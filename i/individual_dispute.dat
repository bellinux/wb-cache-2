40|$|The {{limitations}} on a punitive damage award {{depend on the}} conception of punitive damages. Is it a private law remedy, limited to resolving the dispute between the parties? Or is it a public law remedy, capable of addressing public harm and achieving public good? The Supreme Court has not wavered from public law ideas of punitive damages - that the damages serve the state’s interests and are similar to criminal punishments. At the same time, the Court {{has focused on the}} actual injury to the plaintiff in its holdings and prohibited punitive damages from punishing harm to nonparties, indicating that punitive damages serve only the private law purpose of resolving the parties’ dispute. This Article examines tort law’s influence on the constitutional limitations of punitive damage awards, an influence that mandates a private law conception of punitive damages. Tort law lacks the ability to punish unless a finding of liability for an underlying injury exists. Punitive damages should thus be based only on the underlying injury for which the defendant is liable. Consistent with tort law’s influence, punitive damages that punish the public harm that the defendant’s conduct created would be unconstitutional, meaning that punitive damages will be minimal if supported only by an award of nominal damages. Also consistent with tort law’s influence, punitive damage awards must be personalized to the <b>individual</b> <b>dispute</b> despite the Court’s recent concerns about unpredictability...|$|E

Second, we summarise complaints data to see what issues TV and radio audiences complain about and where broadcasters fall short of the standards set for them or which they set for themselves. Third, we examine the terms and conditions set for the video download services now offered by all free-to-air television broadcasters, a relatively new kind of service that blends broadcasting and telecommunications.

40|$|The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) plays a {{critical}} role as the alternative dispute resolution scheme for the telecommunications industry. Since its establishment in 1993, the TIO has performed well at resolving individual complaints between consumers and carriage service providers (CSPs). In recent years it has dealt with huge increases {{in the number of}} complaints. In 2010, the TIO received 167 955 complaints, double the 85 188 complaints it received in 2007. This increase resulted in the Ombudsman’s office growing from 100 employees in 2007 to 230 employees in 2010. It is a credit to the TIO board, council and Ombudsman that despite the pressure of this increased workload the TIO has continued to provide a high-quality dispute resolution service. Since the inception of the TIO in 1993, the telecommunications environment has changed substantially. The TIO began operation in a narrow market of three licenced carriers (Telecom Australia, Optus and Vodafone) and a small number of service providers. The service offered by these providers was primarily fixed-line telephony. Today, the telecommunications industry is a large and competitive market with hundreds of providers offering a variety of different telecommunications products and services. Ombudsman schemes have also evolved substantially over the past 20 years. Ombudsman schemes not only provide <b>individual</b> <b>dispute</b> resolution, they also play {{a critical}} role in the monitoring, identification, analysis and communication of problems that are systemic across the industry. However, despite this the TIO framework has remained largely as it was in 1993. The review was undertaken to ensure the TIO continues to be a best-practice ombudsman scheme.

Japan’s territorial disputes, while prone to controversy and flare-ups, have not witnessed any militarised conflict in their recent histories. By shifting the focus from conflict to sovereignty the dissertation allows an examination of what does take place in Japan’s territorial disputes, and provides an understanding of Japan’s approach to its territorial disputes and how this approach varies across time as well as across each <b>individual</b> <b>dispute.</b> The dissertation takes a constructivist approach to the relationship between international politics and international law, constructing a conceptual framework – the sovereignty game – which is adapted to the study of Japan’s territorial disputes. Simply put, in contemporary international relations, states rarely use force to conquer territory. Rather, they play the sovereignty game, in which they attempt to gain or maintain sovereignty over a disputed territory by (a) successfully undertaking exercises of sovereignty over the disputed territory, and preventing other states in the dispute from engaging in exercises of sovereignty over that territory; and (b) by gaining international recognition of sovereignty over the disputed territory. States seek to exercise sovereignty by utilising their resources (capital), {{and the extent to which}} they employ this capital is determined by the relative value of the territory in question. The dissertation applies this sovereignty game approach to each of Japan’s three territorial disputes, the Liancourt Rocks dispute with South Korea, the Pinnacle Islands dispute with China and Taiwan, and the Northern Territories dispute with Russia, examining the dynamics of the sovereignty game in the post-Cold War period. The dissertation finds that, due to the different relative values of the territorial disputes, Japan’s approach varies: it has taken a formal, legalistic approach to the Liancourt Rocks and Pinnacle Islands dispute – at least until the mid- 2000 s – using sovereignty only to preserve its existing position in the disputes. However, its approach to sovereignty in the Northern Territories dispute has been characterised by a sense of moral justice, thus it seeks to prevent all Russian exercises of sovereignty while constantly attempting to push its own. ...|$|E

Dans la présente étude il tente de dégager, à même les systèmes européens de relations industrielles, les caractéristiques les plus significatives ainsi que les institutions de droit et de fait informant la négociation et la {{convention collective}} de travail et concourant à la paix industrielle dans les pays étudiés. This article {{is not intended}} to give a descriptive and detailed account of the institutions and legal structures which, in each phase of labour relations, organize relations between the partners in every country under review. Such an analysis would be too long and too exhaustive in view of the scope of this study and, in any event, would only repeat what has already been done in many excellent publications readily accessible to and well known by those who may be interested in such matters. Instead, an attempt will be made to determine from the European industrial relations systems the most significant characteristics, the most interesting formula for Canadians, the institutions in law and fact which can best be compared to our own institutions in conformity with the purpose of our study. We will attempt to do this in respect of each of the main phases of labour-management relations as they operate in the countries under review. A — LABOUR COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS AND AGREEMENTSIt should be noted at the outset that, in matters of negotiations and labour relations more generally, one distinction should first be made. Whereas some countries like Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark maintained almost intact their pre-war legislative and institutional frameworks, the collective negotiation systems of the countries of the European Economic Community, i. e., France, Belgium, Holland, West Germany and Italy, all underwent transformations, at times drastic since 1945, through new or renewed constitutional provisions or amended or entirely different legislation. Most of the changes were based on an increasing acceptance of the existence of trade unions and on a better defined and more liberal status for collective agreements. During the period of intensive reconstruction, from 1945 to about 1950, the liberty of the parties in determining salaries was obviously kept at a minimum by restrictive regulation. 1 But, with the exception of this brief severely « controlled » period, the trend was generally in the direction mentioned above. Even in the Netherlands where controls are still relatively severe, because of the prevailing situation, some relaxation has become apparent in recent years. One indication is the substitution of the Labour Foundation to the State Mediators College for the approval of collective agreements. Also, and this may appear to be paradoxical at first sight but quite logical after proper examination, it was precisely during this period, from 1945 to 1950, that new formulas now accepted were tried out and underwent their first practical tests. The Status of Collective AgreementsIt must be pointed out that, for our purposes, collective agreements generally in European countries, in Great Britain and Scandinavia {{as well as in the}} Common Market countries, consisted primarily of extensive regulations covering individual labour contracts. It is not comparable to our local agreements which cover and control every detail of industrial life at the plant level and in day to day working relations. It is relatively free of substantial regulations governing working conditions in the various industrial units to which it applies. It is necessary to make these comments in view of the situation on this side of the Atlantic. It must be pointed out, however, that for the last fifteen years or so in Common Market countries and even longer in the Scandinavian countries, considerable progress was made in improving agreements either at the level where they are negotiated or through the development of enterprise agreements themselves, which are now much more prevalent than they were before the war. Agreements consist primarily of « minimum compulsory standards of individual contracts between each employer and his employees ». 2 This situation derives from the conditions in connection with industrial relations systems in Europe, but it also demonstrates the still powerful influence of common law in Europe generally on labour relations, in contrast with what one might surmise at first sight. If it is true that « sociologically » several countries such as Great Britain and Scandinavian countries as well as Belgium have,in practice, gone far beyond pure legal formalism, the fact remains that legally individual contracts regulate in the final analysis day to day working relations between individual employees and management. This is apparent, for example, in the settlement of disputes concerning general working conditions. In any event, collective agreements have no legal status of their own in several countries, notably in England, Belgium 3 and Italy. Evidently, however, they are often in practice more effective there than in countries where they have a real legal status. The fact remains however that, since they are designed as minimum standards often without substance and leaving a great deal to the sole discretion of management in determining most actual working conditions, they do not contribute significantly to sound co-operation in industrial relations at the local level. 4 The Parties to AgreementsFrance and the Netherlands require that a union be a legal entity to sign collective agreements as defined in labour legislation. Other countries, such as Sweden and Germany, recognize the obligation for parties to an agreement to « keep the peace » while the agreement is in force and penalties are provided for in this matter. This point is interesting for industrial peace. In England, where trade unions are not legal entities, and are protected by statute from legal actions in their endeavours in pursuing their economic interests in labour relations, certain parties recently expressed the opinion that, in order to check non-official strikes which have been so numerous in recent years, trade unions should be given legal entities, respect agreements as contracts and therefore be legally responsible for the actions of their members, particularly the shop stewards, as is the case in Sweden and West Germany, for example, in the event of strikes or any other action taken in contravention of duly negotiated agreements. 5 But what is more important for the purposes of a study such as this one, in connection with parties to an agreement, is that, in Western Europe and in every country under review, collective agreements still come under the jurisdiction in the vast majority of cases not of labour units at the local level or individual employers, but of vast employer and labour groups, generally at the level of a complete industrial branch and, in some contries such as Sweden and Denmark, at the level of the economy as a whole. 6 On the whole, the statutes reviewed are very clearly directed in this manner. So much so in fact, that one could assume that legislators intended in those countries to center labour relations negotiations on the greater units (federations and confederations grouping wage-earners or management) so that the resulting agreements would be more readily integrated in general economic and social policies in these countries, and that agreements entered into would have a « community » feature and negotiating parties would consequently be more conscious of the implications of their decisions on working conditions for the economy as a whole in such countries. All legislative texts to define collective agreements as capable of being entered into by individual employers and trade unions without giving further details, but a wide range of provisions actually favour clearly negotiations beyond the local level, notably the industry branch level. The Extension of Agreements. There is the possibility provided for almost universally of the local extension of labour collective agreements in Europe, under certain conditions. It is in a sense the logical consequence of the negotiations system in these countries, which consider much more readily that the determination of working conditions results from vast regulations, undoubtedly negotiated for the greater part, but always designed to be used as standards for large sectors of the economy and therefore capable of being more readily integrated in the framework of general salary and working conditions policies, and one can only agree that this is somewhat opposed to the spirit of our North American industrial relations systems. With the extension procedure, public powers in almost all of the countries under review were able to obtain full participation of labour and management associations in the determination of working conditions, even in those sectors where they are not fully represented, and laying down at the same time certain conditions so that standards set by private parties are truly representative of the areas to which they apply and do not disrupt industrial sectors. The precautions taken in such countries before granting extension should be remembered if ever we attempted to follow this course more extensively. Briefly, what are these precautions ? In France, under the provisions of the statutes of February, 1950, only those associations representing management and labour can enter into an agreement capable of extension. Management representation must be an « association » under the terms of the act, i. e., have legal status. The same applies obviously to labour. De facto groups can enter into « ordinary » agreements but not an agreement capable of extension. This is all the more so for an individual employer who could never negotiate towards extension as can be done under the terms of the Collective Agreements Act of Québec. Furthermore, groups on both sides must be « representative » of the trade group or sector covered, be it local, regional or national. Nothing in the texts defines « representative », but the courts and administrative practice have provided for this. The detailed enumeration of the criteria would fall outside the scope of this study Furthermore, they must include a certain number of clauses whose provisions themselves obviously remain free. Generally, extension covers the whole of a pre-determined industry branch and even, in some cases, to the whole of the branches at the national level, for example, the national intertrade agreement on supplementary pensions. In Germany, at least 50 % of the workers involved must already be covered by an agreement before it can be extended, and there are certain other conditions. In Italy, nothing in the texts positively provides for legal extension but in practice, under the constitution and the powers given in the 1959 statutes, the government has practised extension in certain cases, at least in matters relating to salaries. In Belgium, an agreement can only be imposed on non-contracting parties if it has been entered into within a joint parity commission where the parties involved must also be « representative ». In Holland, extension is not considered an exceptional procedure, because it applies automatically when an agreement is approved by the Labour Foundation, a consultative parity organization at the national level with which we will deal further on. As for Great Britain, we are familiar with their wages councils system, which can extend salary standards in trade union sectors to the whole of a branch or region. In Sweden and Denmark, this extension procedure is non-existent as such in law, but trade unionism is so powerful and the authority of negotiation parties is so effective that, in practice, the few employees not covered by agreements obtain the same advantages as the others. Furthermore, in Sweden, the provisions of the 1928 Labour Collective Agreements Act permit terms of an agreement to be in a manner of speaking « imposed » through pressures during negotiations disputes between an employer who is not covered and his employees, by those who are already covered (strike or sympathy action). It must be noted that extension procedure is not a new development achieved during recent years. The fact remains that it is always practised and that it is still in most European labour laws, and this is why we take note of it here without evaluating its chances of disappearance or survival during the next few years. Negociation Through Joint OrganizationsOne of the most common formulas used in Western Europe for collective negotiations, and for that matter for several other labour relations aspects (for example dispute settlements) is what is called « paritism ». Paritism consists of any formula or any institution within which the social partners meet, discuss, negotiate and determine « jointly », generally without the help of a third party and without resorting to open dispute, the relations systems between them in connection with labour relations, and every other aspect of their relations on problems of any type. Paritism implies necessarily a certain equilibrium of forces, a mutual recognition of the diverging points of view of the partners, a determination to achieve compromise where possible, a certain consensus on the long-term objectives to be reached by each party, and, finally, a certain maturity which will incite the partners to make all possible decisions on their own, while limiting as far as possible resorting to arbitration and compulsory decisions by the public powers. In our opinion this constitutes the most spectacular post-war development in certain continental European countries in relation to institutionalized co-operation in labour relations. What differentiates the situation in negotiations co-operation as between Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries on the one hand and the countries of the European Economic Community on the other hand, is that in the former countries government abstention is almost total (joint decision procedures were developed in those countries as safeguards against state intervention) while in those countries of the latter group where they are most prevalent, measures were initiated following increased intervention of the public powers in the field of labour-management relations, after the Second World War. In such countries, paritism is not the same as in the former countries and is not the result of agreements between parties (free « contractual » system), but rather of co-operation with the public powers who included these matters in a « policy », by instituting them and by maintaining them with the support of the interested parties (accepted « statutory » system). B — DISPUTE SETTLEMENTS AND INDUSTRIAL PEACEThe dispute settlement system in labour relations vary considerably from one country to another. It is therefore extremely difficult to sift out common features which could, by themselves, give a good idea of the overall situation in this connection. As for individual labour dispute settlements certain West European countries, at least from a legal point of view, have no other procedure than common law. In Holland, for example, there are labour magistrates, but they are operating within ordinary jurisdictions. In France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, as well as in Belgium labour tribunals deal with these disputes. In Germany and Sweden for example, the decisions of these tribunals are final and without appeal. On the other hand, in France, beyond a certain amount, appeal can be made to appeal courts and to the social chamber of the Appeal Court. In England, nothing in the Act imposes recourse to labour tribunals which do not exist. An <b>individual</b> <b>dispute</b> is legally based on the individual labour contract (as is the case for the other countries mentioned above) and there can be, in theory, recourse to ordinary tribunals. In practice, a whole series of conciliation stages is provided between the parties from the local level up to the national level and, eventually, the dispute can be brought before the Industrial Court, whose decision in fact is not mandatory, unless the parties agree to it beforehand. As to the distinction between legal disputes and disputes in interests, i. e., the interpretation or the violation of an existing agreement, during negotiations or the renewal of an agreement, certain countries make a clear distinction between these two types of disputes while other countries make no distinction at all. In the former group, mention could be made of West Germany, Sweden and Denmark where any dispute arising on the interpretation of a collective agreement must be brought before a labour tribunal, whether it is collective or individual ; this springs from a principle recognized in these countries that the signatories must respect industrial peace when they are bound by an agreement. The second group includes Belgium, Italy, England and France, where nothing in the statutes, as far as we know, prevents the eventuality of a strike during the term of an agreement in connection with a collective dispute, unless the parties had excluded this action in the agreement. None of the countries have compulsory arbitration procedures for disputes of interests, at least as far as private services are concerned. Employer associations as well as employee associations were always firmly opposed to this, since, according to them, this would be tantamount to state salary controls, as is more or less the case in New Zealand and Australia. Management and labour representatives on the Belgian National Labour Council, during the study recently made by it of a proposed bill to organize collective social relations between workers and employers, were once again opposed to having a clause deal with this because « in connection with arbitration, the execution force results from arbitration compromise », achieved between the parties themselves if they deemed it advisable to submit to it. ConciliationIn most European countries, conciliation procedures are a purely voluntary matter subordinated to the will of the parties. Obviously most of the countries have placed at the disposal of the parties, for a long time in many cases, conciliation and mediation services and the social partners themselves have often developed such procedures either through basic agreements to this end or through collective agreement themselves. The fact remains, however, that it is interesting to note how, in Canada, our labour laws are by far more stringent than those of these countries in Western Europe. In England, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, there is no legal obligation to resort to conciliation procedures. Only France, in spite of the fact that it liberalized significantly its legislation in this field since 1936, still maintains compulsory conciliation (without procedures) in case of industrial disputes. Section 5 of the statute of February 1950 states that all collective labour disputes must be submitted to conciliation. But this conciliation does not rule out strikes and can take place during strikes. Furthermore, no penalty is provided for in case this obligation was not fulfilled, except that a fine can be levied for failing to appear before the Conciliation Commission. If, as we have just seen, legislation is most summary and not compulsory in relation to conciliation or mediation procedures in European countries, this does not mean, and far from it, that conciliation and mediation are non-existent in their labour relations systems. Quite to the contrary, in most countries, conciliation is common practice on a voluntary basis. The social partners preferred to rely on their own initiative in this field rather than see the government intervene. Joint OrganizationsIt must also be said that where joint organizations exist at the level of the branch activity, as is the case for example in England, Belgium and the Netherlands, these organizations are expected not only to negotiate agreements but also to settle disputes arising between the parties and they constitute, because of this, the best channel through which these disputes are taken up and settled. Paritism plays an important role in this sector. Since collective agreements are generally centralized at their level, these joint organizations constitute the logical terminal for the settlement of disputes. In our opinion, this is an important example of institutionalized co-operation allowing the parties themselves, often without the help of third parties, to settle their own problems without resorting in most cases to tests of economic strength or violence. This is also due to the fact that, in Europe, management and labour confederations effectively control their affiliated bodies and members. England's experience in this field is quite revealing. This may be where the control of the central authority over the basic elements at the local level is at its weakest and least efficient both for employers and workers. The presence of the shop steward, who represents the union but holds his authority from the members he represents, often excludes any « real » presence of the confederation in the establishment. In Great Britain, the number of days lost through strikes or lockouts has increased in recent years in comparison to the other countries of Western Europe, in spite of joint industrial councils and long tested procedures for private conciliation at the industry branch level. All this tends to show that everywhere where control from top to bottom is even slightly effective, co-operation is made much easier when it is achieved at a higher level, where the dispute is out of the hands of the interested parties...|$|E

By contrast, rule-based dispute resolution advantages weak states as a means to hold powerful states to the terms of their agreements. Then why did the United States want a rule-based system to settle international disputes in the WTO? To answer this question, we have to understand domestic politics as well as international politics. International constraints, particularly international courts, can influence bargaining at the national level by reallocating bargaining power among members of the government. This work addresses both the puzzle of the United States 2 ̆ 7 preference for rule-based dispute resolution and the broader implications for international law...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{traces the}} way in which the {{management}} of workplace conflict has developed and currently operates in Australia. Industrial relations tribunals (dispute-resolution agencies) have been involved in settling workplace disputes since Federation in 1901 but unntil the 1980 s the tribunals dealt mainly with collective disputes. Subsequently there has been change that has been labelled 'labour-market deregulation,' but in effect amounted to re-regulation. This has brought about an emphasis on settling disputes at the workplace level, while increasing the scope of federal-level jurisdiction. There has been a growth in legislation protecting individual rights; declining union membership; declining collective industrial action; and an increase in <b>individual</b> <b>disputes</b> and other <b>individual</b> expressions of conflict. In addition to explaining these developments, the chapter discusses contemporary trends in the management of workplace conflict and the implications of the individualization of disputes for employers and tribunals...|$|R

40|$|The {{resolution}} of individual workplace conflict has assumed {{an increasingly important}} place in policy debates over contemporary work and employment. This is {{in part due to}} the decline in collective industrial action and the parallel rise in the volume of employment tribunal applications. It reflects a growing concern over the implications of <b>individual</b> employment <b>disputes</b> for those involved but has perhaps been driven by concerns over the cost of litigation and the perceived burden that this places on employers. Against this backdrop, an ESRC-funded seminar series, entitled ‘Reframing Resolution – Managing Conflict and Resolving <b>Individual</b> Employment <b>Disputes</b> in the Contemporary Workplace’, was held between October 2012 and September 2013. This comprised six seminars held at: University of Strathclyde; University of Central Lancashire; Swansea University; Queen’s University Belfast; IRRU, University of Warwick and University of Westminster. The series brought leading academic researchers, practitioners and policy-makers together to explore new empirical and conceptual developments, examine innovative practice and provide insights into key questions of public policy...|$|R

40|$|In this article, I explore ways {{in which}} parents of {{children}} with disabilities can more effectively participate in educational decisionmaking and oversight. I begin by describing the federal special education statute, the IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), as a set of procedural safeguards that are intended to result in meaningful educational benefit. IDEA 2 ̆ 7 s cornerstone is the individualized education program (IEP) for each child. The IEP, negotiated between school authorities and the child 2 ̆ 7 s family, is often an arduous and stressful process. I first note the limitations of using litigation against local school districts as a tool to achieve aggregate or long-term positive outcomes or to resolve <b>individual</b> <b>disputes</b> about services, accommodations, placement and instructional interventions. I then offer practical guidance for individualized advocacy and problem solving that can be useful at the IEP meeting, as well as strategies for parent organizing and mobilizing, and formation of alliances outside the disability community. Finally, I suggest that mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution are more effective means of resolving disputes than due process hearings and litigation...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{regulation}} of <b>individual</b> labour <b>disputes</b> settlement provided for in the law systems of the EU member states. The law systems chosen for comparison are the ones of the Czech Republic, England and France. In the first chapter there is an outline of the obligations resulting from the international and European legislation {{in the area of}} labour disputes settlement. In the following three chapters the Czech, English and French regulations are described subsequently. The individual regulations of the above mentioned countries are analyzed with reference to the institutions endowed with authority to settle <b>individual</b> labour <b>disputes,</b> the participation of lay members in the process of decision making, the proceedings at the courts of first instance as well as the proceedings at the higher courts and last but not least with reference to the means of alternative dispute settlement. In the second chapter dedicated to the Czech regulation the historical context is also mentioned. In the final part of the thesis the results of the analysis are compared and suggestions for the future Czech regulation of labour disputes settlement are offered...|$|R
40|$|Trade {{unions have}} {{experienced}} significant turbulence {{over the past}} three decades. In the UK and Ireland, a key change has been a substantial increase in the individual rights-based employment legislation, raising important questions about its impact on trade unions. Based on a survey and interviews with union officials in Ireland, we examine whether individual employment law acts to undermine or enhance the role of trade unions and whether trade union officials use employment law to achieve change in the workplace and to mobilise workers. We find that while unions believe in the superiority of collective bargaining to pursue individual rights, and consider the law as having an individualising effect, they also recognise its benefits in the current environment. Given the legal restrictions on collective action in <b>individual</b> <b>disputes,</b> union officials believe that employment law can be used to support and protect vulnerable groups of workers. The increasing resort to individual employment rights in Ireland is contrasted with an alternative system in Sweden which has a strong collectivist ethos. We conclude that the dilemmas faced by unions regarding the pursuit of rights are symptoms of Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s weak statutory framework. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{institute}} of arbitration in the Czech Republic. Arbitration is an institute enabling resolution of property disputes before an independent third. The result of an arbitration is publication of binding and enforceable arbitration award. Arbitration {{is a type of}} sui generis proceeding, meaning it differs both from the general court proceedings, as well as from other ADR methods. In this work I was mainly focused on a comprehensive analysis of Act no. 216 / 1994 Coll., on arbitration proceedings and enforcement of arbitral awards, in conjunction with the study of literature and case law. The thesis is divided into 9 chapters, which are further divided into subchapters. The thesis is further bounded by introduction and conclusion. The first chapter deals with the definition of arbitration and furthermore here we can find the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and explanations of theoretical concepts of arbitration. The second chapter focuses on the question of arbitrability of <b>individual</b> <b>disputes.</b> The third chapter examines in detail the process of conclusion of the arbitration agreement, including a description of requirements and division of arbitration agreements according to their nature. The fourth chapter deals with the figure of the arbitrator, the [...] ...|$|R
