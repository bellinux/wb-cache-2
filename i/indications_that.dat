The next day, August 18, American troops found {{the bodies of}} six members of the tank crews showing <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> they had been captured and executed {{in the same manner}} as the men on Hill 303.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> Yount had a {{difference}} of opinion with park superintendent Norris, who wanted him to spend more of his time building roads for the convenience of tourists, while Yount preferred to concentrate on protecting the wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

5|$|Born about 1110, Foliot {{became a}} monk of Cluny, {{probably}} in about 1130. He became Prior of Cluny Abbey, then Prior of Abbeville, a Cluniac house. There are some <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> he studied law at Bologna, {{and he may}} have studied under Robert Pullen, the English theologian, either at Oxford or Exeter. He also acquired a knowledge of rhetoric as well as the liberal arts. The names of two of his early teachers are known, but nothing else of them. Foliot also learned biblical exegesis, probably from Pullen.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} of 65mph (100km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> it {{had already begun to}} weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet Formation was {{originally}} identified at {{the confluence of}} the Touchet River with the Walla Walla River. It is also found at some distance up the Touchet River Valley. The number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up-valley, indicating that the floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance upstream from the various flood dams. Clastic dike intrusions are observed in some locations penetrating the layers vertically; the dikes are infilled with uniform-size fine-grained materials and are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the period between floods was long enough that the deposits dried, forming vertical cracks and allowing wind-blown eroded materials to infill the cracks.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the patient may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the other detainees {{being held at}} {{facilities}} throughout the world (e.g., Bagram Air Base and black sites), might use the Supreme Court's ruling to challenge their treatment. Their reasoning may be that since the Geneva Conventions afforded protection to Hamdan, its other protections might be effective for them as well. Commentators expressed mixed opinions about {{the strength of this}} argument.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862, when Arthur Brittan {{drowned in}} the Avon River while {{learning}} to swim. He got entangled in watercress, which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon, {{and it took a}} half-hour for his body to be recovered. Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and there are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> he went through a period of depression. Soon after the drowning, he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker, and even put Linwood House up for sale, though no property transaction was recorded.|$|E

5|$|While {{the leaders}} of Congress languished in jail, the other parties {{supported}} the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At {{the end of the}} war, the British gave clear <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Æthelhard {{resolved}} {{to go to}} Rome and consult with the pope about the decline in power of the see of Canterbury. The archbishop went to Rome along with Bishop Cyneberht of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope. After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield back down to a bishopric. Besides these papal actions, there are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognised the elevation of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
5|$|John Lavender of {{the local}} Red House Museum noted {{evidence}} of small iron-ore smelting hearths on Warren Hill, while green vitreous slag has been also found on the Head. In his 1911 to 1912 excavations, Bushe-Fox found evidence for working of lead, copper and silver; two ingots discovered at this time revealed that raw materials would have been imported to the area. One ingot was of nearly pure copper, while the other, which weighed 8.6kg, was roughly 50/50 copper-silver alloy with around one percent gold. Argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) copper was refined to produce silver at the Head. There are also <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> gold was worked at Hengistbury. One excavation produced part of a torc, twisted together with a small gold bracelet and another fragment in a manner suggesting it was scrap; a different site produced a streaked touchstone indicating use in gold testing.|$|E
5|$|Numbers have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in Europe, although Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs. Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90,000 pairs. The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel {{is thought to be}} due to pesticides. In Somalia this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, where this species is considered to be unlucky. There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> this shrike is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands, which could help populations in the longer term.|$|E
5000|$|Bioactive {{compounds}} induce phenotypic {{changes in}} target cells, {{changes that are}} observable by microscopy, and which can give insight into the mechanism of action of the compound. [...] With antibacterial agents, for example, the conversion of target cells to spheroplasts can be an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> peptidoglycan synthesis is being targeted, and filamentation of target cells can be an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> FtsZ or DNA is being targeted. [...] In the case of anticancer agents, bleb formation can be an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the compound is disrupting the plasma membrane. [...] A current limitation {{of this approach is}} the time required to manually generate and interpret data, but advances in automated microscopy and image analysis software may help resolve this.|$|R
