A major problem with the health care sector is the lack of medical centres for rural areas, which the <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> counter through the development of and expansion of a system called [...] "tele-primary care". Another issue is the overperscription of drugs, though this has decreased in recent years.

Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, says it's constitutional for the government to outlaw businesses with direct operational ties to terrorist organizations, and media outlets that directly incite and direct violent action, but in this case, the <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> stop the spread of ideas.

There they were made slaves on the great henequen plantations. They were driven, beaten, starved. Each slave had for a day's rations a hunk of sour dough, no more. Yucatan is low, marshy, damp, hot. The Yaquis were bred on the high, dry Sonoran plateau, where the air is like a knife. They dropped dead in the henequen fields, and their places were taken by more. You see, the Mexicans won't kill outright in their war of extermination of the Yaquis. They get use out of them. It's a horrible thing.... Well, this Yaqui you brought in escaped from his captors, got aboard ship, and eventually reached New Orleans. Somehow he traveled way out here.
