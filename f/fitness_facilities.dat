5|$|A project {{board was}} {{established}} in January 2009, {{with the objective of}} ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and <b>fitness</b> <b>facilities</b> and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E

25|$|Presiding {{over most}} of the {{prohibition}} period with all of the required changes in personnel, vessels and rapidly changing technology, Billard managed to keep the service focused on its missions and still look out for the welfare of its men. He was noted for an interest in education of the personnel, their morale and welfare. His insight into changing technology to complete a diverse set of missions was met with improvements in cutter design, increasing use of radios, and gave Coast Guard aviation a practical start. He insisted on absolute integrity for his officers and men so that the service's reputation would not be harmed during the prohibition era. His establishment of the Coast Guard Academy in New London helped put officer education on a solid footing. As Commandant, Billard moved the Academy from Fort Trumbull to its current location in 1932 and expanded the curriculum to four years. Earlier as Superintendent in 1920, Billard had established the school's motto, Scientiae Cedit Mare (The Sea Yields to Knowledge).
