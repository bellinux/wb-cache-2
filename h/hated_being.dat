5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though {{he was not the}} target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
5|$|During Victoria's first {{pregnancy}} in 1840, in {{the first}} few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason, found not guilty on the grounds of insanity, and committed to an insane asylum indefinitely. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).|$|E
5|$|In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, {{or perhaps}} was poisoned. He soon {{recovered}} from his illness, but many {{believed that the}} illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness {{reminded him of his}} mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother Antonia Minor. She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, were exiled. He <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder.|$|E

25|$|Popper {{was raised}} in Stamford, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. He {{attended}} Davenport Ridge School, Stamford Catholic High School (now Trinity Catholic High School) and Princeton High School from which he graduated in 1986. He took lessons on the piano, the cello, and the guitar, but none of those instruments appealed {{to him and he}} <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> forced to practice.|$|E
25|$|Although in-fighters {{struggle}} against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance {{between themselves and}} the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses {{a lot of his}} combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer Muhammad Ali in their three fights. Joe Louis, after retirement, admitted that he <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ Rocky Marciano would have caused him style problems even in his prime.|$|E
500|$|Dee's {{character}} Rick Spleen (born Richard Shaw) is {{a stand-up}} comedian living in London who struggles to get decent gigs and makes ends meet by hosting corporate {{events such as}} the Frozen Goods Awards Evening. Dee and Sinclair based the character on the [...] "comedians who <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> comedians" [...] who performed alongside Dee in his early years of stand-up. Rick is a habitual and incompetent liar who often attempts practical tasks himself in an attempt to avoid paying professionals.|$|E

500|$|Stanford {{was never}} an easy-going teacher. He insisted on {{one-to-one}} tutorials, and worked his pupils hard. One of them, Herbert Howells, recalled, [...] "Corner any Stanford pupil you like, {{and ask him to}} confess the sins he most <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> discovered in by his master. He will tell you 'slovenliness' and 'vulgarity.' When these went into the teacher's room they came out, badly damaged. Against compromise with dubious material or workmanship Stanford stubbornly set his face." [...] Another pupil, Edgar Bainton, recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to Phil Symes of Disc and Music Echo in May 1971, Ronnie Spector {{admitted}} that she had <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> away from the music industry. The situation had been forced on her by her husband's semi-retirement in 1966, following the failure in America of Ike & Tina Turner's single [...] "River Deep – Mountain High", a production that Phil Spector had considered his masterpiece. Ronnie Spector told Symes: [...] "For four years Phil and I completely detached ourselves from everyone {{in the business and}} settled down in California. I was so bored and missed the stage so much I nearly had a nervous breakdown. If I hadn't had a kid I don't know what I would have done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{image was}} shot by {{photographer}} Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot ("we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it," [...] said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title {{on one of the}} road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.|$|E

500|$|In his Life of Samuel Johnson Boswell {{referred}} to Johnson as 'Dr. Johnson' {{so often that}} he would always be known as such, even though he <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> called such. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers. Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life, {{like many of his}} fellow Englishmen Johnson had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson [...] "exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism". Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said: [...] "We all know how well he loved to abuse the Scotch, & indeed to be abused by them in return." ...|$|E
500|$|Derek Taylor (Apple's press officer) {{said that}} Aspinall <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> {{stuck in the}} Apple office (at 3 Savile Row) all through the {{recording}} of The White Album and Let It Be album. Life in the Apple office, however, was improved by having a chef and various assistants at hand: [...] "The liquor bill was £600 per month and the food bill was close to that." [...] This was mostly due to Aspinall's and Peter Brown's four-course lunches with expensive wines {{in the dining room}} at Apple. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager Aspinall was dismissed, but reinstated after complaints from the group, and because Klein realised that Aspinall was no threat to his control of the company. Klein lost a High Court action in 1971 (started by McCartney) but lawsuits between Klein and Apple kept Aspinall busy until 1977.|$|E
500|$|The 25 drivers {{determined}} {{their starting}} positions by lot, {{a feature that}} is unique to the event. Martin Truex, Jr. drew the pole position, with Kyle Busch, Keselowski, McMurray and Ragan rounding out the first five positions. Kurt Busch drew sixth place and Biffle drew seventh, ahead of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Allmendinger in eighth and ninth. Logano, Edwards, Burton, Newman, and Jeff Gordon drew the next five positions. Tony Stewart, who drew fifteenth, was followed by Hamlin, Clint Bowyer, Jimmie Johnson, Kahne, and Waltrip for the first 20 spots. Ambrose, Kevin Harvick, Kenseth, Paul Menard, and Montoya drew the last five positions in the race. Once the lot was completed, Truex commented, [...] "I haven't been in this race in a few years. I absolutely <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> down here (those years) and watching this race, so it's cool just {{to be in it}} and to get the pole is icing on the cake." ...|$|E

500|$|Kohli {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, {{at the age}} of 18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90. He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, [...] "That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial," [...] while coach Chetan Chauhan lauded Kohli's [...] "attitude and determination." [...] His mother noted that [...] "Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, {{he looked like he was}} chasing his father's dream which was his own too." [...] He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.|$|E
500|$|The Marble Index was {{produced}} during a little-studied period of Nico's life. For The Quietuss Matthew Lindsay, [...] "the liminal drift {{of these years}} only emphasizes the music's amorphous moorings and lack of precedent." [...] Nico approached Danny Fields around the summer of 1968 {{with the desire to}} make an album and prove herself artistically. Resentful of her beauty, she radically changed her image – dyeing her hair red and wearing black clothes in an effort to distance herself from what had made her a popular fashion model. John Cale said, [...] "She hated the idea of being blonde and beautiful, and in some ways she <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> a woman, because she figured all her beauty had brought her was grief... So The Marble Index was an opportunity for her to prove she was a serious artist, not just this kind of blonde bombshell." [...] Nico already had the title for the album in mind from The Prelude, William Wordsworth's magnum opus; in it, he contemplates a statue of Isaac Newton [...] "with his prism and silent face / The marble index of a mind for ever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone." [...] Asked about the significance of this Wordsworth quote, Nico replied: [...] "I sometimes find a little of my own poetry in other poets, yes. Incidentally, or accidentally." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

She took to wearing a hair shirt, and the strain of being forced to live with her former lover and his current {{mistress}} caused her to lose weight and become increasingly haggard. In 1670 she became pregnant for the last time, but miscarried.|$|E
2500|$|Terry and {{her husband}} lived in {{considerable}} style in Moray Lodge in Kensington, London, where he hosted the Moray Minstrels, until Lewis lost all his money. After that, in Gielgud's words, [...] "my grandmother lived very simply and rather resentfully in an ugly little house in West Cromwell Road, {{and she had no}} grand clothes and did not give parties any more. She played bridge and had paying guests. This was a sad ending to her career but she never grumbled or groused.

Hellman had never been to Finland, and Bankhead, as did the rest of the cast, suspected she refused the benefit due to a fanatical devotion to Soviet Russia. As a result of the feud, Hellman, who did not like being questioned and was used to getting her way, and Bankhead, who was always outspoken and <b>hated</b> <b>being</b> crossed when she knew she was morally right, became enemies.|$|E
