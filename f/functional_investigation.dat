Functional analyses do not fully explain the selective pressure causing ERG rearrangement during the development of prostate cancer. To identify transcriptional changes in prostate cancer, including tumors with ERG gene rearrangements, we performed a meta-analysis on published gene expression data followed by validations on mRNA and protein levels as well as first <b>functional</b> <b>investigations.</b> Eight expression studies (n = 561) on human prostate tissues {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. Transcriptional changes between prostate cancer and non-cancerous prostate, as well as ERG rearrangement-positive (ERG+) and ERG rearrangement-negative (ERG 2) prostate cancer, were analyzed. Detailed results can be accessed through an online database.

40|$|In mammals {{there are}} two ubiquitous, catalytically indistinguishable isoforms of inosine monophosphate {{dehydrogenase}} and mutations in the type I isoform, but not type II, cause retina-specific disorders. We have characterised the spatio-temporal expression of these proteins during development of the rat retina and performed <b>functional</b> <b>investigations</b> of the recently described retinal type I variants. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase was present in all immature cells throughout the retina during embryonic and neonatal development. Following eye opening and cell differentiation its distribution was restricted to the photoreceptors and bipolar cells, becoming prominent in Müller cells with aging. Type II was present in early, developing retinae whilst type I was undetectable. An isoform switch occurred around P 10, after which the type I variants, type Iα and type Iγ, were the major forms. <b>Functional</b> <b>investigations</b> indicate type Iγ has greater catalytic activity compared with other variants and isoforms. Finally, all forms of type I show an increased propensity to form intracellular macrostructures compared to type II and these structures appear to be regulated in response to changing intracellular GTP levels. Collectively these data demonstrate that (i) type I does not {{play a role in}} early retinal development, (ii) type Iγ has greater activity and (iii) there are differences between type I and type II isoforms. These observations are consistent with the aetiology of retinitis pigmentosa and raise the possibility that programmed expression of specific inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase proteins may have arisen to meet the requirements of the cellular environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Thumbnail {{image of}} {{graphical}} abstract PC 12 cells {{are used to}} study the signaling mechanisms underlying the neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Previous microarray experiments indicated that serpinb 1 a was the most induced gene after 6 h of treatment with PACAP or NGF. This study confirmed that serpinb 1 a is strongly activated by PACAP and NGF in a time-dependent manner with a maximum induction (~ 50 -fold over control) observed after 6 h of treatment. Co-incubation with PACAP and NGF resulted in a synergistic up-regulation of serpinb 1 a expression (200 -fold over control), suggesting that PACAP and NGF act through complementary mechanisms. Consistently, PACAP-induced serpinb 1 a expression was not blocked by TrkA receptor inhibition. Nevertheless, the stimulation of serpinb 1 a expression by PACAP and NGF was significantly reduced {{in the presence of}} extracellular signal-regulated kinase, calcineurin, protein kinase A, p 38, and PI 3 K inhibitors, indicating that the two trophic factors share some common pathways in the regulation of serpinb 1 a. Finally, <b>functional</b> <b>investigations</b> conducted with siRNA revealed that serpinb 1 a is not involved in the effects of PACAP and NGF on PC 12 cell neuritogenesis, proliferation or body cell volume but mediates their ability to block caspases 3 / 7 activity and to promote PC 12 cell survival. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and nerve growth factor (NGF) induce a strong increase in serpinb 1 a expression in PC 12 cells. <b>Functional</b> <b>investigations</b> revealed that this increase in serpinb 1 a does not affect cell proliferation or differentiation but inhibits caspase 3 activity and promotes cell survival. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
