40|$|PURPOSES: First, {{to develop}} an {{improved}} retinal capillary endothelial cell culture system which exhibits some of the physiologic features of the bloodretinal barrier; second, to use this model to determine how histamine and chemical conditions of diabetes effect expression of the tight junction protein, ZO- 1; and third, to discuss application of the <b>Henle-Koch</b> <b>postulates</b> {{to the problem of}} diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells were exposed to varying serum and growth factor concentrations, as well as astrocyte-conditioned medium, in order to establish a model of the blood-retinal barrier. Cells were also exposed to varying concentrations of histamine, and of insulin and glucose. The expression of ZO- 1 tight junction protein was determined by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Modified concentrations of growth factors reduced endothelial cell proliferation, without reducing viability. Astrocyte conditioned medium increased ZO- 1 protein content. Histamine reduced ZO- 1 protein content. Both high glucose (20 mM) and low insulin (10 (- 12) M) reduced ZO- 1 protein content compared to control conditions (5 mM glucose and 10 (- 9) M insulin). CONCLUSIONS: Control of culture conditions results in a more physiologic in vitro model of the blood-retinal barrier. Soluble factors from astrocytes promote tight junction formation. Both histamine and chemical conditions of diabetes diminish tight junction formation. These factors may mediate blood-retinal barrier breakdown in diabetic retinopathy. <b>Henle-Koch</b> <b>postulates</b> for diabetic retinopathy are presented...|$|E

The changing guidelines developed for viral diseases, for viruses in relation to cancer and to chronic central nervous system infection, and for causative agents in chronic diseases are discussed chronologically. A set of guidelines for both acute infectious and chronic diseases is presented. The need for recognizing the role of the host and the spectrum of host responses, for sound biologic sense in evaluating causal roles of agents in disease, and for flexibility in adapting our guidelines to new knowledge are emphasized. For nearly 100 years the <b>Henle-Koch</b> <b>postulates</b> have been used as a reference point in evaluating the causal relationship of a new infectious agent to a clinical disease with which it is associated. The postulates have also served as a point of departure for many concepts of causation of chronic diseases. This paper will review chronologically the concepts as they were first presented and their evolution and shortcomings in the elements of causation attending viral infections, chronic disease, and cancer. In 1840, Jakob Henle enunciated the concepts of causation in a book which has been translated into English by Dr. George Rosen (1). Henle was then 31 years old and just starting his duties as professor of anatomy in Zurich (Fig. 1). 2 These concepts were further developed by Henle's pupil, Robert Koch (Fig. 2) and presented as part of lectures in 1884 and 1890 (2, 3). The essence of the postulates is included in his 1890 presentation before the International Congress in Berlin and is reproduced below in the original German: Wenn es sich nun aber nachweisen liess: erstens, dass der Parasit in jedem einzelnen Falle der betreffenden Krankheit anzutreffen ist, und zwar unter Verhaltnissen, welche den pathologische...|$|E
40|$|Porites white patch {{syndrome}} (PWPS) is a coral disease recently {{described in}} the Western Indian Ocean. This study aimed to isolate and identify potential pathogens associated with PWPS utilizing both culture and nonculture screening techniques and inoculation trials. A total of 14 bacterial strains (those dominant in disease lesions, absent or rare in healthy tissues and considered potential pathogens in a previous study) were cultured and used to experimentally inoculate otherwise healthy individuals {{in an attempt to}} fulfil <b>Henle–Koch's</b> <b>postulates.</b> However, only one (P 180 R), identified as closely related (99 – 100 % sequence identity based on 1. 4 kb 16 S RNA sequence) to Vibrio tubiashii, elicited signs of disease in tank experiments. Following experimental infection (which resulted in a 90 % infection rate), the pathogen was also successfully re-isolated from the diseased tissues and re-inoculated in healthy corals colonies, therefore fulfilling the final stages of <b>Henle–Koch's</b> <b>postulates.</b> Finally, we report that PWPS appears to be a temperature-dependent disease, with significantly higher tissue loss (anova: d. f. = 2, F = 39. 77, P < 0. 01) occurring at 30 °C [1. 45 ± 0. 85 cm 2 per day (mean ± SE) ] compared to ambient temperatures of 28 and 26 °C (0. 73 ± 0. 80 cm 2 per day (mean ± SE) and 0. 51 ± 0. 50 cm 2 per day (mean ± SE), respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|In healthy sponges, {{microbes}} {{have been}} shown to account for up to 40 % of tissues. The majority of these are thought to originate from survivors evading digestion and immune responses of the sponge and growing and residing in the microenvironments of the mesophyll. Although a large percentage of these microbes are likely commensals, they may also include potentially pathogenic agents, which under specific conditions, such as temperature stress, may cause disease. Here we report a novel disease (sponge necrosis syndrome) that is severely affecting populations of the sponge Callyspongia (Euplacella) aff biru. Both ITS fungal and 16 S rDNA bacterial diversities were assessed in healthy and diseased individuals, highlighting six potential primary causal agents for this new disease: two bacteria, a Rhodobacteraceae sp. and a cyanobacterium, Hormoscilla spongeliae (formally identified as Oscillatoria spongeliae), and four fungi, a Ascomycota sp., a Pleosporales sp., a Rhabdocline sp., and a Clasosporium sp. Furthermore, histological analysis showed the dominance of fungal hyphae rather than bacteria throughout the disease lesion, which was absent or rare in healthy tissues. Inoculation trails showed that only a combination of one bacterium and one fungus could replicate the disease, fulfilling <b>Henle–Koch’s</b> <b>postulates</b> and showing that this sponge disease is caused by a poly-microbial consortium...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: Bacterial isolates were obtained from corals displaying disease signs at three WS outbreak sites: Nikko Bay in the Republic of Palau, Nelly Bay in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and Majuro Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and used in laboratory-based infection trials to satisfy <b>Henle-Koch’s</b> <b>postulates,</b> Evan’s rules and Hill’s criteria for establishing causality. Infected colonies produced similar signs to those observed in the field following exposure to bacterial concentrations of 1610 6 cells ml 21.

40|$|Why is the {{aetiology}} of sarcoidosis unknown? One {{would think}} that in the nearly 130 yrs since its initial description, someone would have uncovered the root cause of sarcoidosis. This failure speaks to the probable complexity of the problem from both an exposure and genetic perspective, as discussed later. Since its earliest descriptions, sarcoidosis has been suspected to be an infectious disease and yet, to date, while many different microbes have been indicated, none has been convincingly proven to be causative. Interestingly, in the same century, the causes of many idiopathic disorders have been revealed, most of which were due to infectious agents. These include, among others, swamp fever (Plasmodium falciparum), anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), consumption (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), gastric ulcers (Helico-bacter pylori) and Whipple’s disease (Tropheryma whippelii). In most of these other cases, <b>Henle-Koch</b> <b>postulates</b> could be fulfilled (table 1). Several generations of sarcoidosis researchers have learned that fulfilment of these postulates is not an easy matter. This is because not all organisms can be isolated or cultivated, ignorance remains of the true spectrum of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes, some microbes may b...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{purified}} standards of toxins from Pfiesteria species, appropriately conducted fish bioassays are the "gold standard" that must be used to detect toxic strains of Pfiesteria spp. from natural estuarine water or sediment samples and to culture actively toxic Pfiesteria. In this article, we describe the standardized steps of our fish bioassay as an abbreviated term for a procedure that includes two sets of trials with fish, following the <b>Henle-Koch</b> <b>postulates</b> modified for toxic rather than infectious agents. This procedure was developed in 1991, and has been refined over more than 12 {{years of experience in}} research with toxic Pfiesteria. The steps involve isolating toxic strains of Pfiesteria (or other potentially, as-yet-undetected, toxic Pfiesteria or Pfiesteria-like species) from fish-killing bioassays with natural samples; growing the clones with axenic algal prey; and retesting the isolates in a second set of fish bioassays. The specific environmental conditions used (e. g., temperature, salinity, light, other factors) must remain flexible, given the wide range of conditions from which natural estuarine samples are derived. We present a comparison of information provided for fish culture conditions, reported in international science journals in which such research is routinely published, and we provide information from more than 2, 000 fish bioassays with toxic Pfiesteria, along with recommendations for suitable ranges and frequency of monitoring of environmental variables. We present data demonstrating that algal assays, unlike these standardized fish bioassays, should not be used to detect toxic strains of Pfiesteria spp. Finally, we recommend how quality control/assurance can be most rapidly advanced among laboratories engaged in studies that require research-quality isolates of toxic Pfiesteria spp...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{identification}} of coral diseases in the Caribbean in the early 1970 's, the number of reported coral disease syndromes, their prevalence and spread worldwide have rapidly increased. Despite increasing reports of coral epizootics resulting in mortalities, {{little is known about}} the direct causes of coral diseases. Currently, the study of coral pathogens, their natural reservoirs and possible vectors are still in their early infancy with only five causative agents identified and confirmed by fulfilling <b>Henle-Koch's</b> <b>postulates.</b> Uncertainty regarding the causes of disease has sparked a sharp debate about, whether coral diseases occurring in complex aquatic environments are only caused by primary pathogens, or by secondary pathogens in combinations with other factors, such as ocean warming or anthropogenic stress. The aim of this study is to identify coral pathogens that are directly associated with the following Indo-Pacific scleractinian coral diseases: black band disease (BBD), red bands and white syndromes (WS's), and to clarify their role in disease onset. Filamentous cyanobacteria forming red and black bands on three scleractinian corals from Palau were isolated, cultured and identified based on 16 S rRNA gene identity as belonging to a single ribotype. Following trials of a range of specialized media and culture conditions, two media, Grund and ASN III, were identified as the best for successful isolation and culturing. Cultured cyanobacteria were examined under a light microscope to establish purity, color and morphological appearance.

40|$|Coral {{diseases}} {{have been}} increasingly reported {{over the past}} few decades and are a major contributor to coral decline worldwide. The Caribbean, in particular, has been noted as a hotspot for coral disease, and the aptly named white syndromes have caused the decline of the dominant reef building corals throughout their range. White band disease (WBD) has been implicated in the dramatic loss of Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata since the 1970 s, resulting in both species being listed as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red list. The causal agent of WBD remains unknown, although recent studies based on challenge experiments with filtrate from infected hosts concluded that the disease is probably caused by bacteria. Here, we report an experiment using four different antibiotic treatments, targeting different members of the disease-associated microbial community. Two antibiotics, ampicillin and paromomycin, arrested the disease completely, and by comparing with community shifts brought about by treatments that did not arrest the disease, we have identified the likely candidate causal agent or agents of WBD. Our interpretation of the experimental treatments is that one or a combination of up to three specific bacterial types, detected consistently in diseased corals but not detectable in healthy corals, are likely causal agents of WBD. In addition, a histophagous ciliate (Philaster lucinda) identical to that found consistently in association with white syndrome in Indo-Pacific acroporas was also consistently detected in all WBD samples and absent in healthy coral. Treatment with metronidazole reduced it to below detection limits, but did not arrest the disease. However, the microscopic disease signs changed, suggesting a secondary role in disease causation for this ciliate. In future studies to identify a causal agent of WBD via tests of <b>Henle–Koch's</b> <b>postulates,</b> it will be vital to experimentally control for populations of the other potential pathogens identified in this study...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, the {{emergence}} and spread of infectious diseases have caused substantial declines in the biodiversity and abundance of reef-building corals. Despite their increased global prevalence and virulence, {{little is known about}} coral diseases on Indian Ocean coral reefs. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by identifying the main coral diseases and quantify their prevalence at three localities Reunion, South Africa and Mayotte, determining their spatial distribution and seasonal variation. Principal findings of this study demonstrated the presence of six main coral diseases including black band disease (BBD), white syndromes (WS), pink line syndrome (PLS), growth anomalies (GA), skeleton eroding band (SEB) and Porites white patch syndrome (PWPS). The overall disease prevalence was higher in Reunion (7. 5 ± 2. 2 %; mean ± SE) compared to South Africa (3. 9 ± 0. 8 %; mean ± SE) and Mayotte (2. 7 ± 0. 3 %; mean ± SE). Acropora and Porites were the genera most vulnerable to disease. Spatial variability was detected in both Reunion and South Africa with BBD and WS more prevalent on shallow than deep reefs. There was also evidence of seasonality in two diseases: BBD and WS, their prevalence being higher in summer than winter. Corals exhibiting signs of PWPS revealed extensive tissue fragmentation, generally associated with ovoid basophilic bodies resembling bacterial aggregates within the mesoglea of the body wall. Other organisms, including Cyanobacteria, Nematoda, Ciliata and endophytic algae, were also observed on diseased tissues and were generally associated with the dead epidermis and cell debris. Results of 16 S rRNA sequence analysis revealed a high variability between bacterial communities associated with PWPS-infected and healthy tissues in Porites lutea. Several bacterial ribotypes affiliated to potential putative pathogens notably Shimia marina and Vibrio hepatarius were consistently found among the 16 S rRNA sequences derived from the PWPS lesions, and absent and/or poorly represented in HT. Primary pathogens involved in the PWPS were also investigated in this study using traditional culturing techniques and laboratory infection trials. Of the 14 isolates selected for the inoculation trials, only the bacterial strain P 180 R mostly phylogenetically closely related 8 to Vibrio tubiashii with its closest known sister taxon, V. hepatarius, was shown to cause signs resembling those of PWPS and satisfied the four <b>Henle-Koch’s</b> <b>postulates.</b> P 180 R displayed focalised and progressive tissue paling 12 h after inoculation and visible lesions of PWPS were observed 12 h thereafter. Signs of PWPS appeared on 90 % of the exposed coral fragments (27 of 30) under controlled environmental conditions. Moreover, the virulence of this marine pathogen was tested and seemed to be strongly dependent on seawater temperature, resulting in significantly higher tissue loss at 30 °C than 28 °C and 26 °C. Finally, a multidisciplinary approach involving field surveys, gross lesion monitoring, histopathology and 454 -pyrosequencing was investigated to characterize an atypical form of BBD named PBPS. Histology revealed cyanobacterial penetration of the compromised tissue as well as the presence of basophilic bodies resembling bacterial aggregates in the living tissue, adjacent to the bacterial mat. Bacterial 16 S rRNA sequences yielded a broader diversity of bacterial taxa in PBPS-infected tissues than in healthy tissue, represented by the genus Vibrio (24. 9 %), followed by sulfate-reducers or sulfide-oxidizers such as Desulfovibrio (20 %), Clostridium (12. 9 %) and Arcobacter (9. 9 %). PBPS appears to be a multi-stage disease triggered by cyanobacterial invasion and resulting in secondary infections by environmental bacteria that grow in mucus-like decomposing tissue. Cette étude a pour but d'identifier les principales maladies coralliennes, de quantifier leurs prévalences sur les récifs de la Réunion, d'Afrique du Sud et de Mayotte et de déterminer leurs variations spatiales et saisonnières. Les résultats ont révélé la présence de six grands types de maladies coralliennes. Les prévalences totales moyennes des maladies ont été plus élevées à la Réunion (7. 5 ± 2. 2 %) qu'en Afrique du Sud (3. 9 ± 0. 8 %) et qu'à Mayotte (2. 7 ± 0. 3 %). Les genres coralliens Acropora et Porites ont été les plus vulnérables aux maladies dans les trois régions étudiées. Des variations spatiales et saisonnières ont été détectées pour la maladie de la bande noire (BBD) et les syndromes blancs (WS) à la fois à la Réunion et en Afrique du Sud avec des prévalences plus élevées sur les récifs peu profonds et pendant la saison chaude. Ce travail a également pour but de caractériser deux maladies non décrites à ce jour : le syndrome des patches blancs (PWPS) et le syndrome du patch noir (PBPS) chez Porites. PWPS, observé à fois à la Réunion, en Afrique du Sud et à Mayotte est caractérisé par d'importantes fragmentations tissulaires généralement associées à des corps ovoïdes basophiles ressemblant à des agrégats bactériens. L'analyse bactérienne a révélé une grande variabilité entre les tissus infectés et sains. L'identification des pathogènes responsables de PWPS a également été réalisée en laboratoire. Sur les 14 souches bactériennes sélectionnées et testées, seule la P 180 R, génétiquement proche de Vibrio tubiashii a généré des signes de PWPS. Pour finir, PBPS, une forme atypique de BBD a été observée sur les récifs de la Réunion. Les suivis réalisés ont montré des variations spatiales et saisonnières avec des prévalences plus élevées sur le platier et pendant l'été. L'histologie a mis en évidence la présence de cyanobactéries et de corps basophiles dans les tissus infectés du corail.
