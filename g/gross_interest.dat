40|$|The service {{distribution}} protocol for mobile networks is an interest-based service replication protocol {{based on two}} complementary mechanisms namely replication and hibernation. It allows for the self-organized propagation of service copies (replicas) in an ad hoc network and thus serves to overcome the challenging characteristics of ad hoc networks in particular the frequent occurrence of network partition-ing. It increases the service accessibility over time based on the interest {{of a set of}} clients with regard to that service. In [1, 2] it was shown that the protocol indeed reaches high service availability in all network partitions. In this report, we investigate a global view of the protocol performance with respect to the related important parameters. Since the protocol utilizes periodically the service popularity (in-terest) during its replication/hibernation processes, we introduce and discuss a quantifying criterion for the interest in the given service which is its <b>gross</b> <b>interest</b> at a certain time.

40|$|Why is it optimal not to tax {{capital income}} in the long-run in Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) ? This paper {{demonstrates}} that the answer follows standard intuitions from the commodity tax literature. In the steady state, Engel curves for consumption are linear in labour earnings, irrespective of the utility function adopted. Thus, in the steady state, consumption demands in each period become equally complementary to leisure over time. This renders taxes on capital income redundant, since they cannot alleviate distortions from taxing labour income. The argument that taxes on capital income should be zero because distortions explode in finite time is relevant only if restrictions are imposed on the utility function. We show how these restrictions imply that consumption demands in each period are equally complementary to leisure over time. We also demonstrate that the optimal tax on capital income is zero irrespective of whether the <b>gross</b> <b>interest</b> rate is endogenous. This contradicts arguments that the entire burden of capital income taxes is shifted to labour through general equilibrium effects on the interest rate...|$|E

The world presented a picture of the glorious handywork of him who seems to invite the gratitude and adoration of his creatures. To the mind yet untainted, there is exquisite loveliness and even godlike repose in such a scene. The universal stillness permits the softest natural sounds to be heard; and the buzz of the bee, or the wing of the humming-bird, reaches the ear like the loud notes of a general anthem. This temporary repose is full of meaning. It should teach how much of the beauty of this world's enjoyments, how much of its peace, and even how much of the comeliness of nature itself, is dependent on the spirit by which we are actuated. When man reposes, all around him seems anxious to contribute to his rest; and when he abandons the contentions of <b>grosser</b> <b>interests,</b> to elevate his spirit, all living things appear to unite in worship. Although this apparent sympathy of nature may be less true than imaginative, its lesson is not destroyed, since it sufficiently shows that what man chooses to consider good in this world is good, and that most of its strife and deformities proceed from his own perversity.|$|R
