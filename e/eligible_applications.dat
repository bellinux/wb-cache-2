This article reports the process of establishing and validating evaluation criteria for projects submitted for funding within this programme, to ensure that projects selected for funding conform with quality standards. Methods: An evaluation checklist was developed, drawing on project management and health promotion literature, to Score 3 aspects of project quality: policy and contextual relevance (five criteria, scores 0 – 8), technical quality (five criteria, scored 0 – 6) and management quality (six criteria, scored 0 – 5). Teams of three people made consensus ratings with the checklist on each of 215 <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> submitted in response to Calls for Proposals in 2007 and 151 submitted in 2008. Construct validity, internal consistency and predictive validity were assessed on the grouped consensus ratings using psychometric test statistical methods. Results: Principal component analyses on both the 2007 and 2008 data gave a three component solution, which largely coincides with the dimensions of contextual relevance, technical quality and management quality. Reliability analyses show high Cronbach apha’s (> 0. 86) {{for each of the}} three scales. Discriminant analyses indicate that all three of the dimensions contributed to the decision to fund a project.

40|$|Background: Evaluating {{applications}} for multi-national, multi-disciplinary, dual-purpose research consortia is highly complex. There {{has been little}} research on the peer review process for evaluating grant applications and almost none on how {{applications for}} multi-national consortia are reviewed. Overseas development investments are increasingly being channelled into international science consortia to generate high-quality research while simultaneously strengthening multi-disciplinary research capacity. We need {{a better understanding of}} how such decisions are made and their effectiveness. Methods: An award-making institution planned to fund 10 UK-Africa research consortia. Over two annual rounds, 34 out of 78 <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> were shortlisted and reviewed by at least five external reviewers before final selections were made by a face-to-face panel. We used an innovative approach involving structured, overt observations of award-making panel meetings and semi-structured interviews with panel members to explore how assessment criteria concerning research quality and capacity strengthening were applied during the peer review process. Data were coded and analysed using pre-designed matrices which incorporated categories relating to the assessment criteria. Results: In general the process was rigorous and well-managed. However, lack of clarity about differential weighting of criteria and variations in the panel’s understanding of research capacity strengthening resulted in some inconsistencies in use of the assessment criteria. Using the same panel for both rounds had advantages, in that during the second round consensus was achieved more quickly and the panel had increased focus on development aspects. Conclusion: Grant assessment panels for such complex research applications need to have topic- and context-specific expertise. They must also understand research capacity issues and have a flexible but equitable and transparent approach. This study has developed and tested an approach for evaluating the operation of such panels and has generated lessons that can promote coherence and transparency among grant-makers and ultimately make the award-making process more effective...|$|E
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the design and implementation of the Liveable Cities Program, including the assessment and approval of applications. Overall conclusionThrough the LCP, a total of $ 20  million in grant funding was awarded to 26 projects located in 14 major cities across all states and territories. These included seven infrastructure projects, primarily directed at improving pedestrian and cycling access but which also included the supply of low carbon energy, two residential developments and a rapid bus transit system. The other 19 projects approved were for planning, feasibility assessment and/or design activities that will inform future investment in infrastructure. The distribution of funding in geographic terms {{and the nature of the}} demonstration projects provided the desired mix foreshadowed in the program guidelines so as to contribute to achieving the program objective of improving the planning and design of major cities. By the end of April 2013, funding agreements had been signed for the majority of the approved projects, with most of these projects contracted to be delivered by the program’s amended completion date of 30 June 2014. Infrastructure’s management of the design and implementation of LCP was effective in most respects. Of note was that improvements were evident in the merit-assessment approach adopted by the department compared with earlier grant programs audited by ANAO. In particular: all <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> were assessed against published assessment criteria; andthe scoring approach adopted enabled the comparison of the relative merits of applications against each criterion and in aggregate. Infrastructure also adopted an improved approach to briefing the Minister on the outcome of the assessment process. The LCP briefing included a clear funding recommendation to the Minister based on the scores awarded against the assessment criteria and in consideration of the program objectives. In addition, a record was kept of the eight instances where the Minister’s decision diverged from the recommendation of the department—three projects not recommended by Infrastructure were approved by the Minister, and five projects recommended by the department were not approved for funding. This approach provides transparency and accountability for the advice given by Infrastructure, and the funding decisions that were subsequently taken. However, there remain opportunities for further improvements to Infrastructure’s grants administration practices. Firstly, there were shortcomings with the assessment of applications in relation to the department’s eligibility checking and aspects of its conduct of the merit-assessment process. Secondly, it needs to be recognised that applications that are assessed as not satisfactorily meeting the published merit assessment criteria are most unlikely to represent value for money in the context of the program objectives. In addition, an evaluation strategy was not developed at the outset of the program and remained outstanding as at May 2013, notwithstanding that most funding agreements had been signed by then and the program was nearly two years into its three year duration. Such a situation will have an adverse effect on the quality of advice to Ministers on any proposal to provide further funding to the program or to a similar program, as well as in assessing the contribution the program has made to the objectives of the National Urban Policy. As indicated, this audit of the LCP has identified improvements in key aspects of Infrastructure’s grants administration practices, which should be embedded in all grant programs within the department. The ANAO has made three recommendations to address the further opportunities for improvement mentioned above relating to: enhancing the assessment of <b>eligible</b> <b>applications,</b> by clearly and consistently establishing benchmarks for scoring against assessment criteria and a minimum score an application is required to satisfy for each criterion in order for an application to be considered for possible recommendation;recording the value for money offered by each proposal under consideration, having regard to the published program objectives and assessment criteria; anddeveloping an evaluation strategy during the design of a program...|$|E
40|$|Objective {{to search}} for and {{substantiate}} the single criterion of economic efficiency of state purchases in Russia. 	Methods econometric modelling benchmarking. 	Results the article identifies the need to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} state purchases system in Russia under the conditions of its reforming. The studies are analyzed which are devoted to the approaches to estimating the state purchases efficiency and the problems of ensuring the transparency of purchasing procedures. Special attention is paid to the analysis of studying the benchmarking of state purchases which helped to identify the key areas of benchmarking focusing on certain performance indicators. To implement the research objective the purchases effectiveness was analyzed from the viewpoint of the savings achieved. For this we studied the evaluation of savings in purchases as reflected in various sources of information including the data of the state statistics authorities audit and monitoring of purchases. As a result of the data systematization and generalization we identified a functional relationship between savings in purchases and the average number of participants in the purchasing process. A similar conclusion was formulated according to the analysis of indicators of the national rating of purchases transparency. There was also built a functional dependency of the discount on increasing the number of purchasing participants up to five for different ways of determining the provider. A slowdown of the discount to the initial price was revealed as the number of <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> grows. 	Based on the regional rating of the public purchases ldquoPurchases 360 rdquo a factor analysis of differences of the Russian constituent entities was carried out in terms of savings. The analysis confirmed the hypothesis about the existence of a relationship between savings and the level of competition in purchases. The study also identified other factors that determine the level of savings under competitive procedures the indicators of planning quality and of institutional conflict violations of antimonopoly legislation. 	Scientific novelty on the basis of several alternative data sources the study formulated and confirmed the hypothesis about the dependency of the average savings from the competitive purchasing procedures in a region on the average number of admitted applications in one procedure.

40|$|Background 1. The National Stronger Regions Fund was a {{competitive}} grants program {{administered by the}} Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development (DIRD). The program’s objective was to ‘fund investment ready projects which support economic growth and sustainability of regions across Australia, particularly disadvantaged regions, by supporting investment in priority infrastructure’. 2. Local government authorities and not-for-profit organisations were eligible to apply for grants from $ 20 000 through to $ 10 million. Grants were available for capital projects that involved {{the construction of new}} infrastructure, or the upgrade or extension of existing infrastructure, and that delivered an economic benefit to the region. Projects could be located in any Australian region or city. 3. The program’s establishment was a 2013 federal election commitment of the then Opposition, with $ 1 billion to be made available over five years from 2015 – 16. Mid-way through the third funding round, the program’s early abolition was announced as a 2016 federal election commitment of the Government. In total, 229 applications were approved for $ 632. 2 million via the three funding rounds. Audit objective and criteria 4. The objective of the audit was to assess the effectiveness of the design and implementation of round two of the National Stronger Regions Fund. To form a conclusion against the objective, the ANAO adopted the following high-level criteria: • Did the application and assessment process attract, identify and rank the best applications in terms of the published criteria and value for money? • Were the decision makers appropriately advised and given clear funding recommendations? • Were the decisions taken transparent and consistent with the program guidelines? • Was the design and implementation of the program outcomes oriented, and are arrangements in place for program outcomes to be evaluated (including the likely economic benefits to regions) ? Conclusion 5. Program design and implementation was largely effective. In addition, earlier audit recommendations aimed at improving the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development’s assessment of applications, funding advice to decision-makers and evaluation of program outcomes have been implemented. 6. The application process for round two funding was accessible and attracted sufficient applications of merit. The eligibility requirements were appropriate and consistently applied. Applications assessed as ineligible were excluded from further consideration. 7. The merit criteria were consistent with the program’s objective. The criteria would have been more effective at maximising the achievement of the underlying policy intent if explicit consideration had been given to the magnitude of economic benefits claimed and to the socioeconomic circumstances and unemployment rates of regions. 8. Applications were assessed transparently and consistently against the published merit criteria. The department then used the results to rank applications in terms of its assessment of them against the criteria and the requirement to achieve value with relevant money. 9. The Ministerial Panel was appropriately advised and given a clear funding recommendation. There was a clear line of sight from the results of the department’s assessment of <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> against the merit criteria, the department’s selection of 104 applications for funding recommendation, the Ministerial Panel’s reassessment of 28 applications, through to the approval of 111 applications in round two. Internal documentation recording funding decisions, and their reasons, has been further improved by the department but its responses to Parliamentary scrutiny when questioned about its input to those funding decisions were not transparent (this issue has arisen previously). 10. Arrangements are in place for program outcomes to be evaluated, including the likely economic benefits to regions. Each approved project had been assessed as likely to deliver an economic benefit.  ...|$|E
40|$|Before the {{discovery}} and exploitation {{of oil in}} the international markets during the late 1960 s, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was considered {{as one of the most}} deprived regions of the world. However, since then the country has enjoyed remarkable rise in national economic prosperity and sharp increase in personal and household income. Surplus oil economy and adoption of generous welfare programmes by both UAE federal and Dubai local authorities have entirely transformed the social, economic and physical landscape of the country. One such area that has been highly influenced by the new wave of transformation and modernization is housing. Housing conditions in the pre-oil era were grim as more than 80 % of the inhabitants were housed in overcrowded makeshift dwellings made of palm leaves referred to locally as barasti. By the end of 1960 s, housing conditions were undergoing major improvements as the government began to use oil money in subsidizing both income and housing in the form of free serviced residential plots for all middle-incomen ational householdsa nd guaranteedh igh-paying public sectorj obs. With better income and increasing subsidies, housing consumption among newly emerging middle-income households during this period had improved dramatically as overcrowding dropped from 3. 2 to only 1. 6 persons per room and the per capita share of domestic space rose from 15 to 32 square metres per inhabitant. Following the examples of other oil-rich Arab Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Emirate of Abu Dhabi, in 1993, the Dubai government introduced a new housing policy scheme aimed at providing middle-income households with interest-free housing loans in order to facilitate their access to what the government calls adequate owner-occupant housing. The value of each loan was set at AED 500, 000 ($ 136, 240) with a repayment period of 25 years. Although the value of the loan was set to enable middle-class households to build and consume adequate housing, adequate housing itself has never been clearly defined. From the time since the interestfree loan programme was introduced, typical middle-class dwellings have more than doubled in size and average housing consumption rate has climbed to 71. 5 square meters per person exceeding all national, regional and international rates. Moreover, the average number of person per room has declined sharply to only 0. 6. This research aims to study the various causes behind the major increase in the size of the contemporarym iddle-classd wellings and the subsequenrt ise in the rates of housing consumption among this study population. It aims to examine the implications of the current interest-free loan policy and the consequences of the prevailing high levels of housing consumption for loan beneficiaries and other applicants. The interest-free housing loan policy has several shortcomings. It has triggered high demand in relationship to supply. Because of shortage in budget, high value of individual loans and very long repayment period, a major backlog of <b>eligible</b> <b>applications</b> has emerged and waiting time has been increasing steadily. Moreover, the policy has also enabled the few to over-consume scarce housing resources, while providing no assistance for the majority. The interest-free loan policy does not match the specific needs and preferences of the target population. It assumes that all middle-class households have similar housing needs and does not recognize in any way difference in income, household size and aspirations within the various target population subgroups. Additionally, the strict ban on the sale of the dwelling units imposed by the government has trapped many households in large and mostly under-utilized dwellings.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Bureau of Meteorology’s implementation of the Improving Water Information Program. To form a conclusion against this audit objective, the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) adopted the following high-level criteria: 	sound planning processes and governance arrangements were established; 	effective arrangements for collaborating with water organisations and providing financial assistance to water data providers were developed; and 	arrangements for collecting and managing water data and for producing high-quality water information products were appropriate. Overall conclusion The Improving Water Information Program is a relatively new and complex area of activity for the Commonwealth. The program was introduced in 2007 as a key element of the wider national water reforms designed to improve water management in Australia. At the time, governments in Australia were under considerable pressure to address water supply problems that were accentuated by prolonged drought conditions. However, effective policy responses were constrained by poor water information and a lack of nationally consistent data in areas such as water availability, allocations and entitlements. In the six years that the program has been in place, the Bureau has expended $ 186  million and collected more than 21  million water data files containing more than four billion time‑series observations. This data covers thousands of water monitoring sites. From this data and meteorological information, the Bureau has introduced a range of new products and services that have improved the comparability and quality of available water information. These have included: annual national water accounts; water resources assessments; tracking of water storages; and seasonal streamflow forecasts. The Bureau has developed effective arrangements for collaborating with water data providers that supply much of this data, with these providers generally complying with the legislative provisions. High participation in data licensing arrangements has also helped to maximise the utilisation of the Bureau’s water data by third parties and increased the availability of water data to the Australian community. In addition, the Bureau has improved the collection of water information nationally through its collaboration with, and financial assistance to, water data providers. The Modernisation and Extension of Hydrologic Monitoring Systems Program (M&E Program) delivered financial assistance to eligible data providers to assist them in modernising and extending their hydrologic monitoring networks. The Bureau received a total of 789 applications across the five rounds of the program. Of the <b>eligible</b> <b>applications,</b> 60  per cent were awarded funding that totalled $ 78. 1  million. The majority of funding was allocated to projects that focused on modernising and extending monitoring equipment and networks and improving water data management systems and the quality and accuracy of water data. The Bureau effectively administered the M&E Program, with funded activities collectively contributing to improved accuracy and quality of water data and better equipping policy‑makers to manage Australia’s water resources. While stakeholders generally viewed the program and {{the effectiveness of the}} Bureau’s implementation positively, there has been a gap between the expectations of users and the range and completeness of the Bureau’s products and services currently provided. Stakeholders are seeking increased coverage and better quality products and services, including data downloads, so that they can address their own specific product and service needs. Services, such as data downloads, were included as a priority in the Bureau’s 2008 strategic plan for improving water information, but have yet to be fully delivered. While the Bureau’s forward work program is designed to address a number of these concerns, closer consultation with key agencies through established forums (such as the Jurisdictional Reference Group on Water Information) would further assist in managing expectations. A key constraint on the effectiveness of the program’s implementation and the capacity of the Bureau to meet expectations has been the limited functionality available through the system designed to manage national water data—the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS). The development of AWRIS was a key program objective and was fundamental to the Bureau delivering improved national water information. The functionality of AWRIS is severely limited and this has constrained the range and timely development and release of new products and services. Overall, the development of AWRIS was characterised by technical and governance shortcomings, changes in design and approach, unanticipated cost increases and delays. As a consequence, the Bureau has not achieved its vision for AWRIS as a reliable, national repository for water information. Further, the level of expenditure has not been proportional with the level of functionality obtained, with the Bureau expending $ 38. 5  million on AWRIS and associated systems and applications as at 30 June 2013. The issues encountered by the Bureau in this information technology implementation emphasise the importance of agencies understanding their business environment and the likely operational risks and challenges they will be facing when developing new systems. Clarity as to the requirements of users is important, along with the recognition that these may evolve or change over time requiring enhancements to functionality over and above planned business as usual processes. In the case of AWRIS 1, clearly defining business and system requirements and establishing governance arrangements that were commensurate with the risk profile of the project, would have better positioned the Bureau to develop and deliver a system with greater functionality within more reasonable timeframes. The limited functionality that led to the decision to decommission the data warehouse component of AWRIS 1, which is estimated to have cost $ 12. 5  million, raises questions regarding the value for money achieved from the investment in new information technology. Determining {{the extent to which the}} Improving Water Information Program is achieving its objectives has been affected by changes in performance measures over the course of program implementation. The program’s early key performance indicators (KPIs) were broad and difficult to measure. While the KPIs have become more measurable over time, the program’s current KPIs do not readily inform an assessment of the extent to which the program is achieving its outcomes. Having a set of specific, measurable and consistent KPIs that provide the basis for reporting on the program would better position the Bureau to inform stakeholders of program progress and the challenges involved in achieving program outcomes. The ANAO has made two recommendations designed to strengthen the development and management of information technology systems and improve the measurement and reporting of program performance...|$|E
