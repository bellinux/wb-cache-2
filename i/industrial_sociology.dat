25|$|Occupational health {{psychology}} (OHP) is {{an interdisciplinary}} area of psychology that {{is concerned with}} {{the health and safety of}} workers. OHP addresses a number of major topic areas including the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health, work-family balance, workplace violence and other forms of mistreatment, accidents and safety, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker health. OHP emerged from two distinct disciplines within applied psychology, namely, health psychology and industrial and organizational psychology, as well as occupational medicine. OHP has also been informed by other disciplines including <b>industrial</b> <b>sociology,</b> industrial engineering, and economics, as well as preventive medicine and public health. OHP {{is concerned with the}} relationship of psychosocial workplace factors to the development, maintenance, and promotion of workers' health and that of their families. Thus the field's focus is work-related factors that can lead to injury, disease, and distress.|$|E

2500|$|After the Second World War, {{no longer}} a National Socialist, Schelsky became a star of applied sociology, due to his great gift of anticipating social and sociological developments.

Indicted by the communist regime in 1951, he spent some 5 years in prison.

2500|$|Herseni {{took his}} pension from the Psychology Institute in 1973, but carried {{on with his}} work in {{sociology}} and anthropology. His studies of <b>industrial</b> <b>sociology</b> were bound together as Psihologia colectivelor de muncă ("The Psychology of Working Collectives", Editura Academiei, 1973) and an eponymous textbook: Sociologia industrială (Editura Didactică și Pedagogică, 1974). According to Stahl, this was both a [...] "world-level work" [...] and a monograph of [...] "our country's real issues", [...] "the result of direct experiences". Herseni's original drafts were [...] "apolitical", treating industrial relations as indistinct from socialist to capitalist countries, and were revised by censors {{to comply with the}} party line. Also in 1974, Herseni contributed to an Editura Științifică collection on industrial-sociological laboratories, with a study of social engineering techniques. The following year, returning to his native region, he contributed to a monograph on the Făgăraș Chemical Plant.|$|E

Almost immediately someone yanked the sculpture out of its hole, laid it flat on the ground, and slept in it.” [...] Envisioning a future where artists remade our world, Constance Mallinson responded thus to his art in 1980: “In an over-populated, polluted, resource-depleted world, the visionary power of artists in environmental engineering, urban planning, <b>industrial</b> designing, <b>sociology</b> and behavioral psychology could help solve persistent social dilemmas.” ...|$|R

The author concludes by suggesting two avenues for further progress in agency theory: better integration with organizational economics, as launched by Coase (1937) and reinvigorated by Williamson (1975, 1985), and cross-pollination with other fields that study organizations, including <b>industrial</b> relations, organizational <b>sociology,</b> and social psychology. ...|$|R

It has been assumed that the happy worker is a productive worker and that the new participation and enrichment schemes would continue to bring about increased productivity. In this book the author addresses job enrichment as an economist, though he is a strong advocate of a multi-disciplinary approach. He provides a historical summary of the problems involved in job design and then analyses three areas of experiment in order to develop a methodology for measuring the economic costs of changes in the work structure. To effect such changes it is essential to prove that improvement of social performance in companies and organizations is compatible with growth in economic performance and this requires a new form of accounting. First the author analyses factories when are attempting to soften the consequences of job fragmentation and production line work. Then he investigates the impact of computerization on banks and the growth of an over-qualified white-collar workforce. Finally he discusses the case of a company which is attempting to involve its workers in determining their own working conditions. Students and teachers of <b>industrial</b> economics, <b>sociology</b> and psychology, as well as managers, will find this book full of useful insight...|$|R
