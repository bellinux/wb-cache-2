5000|$|A port {{expander}} {{can be any}} {{device to}} which one existing or onboard port becomes two or more - for example: a KVM switch or a USB hub. Such expanders offer the advantage of allowing more devices of a particular port type to be utilized at the same time. A major downside is that, for example, a 3Gbit/s port might have a hub or expander installed and now be able to accommodate 6 devices, but at a maximum of 3Gbit/s throughput bandwidth divided by the said 6 devices, or by however many are plugged in and being used. A port expander is a device that allows one port on a computer system to connect to multiple devices. Two basic forms of port <b>expander</b> exist: <b>internal</b> and external. An <b>internal</b> <b>expander</b> has a connection inside the computer, typically on the motherboard, and the only part the user sees is the expansion plate containing multiple ports. An external device plugs into the existing port and then has multiple places to connect. When {{not part of a}} computer system, these devices are commonly known as [...] splitters.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A novel {{concept for}} rotary {{machines}} is described. A rotor is positioned acentrically in a cylindrical cavity. One or more (typically, three or four) vanes slide radially in slots in the rotor. The vanes {{are connected to}} an axle such that {{the tip of a}} vane follows the internal surface of the housing without touching it. It is shown how the concept can be utilized in the design of compressors, <b>expanders,</b> and <b>internal</b> combustion engines. A thermodynamic model is formulated for the engine process, and calculations for a chosen set of geometrical data are presented. It is concluded that the machine can be described mathematically, and that it can work as claimed by the inventor, Kjell Vading. Some potential advantages over other concepts are discussed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Many {{patients}} who undergo inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) replacement are often upsized to larger cylinders, suggesting the IPP {{may serve as}} a tissue <b>expander</b> and increase <b>internal</b> penile length. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate whether cylinder length increases with subsequent IPP insertion. Materials and Methods: We queried American Medical Systems and Coloplast Patient Information Form databases to identify {{patients who}} underwent IPP placement and replacement between 2004 - 2013. Patients were grouped by device type and time to replacement (0. 5 cm and 40 % demonstrated increases of ≥ 1 cm. Conclusions: As demonstrated, the IPP may provide tissue expansion over time. Further evaluation is needed to determine if increased cylinder length correlates to increased functional length and patient satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the knowledge and the characterization of scroll machines and their systems. It is based on experimental and modeling works carried out on: a) 	A hermetic scroll compressor used inside an air-cooled water chiller. b) 	An oil-free open-drive scroll expander integrated into an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power system. c) 	Open-drive scroll compressor and expander used in a Liquid Flooded Ericsson Cycle Cooler (LFEC). Such a system uses the liquid flooding of the compressor and of the expander to approach isothermal compression and expansion processes. New semi-empirical models of the scroll compressor and expander were proposed and existing models improved. A deterministic model of the scroll expander was established. The model associates a geometrical description of the machine with a thermodynamic description of the expansion process. This model was validated for the two expanders investigated experimentally. The model validation revealed that {{the performance of the}} expanders is mainly affected by the supply pressure drop and by the internal leakages. Using the validated model, parametric studies were carried out to investigate the variation of the performance of both expanders with modification of their design and with the operating parameters. The thesis also investigated the scroll machines {{from the point of view}} of their integration into thermal systems. A first experimental investigation was carried out on an air-cooled chiller. The scroll compressor semi-empirical model, with its parameters identified on the basis of published manufacturer data, was used as a refrigerant flow meter. The analysis of the experimental data allowed a better understanding of the chiller operation and a better identification of its model parameters (such as the fan and the hot gas bypass control models). A second experimental investigation was carried out on an ORC power system, working with R 123. In order to select the most appropriate fluid, the performances achieved with four different fluids were compared by simulation. The experimental study confirmed that the scroll expander is a good candidate for an ORC system: the tested prototype presented a good performance (the maximum global isentropic effectiveness achieved was 68 %). Using an ORC simulation model, parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effects of the expander characteristics and operating conditions on the cycle performance. The latter is mainly affected by the <b>expander</b> <b>internal</b> leakage and by the liquid subcooling at the condenser exhaust. A third experimental investigation was performed on a LFEC working with nitrogen as refrigerant and alkyl-benzene oil as flooding liquid. Experimental data was used to identify the parameters of the scroll compressor and expander semi-empirical models. Parametric studies were performed to identify the different factors affecting their performance. One of the undesirable features of the machines is the increase of the supply and exhaust pressure drops with the increase of oil quantity...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{selection}} for the Organic Rankine Cycle {{has been the}} object of an abundant literature. Most of the scientific publications focus on the cycle thermodynamic efficiency in order to select the best candidate. However, other thermodynamics properties, such as molar mass, or vapor density condition the whole design of the cycle, and its cost. For example, the molar mass influences the number of stages required {{in the case of}} an axial turbine; the volume ratio between expander supply and exhaust conditions the possibility to use a volumetric <b>expander</b> (whose <b>internal</b> volume ratio is limited); the vapor density at the expander exhaust determine the size of the expander, and of the condenser; etc. This paper considers a whole range of ORC applications, in terms of power (from the kW-scale to the multi-MW plants), heat source temperature (from 90 °C to more than 300 °C) or heat source nature (solar, biomass, waste heat recovery, geothermy, etc.). For each of these applications, a screening of the available fluids is performed, and their thermodynamics performance are compared with respect to the foreseen application. A detailed analysis of the most common expansion machines is then conducted, by comparing their respective operating maps for each fluid and for each application type. The considered expansion machines are the radial-inflow turbine, the screw expander, and the scroll expander, since they are the most widely used in commercial applications and/or in scientific literature.

40|$|A 1 -MW {{wellhead}} generator {{was tested}} in 1980, 1981, and 1982 by Mexico, Italy, and New Zealand at Cerro Prieto, Cesano, and Broadlands, respectively. The total flow helical screw expander portable power plant, Model 76 - 1, {{had been built}} for the U. S. Government and field-tested in Utah, USA, in 1978 and 1979. The <b>expander</b> had oversized <b>internal</b> clearances designed for self-cleaning operation on fluids that deposit adherent scale normally detrimental to the utiliation of liquid dominated fields. Conditions with which the expander was tested included inlet pressures of 64 to 220 psia, inlet qualities of 0 % to 100 %, exhaust pressures of 3. 1 to 40 psia, electrial loads of idle and 110 to 933 kW, electrical frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz, male rotor speeds of 2500 to 4000 rpm, and fluid characteristics to 310, 000 ppm total dissolved solids and noncondensables to 38 wt % of the vapor. Some testing was done on-grid. Typical expander isentropic efficiency was 40 % to 50 % with the clearances not closed, and 5 percentage points or more higher with the clearances partly closed. The expander efficiency increased approximately logarithmically with shaft power for most operations, while inlet quality, speed, and pressure ratio across the machine had only small effects. These findings are all {{in agreement with the}} Utah test results...|$|R
40|$|Rotating shafts are {{employed}} in industrial machines such as steam and gas turbines, cryogenic turbo <b>expanders,</b> turbo generators, <b>internal</b> combustion engines, centrifugal compressors for power transmission. On account of the ever increasing demand for power and high speed transportation, the rotors of these machines are made extremely flexible to allow bending. The shafts of these machines are subjected to torsional and bending vibration {{and in some cases}} unstable condition of operation. These machines can develop excessive stress in torsion because of low torsional natural frequencies of the system involving flexible couplings. Determination of natural frequencies and mode shapes is thus important from design point of view. Lateral bending and subsequently whirling of a rotor may arise due to residual unbalance (present due to corrosion, material inhomogeneity etc.) which would cause the simple circular shaft on rigid supports carrying concentrated masses experience synchronous whirl and when the shaft runs at a speed equal to its natural frequency in lateral bending, the whirling becomes predominant. This phenomenon is different from conventional resonance since large amplitude vibration cannot be controlled by additional damping. As the resonance occurs the shaft develops stresses violently, causing the shaft to fail suddenly or decreasing its life. Considering the importance of critical shape and unbalance responses, an effort is made to develop interactive and user-friendly software capable of evaluating the much needed data like critical speed, the associated mode shapes and unbalance-response of a given rotor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tissue {{expanders}} are devices {{which are}} used to create enough skin to form suitable flap in restoration of great skin deficiencies which are not modified initially. The current study aimed at investigating the patients′ satisfaction and the complications such as rupture, hematoma, wound infection, seroma, leakage, chronic pain, and <b>expander</b> expose of <b>internal</b> (implanted under the skin) and external (implanted outside) ports. Materials and Methods: In a prospective quasiexperimental study conducted at Alzahra and Imam Musa al-Kadhim educational referral hospitals in Isfahan, two matched groups of patients each one contained 38 patients undergone, external and internal ports, were followed-up weekly until the removal of expander and the injection was done weekly through port. The frequency of complications and patients′ satisfaction between two groups were compared. Results: The of age for patients in internal and external groups were 25. 5 ± 8. 7 and 24. 7 ± 9, respectively (P = 0. 71). There was significant difference between average of operation time of internal and external group (97. 3 vs. 79. 6; P < 0. 001). The rate of complications such as infection, hematoma, skin necrosis, and expander expose between two groups was comparable, while {{significant difference was found}} between groups in terms of pain intensity in injection [4. 92 (1. 2) vs. 1. 53 (0. 69), P < 0. 001]. There {{was no significant difference between}} groups in terms of symptom incidence and tissue expander insertion place as well as patients′ satisfaction. Conclusion: Although internal port has favorite appearance; however, some complications such as skin infection due to frequent injection, pain rate are higher than external port lead to its more acceptability by the patients...|$|R
