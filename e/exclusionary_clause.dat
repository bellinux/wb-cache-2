Part II describes the structure and content of constitutional clauses that exclude personal law and customary law from constitutional non-discrimination protection. Part III briefly examines international and regional human rights law and offers a pragmatic conclusion that countries must eliminate <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> in order to conform to human rights commitments. Part IV provides a theoretical justification for eliminating <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> from these constitutions. This section builds upon feminist theory and dialogic constitutionalism to argue that countries should eliminate constitutional <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> in order to dismantle the faulty public/private dichotomy and provide a voice for women in constitutional debates over the normative content of customary law. Finally, Part V assesses alternatives for judicial intervention once the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> have been eliminated through constitutional amendment. This part explores a number of strategies courts might employ in interpreting personal and customary law in light of constitutional equality guarantees, ranging from less interventionist to more interventionist. These intervention strategies include limited intervention, in which customary law is largely left to evolve on its own; formalist intervention, in which gender equality rights clearly trump rights to custom or vice versa; and activist intervention, in which courts must balance gender equality rights with rights to custom. This article proposes a rights-balancing approach that values both culture and equality rights.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the validity of}} <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> in medical contracts, more especially, hospital contracts in which the healthcare provider exonerates itself against edictal liability arising from the negligent conduct of its staff, resulting in the patient suffering damages. In assessing whether these types of clauses should be outlawed by our courts, this thesis attempts to synthesize six major traditional areas of law, namely, the law of delict, the law of contract, medical law and ethics, international and foreign law, statutory law and constitutional law into a legal conceptual framework relating specifically to <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> in medical contracts in South Africa. This thesis highlights systemic inconsistencies {{with regard to the}} central issue, namely, whether these types of clauses are valid or not, especially, {{given the fact that the}} practice of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> or waivers in hospital contracts has hitherto traditionally been assessed within the framework of the law of contract. The alignment of the various pre-existing areas of statutory and common law with the Constitution highlights that an inter-disciplinary and purposive approach under the value-driven Constitution, brings about a less fragmented picture in assessing the validity of these types of clauses. This approach accords with the new solicitude of the executive, the judiciary, the legislature and academia to transform the South African legal system not only in terms of procedural law but also substantive law. This has resulted in the alignment with constitutional principles and the underlying values to test the validity of these types of clauses, alternatively, contracts. Whereas pre-constitutionally the assessment of disclaimers in hospital contracts was done against the stratum of antiquated principles, namely, freedom of contract and the sanctity of contract, ignoring values such as reasonableness, fairness and conscionability, post-constitutionally, because the values that underlie the Bill of Rights and which affects all spheres of law, including the law of contract, concepts such as fairness, equity, reasonableness should weigh heavily with the decision-maker. In this regard, broader medico-legal considerations, normative medical ethics and the common law principles of good faith, fairness and reasonableness play a fundamental role in the assessment of contractual provisions, including the practice of disclaimers or <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> in hospital contracts. This thesis critically examines how these types of clauses or contracts ought to be adjudicated eventually against the background of such alignment. It concludes that the entering into a hospital contract, in which the patient exonerates a hospital and its staff from liability flowing from the hospital or its staff's negligence causing damages to the patient, would be inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid. In the old order in which traditional divisions of law have been encouraged, a fragmented approach resulted in legal in congruencies which, in turn, created turbulence and a lot of uncertainty. This approach is apposite to that which the new constitutionally based legal system, aims to achieve. The rights in the Bill of Rights which are interconnected and which influences all spheres of law, including contract law, offers a fairer basis upon which, the validity of contracts, or contractual provisions, can be measured than, the pure contract approach. In this regard, although contracts or contractual provisions in the past may have been unfair and unreasonable, the courts, however, refused to strike them down purely on this basis. The law of contract, as a legal vehicle for adjudicating the validity of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> or waivers in hospital contracts, is therefore not ideal. This is primarily due to the antiquated approach the South African courts have always taken in this area of law. The law of delict, statutory law and medical law, standing alone, also does not provide a satisfactory answer. What is needed is an integrated approach in which the traditional areas of law are united and wherein constitutional principles and values, give much guidance and direction. Alternatively, should the unification of the traditional areas of law not be possible in bringing about fair and equitable results, the introduction of legislative measures may very well be indicated.

Notwithstanding these advantages, concerns have been raised {{about the use of}} the genetic information derived in these processes, outside of the research and medical health care settings, by third parties such as insurers. Indeed, insurance applicants are asked to consent to insurers accessing their medical information (implicitly including genetic) to verify or determine their insurability level, or eligibility to certain insurance products. This use of genetic information may result in the differential treatment of individuals based on their genetic information, which could lead to higher premium, <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> or even the denial of coverage. This phenomenon has been commonly referred to as “Genetic Discrimination” (GD). In the Canadian context, where federal Bill S- 201, An Act to prohibit and prevent genetic discrimination, has recently been enacted but may be subject to constitutional challenges, information about potential risks to insurability may raise issues in the clinical context. We conducted a survey with women in Quebec who have never been diagnosed with breast cancer to document their perspectives. We complemented the research with data from 14 semi-structured interviews with decision-makers in Quebec to discuss institutional issues raised by the use of genetic information by insurers. Our results provide findings on five main issues: (1) the reluctance to undergo genetic screening test due to insurability concerns, (2) insurers' interest in genetic information, (3) the duty to disclose genetic information to insurers, (4) the disclosure of potential impacts on insurability before genetic testing, and (5) the status of genetic information compared to other health data. Overall, both groups of participants (the women surveyed and the decision-makers interviewed) acknowledged having concerns about GD and reported a need for better communication tools discussing insurability risk. Our conclusions regarding concerns about GD and the need for better communication tools in the clinical setting may be transferable to the broader Canadian context...|$|R

The history of the SM <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clause</b> and its impact is detailed herein. We argue that the federal ED definition, and especially its SM <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clause,</b> have both served to inhibit the progress of the behavior disorders subspecialty within the special education field, and have diverted energy and attention from more important aspects of serving students with behavioral and emotional problems. From both a pragmatic and empirical standpoint, we argue that the SM <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clause</b> is untenable, and that it deserves neither our support nor the continued professional focus that it continues to demand. Using the “Triangle of Support” model as an exemplar, we propose that assessment methods should be linked to comprehensive systems of service delivery to provide a true cascade of services for students with behavioral and emotional problems. Recommended alternative definitions of ED are discussed, including the National Coalition definition of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders that narrowly missed con-gressional approval for replacing the current definition. Further, we recommend adoption of the externalizing–internalizing broadband dimensional dichotomy as an emerging and scientifically sound alternative way of conceptualizing emotional and behavioral problems. © 2004 Wile...|$|E

In conducting the assessment, there is an analysis of various international and regional legal instruments relevant {{to the rights of}} the child, refugee law and international criminal law. There is also an analysis of case law from select jurisdictions concerning the matter. There are several issues that have emerged from the analysis such as the lack of a uniform minimum age of criminal responsibility that has led to diverse application of Article I F (a) to child soldiers seeking asylum. There is also the issue of the legal threshold set out in Article IF (a) that has presented a challenge in applying the exclusion clause. The other issue is whether the interpretation of the Refugee Convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child based on the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties will help to resolve the conflict. The conclusion made by this paper is that the current application of the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clause</b> to child soldiers seeking asylum is against {{the best interests of the}} child,Thus it recommends that for the best interests of the child to be upheld, there is need for states to agree on a minimum age of criminal responsibility that will promote certainty in applying the exclusion clause as well as a revision of the legal threshold of the exclusion clause to reflect the current legal threshold in international criminal law...|$|E
40|$|Swaziland {{recently}} {{established a}} framework for enforcing competition law when it passed the Competition, Act 8 of 2007 (Swazi Competition Act). The Act provides {{for the establishment of}} the Swaziland Competition Commission (Swazi Commission), a statutory body responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act. One of its major objectives is to promote a secure and robust economic competition and consumer protection. Following its inception in 2007, the Swazi Commission has dealt with mergers and the question on the legality and enforcement of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clauses</b> in contracts. These clauses are most prevalent in contracts for lease on property seeking to establish large shopping malls, as we shall see later from the case of Pick 'n Pay (Pty) Ltd v The Gables (Pty) Ltd. The adoption of a comprehensive competition law framework by Swaziland is relatively a new phenomenon and like other developing countries, the Swaziland competition regime presents some institutional challenges. Some of these challenges relate to the institutional structure of the Commission and its independence. Whether the independence of the Commission can be guaranteed in view of the manner it is constructed as well as the relationship between the Swazi Commission and the courts and finally, the jurisdictional powers of the Commission in the execution of its duties and functions in terms of the Act. These challenges taken together have a potential of undermining the independence and effectiveness of the only institution that has the mandate to create and ensure free and transparent markets in the country. This treatise seeks to analyse these challenges as presented by the Swaziland competition regime. A comparative analysis between Swaziland and the South African competition regime will be carried out in order to provide somewhat practical solutions to the challenges that Swaziland is confronted with. It is also aimed at setting out proposal for the reform of the competition framework of Swaziland to incorporate the bifurcated agency model as opposed to the integrated agency model it is currently structured on. Under the bifurcated agency model the Commission investigates all competition violations and then hand over the cases to a specialised tribunal for adjudication and enforcement. In the contrary the integrated agency model entails that the Commission investigates and make the first -level adjudication. The decision of the Commission can then be reviewed or appealed by the courts. This is the model adopted by Swaziland according to the Act...|$|R

This Kerrey did, but instead of writing his uncle 2 ̆ 7 s story, he wrote his own, of growing up in the 1950 s in Lincoln, Nebraska, one of seven children in a solid, church-going, middle-class family. 2 ̆ 2 We biked everywhere, 2 ̆ 2 Kerrey writes. 2 ̆ 2 The edge of the universe lay at the ends of the dirt roads leading to those places where the wild and wooly frontier began. 2 ̆ 2 The fearful things in this safe place were either abstract (Soviet and Martian invasions) or very concrete (spring floods). In the plainest of plain prose, Kerrey records his high school ambitions (to defy his asthma and make the football team like his older brother) and his years at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where he majored in pharmacy. Although one of his college girlfriends joined the Freedom Riders in 1961, Kerrey confesses that he himself 2 ̆ 2 knew or cared little about the world outside Lincoln. 2 ̆ 2 Looking back, he both loves his childhood and marvels at how fully he accepted its limitations. Yet a note of self-justification intrudes even when he is self-critical: he joined a fraternity with <b>exclusionary</b> membership <b>clauses</b> because he wanted to belong; but he credits the fraternity with giving him 2 ̆ 2 a chance to lead 2 ̆ 2 when he was elected its president. He does not ask himself whom he was leading nor toward what end. In 1966, Kerrey received his draft notice and instead volunteered for the navy and its special forces unit, the SEALS. His attitude toward the war was passive: he could not imagine refusing to serve but hoped it would end before he had to go. Kerrey 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of the war is brief, superficial, and contradictory. He knew little about the conflict when he volunteered and seems not to have learned a great deal since. He is content to believe that the US intervened in the war out of a desire to secure the 2 ̆ 2 freedom and self-determination of the South Vietnamese, 2 ̆ 2 that in the delta, where he fought, people sympathized 2 ̆ 2 with whomever they feared most, 2 ̆ 2 and that the North Vietnamese defeated the US because 2 ̆ 2 we lost the battle for public opinion not only in the United States but also in South Vietnam 2 ̆ 7 s countryside. 2 ̆ 2 He does not explain why South Vietnamese opinion mattered, if fear alone determined people 2 ̆ 7 s sympathies. One dark February night in 1969, Kerrey led his team into the delta village of Thanh Phong, which, the South Vietnamese district chief had assured him, contained no civilians since the entire village was loyal to the National Liberation Front. The goal was to kill or capture high level enemy officials supposedly meeting in the village. First, the inhabitants of a house on the outskirts of the village are killed for fear they would warn the others. Kerrey 2 ̆ 2 did not have to give an order to begin the killing but I could have stopped it and didn 2 ̆ 7 t. 2 ̆ 2 He leaves out who lived in the house: two grandparents and five grandchildren. Next, the team searched several houses in the village, finding no meeting and no men. Meanwhile the women and children had gathered outside the houses, talking loudly. 2 ̆ 2 We had two choices: withdraw or continue to search the houses in the dark. 2 ̆ 2 The choice was apparently made for them: a shot rang out and Kerrey 2 ̆ 7 s team responded with 2 ̆ 2 a tremendous barrage of fire [...] 2 ̆ 2 Here Kerrey hides behind the passive voice: 2 ̆ 2 I saw women and children in front of us being hit and cut to pieces. 2 ̆ 2 At least one member of Kerrey 2 ̆ 7 s team has disputed this version of events, making Kerrey a direct agent in the killing of the family on the outskirts of the village and denying there had been hostile fire in the village...|$|R

An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used to study Section Four of the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clause</b> of Specific Learning Disability (SLD) that states students must be excluded from identification if their learning difficulties are primarily the result of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage. The Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT) was borrowed from water governance policy analysis to provide a theoretical framework for better understanding the complexity of context and interaction processes in special education policy implementation in Oregon. Survey (n = 100) and interview (n = 6) results showed that 87 % of Oregon school psychologist respondents demonstrated some level of non-compliant behavior on Section Four implementation. Barriers to implementation included unclear state and federal guidelines, lack of measurable terms, unclear roles and responsibilities, external pressures to find students eligible, and lack of confidence that Section Four can be applied in every case for 69 % or more of the sample. Recommendations for future research include defining the Section Four terms, developing a measurement tool with cut offs, and training to improve implementation; however, there is concern that this may be an impossible task. Recommendations were made to develop a state level Task Force to begin the dialogue; however, future research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of validity of CIT, definitions of Section Four terms that are measurable, identification and definitions of the mitigating mechanisms in the determination of Section Four for appropriate and possible implementation.

40|$|Excerpt] “Multiple {{sources for}} {{recovery}} {{are available for}} an employee who is physically injured by a third-party tortfeasor in the course and scope of employment. This is especially true when the physical injury triggers coverage under a health insurance policy or other type of insurance policy for medical benefits. First, assuming that the employer participates in workers’ compensation insurance, the employee is entitled to receive workers’ compensation benefits for medical expenses. Second, the employee can also recover payments for medical benefits from the third-party tortfeasor in a common-law negligence lawsuit. Third, the employee, who in this context would be considered “the insured,” can also make a claim for medical benefits under a private health insurance policy, private automobile insurance policy, or some other variety of private insurance. […] In 2002, the Nevada Supreme Court held in Rubin v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Company that a workers’ compensation <b>exclusionary</b> <b>clause</b> in a private insurance contract does not apply where an injured employee subsequently recovers damages from a third-party tortfeasor. The recovery the employee receives from the third-party tortfeasor, however, is to be reimbursed to the workers’ compensation carrier until workers’ compensation is made whole. Finally, the Rubin court also allows the employee/insured to recover payments for medical benefits under the insured’s med-pay clause of his private automobile insurance policy. This Note contends that under Rubin when an employee recovers medical benefits from both workers’ compensation and the employee’s own private insurance, the insured employee should either not be entitled to med-pay benefits from the private insurance company, or the private automobile insurance company {{should be permitted to}} subrogate against the third-party tortfeasor for med-pay benefits already paid to the insured. Many other jurisdictions support this approach. This Note concedes, however, that Rubin was correctly decided under Nevada law since subrogation of med-pay benefits in Nevada is against public policy. Although some states have allowed the same result as the decision in Rubin, the opposing view is better because it serves the purpose of no-fault med-pay benefits, discourages the windfall of a double recovery, and requires that physical injuries sustained in the course and scope of employment are primarily covered by workers’ compensation. Part II of this Note will provide background information on no-fault medical benefits, subrogation and offsetting, and the collateral source rule as they relate to med-pay benefits. Part III of this Note will report the facts, procedural history, and reasoning of the Rubin decision. Part IV will analyze the Rubin decision using explanations from other jurisdictions that have reached similar results. Part V will explain the problems associated with the Rubin situation, and offer alternate solutions, as reached in jurisdictions other than Nevada. Part VI will briefly conclude this Note. ...|$|E
