500|$|In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon {{wearing a}} Pink Floyd T-shirt {{with the words}} I Hate {{handwritten}} above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon {{to come to a}} nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, [...] "He came in with green hair. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart." [...] When the pub closed, the group moved on to SEX, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon. Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: ...|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
500|$|During the season, Scott {{played in}} 12 of 13games, {{including}} 11starts, and recorded 1,133rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In {{the first game}} of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott [...] "dominated early" [...] against 23rd-ranked California with 19carries for 87yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland take a quick lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23carries but gained only 39yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're not going to go very far. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team... I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play... I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' He patted me on the butt. 'Just get me the ball.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his initial}} {{fellowship}} year, Kesey frequently clashed with Center director Wallace Stegner, who regarded the young writer as [...] "a sort of highly talented illiterate" [...] and rejected Kesey's {{application for a}} departmental Stegner Fellowship before permitting his attendance as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. Reinforcing these perceptions, Stegner's deputy Richard Scowcroft later recalled that [...] "neither Wally nor <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a particularly important talent." [...] According to Stone, Stegner [...] "saw Kesey... {{as a threat to}} civilization and intellectualism and sobriety" [...] and continued to reject Kesey's Stegner Fellowship applications for the 1959–60 and 1960–61 terms.|$|E
2500|$|A Shin Hikari's final race of {{the year}} came in the Hong Kong Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse on 13 December in which he started a 25/1 {{outsider}} in a thirteen-runner field. The Irish colt Free Eagle started favourite but faced a strong challenge from the Hong Kong runners who included Designs On Rome, Military Attack, Blazing Speed (Queen Elizabeth II Cup), Dan Excel (Singapore Airlines International Cup) and Beauty Only (Hong Kong Classic Mile). The other runners were Nuovo Record (Yushun Himba) Satono Aladdin and Staphanos from Japan, Criterion (Queen Elizabeth Stakes) and Lucia Valentina (Turnbull Stakes) from Australia and Free Port Lux (Prix Dollar) from France. A Shin Hikari broke quickly from his draw {{on the outside and}} took the lead soon after the start, setting a strong pace before accelerating three lengths clear of the field early in the straight. He stayed on in the closing stages to win by a length from Nuovo Record in a race record time of 2:00.6. Yutaka Take commented [...] "The horse was in very good condition, so I had much confidence going into the race. The horse sometimes has a difficult temperament, but he’s in good form so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a very good chance".|$|E
2500|$|... but {{the animal}} {{knew better than}} I what was forthcoming, and instead of going faster, so nearly stopped that I remarked he placed one foot after another {{on the ground with}} as much {{precaution}} as if walking on a smooth piece of ice. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. I thought my horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake. I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description. But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon my horse, and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E
