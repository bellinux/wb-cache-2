5|$|According to USA Today, Omaha ranks eighth {{among the}} nation's 50 largest cities in both per-capita billionaires and Fortune 500 companies. With {{diversification}} in several industries, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, architecture/construction, and transportation, Omaha's economy has grown <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the early 1990s. In 2001 Newsweek identified Omaha {{as one of}} the top 10 high-tech havens in the nation. Six national fiber optic networks converge in Omaha.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of large}} land mammals such as caribou, moose, deer, elk, have been declining <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the {{reintroduction}} of wolves. Species almost entirely gone {{that were once}} common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.|$|E
50|$|Although in the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s the halibut {{industry}} in Greenland was low scale, it has <b>since</b> <b>dramatically</b> increased <b>since</b> the 1980s {{and in the}} future may develop into a purely commercial venture for many native people in the country.|$|R

5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E
5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Florida Atlantic {{has changed}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> its opening in 1964. As of 2013, {{there are more}} than 30,000 {{students}} attending classes on seven campuses spread across 120miles (193km). The university consists of ten colleges and employs more than 3,200 faculty and staff. The university's endowment decreased from $182 million in June 2008 to $142 million in January 2009 due to a worsening economy. However, with the national economic recovery the endowment has increased to $179 million by the end of 2012.|$|E

5|$|Arctic Bulk Minerals {{bought the}} mining rights, and {{operated}} a train once to {{twice a year}} to keep the track and rolling stock maintained. This company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The mining company was then bought by the local power company Varanger Kraft and Sør-Varanger Municipality. In 2006, they sold the mining company to Tschudi Group for 102million Norwegian krone (NOK). The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron, registered in Perth, Australia, as a holding company to own the mining company. Operations in the mine and on the line resumed in 2009, after the price of iron had risen <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> {{the closing of the}} mine. With the opening of the mine, production is estimated at 3million tonnes of export per year. The Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line was the northern-most railway in the world until 2010, when Russia's Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line was opened.|$|E
5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{autism is}} {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of people}} affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} Chinese people in Libya has <b>dramatically</b> dwindled <b>since</b> 2011 after the {{outbreak}} of civil war. Commercial activity was destabilized by {{the civil war and}} violence that continued afterwards, forcing the evacuation of foreign residents including Chinese.|$|R
5|$|The Wrington Vale line {{closed in}} 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic {{to the gas}} works ended, though there was some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not faring well either: the number of tickets sold along the line had {{decreased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the early 1900s, although {{there was still a}} significant flow of strawberries, milk and cheese to London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a private siding near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi has increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating {{that more than}} 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the first {{record in the}} 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{proposed}} state regulations related to hydraulic fracturing has <b>dramatically</b> increased <b>since</b> 2005.

5|$|It {{resulted}} in an overwhelming victory for the right, with the CEDA and the Radicals together winning 219 seats. Although the political situation was complicated, parties of the right won around 3,365,700 votes, parties of the centre 2,051,500 votes, and parties of the left 3,118,000 according to one estimate. Turnout was around 8,535,200 votes, 67.5% of the electorate. The right had spent far more on their election campaign than the Socialists, who campaigned alone. Women, in their first election, mainly voted for the centre-right. The Communist Party, with perhaps 3,000 members, were at this point not significant. Nationalist Basques won twelve of seventeen Basque seats, a considerable victory. Keeping their promise, the CNT proclaimed a revolution. There were many reasons the Socialists and Republicans lost out; the female vote alone cannot explain the shift. Among them was the disunity of the political left compared to the right, {{in a system that}} favoured broad coalitions. The Radicals and their supporters had also shifted to the right. Abstentionalism hindered Socialist and Republican candidates. Overall, the political system in Spain had changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>since</b> the last election.|$|E
