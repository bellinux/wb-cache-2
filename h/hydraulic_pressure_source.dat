This paper simplifies the fractures in the surrounding rock as flat ellipses and then identifies the critical <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> values required for the occurrence of tensile-shear and compression-shear failures in water-filled fractures {{in the case of}} plane stress.

40|$|High {{pressure}} is often {{considered to be}} the cause of the high fouling propensity of reverse osmosis (RO) relative to forward osmosis (FO). Several experimental studies have shown that alginate fouling is more susceptible to cleaning in FO than in RO, but the theory that foulant compaction causes this disparity seems to be contradicted by the incompressibility of alginate hydrogels. In addition, the effect of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on fouling in osmotic membrane desalination has never been experimentally isolated, because fixed-flux comparisons at different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures</b> require different draw solution osmotic pressures. In this study, a new approach to isolating the effect of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on alginate fouling and cleaning is introduced: operating FO with elevated but equal feed and draw <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> The same concentration of sodium chloride is used as the draw solution in all trials to eliminate possible effects of draw solution osmotic pressure on membrane fouling or cleaning. Theoretical modeling of the effect of alginate foulant compaction on flux reveals that foulant compaction should accelerate flux decline with low salinity feeds but retard flux decline at high salinity. However, in low-salinity alginate fouling trials, for which foulant compaction should accelerate flux decline, the measured flux decline rate was not affected by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Furthermore, when fouled membranes were cleaned by increasing the feed velocity and reducing the draw osmotic pressure, there was no apparent relationship between <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> and cleaning effectiveness. Finally, in situ visualization of foulant removal during the cleaning process revealed no difference in foulant removal mechanisms between different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressures.</b> These findings demonstrate that alginate gel compaction by high feed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> does not occur and suggest that other explanations should be sought for FO's high fouling resistance relative to RO.

The morphology, cytoskeleton, and expression of myofibroblastic marker protein and transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) of NRK 52 E cells were examined. Results: Disorganized actin filaments and formation of curling clusters in actin were seen in the cytoplasm of pressurized cells. We verified that de novo expression of α-smooth muscle actin induced by pressure, which indicated TEMT, was dependent on both the magnitude and duration of pressure.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of floating buoys of a wave power generating jack-up platform called Haiyuan 1, in order to work out the optimum designed draft and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure.</b> The performance of the buoy, especially its delivered power, is an important issue in designing oscillating buoy wave energy converter. In this case, major factors affect the performance including incident wave, designed draft, and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> on the buoy. To find out the relationship among design draft, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure,</b> and delivered power, the key point is to precisely estimate wave induced motion of the buoy. Three-dimensional theory and time domain method based on potential theory were adopted in the paper. Unlike ship and other floating structures, motion of wave energy converter (WEC) buoy in wave will be weakened because of energy take-off, which will cause significant draft changing with time. Thus, draft changing should be taken into consideration as well. In addition, green water problem occurs more frequently than that in ship and other floating structures and also might the reduce delivered power. Therefore, green water problem will also be taken into account when choosing the optimum designed draft and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure.</b> The calculation indicates that the optimum designed draft is 0. 935 m, while the optimum designed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressure</b> is 30 kN...|$|R
