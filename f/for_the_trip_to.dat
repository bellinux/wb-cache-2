5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because he had left his keys in London and needed some papers from the house <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Major General Millard F. Harmon—{{commander}} of United States Army {{forces in}} the South Pacific—convinced Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley—overall commander of Allied {{forces in the}} South Pacific—that the marines on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus, on 8 October, the 2,837 men of the 164th Infantry Regiment from the U.S. Army's Americal Division boarded ships at New Caledonia <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Guadalcanal with a projected arrival date of 13 October.|$|E

5|$|A 1–0 {{victory against}} Coventry City meant Arsenal were five points behind Sheffield Wednesday, who lay in third spot. Arsenal {{continued}} their strong finish {{to the season}} by scoring seven goals {{in the space of}} three days – three away to Norwich City and four at home to Crystal Palace. The team, without the suspended Wright <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Sheffield United came away from Bramall Lane with a point. Arsenal beat Liverpool 4–0 on 21 April 1992, which marked the opposition's biggest defeat in nine years. A draw at Chelsea ended Arsenal's chances of finishing in a UEFA Cup place. Arsenal ended the league campaign with a 5–1 win against Southampton at home. Wright overtook Tottenham striker Gary Lineker as the league's top goalscorer by scoring three on the day which took his total to 29 (24 of those scored for Arsenal) – one more than Lineker.|$|E

5|$|Bell was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} opening match of the 1904–05 season, a 1–4 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion. Bell kept his place in the side for the following match against Chesterfield, but was dropped <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Bolton Wanderers in favour of youngster William Hutchinson, a summer signing from non-League club Alston. He was recalled for the visit of Liverpool on 22 October 1904, deputising for the unavailable Doug MacFarlane, but then spent more than two months out of the team. Bell made two further appearances for Burnley that season, playing in consecutive defeats to Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool in January 1905. He found himself more involved in the first-team during the 1905–06 campaign, making 19 league appearances. On 13 January 1906, he played in the first FA Cup game of his career as Burnley were eliminated by Southern League side Tottenham Hotspur in the first round. Bell scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 1906, netting the opening goal in the 2–2 draw against Burslem Port Vale. During March 1906, he scored in the home wins over Leeds City and Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it was}} on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|Irvine {{started the}} first match of the 1963–64 campaign, a 1–3 defeat away to Ipswich Town. However, he {{suffered}} a broken hand during the game, which left him unable to play throughout the following months. Even after recovery, he remained sidelined, unable to regain {{his place in the}} starting eleven. Irvine did not play again for Burnley until 30 March 1964, when he was chosen to play at inside-right in the away tie against Bolton Wanderers. Despite Irvine's fifth goal in four league starts, Burnley were beaten 1–2. He retained his place in the team for the next two matches, before returning to his more preferred centre forward position for the 0–3 loss at home to Liverpool on 14 April 1964. He scored three more goals in the final two matches of the season, including two in the 7–2 win against Tottenham Hotspur. His frequent goalscoring led to him becoming a more integral part of the Burnley side during the following campaign, in which he scored three goals in the first six matches, although the team achieved only four draws and two losses. He was dropped from the starting line-up for the away match at Birmingham City on 12 September 1964. The team suffered three defeats in the following four fixtures, and Irvine was reinstated to the team <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> West Bromwich Albion two weeks later. He immediately marked his return with both Burnley goals in a 2–1 win, the team's first away victory of the season. Irvine retained his place in the side for most of the remainder of the campaign, and in December he scored seven goals in four games, including a hat-trick in the 4–0 win over Fulham. Despite missing {{a small portion of the}} campaign through injury, Irvine ended the season with a total of 22 goals in 37 league and cup matches, one more goal than centre forward partner Lochhead.|$|E

25|$|Following their {{win over}} Chicago, Giants coach Bill Parcells {{mentioned}} travel arrangements {{in a team}} meeting during the week.

He then showed the team he was packing for both trips as a motivational tactic.|$|E
25|$|Alliance then {{returned}} to the main battle, firing two broadsides. Again, these did at least as much damage to Richard as to Serapis, but the tactic worked to the extent that, unable to move, and with Alliance keeping well out of the line of his own great guns, Captain Pearson of Serapis accepted that prolonging the battle could achieve nothing, so he surrendered. Most of Bonhomme Richard's crew immediately transferred to other vessels, and after {{a day and a half}} of frantic repair efforts, it was decided that the ship could not be saved, so it was allowed to sink, and Jones took command of Serapis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> neutral (but American-sympathizing) Holland.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, Aurora began a 103-day world cruise {{with more}} than 1,700 {{passengers}} on board.

During the ship's time waiting in Southampton, passengers were offered free drinks in the onboard bars and were able to exit the ship at any time. Passengers were also permitted to cancel their booking for a full refund. After P Cruises cancelled the cruise, the company donated all of the food purchased <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> local charities around Southampton.

25|$|In October 1941, the 55th/53rd Battalion was {{undertaking}} {{a period}} of continuous training at Bathurst, New South Wales {{when it was announced}} that they were to be delinked once more and the 53rd would be sent to act as a garrison force in Darwin, Northern Territory. The battalion was brought up to full strength from other Militia units, but by December as they were due to embark <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> the north they were still below strength and in order to meet this shortfall they received a draft of 104 conscripts. Taken at short notice from units in the Sydney area, many of these men had just turned 18 and had received little or no formal military training. They embarked upon the Aquitania, but instead of being sent to Darwin they were diverted to Port Moresby, arriving there on 3 January 1942 and becoming part of the 30th Brigade. Japan had entered the war the previous month and the battalion was to form part of the garrison for the port in case of a possible invasion.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualities and}} {{approaches}} which gave Livingstone an advantage as an explorer were that he usually travelled light, {{and he had}} an ability to reassure chiefs {{that he was not}} a threat. Other expeditions had dozens of soldiers armed with rifles and scores of hired porters carrying supplies, and were seen as military incursions or were mistaken for slave-raiding parties. Livingstone, on the other hand, travelled on most of his journeys with a few servants and porters, bartering for supplies along the way, with a couple of guns for protection. He preached a Christian message but did not force it on unwilling ears; he understood the ways of local chiefs and successfully negotiated passage through their territory, and was often hospitably received and aided, even by Mwata Kazembe. His great trans-Africa journey was performed with the help at first of 27 Africans loaned to him by Sekeletu, chief of the Kololo, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Loanda (Luanda) on the Atlantic Ocean from Linyanti, and with 114 men, loaned by the same chief, on certain conditions, for the last leg of the journey from Linyanti to Quelimane on the Indian Ocean.|$|E
