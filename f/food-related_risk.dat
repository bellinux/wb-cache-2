40|$|The {{proliferation}} of social media {{applications such as}} online communities, social networking sites, or blogs gives the public new means for receiving, and importantly, providing information. Many opportunities are opening up for food risk communicators by {{the wide variety of}} social media applications and the digital environment with enormous abilities for storing, retrieving and reusing information. The global nature of today's food chains asks for a global approach in communicating <b>food-related</b> <b>risk</b> and benefit issues. However, the evolution of social media also presents a number of pitfalls related to information accuracy, trust and source credibility. This paper portrays and comments on the structural changes in communication and discusses on the current state of social media as a possible tool for communicating food risks and benefits...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the results of {{different}} consumer surveys conducted between 2004 and 2006 with regard to consumers’ perceptions and reactions concerning AI in Vietnam, (mainly in Hanoi). The main results observed are as follows: A high proportion of consumers consider AI to be a <b>food-related</b> <b>risk.</b> However, over time,there has been a slight shift from a fear of consuming poultry to a fear of preparing it (slaughtering it). AI has {{had a profound effect on}} poultry consumption, even outside peak crisis times, more in terms of the quantity consumed (approximately a third less in 2006) than in terms of the number of consumers (6 % less). Blood and internal organs are considered particularly risky, while eggs are viewed as being safer. Poultry from industrial farms is considered to be more risky than poultry from small farms. Purchasing practices have also been affected by AI: in Hanoi, consumers declare that they prefer to buy poultry directly from producers that they know, or from supermarkets in the case of the wealthiest consumers. A high proportion still buy live poultry from market traders, but more consumers now ask sellers to slaughter it for them. With a view to lessening market shocks in the wake of the crisis while maintaining the priority of consumer safety, a number of measures should nevertheless be implemented: Risk communication should not over-emphasize AI as a <b>food-related</b> <b>risk.</b> Reliable safe distribution channels should be promoted (with reliable quality signs and controls) in order to encourage safe production and poultry consumption. Otherwise, a market recovery will only benefit supermarkets and large-scale farmers capable of supplying supermarkets. As numerous live birds are still slaughtered in urban market places, facilities should be provided for safe slaughter. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the provision of a real “cold chain” with a view to promoting the sale of slaughtered poultry...|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to explore}} midwives’ {{perceptions}} of <b>food-related</b> <b>risks</b> and their approaches to Listeria education during pregnancy. Design: an exploratory design within a qualitative framework. Setting: one private and two public hospitals in New South Wales, Australia.

The main education provided was focused only {{on some of the}} high Listeria-risk foods with little education on safe food-handling practices. Midwives’ perception of <b>food-related</b> <b>risks</b> was a function of their limited scientific knowledge and their reliance on their experiential knowledge and their common sense. System constraints such as temporal pressure, limited availability of educational materials and low adherence to Listeria recommendations within the health system were also identified to influence midwives’ practice.

40|$|Although {{the disease}} burden of {{listeriosis}} on population level is low, on individual level {{the impact is}} high, largely due to severe illness and a high case fatality. Identification of risk factors supports and specifies public health actions needed for prevention.

A 2 × 2 between-subjects vignette study was carried out to investigate how food consumers from eight European countries (N = 803) appraised conflicting risk and benefit messages and whether the trustworthiness of a third-party communicator through which a conflicting message is received moderated appraisals of this information. We also investigated whether appraisals were subject to cross-cultural variation based on cultural levels of uncertainty avoidance. Communication of a conflicting message outlining the benefits of red meat led to decreased credibility being attributed to the original risk message compared to when a second confirmatory risk message was communicated. Evaluation of the new information was not impacted by any apparent conflict with the original risk message; however, the third-party communicating the new message did impact the credibility of this new information. These effects were not subject to cultural variation.

40|$|Developing an {{effective}} communication strategy about different food hazards depends {{not only on}} technical risk assessments (for example related to health or the environment) but must also take into account consumer perceptions and preferences. In addition, consumers make decisions about food choices or the acceptability of food processing technologies based on their assessment of both risks and benefi ts, which may include those related to socio-economic or ethical factors. Perceptions and priorities may vary both regionally and within the human life cycle. For example, health is a consumer priority, although the predominant issues of concern vary considerably according to local conditions. In Western and (in some sectors of) emerging economies, obesity continues to represent an important determinant of health. In addition, the ageing population in many countries means that diet {{may be linked to}} the development of healthy ageing trajectories, in particular associated with ensuring optimal quality of life through the entirety of the human life cycle. In other regions food security is a priority. Developing effective risk communication about food safety issues requires understanding of consumer perceptions, needs and behaviours and how these vary between different consumers. Risk (benefi t) communication is likely to be most effective when targeted at specifi c groups of consumers with similar needs and interests. Understanding how individuals differ in, for example, their food safety information needs and preferences, how different individuals process <b>food-related</b> <b>risk</b> (and benefi t) information, and how these may vary according to psychological and other individual differences will help risk communicators in developing and communicating their message...|$|E
40|$|Background: Food-related issues {{remain a}} major public health problem. On one hand, risk hidden in people’s daily dietary {{patterns}} {{has been associated with}} numerous NCDs, especially among socially disadvantaged populations. On the other hand, food safety problems not only cause extensive morbidity and mortality worldwide every year, rapidly developing food technologies and globalization have made food safety more complex. Public exposures of food scandals and the intense media coverage that follows amplifies concerns among the public over food, and consequently results in “irrational” reactions and spoiled the trust over stakeholders in the food chain. Chinese new immigrant parents (CNIPs) are a socially disadvantaged but rapidly increasing segment of the Hong Kong population. They and their family members, especially children, {{are more likely to be}} exposed to food-related risks. However, their food-related concerns and perceptions of risk remain unknown. Aims: 1. To explore CNIPs’ perceptions of risk in their dietary patterns and about food safety; 2. To identify sources of food-related information used by Hong Kong CNIPs and their attitude towards these; 3. To explore the process of decision-making by CNIPs regarding foods and identify important factors that influence food choices for their households. Method: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted among 30 CNIPs who have at last one child aged below 18 years old and who had migrated from Mainland China to Hong Kong in the past 7 years. All interviews were audio taped and transcribed. Both the interviews and the data analysis were conducted following Grounded Theory principles. Result: CNIPs’ perceptions of two types of food-related risks and relevant information from various sources, and the process of how CNIPs made their food choice for their family were described as a result of the data analysis. CNIPs expressed concerns over food-related risks and shared their perceptions of barriers to maintaining what they considered a healthy diet and to avoid food safety risk. Even if they could identify the risks related to their dietary patterns and food safety, because such risks were mostly invisible to the casual observer, most showed low self-efficacy in avoiding food-related risks tending instead to rely on government efforts to control the food-related risks. Participants provided their primary food-related information sources, expressed various levels of trust towards different information sources, and described barriers to information-seeking and the need for a trustworthy authority. The process by which CNIPs’ make food choices for their households emerged, indicating the importance of food planner’s perception of food in influencing the quality of the family diet, and displayed the value negotiation process (sensory perception, convenience, financial costs, health and nutrition considerations, social forms, food quality and other needs) in CNIPs’ food choice. Conclusion: The present study showed <b>food-related</b> <b>risk</b> perception is rooted in sociocultural factors and food modernization. The perceived lack of trustworthy information authorities increased CNIPs’ concerns over food and obstructed their information seeking. In addition, the findings highlighted main family food planners and parents as significant audience for risk communication on food, since they played essentials roles in deciding the diet quality of the entire household. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I study {{a policy}} process that led into a {{possibility}} {{to ban the}} cultivation of GMOs in the member states of the European Union. In practice, this happened by adding a new article to the directive 2001 / 18 /EC. Before the policy process, all the member states were required to allow the cultivation of GMOs that were authorized at the EU level. However, this prior “one-size-fits-all approach” did not work as planned. A number of member states invoked safeguard clauses to prevent the cultivation of the authorized GMO crops, while the pro-GMO countries could not cultivate as great {{of a variety of}} different GMO crops because other countries were blocking the authorization of them. In addition, because of a continuous blocking of new approvals on GMOs, the EU had in place an unofficial de facto moratorium of new GMO approvals which was problematic {{from the point of view}} of the rules of the international trade. In this thesis, I study the legislative process that led into amending the directive 2001 / 18 /EC and to some extent, renationalizing the decision-making on GMO cultivation. The focus is on the roles of the main EU decision-making bodies in the process, namely the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The interest lied in the interplay between the institutions, the expected preferences of them and dynamics within the Council. The analysis is done by using three different approaches. The model used in this thesis regarding the expected preferences of the institutions is based on Mark. A. Pollack’s (2003) perception of the principal-agent analysis in rational choice institutionalism. In addition to this, the Parliament’s environmental ambition is analyzed by using typology developed by Burns and Carter (2010). The strategy used by the “leader” countries within the Council are analyzed by using the classification by Liefferink and Andersen (1998). Key material for this research consists of the official drafting documents of the directive, as well as journalistic reports. The method of the thesis is an intrinsic case study. The case that is studied is the policy process 2010 - 2015 that led to member states’ right to ban the cultivation of GMO crops in their territory. The decision was made under the rules of the co-decision procedure. The analysis revealed a political environment unfavorable to the continuance of the centralized approach. The Commission and the Parliament both acted in a counterintuitive manner throughout the policy process as they are generally believed to be both pro-integration and for maximizing competences, both for themselves and for the Union as a whole. A slightly deeper look into the history of the <b>food-related</b> <b>risk</b> regulation, the prevalent political environment of the time and the policy documents provide a few possible reasons for their actions such as increased Euroscepticism, that has also in the past affected in a similar manner the Commission. In addition, the analysis revealed that the Parliament demonstrated pro-environmental preferences, as it made pro-environmental amendments to the initial proposal for the directive despite many of them being blocked by the two other institutions. Still, the Parliament was able to ‘green’ the proposal, even though the final text was closer to the common position of the Council. Within the Council, a pushing effect of certain “green member states”, especially Austria’s, was prominent...|$|E

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} is {{one more}} of the recent food scares inciting shifts in European food safety governance, away from a predominantly science-based approach towards one involving scientists, policymakers, actors in the food-supply chain and consumers. While these shifts are increasingly receiving scholarly attention, sociological insight into the involvement of consumers and other actors across the multiple levels of today's food safety governance requires further development. This article aims at contributing {{to the understanding of}} consumer perspectives on food safety governance by expounding the results of an explorative research among Dutch consumers, which focused on food risks related to avian influenza. To give ample room for the construction of contextual knowledge, consumers of poultry meat were questioned at various retailers by applying a qualitative interviewing method.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern that {{pressures on the}} global food system present {{a major threat to}} human and environmental health, but that awareness of ecological challenges is not being translated into social and political action of the degree and type needed to address them. This suggests a need to understand how citizens conceptualise and respond to <b>food-related</b> <b>risks</b> and threats in the contexts of their everyday lives where demands on their attention, time and hip-pockets are significant and immediate. It requires that efforts to change individual consumption behaviours are complemented by an understanding of the social and discursive environments in which food meanings and practices are taken up. This paper draws upon emerging research on environmentally sustainable diets, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s recently released National Food Plan, and a variety of literature on the politics of sustainability and media representations of food issues to identify questions for future research in this area.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis was {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the role social media can fulfil for the communication of <b>food-related</b> <b>risks</b> and benefits. Social media is the collective name for a number of online applications, including social networks, video- and picture-sharing websites, blogs, and microblogs, that allow users to generate and share information online. As a consequence users now control how information is found and used instead of the producers. New levels of public engagement have emerged ranging from passive information acquisition through one’s social network to active deliberation with communicators. The research is based on data which were collected through four consecutive studies with qualitative, quantitative and experimental research designs. The outcome indicated that particularly a younger audience appreciates social media to acquire and seek information about food risks and benefits. Social media can act as a complementary information channel, but is not seen as a substitute for traditional or online media. Additionally, actively engaging consumers in discussion about food risks and benefits can lead to better informed consumers. Although the use of social media will not be the answer for all communication difficulties, its advantages such as the accessibility, speed and interaction cannot be ignored to improve food risk and benefit communication...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{information}} landscape, {{there are numerous}} channels for consumers to find information on issues pertaining to food safety. The rise in popularity of social media makes communicators question {{the extent to which}} resources should be allocated to these channels in order to reach new segments or audiences which are hard to reach through more traditional dissemination channels. A segmentation approach was used to identify groups of consumers based on their inclination to use different channels to seek information about <b>food-related</b> <b>risks,</b> including traditional media, online media and social media. In the wake of the 2011 Escherichia coli contamination crisis, the study focused on a bacterial contamination of fresh vegetables. Results were obtained through an online survey among 1264 participants from eight European countries in September 2012. Four segments were identified: ‘a high cross-channel inclination’ (24 %), ‘an established channel inclination’ (31 %), ‘a moderate cross-channel inclination’ (26 %) and ‘a low cross-channel inclination’ (19 %). Results show that social media can act as a complementary information channel for a particular segment, but {{that it is not a}} substitute for traditional or online media. Individuals who showed an inclination to use social media in conjunction with other channels considered it more important to be well informed, were more motivated to find additional information, were more sensitive to risks in general and perceived the likelihood of a food incident in the future to be larger. The ‘high cross-channel inclination’ segment contained relatively younger and more Southern European participants...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} food {{security}} applies in both poor and rich societies and concerns the steady availability {{of food in}} the right quantity and quality, at the right price. Globally, policies to assure it remain confused and world food prices are rising. Despite large exports of fish, Iceland produces only around half of its inhabitants’ nutritional needs and relies significantly on imports, also for food production inputs like fodder and seeds. Icelandic supplies are affected by oligopoly in the retail market, and could be put at risk by events in other security dimensions ranging from natural disasters and infrastructure failures to terrorism, neighbouring conflicts and other people’s shortages. Icelandic farmers have used the terminology of ‘food security’ to press their claims for more home-grown production, and more recently also in their campaign against EU membership. The general public however shows little sign of security-awareness in this field. The government possesses suitable non-military security frameworks to address <b>food-related</b> <b>risks</b> and has initiated useful, general and specific, studies. Yet it has not developed a strategy or contingency plan for food security, even following {{the lessons of the}} 2008 economic crash and 2010 - 2011 eruptions.

Precautionary action points are prioritized with adaptive conjoint analysis. In the risk assessment framework, case studies are used to quantify the size of losses. Additionally, throughout the paper, expert consultation has been an important source of information. Results show that perils and losses of product recall need to be strictly defined, preferably on a case-by-case basis. Also, case studies show that recall losses easily cumulate as losses are yet between Euro 210, 000 and Euro 2, 300, 000 for {{only a limited number of}} recall expenses and contaminated products. Furthermore, in relation to the third-party verifiability of due diligence, difficulties are encountered at the farm level. We conclude that, if risks are properly defined and insurance schemes incorporate adequate due diligence and disclosure incentives for all chain participants, product recall remains an insurable type of risk, even if the number of recalls will further increase...|$|R

This is accompanied by frequent spraying of crops with chemicals for protection against pests and diseases. While the health and environmental impacts of pesticides and their residues are debated among scientific experts, in the minds of European citizens they constitute the most significant food risk. The Eurobarometer public opinion survey on Food-Related Risks commissioned by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2010 looked at risk perceptions in two ways. First, an open-ended question which invited respondents to say ‘what comes to mind when they think about possible problems and risks associated with food and eating’, and second a closed question asked respondents to rate {{the extent to which they}} worry about 17 <b>food-related</b> <b>risks,</b> including pesticides in fruit and vegetables (EFSA, 2010). The most frequent response to the open question was ‘chemicals and pesticides’, mentioned spontaneously by 17 % of Europeans – 7 % mentioned genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In the closed question 74 % of Europeans say they are fairly or very worried about pesticides in fruit and vegetables – the highest percentage of worry across 17 food risks. Sixty-seven per cent say they are fairly or very worried about GMOs. The 2010 survey replicated a number of questions from EFSA’s first Risk Issues Eurobarometer in 2005 (EFSA, 2005). The findings on worry about pesticides in fruit and vegetables show an increase of 4 % over the period – 12 countries show a 4 % or more increase in worry, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, The Netherlands and Sweden. Overall, it appears that pesticides in fruit and vegetables are not only the top concern among Europeans, but also an increasing concern...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{a model of}} food safety {{regulation}} that considers the employment of a differentiated food market with two types of government certified quality standards: a minimum standard and a higher one. Individuals, heterogeneous in their susceptibility to <b>food-related</b> health <b>risks,</b> choose which safety-grade of food to consume based on price and their vulnerability. The model is then extended to the case where consumers misperceive their susceptibility to health risks associated with food consumption. The theoretical presentation is followed by an application of the model to examine campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis caused by consumption of beef, pork, and chicken. The paper demonstrates that the benefits from multiple quality standards hinges fundamentally {{on the distribution of}} vulnerabilities across the population and the associated distribution of population health risks for a given level of food quality. Uniform standards are generally preferred to differentiated ones under either stringent or lax regulations on population health risk. If the population distribution of vulnerabilities is unimodal and consumers misperceive their vulnerability, the value of a differentiated policy will depend on which quality standard is attracting the majority of consumers. The empirical results confirm the importance of the population distribution of vulnerability on the relative desirability of single versus multiple quality standards. ...|$|R
40|$|The SEIFA {{index of}} {{relative}} disadvantage is an area-based index. It takes {{into consideration the}} environmental conditions {{as well as a}} range of population characteristics (socioeconomic resources, occupation and education) for those living in a defined geographical area. The main purpose of this analysis was to identify the characteristics that are likely to increase the risk of poor nutritional status in vulnerable groups in Australia (1) (2). SEIFA was chosen as a proxy indicator for vulnerable groups, to provide a dataset sufficiently large for reliable comparisons of sub-groups to be made. The 1995 National Nutrition Survey (NNS) was conducted on a sub-sample of respondents to the 1995 National Health Survey, and included demographic characteristics, health risk factors and food and nutrient intake (3). In this examination of the NNS data, the results for adults (16 years of age and over) in the most disadvantaged areas across Australia (first quintile of SEIFA; n = 2052) were compared to results for adults in the other areas of SEIFA (2 nd– 5 th quintiles of SEIFA; n = 9203). Persons living in the areas of most disadvantage had lower levels of the entitlements which are known to affect food access and the ability to purchase basic necessities of food and beverages (lower proportions of employment, lower levels of education and lower income). These areas also had a higher proportions of adults reporting poor general health factors and <b>food-related</b> health <b>risk</b> factors (fair or poor health status, no exercise, more medication, more mouth-teeth-swallowing problems, more smoking). A higher proportion of persons were underweight or obese in each adult age group...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{considered}} to be a significant influence for infectious disease risk in Western Europe. Climatic and non-climatic developments act together resulting in current and future infectious disease risk. This study uses a survey to explore Dutch expert perspectives on climate change induced infectious disease risk. The results show that the experts consider temperature change, precipitation change, humidity change, and climate change induced habitat change to be relatively important for water-related infectious disease risk, vector-borne disease risk excluding zoonoses, and the risk of zoonoses. The climatic drivers are seen as relatively less important for <b>food-related</b> infectious disease <b>risk.</b> The experts rate many non-climatic drivers to be highly important for infectious disease risk. Comparatively, the majority of the non-climatic drivers assessed are seen as more important than climate change drivers. The degree of uncertainty in the future development of climatic drivers is viewed as moderate to high, and for non-climatic drivers mostly as moderate. An analysis of subsamples based on professional backgrounds reveals differences in experts’ opinions for e. g., socio-cultural drivers, and similarities. Diversity and consensus amongst expert perspectives on climate change and infectious diseases can have implications for policy. Further research to uncover and compare prevailing perspectives is necessary...|$|R
40|$|During the 1990 s, many European {{countries}} faced one or {{more food}} crises, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), E. coli, dioxin residues, and foot-and-mouth disease. These crises were marked by a growing public recognition of <b>food-related</b> <b>risks</b> and {{the changing nature of}} these risks, and tended to undermine citizen-consumer trust in the practices and institutions that managed food safety. To restore and retain trust in food throughout Europe, the European food policy framework was substantially renewed {{at the turn of the}} century. Conventional food governance was the domain of scientific experts, state agents and actors higher in the food supply chain, who decided on policy measures based on scientific data, and subsequently conveyed them to the general public. In the renewed framework for governing food, other social actors, including (individual and organised) citizen-consumers, were to be more actively involved through innovative roles. While this innovative position for citizen-consumers represents a definite discursive shift, it remains rather elusive how citizen-consumers should be included in food risk governance practices, and what effects such inclusion has on consumer trust. This study aims to further the understanding of whether and how citizen-consumer involvement in European food risk governance (re) establishes trust in the handling of food risks. It investigates consumer involvement within the conventional policy institutions (at the EU and Member State levels), as well as outside of these institutions (at shopping floors and in mass-media). The study focuses empirically on a major risk to Europe that emerged after the renewed policy framework had largely been implemented: highly pathogenic avian influenza H 5 N 1. In August 2005, this avian influenza virus strain entered European public arenas as the next food and agricultural risk. As the virus was detected close to Europe, questions arose whether measures were required to protect human health and secure European food supply. Chapter 2 analyses the public debates on the characteristics of the risk and on the interventions needed. The mass media in two EU Member States, the UK and the Netherlands, were studied for this purpose. With the help of qualitative analysis the debates were analysed as they unfolded in selected national newspapers. Arguing that risks are socially mediated realities, this chapter discusses how struggles on risk definitions relate to different policy decisions. Moreover, it analyses how these political dynamics are informed by the involvement of state, market, science, and civil society actors, and discerns their implications for the functioning of the EU food governance framework. Chapter 3 explores consumer perspectives on food safety governance by expounding the results of an explorative study among Dutch consumers. Moving away from the ‘knowledge deficit’ model, which entails that consumers should be better educated to avoid ‘irrational’ responses, we investigate what consumers consider at the place and time they actually have to deal with food risks. To give ample room for the construction of contextual knowledge, consumers of poultry meat were questioned at various retailers by applying a qualitative interviewing method. From this research, it is concluded that multiple consumer rationalities about food safety governance exist. As a consequence of the existence of these multiple consumer rationalities, a differentiated governance approach to restore or retain consumer confidence is more likely to be pertinent than a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. Chapter 4 starts from the observation that, irrespective of the major food crises that occurred during the 2000 s, consumer trust in food seems to remain high in Western Europe. Information provision to consumers on food risks is a central strategy of the EU, its Member States and private food providers to build food trust among consumers. But can the interpretation of such information by consumers explain these high levels of trust? Following recent outbreaks of avian influenza in the UK, this paper investigates the constitution of food trust among UK poultry consumers by focusing on the place where relevant consumer decisions are made: the shopping floor. In-store qualitative interviews with consumers of a variety of poultry products at different shops are used to reveal the role of information in constructing trust. It is concluded that besides on knowledge inducted from information provided, trust depends as much on consumer strategies to handle non-knowing of food risks. Three main forms of trust relations are distinguished, which together result in high levels of consumer trust at a system level. Chapter 5 studies the institutional incorporation of social interests and values in EU and Member State food risk governance. The study is based on qualitative analyses of key official publications and press releases from Member State and EU level bodies, as well as from scientists, NGOs and food supply chain actors. These analyses are combined with 40 in-depth interviews with relevant food system actors. The chapter reviews how and which social interests and values are incorporated in food risk governance in the Netherlands, France and the UK, and at the EU level. It concludes that predominantly through state-level political (and to a lesser extent: scientific) domains social interests and values were articulated on the EU agenda, while at the EU level food risk governance remained principally justified on the basis of scientific evidence. The chapter finishes with discerning the effects of this inclusion of social interest and values on public trust and the functioning of the internal market. The sixth and final chapter draws conclusions on the changing positions of, and relations between, scientists, policy makers, market actors and citizen-consumers. First, while natural scientists have lost their position as the a priori trustworthy source of risk information, they still maintain a central position in legitimating risk definitions. Yet, in this position scientists have become more transparent than in the past concerning their internal disagreements, and are (more overtly) incorporating wider social, economic and political arguments in their policy advice. Herewith, these scientists become more susceptible to public contestation, and risk assessment opens up for non-scientific actors aiming to publicly legitimate their own perspectives. In essence, this changing public character of risk assessments entails the conflation of two previously segregated risk governance phases: those of risk assessment and communication. With such communication, citizen-consumers are ‘invited’ or even ‘forced’ to conduct micro-level assessments and judgements of conflicting risk characterisations. Second, due to the dissolution of science as the uncontested source of risk characterisation, risk managers can no longer assume that they can legitimate their decisions by referring to scientific risk assessments, and the cost-benefit analyses based on them. Instead, policy makers are urged to base decisions also (more explicitly) on wider social interests and values and legitimate their handling of risks in view of scientific non-knowing. This is especially the case when risk knowledge bases are subject to public contestation, and when wider social perspectives on the appropriateness of different risk governance options diverge. In such situations, different risk perspectives may become dominant in different countries, as risks are mediated through different culturally-embedded and socially contextualised sense-making frames. Due to this differentiation, European Member States (re-) emerge as pivotal governance actors: while EU level food risk governance remains grounded in scientific-rational and technically-based justification which safeguards a minimum level of European policy harmonisation, more room has to be opened for the Member States to incorporate country-specific social interests and values in their decisions. Third, the possibilities for Member States to differentiate from a harmonised European food risk governance arrangement entailed increased room for private actors to become—legitimately—involved. By refusing to retail products whose characteristics were co-determined by Member State-specific measures, supermarkets became strongly involved in food risk governance—and were decisive in the success of such measures. Supermarkets legitimated their involvement with the argument of retaining their consumers’ trust in food. Fourth, citizen-consumers take on roles as micro-level assessors of conflicting risk characterisations, which ‘materialises’ in consumers’ co-governance of food risks through their consumption practices. With such consumer co-governance, consumption turns political, marking a partial shift of risk management practices towards places where consumers stand in ‘direct’ relation to the risk governors in the food supply and management systems: the shopping floors. On shopping floors, consumers differ in their perspectives on risks and on how to govern these. Hence, providing room for Member State-based differentiation in risk management does not necessarily mean one addresses all consumer rationalities, as for groups of consumers such management decisions may lack congruence with their perspectives and concerns. Moreover, political and policy institutions encounter difficulties to address in their risk management decisions the socio-contextual embeddedness of consumers, consumption practices and trust. Significant groups of consumers do not regard themselves merely as passive recipients of food products, information flows and governance outcomes. They are self-defined co-governors of the safety of food through their acts of buying food and relating to the relevant actor networks. Within these relations and co-constructions consumer trust is being built. As such, European and national policy institutions may contribute to the make-up of the constraining and enabling environment of the shopping floor, but these institutions cannot fully construct and determine consumer trust. Hence, we observed an increased involvement of (interests and values of) citizen-consumer in institutional risk assessment and management practices—particularly through Member State-level political domains. At the same time, risk assessment and management dynamics shift for an important part to contexts and practices outside of conventional, political and policy institutions: to the mass-media and shopping floors. Besides policy challenges, these dynamics entail opportunities for improving the European food risk governance process, which are set out in policy recommendations for different groups of governance actors. The study finishes with making some recommendations for further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new antimicrobial active packaging systems have been gaining a raising interest due to its potential to increase product shelf-life and provide food quality and safety benefits allied to society demands on <b>food-related</b> health <b>risks,</b> multi-drug resistance and environmental problems. A great variety of organic substances such as phenolic compounds and essential oils as well as inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles such as Ag+, ZnO and TiO 2 have been intensively studied for having antimicrobial properties, although their efficiency is highly dependent on the target microorganisms, the material or media where they act {{as well as the}} surrounding environment are relevant (Burt, 2004; Suppakul et al., 2003; Visai et al., 2011). Recent research in active packaging is mostly focused on the use of natural renewable material resources including preservatives to develop biodegradable and recyclable packaging products. Accordingly, the NEWGENPAK project was funded within ITN-Marie Skłodowska-Curie EU program with the aim “to take wood cellulose based material a significant step forward by replacing petroleum-based additives used in paper and board packaging materials in order to achieve the barrier and other crucial properties needed for competitive, low carbon footprint, packaging materials”. NEWGENPAK, the acronym for New Generation of Cellulose Fibre Based Packaging Materials for Sustainability, just finished in December 2015, was an interdisciplinary research training network (ITN) constituted by 8 European universities, 3 research institutes and 6 enterprises from all over Europe, with 13 researchers working full time developing their own individual researcher projects, making collaborations and receiving training on the field. This PhD thesis was carried out within this project and developed mainly at Innovhub SSI – Paper Division, Milan, Italy. The main target of this work was to attain antibacterial cellulose-based materials for food packaging applications, following two approaches based in the incorporation of active organic components or active nanoparticles as active agents. Besides, it was studied the possibility to develop an antibacterial packaging for medical applications, in order to prevent medical cross contamination. The fate of the nanoparticles in the recycling process and their effect on the biodegradability of the packaging was initially assessed as an important part of environmental aspects related to the end of life of packaging products. The first approach, described in the chapter 2, aimed to explore the possibilities to extract polyphenols from black tea brewing residues and use them as active compounds for the {{development of}} active cellulosic-based surfaces. Therefore, the chemical characterization of black tea residues as well as the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of their extracts were addressed. The best infusion conditions, considering the yield of extraction, the antioxidant activity and the total phenolic content, were found to be at 80 ºC for 7. 5 minutes for an infusion of 2. 5 g of tea residue in 100 mL of water, and just 1. 1 mg of these extract where enough to provide a bactericidal effect. The resulting paper coated with 3. 8 g/m 2 of polyphenols-based coating formulation attained a complete killing effect against S. aureus. In the second approach, several papers were functionalized with formulations based on photo-active TiO 2 NPs by dip-coating and compared regarding their antibacterial activity. The results presented in the chapter 3 have shown that both handsheets of bleached Kraft pulp (BK) and chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) displayed a bactericidal effect against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, even after three weeks of storage either in light and dark conditions, while pre-coated recycled paper (PCR) and bleached pre-coated Kraft (BPK) paper samples did not shown any antibacterial activity. The effect of TiO 2 NPs against S. aureus was inhibited in: i) PCR samples due to the presence of considerable amounts of inorganic compounds, such as calcium carbonate, that shielded the effect of active nanoparticles; and ii) BPK samples, most likely due to their high hydrophobicity that did not permit a good retention of the NPs and homogenous coating distribution. Accordingly, different preparation methods and deposition techniques were considered for hydrophobic surfaces and compared regarding the amount of TiO 2 incorporated in nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) loaded and finally retained on the BPK paper surfaces. Under the best conditions with the polyelectrolyte-assisted deposition 90 % of nanoparticles retention was attained against only 25 % for the direct-mixture formulations. The antibacterial activity of the paper samples reached approximately 2 log bacterial reduction of S. aureus showing the possibility to achieve a contact active surface based on layer-by layer assembly NFC-TiO 2 formulation. Moreover a scale-up pilot demonstration of an over-print varnish based on ZnO nanoparticles was performed to be loaded by flexographic printing at industrial scale for medical packaging applications. The SAFEBOX packaging demonstrator produced was loaded with only 5. 6 mg/m 2 of ZnO NPs based varnish, due to some technical production constraints and restrictions, therefore it presented a slightly bacteriostatic effect with less than one log reduction. However, with the possibility {{to increase the amount of}} NPs loaded on the paper surface, promising results can be achieved. Preliminary results obtained at lab scale showed a bactericidal effect, up to 4 log reduction, for papers with about 1, 5 g/m 2 of ZnO NPs on the surface. Regarding the preliminary studies on environmental impact of NPs, towards packaging end-of-life options presented also in the chapter 3, laboratory tests have shown only marginal effect of active ingredients on biodegradability performance whereas recyclability tests have shown a reasonable good retention of TiO 2 nanoparticles (approximately 90 %) in the recycled fibres after one recycling loop...|$|R
