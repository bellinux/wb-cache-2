50|$|The {{chemical}} composition of upconverting nanoparticles, UCNPs, directly influences their conversion efficiency and spectral characteristics. Primarily, three compositional parameters influence the particles’ performance: the <b>host</b> <b>lattice,</b> activator ions, and sensitizer ions.The <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> provides structure {{for both the}} activator and sensitizer ions and acts as a medium which conducts energy transfer. This <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> has to satisfy three requirements: low lattice phonon energies, high chemical stability, and low symmetry of the lattice. The major mechanism responsible for reduced upconversion is nonradiative phonon relaxation. Generally, if large numbers of phonons are needed to convert excitation energy into phonon energy, {{the efficiency of the}} nonradiative process is lowered. Low phonon energies in the <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> prevent this loss, improving conversion efficiency of incorporated activator ions. The lattice must also be stable under chemical and photochemical conditions, as these are the environments the conversion will take place within. Finally, this <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> ought to have low symmetry, allowing for slight relaxation of the Laporte selection rules. The normally forbidden transitions lead to an increase in the f-f intermixing and thus enhancement of the upconversion efficiency.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presence}} of second phase particles often causes lattice distortions. These lattice distortions result when the precipitate particles differ {{in size and}} crystallographic structure from the host atoms. Smaller precipitate particles in a <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> leads to a tensile stress, whereas larger precipitate particles leads to a compressive stress. Dislocation defects also create a stress field. Above the dislocation there is a compressive stress and below there is a tensile stress. Consequently, there is a negative interaction energy between a dislocation and a precipitate that each respectively cause a compressive and a tensile stress or vice versa. In other words, the dislocation will be attracted to the precipitate. In addition, {{there is a positive}} interaction energy between a dislocation and a precipitate that have the same type of stress field.

40|$|The {{upconversion}} {{quantum yield}} (UCQY) {{is one of}} the most significant parameters for upconverter materials. A high UCQY is essential for a succesful integration of upconversion in many applications, such as harvesting of the solar radiation. However, little is known about which doping level of the rare-earth ions yields the highest UCQY in the different <b>host</b> <b>lattices</b> and what are the underlying causes. Here, we investigate which Er 3 + doping yields the highest UCQY in the <b>host</b> <b>lattices</b> β-NaYF 4 and Gd 2 O 2 S under 4 I 15 / 2 → 4 I 13 / 2 excitation. We show for both <b>host</b> <b>lattices</b> that the optimum Er 3 + doping is not fixed and it actually decreases as the irradiance of the excitation increases. To find the optimum Er 3 + doping for a given irradiance, we determined the peak position of the internal UCQY as a function of the average Er−Er distance. For this purpose, we used a fit on experimental data, where the average Er−Er distance was calculated from the Er 3 + doping of the upconverter samples and the lattice parameters of the host materials. We observe optimum average Er−Er distances for the <b>host</b> <b>lattices</b> β-NaYF 4 and Gd 2 O 2 S with differences < 14 % at the same irradiance levels, whereas the optimum Er 3 + doping are around 2 × higher for β-NaYF 4 than for Gd 2 O 2 S. Estimations by extrapolation to higher irradiances indicate that the optimum average Er−Er distance converges to values around 0. 88 and 0. 83 nm for β-NaYF 4 and Gd 2 O 2 S, respectively. Our findings point to a fundamental relationship and focusing on the average distance between the active rare-earth ions might be a very efficient way to optimize the doping of rare-earth ions with regard to the highest achievable UCQY...|$|R

50|$|Other {{considerations}} {{about the}} <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> include choice of cation and anions. Importantly,  cations should have similar radii to the intended dopant ions: For example, when using lanthanide dopant ions, certain alkaline-earth (Ca2+), rare-earth (Y+), and transition-metal ions (Zr4+) all fulfill this requirement, {{as well as}} Na+.  Similarly, the choice of anion is important as it significantly affects the phonon energies and chemical stability.  Heavy halides like Cl− and Br− have the lowest phonon energies {{and so are the}} least likely to promote nonradiative decay pathways. However, these compounds are generally hygroscopic and thus not suitably stable.  Oxides on the other hand can be quite stable but have high phonon energies.  Fluorides provide a balance between the two, having both stability and suitably low phonon energies.  As such, it is evident why {{some of the most popular}} and efficient UCNP compositions are NaYF4:Yb/Er and NaYF4:Yb/Tm.|$|E
5000|$|Efficiency of UCNPs doped {{with only}} {{activators}} is usually low, {{due to their}} low absorption cross section and necessary low concentration. Sensitizer ions are doped into the <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> along with the activator ions in UCNPs to facilitate Electron Transfer Upconversion. The most commonly used sensitizer ion is trivalent Yb3+. This ion provides a much larger absorption cross-section for incoming near-IR radiation, while only displaying a single excited 4f state. And since the energy gap between the ground level and this excited state matches well with the [...] "ladder" [...] gaps in the common activator ions, resonant energy transfers between the two dopant types. [...] Typical UCNPs are doped with approximately 20 mol% sensitizer ions and less than 2 mol% activator ions. These concentrations allow adequate distance between activators, avoiding cross-relaxation, and still absorb enough excitation radiation through the sensitizers to be efficient.  Currently, other types of sensitizers are being developed to increase the spectral range available for upconversion, such as semi-conductor nanocrystal-organic ligand hybrids.|$|E
50|$|A {{good match}} between the {{chromophore}} and the <b>host</b> <b>lattice</b> {{leads to a}} uniform environment for all the chromophores and hence greatly reduces the inhomogeneous broadening of the electronic transition's pure electronic and vibronic lines. In addition to the weak inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions, the quasi-lines observed at very low temperatures are phonon-less transitions. Since phonons originate in the lattice, an additional requirement is weak chromophore-lattice coupling. Weak coupling increases the probability of phonon-less transitions and hence favors the narrow zero phonon lines. The weak coupling is usually {{expressed in terms of}} the Debye-Waller factor, where a maximum value of one indicates no coupling between the chromophore and the lattice phonons. The narrow lines characteristic of the Shpolskii systems are only observed at cryogenic temperatures because at higher temperatures many phonons are active in the lattice and all of the amplitude of the transition shifts to the broad phonon sideband. The original observation of the Shpolskii effect was made at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 kelvins), but using temperatures close to that of liquid helium (4.2 K) yields much sharper spectral lines and is the usual practice.|$|E

5000|$|It is a dopant in {{some types}} of glass in lasers and other {{optoelectronic}} devices. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors.

5000|$|Photon {{upconversion}} {{belongs to}} a larger class of processes by which light incident on a material induces anti-Stokes emission. Multiple quanta of energy such as photons or phonons are absorbed, and a single photon with the summed energy is emitted. It is important to make the distinction between photon upconversion, where real metastable excited states allow for sequential absorption, and other nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation or two-photon excited fluorescence which involve virtual intermediate states such as the [...] "simultaneous" [...] absorption {{of two or more}} photons. It is also distinct from more weakly anti-Stokes processes like thermoluminescence or anti-Stokes Raman emission, which are due to initial thermal population of low-lying excited states and consequently show emission energies only a few kBT above the excitation. Photon upconversion is distinctly characterized by emission-excitation differences of 10-100 kBT.Photon upconversion relies on metastable states to facilitate sequential energy absorption. Therefore, a necessary condition for upconverting systems is the existence of optically active long-lived excited states. This role is traditionally filled by lanthanide metal ions embedded in an insulating <b>host</b> <b>lattice.</b> Generally in the +3 oxidation state, these ions have 4fn electronic configurations and typically exhibit f-f transitions. These 4f orbitals allow for complex electronic structures and a large number of possible electronic excited states with similar energies. When embedded in bulk crystals or nanostructures, the energies of these excited states will further split under crystal field, generating a series of states with many closely spaced energies (Figure 1). The 4f shell is localized near the core of the ion and is therefore non-bonding, while the 5s and 5p shells provide further shielding from the exterior crystal field. Thus, the coupling of electronic excited states to the surrounding lattice is weak, leading to long excited state lifetimes and sharp optical lineshapes.|$|E
