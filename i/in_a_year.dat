5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> The ratio of actual productivity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E
