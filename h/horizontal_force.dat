5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with <b>horizontal</b> <b>force.</b> For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A <b>horizontal</b> <b>force</b> pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

The inward compression of the dam by the water reduces the lateral (<b>horizontal)</b> <b>force</b> acting on the dam. Thus, the gravitation force required by the dam is lessened, i.e. the dam {{does not need to}} be so massive. This enables thinner dams and saves resources.|$|E

The writer extended the same thema to two-storied frames in this paper, and obtained the results as follows. 1) The distribution of external <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces</b> among the bracings in to-storied braced-frames shows approximately a certain serial decrease, which is less than that of in one-storied braced-frames, according to distance from the external <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces.</b> 2) The distribution of external <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces</b> applied only on the bracings of 2 -nd storey approaches uniform more than that applied only 1 -st storey. 3) If the strength of the bracings of 2 -nd storey will be less than that of 1 -st storey, the distribution of external <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces</b> applied only on the bracings of 2 -nd storey approaches uniform more than that in one-storied braced-frames, but the opposite results are obtained in the case applied only on the bracings of 1 -st storey...|$|R

500|$|Dynamic {{equilibrium}} {{was first}} described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic. Galileo realized that simple velocity addition {{demands that the}} concept of an [...] "absolute rest frame" [...] did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a [...] "natural state" [...] of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls {{at the foot of the}} mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward <b>horizontal</b> <b>force</b> being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.|$|E

The effects of changing both the speed and the pattern of locomotion under three different gravity conditions were investigated. As gravity level increased, vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces</b> significantly declined; similarities were noted across gravity levels, however, with respect to locomotion speed and pattern changes, where increasing speed enhanced both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces.</b> With decreasing gravity, the ratio of <b>horizontal</b> to vertical <b>forces</b> increased significantly...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>horizontal</b> ground <b>forces</b> {{are only}} ~ 15 % of {{vertical}} forces, {{they account for}} 47 % and 33 % of the metabolic cost in walking and running. To explain these disproportionately high metabolic costs we hypothesized that low <b>horizontal</b> ground <b>forces</b> generate relatively high torques on body segments during locomotion and this is mediated by long moment arms. We compared external force moment arms and discreet torques applied to the body segments by <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>forces</b> during walking and running. Sixteen subjects (21. 9 ± 1. 9 years) walked at 1. 5 m/s and 10 subjects (23. 2 ± 2. 0 years) ran at 3. 83 m/s. Segmental torques in the sagittal plane were partitioned into components due to <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>forces</b> and quantified by their angular impulses. The mean (±S. E.) ratios of horizontal to vertical ground forces (GF ratio) and angular impulses (AI ratio) in walking were 0. 131 (± 0. 003, 95 % C. I. 0. 124 to 0. 137) and 0. 530 (± 0. 018, C. I. 0. 497 to 0. 569). Results were similar in running. In both gaits the AI ratios were significantly greater than the GF ratios because the respective C. I. s did not overlap. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces</b> produced 53 % and 41 % as much angular impulse on the body segments as did the vertical forces in walking and running despite being only 13 % as large. In the two movements the moment arms for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces</b> averaged across foot, leg, thigh, and trunk body segments were 3. 8 fold larger than those for the vertical forces. The data supported the hypothesis and suggest that the relatively low <b>horizontal</b> vs vertical <b>forces</b> accounted for a disproportionately higher percentage of the angular impulses placed on the body segments and this effect was due to relatively long moment arms for <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces.</b> These results partially explain the relatively large metabolic cost of generating relatively low <b>horizontal</b> <b>forces.</b> Originally published Journal of Biomechanics, Vol. 41, No. 8, 200...|$|R
