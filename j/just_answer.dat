60|$|BILLY. [Ignoring {{the appeal}} and {{pressing}} home the point.] The thing is, {{do you want}} to marry me? [He looks at his watch.] <b>Just</b> <b>answer</b> that.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right. Never {{mind about}} being careful, then. <b>Just</b> <b>answer</b> me that question. Why, if I had not your {{interests}} sincerely at heart, should I have ticked you off, as stated?" ...|$|E
60|$|Do come, if you {{possibly}} can!--and remember and don't forget to avoid letting Mrs. Clemens find out I lost her letter. <b>Just</b> <b>answer</b> {{her the same}} {{as if you had}} got it.|$|E
6000|$|... "She <b>just</b> <b>answered</b> in that dreamy {{way when}} he spoke to her. He says he thinks it is as Mr. Ward believes, and that she will soon come to herself. He is quite able to consider--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert, {{who gave}} {{positive}} reviews {{to the previous}} films, gave an unfavorable review of the film, writing, [...] "I admire the craft involved, but the movie leaves me profoundly indifferent. After three earlier movies in the series, which have been transmuted into video games, {{why do we need}} a fourth one? Oh. I <b>just</b> <b>answered</b> my own question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{we are at}} work at a distance, {{dinner is}} brought out, {{and there is an}} hour and a half of rest; and on Sunday we may walk about the yards. You should have seen one of our gang, when I got him to look at the chevaux de frise round a bud, how he owned it was a regular patent invention; it <b>just</b> <b>answered</b> to Paley's illustration.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{were not}} sure {{that you are in}} earnest--!" [...] he began. [...] "However, I will <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> your question. Nothing of the sort is possible. Besides, people don't come to Monte Carlo for serious affairs, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "I {{will make}} a bargain with you. You shall have the free run of all my lands {{for as long as}} you like, and in return you shall <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> me one question." ...|$|E
6000|$|BILLY. [Most irascibly.] Darn isn't swearing. [Plaintively.] That's the way {{you always}} put me off. I didn't {{come all the way}} here for a train. I came for you. Now <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> me one thing. Do you want to marry me? ...|$|E
6000|$|A list of his {{directions}} {{has been}} drawn, [...] And feeling somewhat more at mental ease [...] He asks Sir Walter {{if he has}} long to live. [...] Farquhar <b>just</b> <b>answered,</b> in a soothing tone, [...] That hope still frailly breathed recovery. [...] At this my dear friend smiled and shook his head, [...] As if to say: [...] "I can translate your words, [...] But I reproach not friendship's lullabies." ...|$|R
50|$|Wood {{pointed out}} that his testing {{techniques}} {{of the use of}} multiple-choice answers provided a scientific way of measuring a person's intelligence. He claimed that his testing techniques were all embracing - the individualized field multiple choice tests covered all aspects of the subject given in college. This then made it a fairer way of seeing what the student learned from the course than <b>just</b> <b>answering</b> a specific question or fill in the blank questions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet I {{shall not}} sleep, I shall know no rest, no peace {{until you have}} given me an <b>answer.</b> <b>Just</b> an <b>answer</b> is all I ask. I will set a curb upon my impatience afterwards, and go through my period of ah--probation without murmuring. Say that you, will marry me in six months' time--at Easter, say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I should hope not," [...] she enjoined severely. [...] "Besides, as {{a matter}} of fact, Letitia is engaged. Her young man is staying at Mandeleys now. <b>Just</b> <b>answer</b> me one question, David--why did you refuse that {{invitation}} to dinner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us sit down, Dorian," [...] {{said the}} painter, looking troubled. [...] "Let us sit down. And <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> me one question. Have you {{noticed in the}} picture {{something}} curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is," [...] the man answered, [...] "and if I were you, miss, I wouldn't do {{much more}} than <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> her {{questions}} and skedaddle. I haven't had any conversation with her myself, but mademoiselle says she's more than a bit off it this morning. Slept badly or something." ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{proposed}} prologue {{or perhaps}} epilogue of Bayes’ play features the characters Thunder and Lightning, who threaten the audience. The prologue is ludicrous and Smith once again questions Bayes about what's happening. Bayes defends {{himself and the}} play by stating {{that it is a}} [...] "new way of writing.” Because at first he doesn't understand that Smith is criticising, Bayes <b>just</b> <b>answers</b> all the questions as if they were purely academic queries and not patronising questions.|$|R
5000|$|Elizabeth's parents {{employed}} a French instructor {{for her when}} she was five years old. Five weeks later, she was speaking fluently. After excelling in French, she insisted on learning Spanish, Italian, Latin, Hebrew, and Transylvanian on her own, without an instructor. Later on at the age of ten, she also helped exonerate a woman accused of witchcraft after noticing that the accused woman was <b>just</b> <b>answering</b> [...] "yes" [...] to every question she was asked, without thinking about what she was admitting to.|$|R
40|$|Who rules? ¿Fate, or chance? Why the Being, and not, rather, the Nothing? Fake question, <b>just</b> <b>answered</b> by God. Calculus thinking. How is {{possible}} think the nihilismus? Is this the last what for? For Kafka, writing is get back not to prehuman nature, but to mankind in statu nascendi. For Nietzsche, {{be a human}} being is {{want to be the}} dark side of human. For Heidegger, the human is the poem, the fall of the promise that rules the world: everything will be meaningful...|$|R
6000|$|... "What of it?" [...] the man repeated. [...] "You lend them youngsters {{money and}} then you come to me, a man who's been on this land for twenty-two years, and you've nothing to say but 'get out!' Where am I to find another farm at my time of life? <b>Just</b> <b>answer</b> me that, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Thady {{walked on}} fast, {{but did not}} answer him, and Reynolds continued--"Come, Mr. Thady, I don't intend to anger you, or affront you; and av I've said {{anything}} that way, I axes your pardon; but <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> me--will you come down there only for once, av it wor only becase you swore it afore them all on the holy cross?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Harriet could <b>just</b> <b>answer,</b> [...] "Oh! dear, yes," [...] {{before the}} gentleman joined them. The wants and sufferings {{of the poor}} family, however, were the first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit he would now defer; {{but they had a}} very {{interesting}} parley about what could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was much}} {{laughter}} {{in the courtroom}} when Cameron began questioning a witness demanding to know why [...] "John Downey" [...] had <b>just</b> <b>answered</b> {{that he had never}} known Whelan, nor lived in Montreal as it was widely known was true. The witness whispered to the judge, who informed counsel that the man called to the witness stand was named John O'Donnell, causing Cameron to mutter [...] "Oh...then you may go down" [...] and excusing him from the court while the actual John Downey was found and sworn in.|$|R
5000|$|There used to {{be posted}} armed guards (also Polistas) at the {{outskirts}} of every poblacion and when challenged by the guards at night, the couriers <b>just</b> <b>answered</b> aloud the word [...] "Badageros" [...] and the guards {{would allow them to}} pass. Upon delivery of the letter of communication at the next tribunal, the recipient was required to sign on a booklet to show receipt like our present special delivery-registered letters. Sometimes important papers like appointments from the [...] "Capitan General" [...] (Governor General), were receipted with signatures of the appointees and persons present as witnesses.|$|R
50|$|In {{this spirit}} {{it is not}} {{adequate}} <b>just</b> to <b>answer</b> - to give symptom remedies - to the diverse and escalating endangerments for humankind and more over for its carrying biosphere.|$|R
60|$|The truth was, that Raymond {{had just}} begun to go to a singing school, and he was taking this {{opportunity}} to rise and fall the notes, as he called it. When Caleb asked him any question about his work, he would <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> it in a few words, and then, a minute after, begin again with his 'Do, Re, Mi,' and all the rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't {{expect you}} had, but I thought I would ask, to make sure; it's the way I've been raised. Now you mustn't take it unkindly if I {{remind you that}} as we don't know you, we must go a little slow. You may be all right, of course, and we'll hope that you are; but to {{take it for granted}} isn't business. You {{understand}} that. I'm obliged to ask you a few questions; <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> up fair and square, and don't be afraid. Where do you live, when you are at home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Imogene {{caught the}} little grieving, quivering face {{to her breast}} [...] "He is a wicked, wicked wretch! And I will give him the awfulest scolding he ever had when he comes here again. I will teach him to neglect my pet. I will let him {{understand}} that if he doesn't notice you, he needn't notice me. I will tell you, Effie--I've just thought of a way. The next time he comes we will both receive him. We will sit up very stiffly on the sofa together, and <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> Yes, No, Yes, No, to everything he says, till he begins to take the hint, and learns how to behave himself. Will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is <b>just</b> the <b>answer</b> Tertius gave me, when I {{first asked}} him if she were handsome. What {{is it that you}} gentlemen are {{thinking}} of when you are with Mrs. Casaubon?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Although serving 30 {{years as}} an officer {{spanning}} three wars, Simons was deemed not to fit the [...] "career mold" [...] for a general officer and did not rise above the rank of colonel. An Air Force officer who helped plan and execute the Son Tay raid wrote of Simons: [...] "He was not {{out to make a}} name for himself; he was there to do his duty. He did not attend all the professional advancement schools and did not cultivate any sponsors for his career. He <b>just</b> <b>answered</b> every call because it was the right thing for an American soldier to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sulpicius asks, [...] "is {{there an}} 'art' of oratory?" [...] Crassus {{responds}} with some contempt. Do {{they think he}} is some idle talkative Greekling? Do they think that he <b>just</b> <b>answers</b> any question that is posed to him? It was Gorgias that started this practice—which was great when he did it—but is so overused today {{that there is no}} topic, however grand, that some people claim they cannot respond to. Had he known this was what Sulpius and Cotta wanted, he would have brought a simple Greek with him to respond—which he still can do if they want him to.|$|R
6000|$|Who cares to {{know how}} it began? Who cares to hear how it went on,--the stupid, aimless {{skirmish}} of bitter words, between two people who had forgotten themselves? I believe it began with Elsley's being vexed at her springing up two or three times, fancying that she heard the children cry, while he wanted to be quiet, and sentimentalise over the roaring of the wind outside. Then--she thought of nothing but those children. Why did she not take a book and occupy her mind? To which she had her pert, though <b>just</b> <b>answer,</b> about her mind having quite enough to do to keep clothes on the children's backs, and so forth,--let who list imagine the miserable little squabble;--till she says,--"I know what has put you out so to-night; nothing but the news of my sister's coming." [...] He answers,--"That her sister is as little to him as to any man; as welcome to come now as she has been to stay away these three years." ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{moved away}} and stood {{looking into the}} sunny stillness of the garden; but after a little {{she turned back to}} him. [...] "I'm afraid your talk then is the wildness of despair! I don't {{understand}} it--but it doesn't matter. I'm not arguing with you; it's impossible I should; I've only tried to listen to you. I'm much obliged to you for attempting to explain," [...] she said gently, as if the anger with which she had just sprung up had already subsided. [...] "It's very good of you to try to warn me, if you're really alarmed; but I won't promise to think of what you've said: I shall forget it as soon as possible. Try and forget it yourself; you've done your duty, and no man can do more. I can't explain to you what I feel, what I believe, and I wouldn't if I could." [...] She paused a moment and then went on with an inconsequence that Ralph observed {{even in the midst of}} his eagerness to discover some symptom of concession. [...] "I can't enter into your idea of Mr. Osmond; I can't do it justice, because I see him in quite another way. He's not important--no, he's not important; he's a man to whom importance is supremely indifferent. If that's what you mean when you call him 'small,' then he's as small as you please. I call that large--it's the largest thing I know. I won't pretend to argue with you about a person I'm going to marry," [...] Isabel repeated. [...] "I'm not in the least concerned to defend Mr. Osmond; he's not so weak as to need my defence. I should think it would seem strange even to yourself that I should talk of him so quietly and coldly, as if he were any one else. I wouldn't talk of him at all to any one but you; and you, after what you've said--I may <b>just</b> <b>answer</b> you once for all. Pray, would you wish me to make a mercenary marriage--what they call a marriage of ambition? I've only one ambition--to be free to follow out a good feeling. I had others once, but they've passed away. Do you complain of Mr. Osmond because he's not rich? That's just what I like him for. I've fortunately money enough; I've never felt so thankful for it as to-day. There have been moments when I should like to go and kneel down by your father's grave: he did perhaps a better thing than he knew when he put it into my power to marry a poor man--a man who has borne his poverty with such dignity, with such indifference. Mr. Osmond has never scrambled nor struggled--he has cared for no worldly prize. If that's to be narrow, if that's to be selfish, then it's very well. I'm not frightened by such words, I'm not even displeased; I'm only sorry that you should make a mistake. Others might have done so, but I'm surprised that you should. You might know a gentleman when you see one--you might know a fine mind. Mr. Osmond makes no mistakes! He knows everything, he understands everything, he has the kindest, gentlest, highest spirit. You've got hold of some false idea. It's a pity, but I can't help it; it regards you more than me." [...] Isabel paused a moment, looking at her cousin with an eye illumined by a sentiment which contradicted the careful calmness of her manner--a mingled sentiment, to which the angry pain excited by his words and the wounded pride of having needed to justify a choice of which she felt only the nobleness and purity, equally contributed. Though she paused Ralph said nothing; he saw she had more to say. She was grand, but she was highly solicitous; she was indifferent, but she was all in a passion. [...] "What sort of a person should you have liked me to marry?" [...] she asked suddenly. [...] "You talk about one's soaring and sailing, but if one marries at all one touches the earth. One has human feelings and needs, one has a heart in one's bosom, and one must marry a particular individual. Your mother has never forgiven me for not having come to a better understanding with Lord Warburton, and she's horrified at my contenting myself with a person who has none of his great advantages--no property, no title, no honours, no houses, nor lands, nor position, nor reputation, nor brilliant belongings of any sort. It's the total absence of all these things that pleases me. Mr. Osmond's simply a very lonely, a very cultivated and a very honest man--he's not a prodigious proprietor." ...|$|E
