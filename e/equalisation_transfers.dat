40|$|This paper {{examines}} the working of Australia’s fiscal transfer {{system in the}} context of its long term evolution, paying particular attention to salient changes that have occurred since the introduction of a comprehensive Goods and Services Tax (GST). The GST has served to increase the vertical imbalance in the system, which was high even prior to this change, by placing more revenue resources with the commonwealth government in Australia. In spite of a high degree of expenditure centralisation, considerable emphasis is placed in Australia for achieving horizontal fiscal equalisation through an elaborate mechanism of <b>equalisation</b> <b>transfers,</b> which looks into both revenue and expenditure sides of the state budgets and calculates revenue and expenditure ‘disabilities ’ that account for departures from a pure equal per capita distribution of the shareable amounts. This paper looks at the equity and efficiency implications of the Australian <b>equalisation</b> <b>transfers</b> and considers its relevance for the Indian system, which has many comparable features. Apart from the need for making equalising features of the Indian transfer system more transparent, there is need for emphasising some cost disabilities, particularly those that are structural and exogenous in nature. ...|$|E
40|$|In a decentralised tax system, {{the effects}} of tax {{policies}} enacted by one government are not confined to its own jurisdiction. First, if both the regional and the federal levels of government co-occupy the same fields of taxation, tax rate increases by one layer of government will reduce taxes collected by the other. Second, if the tax base is mobile, tax rate increases by one regional government will raise the amount of taxes collected by other regional governments. These sources of fiscal interdependence are called in the literature vertical and horizontal tax externalities, respectively. Third, as Smart (1998) shows, if <b>equalisation</b> <b>transfers</b> are present, {{an increase in the}} standard equalisation tax rate provides incentives to raise taxes to the receiving provinces. A way to check the empirical relevance of these hypotheses is to test for the existence of interactions between the regional tax rate, on the one hand, and the federal tax rate, the tax rate set by competing regions, and the standard equalisation tax rate, on the other hand. Following this approach, this paper estimates provincial tax setting functions with data on Canadian personal income taxation for the period 1982 – 1996. We find a significant positive response of provincial tax rates to changes in the federal income tax rate, the tax rates of competing provinces, and the standard equalisation rate (only for receiving provinces). We also find that the reaction to horizontal competition is stronger in the provinces that do not receive <b>equalisation</b> <b>transfers.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 2002 fiscal federalism, tax competition, equalisation grants, personal income tax,...|$|E
40|$|In April 2007, the ‘Reinsurance’ {{arrangements}} {{in place since}} 1956 were replaced by a ‘Risk Equalisation’ scheme in the Australian private health insurance market. However, the new arrangements maintained a de facto ex-post (retrospective) claims-equalisation scheme. <b>Equalisation</b> <b>transfers</b> across competing health insurers could instead be achieved {{by means of a}} system of ex-ante prospective risk-adjusted subsidies with higher incentives for efficiency and lower incentives for selection compared to ex-post claims equalisation. This paper examines the option of introducing demographic scales for ex-ante (prospective) risk equalisation and its implications on the actual financial transfers (that is, risk-adjusted subsidies flows) across funds. The findings of this paper serve as an information basis for future policies aiming at improving efficiency and preventing selection in the Australian private health insurance market...|$|E
40|$|The {{point of}} this paper is to show that under a certain set of highly {{plausible}} circumstances, the well-known fiscal <b>equalisation</b> <b>transfer</b> required to establish spa- tial efficiency in federations, regional unions of states (such as the EU) or unitary countries with local governments, induces under-taxation of economic rents. The circumstances which lead to this result are carefully explained in the paper. It is also noted that the result does not invalidate the standard spatial efficiency case for inter-regional transfers. Rather, it means that whether such transfers are wel- fare enhancing in net terms depends on the benefit from achieving spatial efficiency relative to the cost arising from the under-taxation of rent...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the intergovernmental general purpose <b>equalisation</b> <b>transfer</b> (DAU) that began operating in 2001. First, {{a description of}} the mechanism highlights the significant distributional role played by the 'balancing factor' relative to the 'formula', and the key differences in distribution procedures for districts/municipalities and provinces. Second, the approach and methods are empirically analysed and evaluated. The sums available to the DAU appear more than sufficient to meet regional governments' net expenditure requirements, at least in aggregate, and given some caveats. The allocation mechanism has some design flaws in both its structure and the methods it uses to operationalise expenditure needs and fiscal capacity. Third, an examination of the 'equalising' effects of the transfer scheme shows that conclusions about equalisation depend very much on how one defines and operationalises the concept; policy makers need to be clear about what they want the DAU to accomplish in respect of equalisation. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the evolution and functioning of fiscal decentralisation process and intergovernmental finance in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). It analyses {{the system of}} dividing revenues among the three spheres of government. The paper highlights the challenges of designing and implementing intergovernmental fiscal policies and institutions in the post-apartheid era. The paper argues that the costed norms approach developed by the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) has tremendous potential in evolving a simple, objective, and fair system of transfers. However, significant additional work in terms of research, its meaningful dissemination to various governmental units, and building the information system undertake the task is necessary to make it operational. The absence of revenue <b>equalisation</b> in the <b>transfer</b> system is an important weakness of the transfer design. However, provinces do not have much revenue powers. Revenue <b>equalisation</b> in the <b>transfer</b> formula is meaningful only when some broad-based tax handles are assigned to provinces. It {{is also an important}} moral and a policy question as to whether there should be incentive to raise revenues from sources such as, gambling taxes and hospital services. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} grants from central {{government}} to local government {{is an important}} issue in developing countries. In hese countries the decentralisation process involves a vertical gap, i. e. an imbalance between the cost of local public competences and local governments' revenue-raising powers. Our analysis considers the crowding-in (or crowding-out) effect of simple unconditional central grantsonlocal own-source revenue. Wedemonstrate atheor- etical ambiguity concerning the nature of this effect by taking into account the collection costs of local governments'ownrevenue. Ourempirical analysis focuses on Benin. We study the impact of a very simple grant that is collected at the border by Customs and is allocated to local governments through a fixed rule (based on population). Our empirical analysis covers panel data for the seventy-seven Benin communes (local governments) from 2003 to 2008, and addresses the potential endogeneity issues of transfer from the centre. We conclude unambiguously that there is a positive impact of this grant on local own-source revenue. This effect is contingent on a minimum level of wealth of the commune and is stronger for local governments that do not share the same political affiliation as the president in office. Our result emphasises a neglected property of those unconditional transfers whose allocation rule is solely population based: their complementarity with local own-source revenue. Such transfers are not only simpler than other formula-based <b>equalisation</b> <b>transfers,</b> but they may also have an incentive effect on local own-source revenue...|$|E
40|$|Australian {{federalism}} in the 1970 s was characterised by marked {{vertical and}} horizontal financial imbalance, a trend towards 'big government', and increasing government involvement in social policy. These characteristics presented a challenge to {{a system in which}} the federal government dominated revenue and the states dominated expenditure. The challenge was met by altering the method of transfer payments within the federal system. Attempts to adopt a clear principle of fiscal <b>equalisation</b> in such <b>transfer</b> payments were thwarted however by political expediency. ...|$|R
40|$|By Hansjörg Blöchliger and Claire Charbit Fiscal <b>equalisation</b> is a <b>transfer</b> {{of fiscal}} {{resources}} across jurisdictions to offset disparities in revenue raising capacity or public service cost. It covers on average 2. 5 % of GDP or 5 % of total government expenditure across OECD countries. Equalisation reduces fiscal disparities by two-thirds on average {{and in some}} countries levels them virtually out. Strong equalisation comes at a price: on average, around 70 % of a jurisdiction’s additional tax income must be dedicated to an equalisation fund. The equalisation rate is generally higher for jurisdictions with low fiscal capacity, reducing their tax effort and likely to slow down regional economic convergence. Cost equalisation is larger than revenue equalisation in terms of GDP despite smaller cost disparities, pointing at inefficiencies in the distribution formulae. Fiscal equalisation can be pro-cyclical but most countries succeed in reducing fluctuations of entitlements, sometimes {{at the cost of}} sub-central budget needs. Fiscal equalisation is very country specific, and data and analysis must be taken with care. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last two}} decades {{witnessed}} an ongoing trend towards fiscal decentralisation in Europe – sub-central governments have been given more responsibilities and greater shares in public spending (Bloechliger & Vammalle 2012). The policy of decentralisation brings with it a promise of increased efficiency in terms of service provision and resource allocation on local and regional levels. The often unwanted consequence of decentralisation is that growing taxing powers and financial autonomies given to territorial units are accompanied by growing disparities in terms of wealth and/or income distribution between local governments. Hence the need for fiscal equalisation appears. The overriding objective of fiscal equalisation is to correct imbalances in fiscal capacity of territorial units resulting from sub-central autonomy and differentiation in terms of tax bases and to allow local and regional governments to provide their citizens with services of comparable quality and quantity. A recent study across eighteen countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom) showed that fiscal <b>equalisation</b> involves <b>transfers</b> varying from 0. 5 % to 3. 8 % of GDP (Bloechliger, Merk, Charbit, Mizell 2007). Depending on specific arrangements, equalisation mechanisms may be {{in line with the}} chosen policy for development, supporting either territorially balanced development or placing emphasis on development engines. This paper builds on notions of fiscal federalism and fiscal equalisation to give a better view of approaches to income equalisation between territorial units in six European countries. Countries chosen for comparison within the framework of this paper are different in terms of geographical location, size, levels of socio-economic development and adopted local government systems. The major criterion for choosing case study countries was their geographical location, as it is the authors’ intention to highlight differences in approach to fiscal equalisation between the Nordic countries (Finland and Sweden), Central European countries (Poland and Hungary), and the Mediterranean countries (Greece and Portugal). The hypothesis which is put forward and tested by the research team is as follows: The attitudes and approaches towards fiscal equalisation between local governments in: (1) the Nordic countries, (2) the Central European countries and (3) the Mediterranean countries differ significantly, reflecting cultural differences and different economic conditions in these countries. Specifically, the following sub-hypotheses are put forward and tested: + higher level of socio-economic development tends to favour stronger equalisation policy and mechanisms between local governments; + countries where local governments participate to a greater degree in public sector expenditures require far stronger equalisation mechanisms. The hypotheses are backed up by reasonable expectation that the extent of horizontal equity pursued in each country is based on value judgments of political actors in power. There might also be efficiency motives for equalisation grants (King 1984, 140 - 146). The first sub-hypothesis may be justified by the need of developing countries to favour rapid growth and encourage people to move from low productivity areas to highly productive areas, resulting with strategies favouring development engines and cautious with regards to high levels of redistribution (i. e. by means of equalisation grants to local governments in lagging areas). Respectively the more developed countries tend to emphasise equality at the expense of a lower growth rate and tend to favour stronger equalisation policy and mechanisms between local governments. The second sub-hypothesis is a natural anticipation that big volumes of local government activities lead rather to big than low volumes of equalisation of local government expenditures. The paper starts with snap-shot descriptions of countries chosen for analysis. Country backgrounds present situation in terms of socio-economic development, inequality in terms of personal wealth distribution and approaches to equalisation of personal incomes in respective 3 countries. Each country’s background also includes basic information on administrative division, scope of tasks performed by local governments, general structure of local government incomes and level of local government expenditure relative to GDP or central government spending. The second part of the paper is devoted to describing in more detail the grant systems and income equalisation mechanisms applied in all six case study countries. The final, third, part of the paper presents examples of how equalising measures work in relation to selected local governments which provide an overview of local governments of different income level prior to equalisation. This part then leads to conclusions, revisiting the hypotheses formulated above. The conclusions described in the paper are of a tentative character, showing possible research problems for future in-depth analyses which were not possible in a large, six-country comparison...|$|R
40|$|The Austrian Federal {{government}} is striving {{to achieve a}} balanced national budget for 2002. In terms of budgetary distribution, {{it is assumed that}} the Länder (Federal states) will deliver a surplus of 0. 75 percent of GDP, whereas the communities will arrive at a balanced budget. Accordingly, the Federal budget could then have a deficit margin of 0. 75 percent of GDP. The budget proposed for 2002 meets this stability target. Current economic prospects, however, will not help to achieve the objective of a balanced budget. The Federal government attempts to meet its budgetary goal by raising additional (tax) revenues and by instituting savings on the expenditure side. Compared to 2000, the one-time effects on the revenue side of the 2002 budget are markedly lower, {{while at the same time}} the overall tax ratio is rising. Apart from ATS 1 billion, all of the additional revenues from taxation, which are estimated at about ATS 28 billion, will flow into Federal budget. At the same time, the Länder have raised their consolidation contribution to the Federal budget from ATS 2. 29 billion (from 2001) to ATS 4. 29 billion. Federal expenditures show substantial shifts due to budget consolidation. Altogether, both personnel expenses and transfers in the 2002 budget follow the original targets. The preliminary result for 2000 indicates that objectives were met, so that a solid foundation was built for the budgets for 2001 and 2002. The 2002 budget makes it clear that Bundesimmobiliengesellschaft is now investing a substantial part of the funds for construction and buildings which were formerly invested directly under the Federal budget. As a consequence, construction investment is noticeably lower in the Federal budget (at € 197 million in 2002, it is posted at more than 40 percent below the 2000 figure), whereas expenditure on rents has risen by almost € 400 million between 2000 and 2002. Other expenditure items similarly illustrate that the Federal {{government is}} increasingly outsourcing works and services to third parties rather than rendering them directly. Transfer payments are mostly within the scope of social expenditure. More than half of these payments are made to cover old-age pensions. At ATS 177. 3 billion (€ 12. 9 billion) in 2002, they will be 8. 2 percent higher than in 2000. The greater part of this sum is used as Federal contribution to the statutory pension insurance scheme (including <b>equalisation</b> payments) and <b>transfers</b> to the <b>equalisation</b> funds held by the pension insurance institutions. Apart from covering old-age pensions, a substantial share of the transfer payments involves family subsidies. The new child-care benefit (payable as of 2002) will make for a considerable increase of this item. Taking into account the abolishing of the parental leave benefit, the new child-care benefit will call for another ATS 6. 4 billion (€ 0. 46 billion) by 2002. Two components on the expenditure side will make an important contribution to budget consolidation: interest on the national debt and transfer payments to other public bodies. Lower budget deficits will make for interest payments in 2002 at roughly the 2001 level. Payments to other territorial authorities and funds are budgeted at ATS 113. 4 billion in 2002 (compared to ATS 113. 2 billion in 2000), as a consequence of the Federal government's attempt to reduce its financing functions.
