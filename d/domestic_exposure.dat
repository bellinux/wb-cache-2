50|$|Metsovo Lung was an {{epidemic}} of lung disease resulting from <b>domestic</b> <b>exposure</b> to asbestos {{in the village of}} Metsovo in NW Greece. Most of the inhabitants had previously been exposed to a whitewash derived from local soils containing tremolite asbestos. This caused {{an epidemic}} of malignant mesothelioma (MM) that reached an incidence 300 times that expected in populations not exposed to asbestos. This was accompanied by pleural calcifications (PCs) in almost half the adult population. Both conditions have declined significantly since the whitewash ceased to be used after 1980-1985.|$|E

The song has a very high reputation and often features in polls of the best Eurovision entries of all time.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of this exposure being occupational seemed very unlikely, {{as there are}} no asbestos mines or factories near Metsovo. The nearest such mine (active until 1990) is located near Kozani, a city 150 miles east of Metsovo. Guided by previous research by Izzetin Baris dealing with not-occupational (<b>domestic)</b> <b>exposure</b> of vast areas in Anatolia (Turkey) from erionite and tremolite, the researchers arranged a meeting with Metsovites where {{they were told that}} practically all households in Metsovo were using soil from nearby hills (white soil = louto in the local dialect) for whitewashing. The material was applied more often on walls around fireplaces, because this kept the walls white, unsoiled from the fire. This whitewash was used by everybody until 1940-1950 and gradually abandoned, so that in 1980 it was used by only 15% of the households and by 1985 it was completely abandoned.|$|E

50|$|Radon {{concentration}} is usually {{measured in the}} atmosphere in becquerels per cubic meter (Bq/m3), which is an SI derived unit.

5000|$|Nitrogen dioxide {{poisoning}} is {{the illness}} {{resulting from the}} toxic effect of nitrogen dioxide (...) [...] It usually occurs after the inhalation of the gas beyond the threshold limit value.Nitrogen dioxide is reddish-brown with very harsh smell at high concentrations. It is colorless and odorless at lower concentration but yet harmful. Nitrogen dioxide poisoning depends on the duration, frequency, and intensity of exposure.Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant of the mucous membrane linked with another air pollutant that causes pulmonary diseases such as OLD, asthma, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and sometimes acute exacerbation of COPD and in fatal cases, deaths.Its poor solubility in water enhances its passage and its ability to pass through the moist oral mucosa of the respiratory tract.Like most toxic gases, the dose inhaled determines the toxicity on the respiratory tract. Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk of toxicity and <b>domestic</b> <b>exposure</b> is uncommon. Prolonged exposure to low concentration of the gas may have lethal effects, as can short-term exposure to high concentrations like chlorine gas poisoning. It {{is one of the major}} air pollutant capable of causing severe heath hazards such as coronary artery disease as well as stroke.Nitrogen dioxide is often released into the environment as a byproduct of fuel combustion but rarely released by spontaneous combustion. Known sources of nitrogen gas poisoning include automobile exhaust and power stations. The toxicity may also result from non-combustible sources such as the one released from anaerobic fermentation of food grains and anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste.The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a global recommendation limiting exposures to less than 20 parts per billion for chronic exposure and value less 100 ppb for one hour for acute exposure, using nitrogen dioxide as a marker for other pollutants from fuel combustion. [...] The standards also based on the concentration of nitrogen dioxide that show a significant and profound effects on the function of the pulmonary of asthmatic patients.Historically, some cities in the United States including Chicago and Los Angeles have high levels of nitrogen dioxide but the EPA set a standard values less than 100 ppb for a one-hour exposure and less than 53 ppb for chronic exposure.|$|E

40|$|Inhalation of {{asbestos}} resulting from living with and handling the clothing of workers directly exposed to asbestos {{has been established}} as a possible contributor to disease. This review evaluates epidemiologic studies {{of asbestos}}-related disease or conditions (mesothelioma, lung cancer, and pleural and interstitial abnormalities) among domestically exposed individuals and exposure studies that provide either direct exposure measurements or surrogate measures of asbestos exposure. A meta-analysis of studies providing relative risk estimates (n = 12) of mesothelioma was performed, resulting in a summary relative risk estimate (SRRE) of 5. 02 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 48 – 10. 13). This SRRE pertains to persons domestically exposed via workers involved in occupations with a traditionally high risk of disease from exposure to asbestos (i. e., asbestos product manufacturing workers, insulators, shipyard workers, and asbestos miners). The epidemiologic studies also show an elevated risk of interstitial, but more likely pleural, abnormalities (n = 6), though only half accounted for confounding exposures. The studies are limited with regard to lung cancer (n = 2). Several exposure-related studies describe results from airborne samples collected within the home (n = 3), during laundering of contaminated clothing (n = 1) or in controlled exposure simulations (n = 5) of <b>domestic</b> <b>exposures,</b> the latter of which were generally associated with low-level chrysotile-exposed workers.

40|$|The study investigates {{mortality}} {{from cancer}} and other diseases in a cohort of wives of asbestos cement workers in Casale Monferrato (northwest Italy). After the exclusion of women with an occupational record in the asbestos cement industry, the cohort comprised 1964 women. Their <b>domestic</b> <b>exposure</b> was estimated according to their husbands' periods of employment in the plant: 1740 had a period of <b>domestic</b> <b>exposure</b> whereas the remaining 224 married an asbestos cement worker only after he definitely stopped his activity in the asbestos cement plant; these have, therefore, been considered as unexposed. The cohort of wives was constructed entirely through official records in the town offices and is both exhaustive and unaffected by recall bias. At the end of follow up (1988) 1669 women were alive, 270 were dead and 25 (1. 2 %) were untraced. Main mortality analyses were only up to age 79 to reduce the misclassification of causes of death. Expected mortality was based on local rates. Mortality analyses were limited to the period 1965 - 88 due to the availability of local rates: in that period 210 deaths occurred among women with <b>domestic</b> <b>exposure</b> v 229. 1 expected.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} <b>domestic</b> <b>exposure</b> to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and asthma in young children. Methods: A population based case-control {{study was conducted in}} Perth, Western Australia in children aged between 6 months and 3 years. Cases (n = 88) were children recruited at Princess Margaret Hospital accident and emergency department and discharged with asthma as the primary diagnosis; 104 controls consisted of children from the same age group without an asthma diagnosis identified through the Health Department of Western Australia. Information regarding the health status of the study children and characteristics of the home was collected using a standardised questionnaire. Exposure to VOCs, average temperature and relative humidity were measured in winter and summer {{in the living room of}} each participating household. Results: Cases were exposed to significantly higher VOC levels (mg/m 3) than controls (p, 0. 01). Most of the individual VOCs appeared to be significant risk factors for asthma with the highest odds ratios for benzene followed by ethylbenzene and toluene. For every 10 unit increase in the concentration of toluene and benzene (mg/m 3) the risk of having asthma increased by almost two and three times, respectively.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the evidence for an association between <b>domestic</b> <b>exposure</b> to food-producing animals and cases of human diarrhea and specific enteric infections. We performed a systematic review of available literature to examine domestic livestock and poultry as risk factors for diarrhea and applied pre-determined quality criteria.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Environmental {{asbestos}} pollution {{can cause}} malignant mesothelioma, but {{few studies have}} involved dose–response analyses with detailed information on occupational, <b>domestic,</b> and environmental <b>exposures.</b> OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we examined the spatial variation of mesothelioma risk in an area {{with high levels of}} asbestos pollution from an industrial plant, adjusting for occupational and <b>domestic</b> <b>exposures.</b> METHODS: This population-based case–control study included 103 incident cases of mesothelioma and 272 controls in 1987 – 1993 in the area around Casale Monferrato, Italy, where an important asbestos cement plant had been active for decades. Information collected included lifelong occupational and residential histories. Mesothelioma risk was estimated through logistic regression and a mixed additive–multiplicative model in which an additive scale was assumed for the risk associated with both residential distance from the plant and occupational exposures. The adjusted excess risk gradient by residential distance was modeled as an exponential decay with a threshold.

50|$|High {{concentrations}} of radon in homes were discovered by chance in 1985 after the stringent radiation testing conducted at {{a nuclear power}} plant entrance revealed that Stanley Watras, an engineer at the plant, was contaminated by radioactive substances. Typical <b>domestic</b> <b>exposures</b> are of approximately 100 Bq/m3 (2.7 pCi/L) indoors. Some level of radon will be found in all buildings.
