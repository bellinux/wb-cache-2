5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to {{the left side of the}} main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having {{problems}} with his <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
25|$|The second {{diaphragm}} is the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> {{portion of}} the regulator, and is located farthest from the carburetor body.

25|$|Chamber C and chamber D are {{connected}} by a fuel passage which contains the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> jets. When the mixture control lever is moved from the idle-cutoff position, fuel starts to flow through the metering jets and into chamber D where it becomes metered fuel.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{carburetor}} {{leaves a}} stable condition, the float {{is influenced by}} both gravity and inertia, resulting in inaccurate <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> {{and a reduction in}} engine performance as the air-fuel ratio changes, becoming either too lean or too rich for maximum engine performance, and in some cases, stopping the engine.|$|E

5000|$|The {{gameplay}} of Pyongyang Racer focuses {{largely on}} driving a North Korean car Hwiparam II [...] {{through the streets}} of Pyongyang. Specifically, certain rules and regulations must be followed, such as the need to continually hit barrels of gasoline to maintain a depleting <b>fuel</b> <b>meter.</b> In addition, certain obstacles and objects must be avoided, or will result in points deducted. Other cars are present on the road but do not actually move.|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} {{chambers}} in the fuel regulator {{portion of the}} carburetor. They are referred to by letters A, B, C, and D, with the A chamber closest to the throttle body. The <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> servo valve responds to pressure differentials across the diaphragms separating the chambers. The resulting diaphragm movement controls fuel flow into the engine under all flight conditions.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the engines}} found that their fuel systems were {{contaminated}} with spherical particles. The particles had caused the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Metering</b> Units' Main Metering Valves (MMVs) to seize; the MMVs {{were found to be}} stuck in positions corresponding to the recorded thrust output of each engine as it approached Hong Kong. Other engine components were found to be contaminated with the particles as well, and No. 2 engine's Variable Stator Vane Controller was also found to be seized; the entire fuel system including the aircraft's fuel tanks was found to be contaminated with the spherical particles. As part of the investigation, fuel samples had been collected at Juanda International Airport. Investigators found that the contaminant particles were present in the fuel samples. The fuel supply pipeline system used to refuel aircraft at Juanda International Airport had been extended prior to B-HLL being refuelled there, as part of the construction of new aircraft parking bays. The investigation discovered that not all procedures were followed when the fuel pipeline system was brought back into service.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{airborne}} {{and having}} reached the cruising altitude, the pilot moves the mixture control from auto rich to auto lean. [...] This reduces fuel flow by closing the passageway through the rich jet. [...] The resulting reduction of flow unbalances the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> diaphragm, causing the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> valve to change position, thereby reducing fuel {{flow to the}} auto lean flow setting.|$|E

2500|$|Bendix-Stromberg {{engineers}} {{overcame the}} problems found with float-type carburetors {{by moving the}} fuel discharge nozzle to the carburetor adapter {{or in some cases}} at the [...] "eye" [...] of the supercharger, both below the throttle plates and by eliminating the float from the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system. The new [...] "pressure carburetor" [...] design replaced the float-operated fuel inlet valve with a servo-operated poppet-style <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> valve.|$|E
2500|$|The air {{metering}} {{force from}} chambers A and B [...] is {{opposed by the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> force from chambers C and D. [...] These two forces combine into movement of the servo valve to adjust the fuel flow to the precise amount required {{for the needs of}} the engine, and the needs of the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{velocity}} of the air flow [...] entering the carburetor is measured by placing one or more venturi directly in the airflow. The venturi creates a low pressure that changes with the {{velocity of}} the air. As the air pressure in chamber A is decreased with greater airflow, the diaphragm is pulled toward the carburetor body. Chamber A also contains a spring that opens the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> valve when the air flow is absent.|$|E

It may cause un-commanded in-flight shut-down (IFSD) on the aero-engine and threat the flight safety. The operation principle of <b>fuel</b> flow <b>metering</b> valve is introduced in this paper. The basic faults detection logic is given. Two IFSD examples are presented. To reduce the un-commanded IFSD, faults detection logic updating is discussed. It {{can be used}} to design the new control software of the aero-engine and improve the aero-engine’s reliability...|$|R

2500|$|The fuel {{regulator}} portion takes input signals {{from various sources}} to automatically control fuel flow into the engine. It consists {{of a number of}} diaphragms sandwiched between metal plates, with the center of the roughly circular diaphragms connected to a common rod, forming four pressure chambers when assembled. The outer end of the rod connects to the <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> servo valve that moves away from the throttle body to open, allowing more fuel flow or toward the throttle body to close, reducing the amount of fuel to flow. [...] The rod is moved by the forces measured within the four pressure chambers.|$|E

Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E
