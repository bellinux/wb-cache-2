25|$|By November Verdi and Strepponi left Italy {{to spend}} the winter of 1851/52 in Paris, where he {{concluded}} {{an agreement with the}} Paris Opéra to write what became Les vêpres siciliennes, his first grand opera, although he had adapted his <b>earlier</b> <b>I</b> Lombardi into Jerusalem for the stage. Including work on Trovatore, other projects consumed him, but a significant event occurred in February, when the couple attended a performance of Alexander Dumas filss The Lady of the Camellias. What followed is reported by Verdi's biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz who states that the composer revealed that, after seeing the play, he immediately began to compose music for what would later become La traviata.|$|E

They remained for two weeks, pushing scouting parties to within three miles (4.8km) of Ticonderoga. The battle-season was getting late as the first snow began to fall on October 20 and his supply line {{would be difficult to}} manage in winter, so Carleton decided to withdraw north to winter quarters; Arnold's plan of delay had succeeded. Baron Riedesel, commanding the Hessians in Carleton's army, noted that, [...] "If we could have begun our expedition four weeks <b>earlier,</b> <b>I</b> am satisfied that everything could have ended this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its success, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{had some}} detractors, {{including}} hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album's style. At the 1995 Source Awards, OutKast {{won in the}} [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and only said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at us like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so different from what I was used to that I foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade <b>earlier,</b> <b>I</b> didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop. They were offering {{one of the most}} honest expressions, and expression so honest that it went completely over my head at first." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, {{some people}} have {{considered}} that the song's opening guitar arpeggios bear a close resemblance to the 1968 instrumental [...] "Taurus" [...] by the Los Angeles-based rock band Spirit, written by Spirit guitarist Randy California. In the liner notes to the 1996 reissue of Spirit's self-titled debut album, California wrote: [...] "People always ask me why [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] sounds exactly like [...] "Taurus", which was released two years <b>earlier.</b> <b>I</b> know Led Zeppelin also played [...] "Fresh Garbage" [...] in their live set. They opened up for us on their first American tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: [...] "I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years <b>earlier.</b> <b>I</b> told myself if I ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently.
