Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} war {{approached}} and hostilities with the Sioux Indians loomed, Raynolds's <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> experiences in the Great Lakes region became {{more important to the}} army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. As a result, he returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses in April 1864, and saw no further combat {{for the rest of his}} career. Before the war was over, on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to brigadier general for meritorious service.|$|E
5|$|For aristocrats {{to succeed}} in private and public life during the Heian period, it was {{essential}} to be fluent in the composition and appreciation of waka, as well as having thorough <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> ability in music, and calligraphy. Poetry was used in witty conversations, in notes of invitation, thanks or condolence, and for correspondence between friends and lovers. Some of the finest poetry of the Heian period came from the middle-class court society such as ladies in waiting or middle-rank officials. Uta-awase poetry contests, in which poets composed poetry on a given theme to be judged by an individual, were held from 885 onwards, and became a regular activity for Heian courtiers from the 10th century onward. Contest judgments led to works about waka theory and critical studies. Poems from the contents were added to imperial anthologies. Critical theories, and the poems in the anthologies (particularly the Kokinshū), {{became the basis for}} judgments in the contests. Utaawase continued to be held through the late-11th century, as social rather than literary events. Held in opulence in a spirit of friendly rivalry, they included chanters, scribes, consultants, musicians, and an audience. During the Heian period, waka were often collected in large anthologies, such as the Man'yōshū or Kokinshū, or smaller private collections of the works of a single poet. Waka also featured highly in all kinds of literary prose works including monogatari, diaries and historical works. The Tale of Genji alone contains 800 waka.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the major categories of English language teacher educators’ pedagogical knowledge base. To this end, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 5 teachers, teacher educators, and university professors (15 participants in total). The results of data analysis indicated that teacher educators’ pedagogical knowledge encompasses eight macro categories; namely, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> language <b>and</b> related disciplines, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> ELT theories, skills, <b>and</b> techniques, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> context <b>and</b> social relations, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> class, time, <b>and</b> learning management, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> research <b>and</b> professional development, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> practicum, <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> teachers <b>and</b> their assessment, <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> reflective <b>and</b> critical teaching. Among these categories, the first four ones are shared by language teachers, while the rest belong to the domain of teacher educators. The findings also revealed no significant statistical difference among the categories proposed by the three groups of the participants. The results are discussed and suggestions are provided for future research...|$|R
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the kinds of language experience and knowledge gained through the statistical learning of the first language influences one's acquisition of a second language.

In that sense, the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> skills to process the first language from statistical acquisition may act as a complicating factor when one tries to learn a new language with different sentence structures, grammatical rules, and speech patterns.|$|E

25|$|Morse code {{is used by}} some amateur radio operators, {{although}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> proficiency with it is {{no longer}} required for licensing in most countries. Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding. Aeronautical navigational aids, such as VORs and NDBs, constantly identify in Morse code. Compared to voice, Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions, yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device. Morse is, therefore, a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels. Many amateur radio repeaters, for example, identify with Morse, even though they are used for voice communications.|$|E
25|$|The Core Curriculum in the Liberal Arts of John Carroll is {{informed}} by the principles that issue from the University's mission as a Jesuit liberal arts institution of higher learning. Accordingly, the Core emphasizes the development of whole human persons who are educated in the humanizing arts and sciences; skilled in expression and in scholarly investigation; and aware of the interrelationship of all knowledge and the interdependence of all peoples. Moreover, it promotes the integration of faith and reason by imparting a deeper <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> respect for the students' own cultural and religious traditions {{as well as those}} of others. Finally, it highlights the development of intellect, character, and leadership, and the responsible social actions which flow from them.|$|E
25|$|Hugh J. Schonfield, in the {{controversial}} The Passover Plot and other works, saw {{evidence that the}} source of this Gospel was the Beloved Disciple of the Last Supper and further that this person, perhaps named John, was a senior Temple priest and so probably a member of the Sanhedrin. This would account for the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> access to the Temple which would not have been available to rough fishermen and followers of a disruptive rural preacher from the Galilee, one who was being accused of heresy besides. And probably for the evanescent presence of the Beloved Disciple in the events of Jesus' Ministry. On this reading, the Gospel was written, perhaps by a student and follower of this Disciple in his last advanced years, perhaps at Patmos.|$|E
