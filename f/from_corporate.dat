5|$|On 20 April 2005, the Norwegian Ski Federation's board supported, with 13 against 1 vote, {{to build}} both a normal {{and a large}} hill at Rødkleiva and to close Vikersundbakken. However, the {{following}} day Svarstad Haugland stated that the government supported keeping Vikersundbakken rather than building a new venue in Rødkleiva.

A majority of the county chapters supported Vikersundbakken, with only 4 of 19 chapters supporting Rødkleiva.

5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble.

It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation <b>from</b> <b>corporate</b> and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder.
