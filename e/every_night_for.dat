In this period he composed his only full opera buffa, La sorella amante, in addition to several intermezzi and serenatas.

Trenet then returned to his peaceful semi-retirement in Occitania (South of France), occasionally reappearing for a special gala performance in France or abroad. After giving farewell concerts in France, Trenet was persuaded out of retirement by a French Canadian lawyer, Gilbert Rozon, in 1983 for a farewell concert in Montreal.

25|$|Padmavati, though {{initially}} dejected by her husband's departure, soon {{falls into}} the company of wanton women who suggest that she take on a lover. She agrees, and <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> the next seventy nights, she gets ready to meet him. But she is thwarted in her attempt every single night by the parrot, which adopts the stratagem of telling her a story. The parrot typically expresses approval of its mistress' intention by agreeing {{that the goal of}} life was to seek pleasure and acknowledges the strength of sexual desire. Then it excites her interest by asking whether she had the wits to escape if any troublesome situation were to arise, as the protagonist of her next story had. Padmavati naturally wants to know the details of the story and the parrot proceeds to narrate it. At the end of the story, Padmavati decides not to go for her rendezvous that night.|$|E
25|$|Major {{additions}} {{have been}} made to the buildings through the centuries, and Wolsey's Great Quadrangle was crowned with the famous gate-tower designed by Sir Christopher Wren. To this day the bell in the tower, Great Tom, is rung 101 times at 9pm at the former Oxford time (9:05pm GMT/BST) <b>every</b> <b>night,</b> <b>for</b> the 100 original scholars of the college (plus one added in 1664). In former times this was done at midnight, signalling the close of all college gates throughout Oxford. Since it took 20minutes to ring the 101, Christ Church gates, unlike those of other colleges, did not close until 12:20. When the ringing was moved back to 9:00pm, Christ Church gates still remained open until 12.20, 20minutes later than any other college. Although the clock itself now shows GMT/BST, Christ Church still follows Oxford time in the timings of services in the cathedral.|$|E

Unlike some other monkey species, the group does not split into separate foraging groups during the day. Individual monkeys may separate for the main group to engage in different activities for periods of time, and thus the group may be dispersed over an area of up to three acres (1.2 hectares) at any given time.

500|$|The {{extinction}} of the Caribbean monk seal was mainly triggered by overhunting {{in the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries to obtain the oil held within their blubber, fueled by the large demand for seal products. As early as 1688, sugar plantation owners sent out hunting parties to kill hundreds of seals <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> blubber oil to lubricate [...] machinery. The Caribbean monk seals’ docile nature and lack of an instinctive fear of humans made it an easy target, and hunting only ended (in the 1850s) because the population was too low for commercial use. Overfishing of the reefs that sustained the Caribbean monk seal population also contributed to their extinction. Fish stock decline in the Caribbean starved the remaining populations. Little was done to protect the Caribbean monk seal; by the time it was placed on the endangered species list in 1967, it was likely already extinct.|$|E
500|$|Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly {{compiled}} a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, {{the first day}} I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford. After dinner <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> about a month, I'd run Stagecoach, often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school." ...|$|E
500|$|To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100Hz) booming {{calls from}} their bowls by {{inflating}} a thoracic sac. They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After {{a sequence of}} about 20 loud booms, the male kakapo emits a high-frequency, metallic [...] "ching" [...] sound. He stands {{for a short while}} before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least [...] away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least [...] Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard.|$|E

Ibárruri related that seniors, women and children kept watch on the terraces of Moscow <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> the burning sticks of incendiaries scattered by the Luftwaffe.
