40|$|<b>Hydro-cracking</b> is the {{catalytic}} thermal hydro-decomposed {{process that}} changes the long chain of hydrocarbon to become oil fraction with the shorter hydrocarbon chain. In this preliminary work, <b>hydro-cracking</b> of Jarak seed oil was studied to investigate the catalytic activity of the catalyst. The catalysts {{used in this study}} have double functions which are the metal component as a hydrogenation catalyst and the acid component as the cracking catalyst. Initially, TiO 2 -pillared-montmorillonite based Co-Mo catalysts have been characterized by the adsorption-desorption of N 2 to view its porosity and structure. The results showed that the TiO 2 pillared montmorillonite increases significantly the total pore volume and the specific surface area of their initial montmorillonite features. It is concluded that the catalytic activity of TiO 2 pilared montmorillonite is more active than its montmorillonite parent.

40|$|AbstractLight {{and middle}} {{atmospheric}} distillate petroleum substances are blended to produce fuels used in transportation and heating. These substances represent the majority by volume {{of crude oil}} refined products in the United States. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop biodegradability and aquatic toxicity data for four substances; heavy, straight-run naphtha (HSRN), hydro-desulfurized kerosene (HDK), <b>hydro-cracked</b> gas oil (HCGO), and catalytic-cracked gas oil (CCGO). Ready biodegradability tests demonstrated rapid and extensive microbial oxidation of these test substances, indicating a lack of persistence in the aquatic environment. Differences in biodegradation patterns reflected compositional differences in the constituent hydrocarbons. Results of aquatic toxicity tests on alga, cladocera, and fish demonstrated that toxicity was greatest for catalytic-cracked gas oil, which contained a high proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons are more soluble, and hence more bioavailable, resulting in higher toxicity. When expressed on the basis of loading rates, acute toxicity values (LL/EL 50) ranged between 0. 3 and 5. 5 mgL− 1 for all three species, while chronic no-observed-effect loading rates (NOELR) ranged between 0. 05 and 0. 64 mgL− 1. PETROTOX estimates for acute and chronic toxicity ranged from 0. 18 to 2. 3 mgL− 1 and 0. 06 to 0. 14 mgL− 1, respectively, which were generally more conservative than experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Hydro-conversion {{reactions}} {{were carried out}} at 360 ℃ under 5 MPa of H_ 2 pressure to study ring opening reactions of 1 -methyl naphthalene using NiMoS supported on γ-alumina and alumina-coated/mixed USY zeolites. The catalysts were characterized using N_ 2 BET, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), pyridine FT-IR, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) to study the influence of morphological and acidic properties on hydrogenation (HYD) and hydrocracking (HC) reactions. NMACZ- 2 (NiMoS supported on the minimum amount of alumina-coated USY zeolite) showed enhanced reactivity for HC and produced (alkyl) benzenes with the highest yield, of ca. 80 %. By-products were tetralin, decalin and cyclo-paraffin species. The tetralin species produced using NMACZ- 2 moved into the alumina-coated USY zeolite support before undergoing HYD to produce decalin species, which were rapidly and selectively <b>hydro-cracked</b> into (alkyl) benzenes. A large amount of decalin was produced through the HYD of tetralin without significant cracking, possibly due to the weak acid character of γ-alumina. Bulk phase Mo oxide species on NMAZ (physical mixture of alumina and USY zeolite), as well as deactivation of the catalysts due to coke formation over the naked zeolite surface, inhibited the ring opening of tetralin, decreasing the yield of (alkyl) benzene. Various morphologies, such as the MoS_ 2 structure and acidic characteristics of the catalysts, were crucial factors affecting the HC reactivity of 1 -methyl naphthalene...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} hundred years, the fossil fuels {{consumption}} is increasing dramatically and this lead to {{a significant increase in}} greenhouse gas emissions, the depletion of natural reserves of fossil fuels and increase the fuel production cost. Consequently, renewable and sustainable fuel sources such as bio-oil are receiving increased attention. In bio-based oil such as micro-algae oil, triglycerides and fatty acids are sustainable resources with high energy densities that can be converted into liquid hydrocarbon fuels, efficiently. One of the efficient ways for bio-oil conversion to applicable fuels is <b>hydro-cracking.</b> <b>Hydro-cracking</b> with acidic catalysts is a single step and energy efficient process for bio-oil upgrading towards bio-fuels. Zeolitic structures such as ZSM- 5 and beta-zeolite are prevalent acidic catalysts in hydro-treating processes due to their strong acidity, their crystalline porous structure and their high hydrothermal stability. The aim of this research is checking the feasibility of <b>hydro-cracking</b> synthesis towards the light (LC) and middle (MC) range of hydrocarbons over the zeolite based catalysts. Two different types of zeolite catalysts, ZSM- 5 and beta-zeolite, were chosen and they were impregnated with Ni (NO₃) ₂. 6 H₂O and calcined at 500 °C. The prepared catalysts were tested with oleic acid which is the main component of plant-derived oil. The catalysts were injected in a lab-scale trickle bed reactor in certain operating conditions. The oleic acid conversion over beta-zeolite was greater than ZSM- 5 due to higher pore size distribution and acidity of beta-zeolite compared with ZSM- 5. Also the reaction rate constant and Arrhenius equations for beta-zeolite and ZSM- 5 were identified. The second step of this research is investigating the <b>hydro-cracking</b> performance with performing a mathematical modelling. The model predictions showed reasonable correlation with experimental data and conversion rates. The total conversion for the hydrocracking reactor model was 82. 54 % for 4 major classes of hydrocarbons (light [LC], middle [MC], heavy [HC] and oligomerised [OC]). In addition, the concentration distribution and temperature profile along the reactor were investigated. At the end, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the <b>hydro-cracking</b> reactor performance. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Reported experimental data in the literature were used to de-velop, train, and check these models.

Results showed that kinetic-based and artificial neural models have specific capabilities to predict yield of hydrocracking products. The former is able to accurately predict the yield of lighter prod-ucts, i. e. light naphtha, heavy naphtha and kerosene.

40|$|Abstract— 21 / 4 CrlMo {{steel and}} 11 / 4 Cr 1 / 2 Mo steel {{have been widely}} been used for hydro‐processing units such as hydro‐desulphurising and <b>hydro‐cracking</b> reactors. These reactor {{pressure}} vessel steels have a potential for temper embrittlement that leads to toughness degradation and a reduction of the critical flaw size for brittle fracture. These steels are also susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement, especially in aged steels where cracks may propagate in the base metal up to the critical flaw size. A vessel with adequate toughness when originally constructed may therefore embrittle during service and such changes may require pressure restrictions during start‐up and shut‐down. A survey of the literature shows composition to be the controlling parameter for both temper embrittlement (TE) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE), in‐particular the presence of residual impurity elements such as P {{and the presence of}} elements such as Mo which nullify the effect of impurity segregation. Much information is available to describe embrittlement phenomena for Cr‐Mo steels. This paper reviews the mechanisms of TE and HE and describes a microstructural characterisation route which subsequently allows the structural integrity of potentially embrittled vessels to be examined for the purposes of remaining life assessment and plant life extension.

The process of sediment deposition was analyzed by using the CFD technology, and the critical condition of bending deformation and instability of tubes was determined via stress analysis. On this base, reasons of bending deformation in air cooler system and the targeted control measures were determined. The results showed that corrosion system of H 2 S-NH 3 -H 2 O existing in the cooling and separation process of hydrogenation reactor effluent stream, which would result in high temperature corrosion of H 2 S/H 2 and erosion-corrosion of NH 4 HS solution. A large amount of corrosion products located {{at the end of}} tubes, which could block the air coolers when at a low flow velocity. In the air-cooler system, the temperature and force distribution were uneven when some part of pipes were blocked. Once the number of blocked pipes exceeds 9, the pipe bundles were diastrophic.

40|$|Petroleum {{refining}} {{industry in the}} United States is {{the largest in the}} world operating 148 refineries. These refineries contribute a major economic value to the U. S. market for providing the chemical industry with vital products. The economic gain, however, is challenged by the increasing competitiveness within the refining sector as well as the unpredictable oil prices. Furthermore, environmental obligations also have been recently advocating low emission rates that may entail additional operating costs to refineries. In this study, we analyze hydrogen production and utilization in the U. S. oil and gas industry to characterize its key role and trends in this energy-intensive industry. We referred to U. S. Department of Energy data and statistics of hydrogen production rates as well as we considered other elementary factors of refineries productivity such as; economics of crude oil, power consumption and chemical outputs. Considering the fact that hydrogen-dependent processes in refining count as a key element in oil refining; it is certainly that efficient production and implementation of hydrogen in processes such as <b>hydro-cracking</b> and hydro-desulfurization will result in cost saving opportunities for refineries. From this point of view, we highlight the economic and environmental advantages of solar cracking of natural gas as an alternative way of hydrogen production. Hydrogen production in refineries could possibly benefit from utilizing this alternative method on both local and global levels. Economically, this study explains how solar cracking could save about $ 62 million in hydrogen production for U. S. refineries. Even though the momentum of desulfurization acts are not yet strong in the U. S., major European refining investments are in jeopardy if not soon to utilize enhanced desulfurization facilities in response to demands of lower sulfur content of refined products. A comprehensive expenditures model is presented in this study to monitor primary areas of saving in hydrogen production from the early stages of establishing a hydrogen production plant. Further alternatives showing potential are also included as future considerations for the refinery sector. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The global {{energy and}} climate {{challenges}} have motivated development of innovative techniques to satisfy energy demand while minimizing emissions. To this end, hydrogen {{as an alternative}} energy carrier in the transportation sector is an attractive option. In addition, {{there is already a}} great need for hydrogen gas in several industrial processes such as <b>hydro-cracking</b> of crude oil to produce gasoline and production of ammonia and methanol. The current dominant methods of hydrogen production from fossil fuels are well-developed and have reached relatively high energy efficiencies (up to 85 %), but these methods rely on non-renewable natural resources and produce carbon dioxide emissions. This work investigates the feasibility of hydrogen production by dissociating water molecules in a radio-frequency (RF) plasma discharge. In addition to the widespread usage of hydrogen gas, applications of water plasma have permeated in many areas of research, and information on basic behaviors of a water plasma discharge will provide fruitful insights for other researchers. An RF plasma source equipped with a double-helix antenna (m = 1 mode) and an applied axial magnetic field is designed to operate on water vapor. It is shown that water molecules are being dissociated in the discharge. Experimental results show that the rate of hydrogen production increases linearly with RF power {{in the absence of the}} applied axial magnetic field. With the magnetic field, the rate of hydrogen production increases from 250 to 500 W, and begins to saturate with RF power. Despite this saturation, it is shown that hydrogen increases with magnetic field strength at a fixed RF power. Further, the rate of hydrogen production increases with water input flow rate up to 100 sccm for a fixed RF power level, and begins to decrease at 125 sccm. This dissertation characterizes the rate of hydrogen production and plasma properties as a function of RF power, applied B-field strength, and water input flow rate. A zero-dimensional kinetics model is used to determine the theoretical energy efficiency...|$|E
