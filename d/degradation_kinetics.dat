40|$|Protein ubiquitination and {{degradation}} play {{important roles in}} many biological functions and are associated with many human diseases. It {{is well known that}} for biochemical oscillations to occur, proper degradation rates of the participating proteins are needed. In most mathematical models of biochemical reactions, linear <b>degradation</b> <b>kinetics</b> has been used. However, the <b>degradation</b> <b>kinetics</b> in real systems may be nonlinear, and how nonlinear <b>degradation</b> <b>kinetics</b> affects biological oscillations are not well understood. In this study, we first develop a biochemical reaction model of protein ubiquitination {{and degradation}} and calculate the degradation rate against the concentration of the free substrate. We show that the protein <b>degradation</b> <b>kinetics</b> mainly follows the Michaelis-Menten formulation with a time delay caused by ubiquitination and deubiquitination. We then study analytically how the Michaelis-Menten <b>degradation</b> <b>kinetics</b> affects the instabilities that lead to oscillations using three generic oscillation models: 1) a positive feedback mediated oscillator; 2) a positive-plus-negative feedback mediated oscillator; and 3) a negative feedback mediated oscillator. In all three cases, nonlinear <b>degradation</b> <b>kinetics</b> promotes oscillations, especially for the negative feedback mediated oscillator, resulting in much larger oscillation amplitudes and slower frequencies than those observed with linear kinetics. However, the time delay due to protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination generally suppresses oscillations, reducing the amplitude and increasing the frequency of the oscillations. These theoretical analyses provide mechanistic insights into the effects of specific protein...|$|E
