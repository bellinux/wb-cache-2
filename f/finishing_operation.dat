40|$|This {{article is}} focused on {{influence}} of <b>finishing</b> <b>operations</b> on the surface quality of polymer products. <b>Finishing</b> <b>operations</b> are the necessary part {{in the production of}} injection mold cavities. Surface quality of cavities is reflected to quality of future polymer products. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} use appropriate <b>finishing</b> <b>operations</b> and its technological conditions from the aesthetic point of view. However, it is not always necessary to use time consuming and most expensive <b>finishing</b> <b>operations,</b> because the polymeric products are not able to achieve similar surface quality as cavities. The different surface quality of injection molded parts can be also expected using various supramolecular structure of polymer (amorphous, semicrystalline). Supramolecular structure of polymer determines the future properties of product as well as the distribution of the individual macromolecules in the polymer chain. Divergent distribution may result to achievement of different surface quality of injection molded parts. This research {{is focused on}} finding an influence of supramolecular structure of chosen polymer on the surface quality of polymer product. Â© 2016. Published by Manufacturing Technology.

40|$|AbstractProduction {{engineers}} need {{to focus}} increasingly on the sustainability of manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, there are a confusingly high number of sustainability indicators available and they mostly focus on energy and material efficiency. These indicators are, however, not all appropriate for <b>finishing</b> <b>operations.</b> For example, many efficiency indicators relate to the material volume processed, but since the volume is very small in <b>finishing</b> <b>operations,</b> the material removal rarely is the best indicator. This paper discusses more appropriate efficiency indicators for <b>finishing</b> <b>operations</b> which are calculated as ratio of change in process performance or part quality divided by the needed resources. Three efficiency indicators based on average roughness, average peak-to-valley height and subjective part quality are then used in a case study on vibratory grinding.

50|$|The {{traditional}} shoemaker would {{measure the}} feet {{and cut out}} upper leathers according to the required size. These parts were fitted and stitched together. The sole was next assembled, consisting {{of a pair of}} inner soles of soft leather, a pair of outer soles of firmer texture, a pair of welts or bands about one inch broad, of flexible leather, and lifts and top-pieces for the heels. The insole was then attached to a last made of wood, which was used to form the shoe. Some lasts were straight, while curved lasts came in pairs: one for left shoes, the other for right shoes. The 'lasting' procedure then secured the leather upper to the sole with tacks. The soles were then hammered into shape; the heel lifts were then attached with wooden pegs and the worn out-sole was nailed down to the lifts. The <b>finishing</b> <b>operation</b> included paring, rasping, scraping, smoothing, blacking, and burnishing the edges of soles and heels, scraping, sand-papering, and burnishing the soles, withdrawing the lasts, and cleaning out any pegs which may have pierced through the inner sole.|$|E

40|$|Fused Deposition Modeling {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{additive}} manufacturing technology to produce prototypes and final parts without geometrical complexity limitations. One of the most limiting aspects of this technology is the obtainable roughness. Frequently, to comply with the component requirements, it is necessary to improve surface quality by finishing operations. Barrel Finishing is typically employed in industry to finish Fused Deposition Modeling components due to the advantage that the part does not need to be clamped and the process parameters are marginally affected by the part shape. The aim of this work is to develop a geometrical model of the deposited filament in order to predict the surface roughness of part after Barrel <b>Finishing</b> <b>operation.</b> The model depends upon the Fused Deposition Modeling process parameters, namely the layer thickness and the deposition angle, and the material removed during Barrel <b>Finishing</b> <b>operation.</b> The estimation of this quantity is measured as function of working time by a profilometer procedure showing an inverse square relationship, as confirmed by the statistical analysis. The proposed formulation is not restricted to average roughness: several parameters are provided. The theoretical models are validated by an experimental campaign. The comparison between modeled and experimental data shows significant reliability by means of statistical analysis. This formulation is a useful tool in Computer Aided Manufacturing step to choose the optimum combination of process parameters in order to obtain the desired results provided by Barrel <b>Finishing</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|E
