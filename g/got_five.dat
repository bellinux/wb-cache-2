25|$|The next {{match was}} also won by New Zealand, whose first innings total of 372 {{was the highest}} all series; West Indies' two totals of 192 and 218 were the two lowest in {{completed}} innings. Despite lacking Shane Bond, New Zealand's bowlers got the twenty wickets required, with James Franklin taking seven including a first-innings five-for and Kyle Mills six. With New Zealand helped by half-centuries from Peter Fulton, Stephen Fleming and Nathan Astle then defied Fidel Edwards, who <b>got</b> <b>five</b> for 65, and New Zealand made it to a series-clinching ten-wicket win after 23 not out from Hamish Marshall. In the third Test, West Indies made it to 256 for 4 in the 78.1 overs possible {{on the first two}} days, and the other three were rained off as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} found match documentation {{was from}} 9 January 1864, when Bells Life in Victoria printed the complete scores of a match between Andersons Creek and Caledonia (now St Andrews), and many noted early residents took part including James Masterton, who <b>got</b> <b>five</b> wickets in each innings. Masterton owned a rich mining claim almost opposite the Old Catholic Church in Brackenbury Street. In 1856 he caused {{quite a stir}} in the Melbourne Argus when he found 12oz. of gold in a tub of quartz. Others who took part were the Squires brothers who ran the Grocers Shop in the Main Street for 40 years, which {{it is now the}} Foodlands Store, Stiggants the pioneer orchardist on Pound Road, while Ewen Hugh Cameron who later represented the district in Parliament for 40 years took two wickets for Caledonia. Anderson's Creek won a brilliant victory scoring 114 to their opponents 26 and 36.|$|E
25|$|The group {{stage of}} this tournament began on 6 January and ran until 10 January, {{three days before}} the VB Series began. The Bulls opened against the Tigers at the Gabba in the first group, losing their first four wickets inside five overs with Ben Hilfenhaus taking two, but a 79-run {{partnership}} between Jimmy Maher and Steve Paulsen took the Bulls past the 15-over mark. Hilfenhaus got another wicket, ending with three for 17, and Paulsen was caught off the very last ball to end with 45 of the Bulls' total of seven for 136. In the fourth over of the Tigers' innings, heavy rain stopped play with the score on one for 15, and play was not restarted. In Group A, the Bushrangers batted to nine for 163 in 20 overs, though the Warriors' Ben Edmondson conceded only 16 in his four overs, taking three wickets. Cameron White and Liam Buchanan then put on 69 for the fourth wicket, and the last 43 balls yielded 74 runs for the Bushrangers. Adam Voges made a half-century, but after three run outs the Warriors needed eight off the last five balls. They <b>got</b> <b>five,</b> thus losing by two runs.|$|E

25|$|The Blue Jays {{played against}} the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium on Opening Day and won, 6–1. Toronto scored five {{runs in the}} third inning. Prospects Devon Travis and Miguel Castro made their MLB debuts, with Travis {{recording}} his first career hit, a solo home run. Drew Hutchison, who became the youngest opening day starter in Blue Jays history, pitched six innings giving up three hits, including a solo home run to Brett Gardner. Castro got the final four outs to close out the game. With the win, the Blue Jays opening day record improved to 20–19. After an off-day, Toronto suffered a 4–3 loss to New York. Entering the 8th inning with a 3–1 lead, Aaron Loup put all three batters he faced on base, before Brett Cecil entered the game and allowed all three to score. Due to his poor performance, Cecil was temporarily {{moved out of the}} closer role, and was replaced by Miguel Castro. In the series finale, prospect Daniel Norris earned his first MLB win, while Castro closed out the game for his first MLB save as the Blue Jays won 6–3. Toronto <b>got</b> <b>five</b> singles in the second inning to get four runs. Toronto won the series 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{purchasing}} new rolling stock for the Gråkallen Line, the city trams were to start {{operating on the}} line. Trondheim Sporvei needed buses for {{the closing of the}} Singsaker Line, and made a deal with Graakalbanen, where the latter would purchase four new Büssing buses and rent them out to Trondheim Sporvei for the amortization cost, in exchange for renting excess trams. Each bus cost NOK 237,000. However, {{there was a lack of}} material in Trondheim Sporvei, and not until 7 November 1966 could a TS Class 7 city tram be taken into use. This was supplemented with a trailer on 6 February 1967. Also, there was operated a direct route from Lian to Lade during the morning rush hour. Seven additional buses were ordered in 1968, financed through a NOK 1.750,000 loan. In exchange the company <b>got</b> <b>five</b> additional trams. However, Trondheim Sporvei had problems delivering the trams. With this deal in place, the oldest trams could be retired. However, during from 30 June to 19 August 1968, Trondheim Sporvei needed the trams again, and the old Class 1 was back in service. The final run of the Class 1 in regular service was on 29 November 1968. From 19 May 1969 the trams lost their conductors.|$|E
25|$|Leicestershire {{prevailed in}} a match at Old Trafford where 726 runs were scored in four {{completed}} innings and Leicestershire's young bowler Stuart Broad and captain HD Ackerman starred. Leicestershire chose to bat {{after winning the}} toss, and were taken apart by Glen Chapple and Murali Kartik, who shared nine wickets, while the highest partnership for Leicestershire was worth 53. The lack of veteran bowler Dominic Cork {{did not seem to}} bother Lancashire unduly, as Chapple <b>got</b> <b>five</b> wickets for 22 runs and Kartik four for 43. Only Jon Maunders and HD Ackerman passed 20 for the visitors, and they were all out for 165. Lancashire accumulated runs slowly, and their score was 61 for 2 at the close of play on the first day. With Mal Loye out with an injury, Lancashire posted 191, Maunders taking four for 28 and Stuart Broad three for 57 to limit Lancashire's lead to 26 runs. An opening partnership of 63 saw Leicestershire take the lead, but spinners Murali Kartik and Andrew Symonds took two wickets each, while the three seamers Chapple, Sajid Mahmood and Anderson took one each to round off the day. Ackerman was left overnight on 37 - 11 short of the highest score in the match so far.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{recorded}} a thumping 10-wicket win over Bangladesh to level their head-to-head {{record in the}} NatWest Series to 1–1. Under leaden skies at Old Trafford, Ricky Ponting made the wise decision and chose to bowl, and short-balls from Brett Lee immediately had the Bangladeshis worried. They survived six overs without loss before Javed Omar was trapped by an in-swinger for a 20-ball 3. Tushar Imran was next to fall to Lee, and many expected a procession to begin, but Shahriar Nafees and Mohammad Ashraful gave the crowd a treat with some special strokes. Ashraful had two top-edged sixes, as Lee was dispatched for 20 runs in the 11th over. By the drinks break after 15 overs, Bangladesh were 76 for 2, having added 53 from the last 39 balls. Ponting, however, brought on the spinners Brad Hogg and Andrew Symonds, who both got {{a fair amount of}} turn out of the Old Trafford pitch, and Symonds had Shahriar bowled for 47 with a yorker that he played late to. The next ball, he got the out-of-form captain Habibul Bashar, and the wickets began to tumble quickly. Symonds <b>got</b> <b>five</b> wickets for 18 runs, Hogg three for 29, Bangladesh collapsed from 137 for 6 (when Khaled Mashud was bowled by Hogg) to 139 all out in three overs, as Ashraful went for 58 and no one else really offering any resistance to the slow Australian bowlers.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} innings, England were 124/8 {{at one point}} and looked sure to be {{dismissed}} for a very low first innings score. Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann then had a partnership of 73 runs and salvaged the innings for England who were eventually dismissed for 221. In reply, India reached a dominant score of 267/4 with Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh sharing a partnership of 128 runs before England bowler Stuart Broad took a hat-trick, dismissing MS Dhoni (caught Anderson), Harbhajan Singh (lbw) and Praveen Kumar (bowled) and finished with his best Test figures to date, with 6 for 46. This hat-trick {{was part of a}} remarkable spell of 16 balls in which Broad <b>got</b> <b>five</b> wickets without conceding a run. India were eventually also dismissed for less than 300, with 288. Ian Bell was involved in a controversial run-out decision with the final delivery before tea on the third day when he was on 139 not out. Bell walked off the field, believing that the previous shot played by Eoin Morgan had gone to the boundary for four. However, the ball had been kept in play and was thrown back to the middle, where India removed the bails. It was referred to the third umpire, Billy Bowden, who gave Bell out. During the tea interval, England captain Andrew Strauss and coach Andy Flower met with the Indian captain Dhoni and their coach Duncan Fletcher and they agreed to withdraw the appeal. Bell was eventually dismissed for 159. England continued to bat strongly with tail-ender Tim Bresnan getting 90 runs. England were eventually bowled out for 544 runs, setting India a target of 478 runs to win. India's response to this target was poor and they slumped to 68/6 at tea on day 4. England dismissed India's top second innings scorer, Sachin Tendulkar for 56 soon after tea. England wrapped the game up in the evening session, finally dismissing India for 158 runs, winning by 319 runs.|$|E

[...] "Marty Hogan, who is playing temporarily in middle {{field for the}} Indianapolis team of the western league...is covering himself in glory with his superb playing", the Vindicator reported on June 4, 1895. [...] "The Indianapolis Sentinel of May 31st says: Hogan made a great record at the bat yesterday morning", the newspaper added. [...] "One of the drives was for a home run {{and three of the}} hits were bunts". [...] In addition, the article credited Hogan with four runs, five base hits, and two put outs in a late morning game against a rival team from St. Paul, Minnesota. [...] The Vindicator went on to quote the Indianapolis Journal as follows: [...] "Among the features of the forenoon game was Hogan's batting. [...] He <b>got</b> <b>five</b> hits, one a home run, and his bunting was even cleverer than usual, and that is saying a great deal".

500|$|After {{having spent}} most of his minor league career as an infielder, he was used almost {{exclusively}} as an outfielder with the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League in 1981. He batted [...]302 with 73 steals, and received a September call-up to the major leagues. In his first stint with the Padres, he <b>got</b> <b>five</b> hits in 14 at bats. Wiggins began the following season with the Islanders, but he was called up again by the Padres in early May to replace injured outfielder Gene Richards. Wiggins was leading San Diego with 29 stolen bases in 59 games when he was arrested for possession of cocaine in July. He was issued a 30-day suspension from baseball, and spent a month in a substance abuse treatment facility. The Padres, who were one of the first sports teams to offer an employee assistance program to its players, paid for all of his treatment, and he returned to the team in September. By 1983, Wiggins had become a regular in the Padres lineup. He batted in the leadoff spot, playing in the outfield for most of the season. Though he was exceptional on defense in left field, he was moved to first base for the last 45 games of the year after Steve Garvey suffered a broken thumb. He hit [...]276 and picked up 139 hits that year. His 66 stolen bases, good for second in the league, broke the Padres single-season record of 61 set by Richards in 1980. Wiggins was named the team's most valuable player that season.|$|E
