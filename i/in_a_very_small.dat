5|$|Wagner {{planned for}} a {{collected}} {{edition of his}} publications as early as 1865; he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims. The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress. Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben was originally published for close friends only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Upon moving inland in east-central Florida, the {{hurricane}} produced a storm tide {{of up to}} 10feet (3m) in St. Lucie County. In New Smyrna Beach, the storm tide washed away much of the beach {{to the east of}} the city seawall. Overall impact from the storm tide was less than expected, due to the storm hitting at low tide. Jeanne produced peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> north of the center near Sebastian, though the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of the strongest winds remaining over water. The National Weather Service office in Melbourne recorded sustained winds of 91mph (147km/h), which was the strongest official sustained wind reading; stronger readings were not available due to widespread power outages along its track. Wind gusts peaked at 128mph (206km/h) in Fort Pierce. In addition to the winds, {{the hurricane}} dropped heavy rainfall in the vicinity of its eyewall, peaking at 11.97inches (304mm) in Kenansville. The rainfall caused freshwater flooding, as well as increased levels along the St. Johns River. The hurricane also produced several eyewall mesovortices and tornadoes near where it moved ashore.|$|E

25|$|Haptanthus hazlettii {{has only}} been found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> area of {{tropical}} rain forest on the northern coast of Honduras, close to Matarras in the Arizona Municipality. After the original specimen was collected in 1989, numerous {{attempts were made to}} find the species again but without success; the area had become covered with grass following tree clearance. It was thought that the species was perhaps extinct. In 2010 an expedition organized by Alexey Shipunov and Ekaterina Shipunova found a single tree 2km from the original collection point. A few more were later found nearby. Work to conserve the species is being led by the Lancetilla Botanical Garden of Tela, Honduras.|$|E

25|$|Henneman {{proposed}} that the mechanism underlying the Size Principle was that the smaller motor neurons had a smaller surface area and therefore a higher membrane resistance. He predicted that the current generated by an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPs) {{would result in a}} higher voltage change (depolarization) across the neuronal membrane of the smaller motor neurons and therefore larger EPSPs in smaller motoneurons. Burke later demonstrated that there was a graded decrease of both EPSP and inhibitory post synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes from small to large motoneurons. This seemed to confirm Henneman's idea, but Burke disagreed, pointing out that larger neurons with a larger surface area had space for more synapses. Burke eventually showed (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> sample of neurons) that smaller motoneurons have a greater number of synaptic inputs from a single input source. The topic is probably still regarded as controversial.|$|E
25|$|British Dakota and Hastings {{aircraft}} carrying essential {{goods and}} raw materials began using Tegel {{on a regular basis}} from 17 November 1948. Regular cargo flights with American C-54s followed from 14 December 1948. Generally, the former carried food and fuel while the latter were loaded with coal. December 1948 also saw three Armée de l'Air Junkers Ju 52/3m transport planes participating in the airlift for the first time. However, the Armée de l'Air contributed to the overall airlift effort <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> and symbolic way only. As a result of committing the small French transport fleet to the growing war effort in Indochina, as well as the joint Anglo-American decision to employ only four-engined planes {{for the remainder of the}} airlift to increase the number of flights and the amount of cargo carried on each flight by taking advantage of those aircraft's higher speeds and greater capacities, the French participation ceased.|$|E
25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, it is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), {{as well as the}} redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.|$|E

25|$|Following several aborted {{attempts}} at {{various forms of}} incorporation and association, in 1890 the college began to establish closer links with the University of St Andrews, a process which was completed in 1897 when University College {{became part of the}} University of St Andrews. This move was of notable benefit to both, enabling the University of St Andrews (which was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> burgh (roughly equivalent to a conurbation), and remains so) to support a medical school. Medical students could choose to undertake preclinical studies either in Dundee or St Andrews (at the Bute Medical School) after which all students would undertake their clinical studies at Dundee. Eventually, law, dentistry and other professional subjects were taught at University College. By 1904 University College had a roll of 208, making up 40 per cent of the roll of the University generally. By session 1909-10 234 students were studying at University College, 101 of whom were female. Among the notable students at this time were Robert Watson-Watt, the radar pioneer; William Alexander Young the epidemiologist who later died in Accra while studying yellow fever; and David Rutherford Dow who would go on to be a senior member of staff at the college.|$|E
