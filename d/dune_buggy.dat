25|$|The <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> is {{the vehicle}} used most to drive along the beaches. Some {{companies}} offer tours in Land Rovers and other 4WD vehicles, these cars offer much more comfort, but buggy drivers {{claim that the}} buggy is more flexible. Riding a buggy, people feel {{the sun and the}} wind. Buggies are safe, accidents with buggies are much less frequent than accidents with other cars (most <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> drivers are certified by the Tourist Authority).|$|E

25|$|Smith {{was born}} September 24, 1969 in El Paso, Texas to Ivan Smith and Janice Pvirre {{but when he}} was nine the family moved to Tampa, Florida. As a child he {{attended}} public schools and enjoyed sports, especially American football. He also liked riding skateboards and bicycles, playing pranks with his friends and younger sister Lisa. In high school he became interested in carpentry, even finding a part-time job as a carpenter's assistant. He also liked to work on cars, especially old ones, and enjoyed taking things apart to see how they worked, even restoring a <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> with a friend. In 1989 he graduated from Tampa Bay Vocational Tech High School and shortly thereafter joined the United States Army in October 1989.|$|E
500|$|Set in an {{assortment}} of locations around the world, the series follows three teenagers (Mark, Debbie, and Tinker) and a talking <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> as they partake in various adventures. Speed Buggy, the <b>dune</b> <b>buggy,</b> was designed by Tinker and participates in racing competitions in order to collect [...] "winner's trophies". During their travels, the crew often defeats villains and crooks {{in order to save}} the world, such as diamond thieves, car-obsessed doctors, and evil pirates. Known as the [...] "Speed Buggs", the group of three teenagers is able to activate Speed Buggy {{through the use of a}} portable walkie-talkie. Several episodes in the series feature reworked versions of storylines from Hanna-Barbera's Josie & the Pussycats.|$|E

His {{headlights}} and front grille serve as his eyes and mouth, respectively. He served as the [...] "wacky hero" [...] of the series with St. Bernard-like qualities. Blanc's frequent work as a voice actor with Hanna-Barbera landed him the position. His voice was similar to the Maxwell automobile he portrayed on the radio series The Jack Benny Program.|$|E
500|$|Speed Buggy {{would not}} be the last time Hanna-Barbera {{incorporated}} automobiles into animation. Both Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch and Wonder Wheels also featured cars that were able to talk and act like humans. Perlmutter grouped the three shows together, calling them a [...] "trilogy". Wonderbug, an occasional live-action segment on ABC's The Krofft Supershow (1976-1978), featured three teenagers and a talking <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> and often drew comparisons to Speed Buggy. Also compared to the show was Adult Swim's Mike Tyson Mysteries, with Rolling Stones James Montgomery calling it an ode to classic cartoons like Speed Buggy, Scooby-Doo, and Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels.|$|E
500|$|A unique launch system propels riders up the [...] hill. The {{system was}} {{developed}} by Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation. A prototype launch system was designed by January 1995. The prototype consisted {{of a series of}} boxcars welded together to form a launch tunnel. A track-mounted <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> was then propelled inside the tunnel {{through the use of a}} weight drop launch mechanism. The designers then experimented with different rates of acceleration, each emitting between one and five times the force of gravity. The final system which was implemented on The Incredible Hulk sees trains launch from 0 to [...] in 2 seconds. Riders travel at an angle of 30 degrees through a [...] tunnel, pulling 1G. To power this launch the designers investigated a variety of systems ranging from hydraulic, pneumatic, cable, steam catapult, and conveyor belt. In the end a drive tire system was selected, where 230 electrical motors power a set of tires that pinch the train's underside to provide propulsion. As this system required eight megawatts of power to launch a train, the park built several customized motor generator sets with large flywheels. Without these stored energy units, they would have had to build a whole substation and risk browning-out the local energy grid with every launch. The launch system made The Incredible Hulk the only B ride to feature a launch, until Thunderbird opened at Holiday World in 2015. Unlike The Incredible Hulk, Thunderbird uses a Linear Synchronous Motors (LSM) launch system that was designed by B ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, {{the amateur}} fossil hunter Rubén D. Carolini {{discovered}} the tibia of a theropod dinosaur while driving a <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> in the badlands near Villa El Chocón, in the Neuquén province of Patagonia, Argentina. Specialists from the National University of Comahue {{were sent to}} excavate the specimen after being notified of the find. The discovery was announced by the Argentinean palaeontologists Rodolfo Coria and Leonardo Salgado at a Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in 1994, where American science writer Don Lessem offered to fund the excavation, after having been impressed by {{a photo of the}} leg-bone. The partial skull was scattered over an area of about 10 square metres (110 sq ft), and the postcranial skeleton was disarticulated. The specimen preserved almost 70% of the skeleton, and included most of the vertebral column, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, the femora, and the left tibia and fibula. In 1995, this specimen (MUCPv-Ch1) was preliminarily described in Nature by Coria and Salgado, who made it the holotype of the new genus and species Giganotosaurus carolinii (parts of the skeleton were still encased in plaster at this time). The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words gigas/γίγας (meaning [...] "giant"), notos/νότος (meaning [...] "austral/southern", in reference to its provenance) and -sauros/-σαύρος (meaning [...] "lizard"). The specific name honours Carolini, the discoverer. The holotype skeleton is now housed in the Ernesto Bachmann Palaeontological [...] Museum in Villa El Chocón, which was inaugurated in 1995 at the request of Carolini. The specimen is the main exhibition at the museum, and is placed on the sandy floor of a room devoted to the animal, along with tools used by palaeontologists during the excavation. A mounted reconstruction of the skeleton is exhibited in an adjacent room.|$|E

50|$|In Manson's view, <b>dune</b> <b>buggies</b> {{were the}} ideal {{vehicles}} of the apocalypse; they {{would enable the}} Family to outrun police in the Bottomless Pit and were light enough that {{a few of the}} girls could carry them. During the war, the Family would be making forays from the Bottomless Pit. Accordingly, the <b>dune</b> <b>buggies</b> the Family acquired, licitly and otherwise, were fitted, on Manson's inspiration, with machine gun mounts; while the men would drive, the girls would operate the guns.|$|R

Escaping the town, Gordon discovers a resistance outpost, and uses a customized <b>dune</b> <b>buggy</b> to travel a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt, encountering Combine patrols and helping the resistance fend off raids.|$|E

Some are even built for and used as on-road vehicles. Typically the function is determined before the buggy is created in order to maximize the comfort or abilities of the vehicle.|$|R
