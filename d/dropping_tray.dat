50|$|In the video, {{directed}} by Philipp Stölzl in Bucharest, Romania, the band are performing {{a concert in}} what looks {{to be an old}} Victorian mansion. During the verses, a maid is seen constantly busy serving the masters of the house in {{what appears to be the}} past of the mansion. The maid sees (lead singer) Lauri and the concert in mirrors on the walls, which causes her to become distracted, making mistakes and <b>dropping</b> <b>trays.</b> Eventually, while despairing over her errors in her room, she sees Lauri and all the fans in her mirror, while the master of the house is approaching with somebody else, possibly the head maid, presumably to reprimand the new maid. Lauri tugs her through the mirror in her room to where they are performing. She then finishes watching the concert. It concludes with the master of the house and the others entering to find the maid's room empty.|$|R

Early on, he expressed {{great pride in}} Jim for mastering the task of heating fish fillet buns, but when Jim <b>dropped</b> a <b>tray</b> of hamburgers, he didn't speak to Jim {{the rest of the}} day. After Jim left McDonald's {{at the end of his}} freshman year, he snubbed Jim when they met outside the store.|$|R

40|$|We have {{conducted}} experiments {{to determine the}} equilibration rates of some major precipitants used in protein crystallography aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The solutions {{were placed in the}} Protein Crystallization Apparatus for Microgravity (PCAM) which mimic Cryschem sitting <b>drop</b> <b>trays.</b> The trays were placed in cylinders. These cylinders were placed inside a Single locker Thermal Enclosure System (STES), and were activated for different durations during the flight. Bumpers pressed against elastomers seal drops in a deactivated state during pre-flight and prior to transfer to the ISS. Activation occurs while in flight on the ISS by releasing the bumpers allowing the drops to be exposed to the reservoir. PCAM was flown to the ISS on STS 100, Flight 6 A, on April 19, 2001. Six series of equilibration experiments were tested for each precipitant {{with a small amount of}} Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Cylinder 10 was never activated, 7 was activated for 40 days, 8 was activated for 20 days, 9 was activated for 10 days, 11 was activated for 4 days and 12 was activated for 2 days. Upon the return to Earth by STS 104 on July 24, 2001 the samples were transferred to Marshall Space Flight Center. The samples were then brought to the lab and the volumes of each sample were measured...|$|R
60|$|Then Courthorne {{looked around}} and for a moment; set his lips tight, while the girl would have <b>dropped</b> the <b>tray</b> had he not {{stretched}} out a hand and seized it. A dark flush swept into her face and then as suddenly faded out of it, leaving her very pale. She stood gazing at him, and the fingers of one hand quivered on the tray, which he still held. He was, as it happened, the first to recover himself, {{and there was a}} little sardonic gleam in his eyes as he lifted down one of the plates.|$|R

His idea was to [...] "stage an accident" [...] and have the song's tapes erased. He said that this was not to force {{abandonment}} of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, <b>dropped</b> the <b>tray</b> of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno.|$|R

The next trial is Concilium - mind control; Misty (Lily Rabe) and Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe) succeed on each other. Madison (Emma Roberts), instead of demonstrating her power on Zoe (Taissa Farmiga), makes Kyle (Evan Peters), now the new caretaker, <b>drop</b> his <b>tray</b> of {{beverages}} and walk over to Madison to kiss her. Zoe responds by making Kyle do the same thing. Furious, Madison makes him choke Zoe. The altercation is broken up by Cordelia (Sarah Paulson), who flings Kyle across the room.|$|R
5000|$|Flo and {{her friend}} Darla (featured in Diner Dash 2) go on a vacation. However, whilst {{boarding}} the ship, Flo's suitcase containing her clothes accidentally falls overboard. As the pair eat at the on-board restaurant, a waiter slips, <b>dropping</b> his <b>tray.</b> Flo catches it, and the manager comments that she [...] "looks like she's handled a tray before". Flo explains that she owns a restaurant along with Darla, and since the crew is short-handed, the manager asks Flo {{to work for the}} ship's crew. In return, the manager offers to refund their tickets, as well as pay them for their services. Using the money from this offer, Flo plans to buy herself some new clothes on the on-board store. The vacation takes the pair through the cruise, riding the rails, exploring the deep, waiting tables in the sky, and into the reaches of space.|$|R
50|$|At a coroner's inquest October 20, {{a jury of}} nine men {{found that}} Bauerdorf's death was a {{homicide}} and proposed a thorough investigation to apprehend her killer. During the hearing, Fred Atwood, janitor of the apartment building, provided new evidence for deputies. He said he heard woman's heels clicking {{back and forth on}} the floor, followed by a loud crash, like a <b>tray</b> <b>dropping</b> on the floor. He was awakened by this noise around midnight on October 11. He recognized the sounds as coming from Bauerdorf's apartment. He said there was no one with her.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum {{distillation}} column internals must provide good vapor-liquid contacting while, {{at the same}} time, maintaining a very low pressure increase {{from the top of}} the column top to the bottom. Therefore, the vacuum column uses distillation trays only where withdrawing products from the side of the column (referred to as side draws). Most of the column uses packing material for the vapor-liquid contacting because such packing has a lower pressure <b>drop</b> than distillation <b>trays.</b> This packing material can be either structured sheet metal or randomly dumped packing such as Raschig rings.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a crash, the {{breaking}} of glass, and an exclamation. Tournelli, no doubt disorganized by the unusual hurry, {{on his way to}} our table had <b>dropped</b> his <b>tray,</b> impartially distributed a plate of asparagus over an adjoining table, and, flushed and nervous, yet with an affectation of studied calmness, was pouring the sauce into the young Quartermaster's plate, in spite of his languid protests. At any other time we would have laughed, but there was something in the exaggerated agitation of the Italian that checked our mirth. Why should he be so upset by a trifling accident? He could afford to pay for the breakage; he would laugh at dismissal. Was it the sensitiveness of a refined nature, or--he was young and good-looking--was he disconcerted by the fact that our handsome neighbor had witnessed his awkwardness? But she was not laughing, and, as far as I could see, was intently regarding the bill of fare.|$|R
50|$|Work in the United States {{began in}} 1953, when Grierson {{was one of}} the {{founding}} instructors at the American Numismatic Society's annual summer school. He returned the following year, and in 1955 was invited to become honorary adviser and curator at the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington DC, managed by the trustees of Harvard University. His brief was to use the centre's considerable resources to build up the world's finest collection of Byzantine coinage and publish it - a task which, by the time he left the post in 1997, he had completed admirably (despite once accidentally <b>dropping</b> a <b>tray</b> of gold coins down a lift shaft). The Catalogue of Byzantine Coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection remains the standard reference work for Byzantine coinage. At the height of his productivity, therefore, Grierson would spend the Michaelmas, Lent and Easter terms each year in Cambridge, Christmas and Easter in Brussels and two months of the summer vacation in Washington and at Cornell University.|$|R
5000|$|Late in 1978, the Raincoats {{became an}} all female band {{as they were}} joined by the Slits' ex-drummer Palmolive and the classically trained violinist Vicky Aspinall, with this line-up making their live debut at Acklam Hall in London on 4 January 1979. Managed by Shirley O'Loughlin, the band went on their first UK tour with Swiss female band Kleenex, in May 1979 after Rough Trade Records {{released}} their first single, [...] "Fairytale in the Supermarket". Johnny Rotten was an early admirer of the band, and later stated: [...] "The Raincoats offered a completely different way of doing things, as did X-Ray Spex and all the books about punk have failed to realise that these women were involved {{for no other reason than}} that they were good and original". The Raincoats' distinctly uncommercial sound did not appeal to everyone; after witnessing an early performance by the band, Danny Baker remarked that [...] "they are so bad that every time a waiter <b>drops</b> a <b>tray</b> we'd all get up and dance".|$|R
50|$|A heavy storm brews outside, and George hears {{a monstrous}} growl from the bedroom. It is his {{grandmother}} asking George for her tea. George is startled and hides, but convinces himself he's {{too old to}} behave this way and resigns himself to bring the tea. As he walks {{down the hall to}} the Gramma's room, George recalls conversations in which his mother and her siblings discussed how dangerous Gramma is now that she's senile. As George enters Gramma's room, he considers how awful it would be if she died while he was alone with her. A gnarled hand reaches out from the bedclothes. This startles George, and he <b>drops</b> the tea <b>tray</b> and flees the room.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, strippers can be trayed or packed. Packed columns, {{and particularly}} when random packing is used, are usually favored for smaller columns with a diameter less than 2 feet and a packed height of {{not more than}} 20 feet. Packed columns can also be advantageous for corrosive fluids, high foaming fluids, when fluid velocity is high, and when particularly low pressure <b>drop</b> is desired. <b>Trayed</b> strippers are advantageous because of ease of design and scale up. Structured packing can be used similar to trays despite possibly being the same material as dumped (random) packing. Using structured packing is a common method to increase the capacity for separation or to replace damaged trays.|$|R
50|$|Sally, however, {{does not}} know that Blair has been forced into an {{engagement}} by his family with a socialite named Marcia (Nora Lane). One day, a theatrical agent shows up at Sally's work (T. Roy Barnes) and gives {{her a chance to}} audition for a job. Sally, however, ends up losing her job and the opportunity when she <b>drops</b> a <b>tray</b> of food into Barnes' lap. Eventually, Sally gets another job at the Elm Tree Inn, which is managed by Ford Sterling. Blair drops in one day and immediately takes an interest in Sally. He convinces Sterling to have Sally dance for his customers. While she is performing one day, the theatrical agent (T.

Undaunted, she proceeds with her life and eventually becomes a star on Broadway. Unfortunately she never forgets Blair and becomes terribly depressed until...|$|R
50|$|The dryer {{itself is}} {{composed}} of a large upright cylindrical chamber, inside of which are 25 to 30 layers of trays or 'hearths'. Hot air and gasses are distributed throughout the dryer {{by a series of}} fans and ducts. At the centre of the dryer is a rotating column, to which the trays are attached and positioned radially within the dryer. Material enters the top of the dryer and lands on one of the top trays. As the central column rotates, fixed arms push the material off the <b>tray,</b> <b>dropping</b> it down onto the one below it. Gradually the material works its way down through the dryer in this manner, and exits the bottom of the dryer with the assistance of fans.|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the optimum}} number of trays in a {{distillation}} column {{has been an}} important process optimization problem for over fifty years. Over the past decade this problem has been addressed successfully as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. But tools for solving MINLPs are not widespread, especially in connection with detailed simulation models. This paper therefore addresses the question: is there an accurate tray optimization formulation that can be solved using current nonlinear programming algorithms? In this study we obtained a positive answer by introducing a differentiable distribution function (DDF). In this formulation, all streams around a column, except the top and bottom products, are directed to all of the column trays using the DDF. As a result, the distributed flowrate of the entry or exit streams is directed to a specific tray based on the value of its DDF at that tray. This approach allows the placement of feeds, sidestreams and number of trays in the column to be continuous variables in the DDF and in the optimization problem it eliminates the need for integer variables. Instead, we formulate the tray optimization problem as an NLP using the original MESH model. In this approach it is critical to deal with trays that have no liquid or vapor flows. To describe this phenomenon properly in the optimization, complementary constraints are formulated and added to the NLP, by taking advantage of a smoothing algorithm developed by Gopal and Biegler for phase equilibrium. Also, since pressure in each tray has a substantial affect on distillation calculations, the pressure <b>drops</b> across each <b>tray</b> depend on the optimal number of trays and a related smoothing function formulation is presented that removes the pressure <b>drop</b> on dry <b>trays.</b> Pressu [...] ...|$|R
25|$|In December 2009 Alison Grieve, a 32-year-old {{waitress}} and event manager from Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, {{witnessed a}} waitress <b>drop</b> a <b>tray</b> full of glasses of champagne at a corporate event for {{a delegation of}} international lawyers. To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around the tray. The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right {{at the edge of the}} tray while still keeping the tray in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance downward force.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of motion}} {{strategies}} to eliminate uncertainty, {{without the use}} of sensors, is considered. The approach is demonstrated {{within the context of a}} simple method to orient planar objects. A randomly oriented object is <b>dropped</b> into a <b>tray.</b> When the tray is tilted, the object can slide into walls, along walls, and into corners, sometimes with the effect of reducing the number of possible orientations. For some objects a sequence of tilting operations exists that leaves the object 2 ̆ 7 s orientation completely determined. An automatic planner is described that constructs such a tilting program, using a simple model of the mechanics of sliding. The planner has been implemented, the resulting programs have been executed using a tray attached to an industrial manipulator, and sometimes the programs work. The authors explore the issue of sensorless manipulation, tray tilting in particular, within the context of a formal framework described by T. Lozano-Perez, M. T. Mason, and Russ Taylor (1984). It is observed that sensorless motion strategies perform conditional actions using mechanical decisions in place of environmental inquiries...|$|R
5000|$|In either case, {{the ball}} enters the playing field, which is {{populated}} {{by a large}} number of brass pins, several small cups into which the player hopes the ball will fall (each catcher is barely the width of the ball), and a hole at the bottom into which the ball will fall if it doesn't enter a catcher. The ball bounces from pin to pin, both slowing the fall and making it travel laterally across the field. A ball which enters a catcher will trigger a payout, in which a number of balls are <b>dropped</b> into a <b>tray</b> {{at the front of the}} machine. Many games made since the 1960s feature [...] "tulip" [...] catchers, which have small flippers which open to expand the width of the catcher. Tulip catchers are controlled by the machine, and may open and close randomly or in a pattern; an expert player might try to launch the ball with an impulse and timing to reach the catcher when the flippers are open. The object of the game is to capture as many balls as possible. These balls can then be exchanged for prizes. Pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, but modern ones have incorporated extensive electronics, becoming similar to video slot machines.|$|R
50|$|Reflux {{refers to}} {{the portion of the}} {{condensed}} overhead product that is returned to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for condensing the vapours flowing upwards. The reflux ratio, which is the ratio of the (internal) reflux to the overhead product, is conversely related to the theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the distillation products.Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the reflux ratio, heat reflux and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter and height. In most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include feed load size and properties and the type of distillation column used. The two major types of distillation columns used are tray and packing columns. Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are corrosive or temperature sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure <b>drop</b> is important. <b>Tray</b> columns, on the other hand, are used for larger columns with high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most oil refinery operations, tray columns are mainly used for the separation of petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.|$|R
