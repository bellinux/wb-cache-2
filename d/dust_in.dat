5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar <b>dust.</b> <b>In</b> its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> outdoor displays.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{modeling}} <b>dust</b> evolution <b>in</b> the ISM of the Galaxy are pre-sented.

40|$|<b>Dust</b> storms <b>in</b> Khuzestan {{province}} (Iran) {{are causing}} problems in industries and human health. To mitigate {{the impact of}} those phenomena, {{it is vital to}} know the physical and chemical characteristics of airborne <b>dusts.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we give an overview of the spatio-temporal occurrences and geochemical characteristics of airborne <b>dusts</b> <b>in</b> Khuzestan. Meteorological data from 10 stations in Khuzestan during 1996 – 2009 indicate (a) an average of 47 dust storm days per year, (b) a lowest annual average of 13 <b>dust</b> storm days <b>in</b> 1998, (c) a highest annual average of 104 <b>dust</b> storm days <b>in</b> 2008, and (d) an average increase of two dust storm days per year. Above-average number of dust storm days usually occurred in the cities of Dezful, Ahvaz, Masjed-e-Soleiman, Abadan and Bostan, whereas below-average number of dust storm days usually occurred in the cities of Mahshahr, Ramhormoz, Behbahan, Shoushtar and Izeh. XRD analyses of airborne <b>dust</b> samples collected <b>in</b> 2008 and 2009 show that the mineralogy of airborne dusts is dominated by calcite, followed by quartz and then kaolinite, with minor gypsum. SEM analyses of the samples indicate that airborne dusts have rounded irregular, prismatic and rhombic shapes. The sizes of airborne dusts vary from 2 to 52 μm, but 10 to 22 μmare the dominant sizes. The smallest and largest dust particles are clays, sulfates or carbonates. XRF and ICP analyses of the samples show that the most important oxide compositions of airborne dusts are SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, CaO and MgO. Estimates of enrichment factors (EF) for all studied elements show that Mn, Hf, U, Sc, K, V and Sr, with EF 10, are of anthropogenic origin. Flat REE patterns with depletion in Th, V, Nb, Zr and enrichment in Al, Rb, Sr and Mn indicate that airborne <b>dusts</b> <b>in</b> Khuzestan come from the same source, which is likely an eroded sedimentary environment outside Iran. <b>In</b> general, airborne <b>dusts</b> <b>in</b> Khuzestan are geochemically similar to airborne <b>dusts</b> elsewhere <b>in</b> the world...|$|R
5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected a stream of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 a major {{explosion}} at a colliery in Courrières, northern France, caused {{the deaths of}} more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes {{to the health and}} safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E

Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams, and eventually the last to discard them for more modern public transport. Although two trials of street level trains were run, the state of Adelaide's streets, with mud in winter and <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> summer, led to the decision {{that they would not}} be reliable.|$|E

5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 2009, exactly 15 {{years after}} the SL9 impacts, a new black spot {{about the size of}} the Pacific Ocean {{appeared}} in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Thermal infrared measurements showed the impact site was warm and spectroscopic analysis detected the production of excess hot ammonia and silica-rich <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> the upper regions of Jupiter's atmosphere. Scientists have concluded that another impact event had occurred, but this time a more compact and strong object, probably a small undiscovered asteroid, was the cause.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm or less. To maintain this amount of <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that {{were in the process of}} collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E
