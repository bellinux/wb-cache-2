5|$|In {{the last}} decade, some {{progress}} dealing with ultra-high-pressure inactivation of prion <b>infectivity</b> in processed meat has been reported.|$|E
5|$|<b>Infectivity</b> titre in TSEs roughly {{correlates}} with prion amyloid (PrPSc) titre, however, prion amyloid is absent in approximately 10% of CJD cases.|$|E
5|$|Familial {{prion disease}} occurs in {{families}} with a mutation in the PrP gene, and mice with PrP mutations develop prion disease despite controlled conditions where transmission is prevented. These mice can then transmit {{the disease to}} healthy, wild type mice, suggesting that mice with PrP mutations spontaneously generate <b>infectivity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Studies {{propagating}} TSE <b>infectivity</b> in cell-free {{reactions and}} in purified component chemical reactions {{is thought to}} strongly suggest against TSE viral nature. However, some viruses, such as Poliovirus, {{have the ability to}} replicate in cell-free reactions.|$|E
5|$|Tomb et al. {{complete}} {{sequencing of}} the entire 1,667,867 base pairs of the H. pylori genome. This assists in identifying new virulence factors for the <b>infectivity</b> of H. pylori on the molecular level.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} {{protease}} functions in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) {{is used in}} order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases <b>infectivity</b> by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine protease.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is {{the virus that}} was {{initially}} discovered and termed both LAV and HTLV-III. It is more virulent, more infective, and {{is the cause of}} the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower <b>infectivity</b> of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{preclinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} inhibitory effects of MFGM against several pathogens. Both whole bovine MFGM and its extracted lipid components were found to exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus <b>infectivity</b> in vitro. Antibacterial effects of MFGM have included decreased gastric colonization and inflammation after H. pylori infection in mice; inhibition of shiga toxin gene expression by E. coli O157:H7; and decreased colonization and translocation of L. monocytogenes. Mice that were fed prophylactically with bovine whey glycoprotein fraction, including MFGM proteins, did not develop diarrhea after exposure to rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their <b>infectivity,</b> their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their <b>infectivity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smallpox is not notably {{infectious}} in the prodromal {{period and}} viral shedding is usually delayed until {{the appearance of}} the rash, which is often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx. The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness, but is most frequent {{during the first week of}} the rash, when most of the skin lesions are intact. <b>Infectivity</b> wanes in 7 to 10 days when scabs form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is {{the virus that}} was {{originally}} discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more virulent, more infective, and {{is the cause of}} the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower <b>infectivity</b> of HIV-2 as compared with HIV-1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their <b>infectivity</b> can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of BSE is {{not well}} understood or documented like other diseases of this nature. Even though BSE is a disease that results in neurological defects, its pathogenesis occurs in areas that reside outside of the nervous system. There was a strong deposition of PrPSc initially located in the Ileal Peyer’s patches of the small intestine. The lymphatic system has been identified in the pathogenesis of scrapies, it has not, however, been determined to be {{an essential part of}} the pathogenesis of BSE. The Ileal Peyer’s patches have been the only organ from this system that has been found to play a major role in the pathogenesis. <b>Infectivity</b> of the Ileal Peyer's patches has been observed as early as 4 months after inoculation. PrPSc accumulation was found to occur mostly in tangible body macrophages of the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Tangible body macrophages involved in PrPSc clearance are thought to play a role in PrPSc accumulation in the Peyer’s patches. Accumulation of PrPSc was also found in follicular dendritic cells; however, it was of a lesser degree. Six months after inoculation, there was no <b>infectivity</b> in any tissues, only that of the ileum. This led researchers to believe that the disease agent replicates here. In naturally confirmed cases, there have been no reports of <b>infectivity</b> in the Ileal Peyer’s patches. Generally, in clinical experiments, high doses of the disease are administered. In natural cases, it was hypothesized that low doses of the agent were present, and therefore, <b>infectivity</b> could not be observed.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of <b>infectivity</b> is also unknown {{so it is}} unclear how long people must be isolated, but current recommendations are for 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. In the SARS outbreak the virus was not cultured from people after the resolution of their symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in nsP2 {{that produce}} noncytopathic viruses or a {{temperature}} sensitive phenotypes cluster at the P2/P3 interface region. P3 mutations opposite {{the location of}} the nsP2 noncytopathic mutations prevent efficient cleavage of P2/3. This in turn affects RNA <b>infectivity</b> altering viral RNA production levels.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>infectivity</b> {{describes}} {{the ability of}} an organism to enter, survive and multiply in the host, while the infectiousness of a disease agent indicates the comparative ease with which the disease agent is transmitted to other hosts. Transmission of pathogen can occur in various ways including physical contact, contaminated food, body fluids, objects, airborne inhalation, or through vector organisms.|$|E
25|$|When {{the immune}} system of a {{vertebrate}} encounters a virus, it may produce specific antibodies which bind to the virus and neutralize its <b>infectivity</b> or mark it for destruction. Antibody presence in blood serum {{is often used to}} determine whether a person has been exposed to a given virus in the past, with tests such as ELISA. Vaccinations protect against viral diseases, in part, by eliciting the production of antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, specific to the virus, are also used for detection, as in fluorescence microscopy.|$|E
25|$|The Coltivirus virions {{are about}} 60-80 {{nanometers}} {{in diameter and}} are not enveloped, and are generally a spherical shape with icosahedral symmetry. Each virion has two concentric capsid shells surrounding a core of about 50 nanometers in diameter. The surface of the particle is relatively smooth. The virus loses its <b>infectivity</b> when the surrounding fluid becomes acidic, around a pH of three, but is stable when the pH is between seven and eight. It also stops being a threat when the temperature becomes about fifty-five degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{autoclave}} treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial spores {{in addition}} to fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but {{is not expected to}} eliminate all prions, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state 121-132°C for 60 minutes or 134°C for at least 18 minutes. The 263K scrapie prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of CJD and BSE are more resistant. Using mice as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive brain tissue at 134-138°C for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 log decrease in prion <b>infectivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|It used to {{be thought}} that UV {{disinfection}} was more effective for bacteria and viruses, which have more-exposed genetic material, than for larger pathogens that have outer coatings or that form cyst states (e.g., Giardia) that shield their DNA from UV light. However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted {{in the use of}} UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn {{has been shown to be}} very susceptible to UV-C when the tests were based on <b>infectivity</b> rather than excystation. It has been found that protists are able to survive high UV-C doses but are sterilized at low doses.|$|E
25|$|Picornaviruses are classed under Baltimore's viral {{classification}} system as group IV viruses as they contain a single stranded, positive sense RNA genome. Their genome ranges between 7.1 and 8.9 kb (kilobases) in length. Like most positive sense RNA genomes, the genetic material alone is infectious; although substantially less virulent than if {{contained within the}} viral particle, the RNA can have increased <b>infectivity</b> when transfected into cells. The genome RNA is unusual {{because it has a}} protein on the 5' end that is used as a primer for transcription by RNA polymerase.This primer is called VPg genome range between 2–3 kb. VPg contain tyrosine residue at the 3’ end. Tyrosine as a –OH source for covalently linked to 5’ end of RNA.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their <b>infectivity,</b> their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Up until this time, viruses had only been grown in plants and animals, but in 1906, Ross Granville Harrison (1870–1959) invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E Steinhardt, C Israeli, and RA Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, HB and MC Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production. In 1941–42, George Hirst (1909–94) developed assays based on haemagglutination to quantify a wide range of viruses as well as virus-specific antibodies in serum.|$|E
25|$|Animal herpes viruses {{all share}} some common properties. The {{structure}} of herpes viruses {{consists of a}} relatively large double-stranded, linear DNA genome encased within an icosahedral protein cage called the capsid, which is wrapped in a lipid bilayer called the envelope. The envelope is joined to the capsid {{by means of a}} tegument. This complete particle is known as the virion. HSV-1 and HSV-2 each contain at least 74 genes (or open reading frames, ORFs) within their genomes, although speculation over gene crowding allows as many as 84 unique protein coding genes by 94 putative ORFs. These genes encode a variety of proteins involved in forming the capsid, tegument and envelope of the virus, as well as controlling the replication and <b>infectivity</b> of the virus. These genes and their functions are summarized in the table below.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the bigger}} intron is {{preferred}} to be spliced out, and since {{in the major}} splice the ACG codon is a much weaker translation initiation signal, the ratio at which the AAV structural proteins are synthesized in vivo is about 1:1:20, {{which is the same}} as in the mature virus particle. The unique fragment at the N terminus of VP1 protein was shown to possess the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, which is probably required for the releasing of AAV particles from late endosomes. Muralidhar et al. reported that VP2 and VP3 are crucial for correct virion assembly. More recently, however, Warrington et al. showed VP2 to be unnecessary for the complete virus particle formation and an efficient <b>infectivity,</b> and also presented that VP2 can tolerate large insertions in its N terminus, while VP1 can not, probably because of the PLA2 domain presence.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} {{reasonable}} to assume that irradiating food might lead to radiation-tolerant strains, similar to the way that strains of bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics. Bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics after an individual uses antibiotics repeatedly. Much like pasteurization plants, products that pass through irradiation plants are processed once, and are not processed and reprocessed. Cycles of heat treatment have been shown to produce heat-tolerant bacteria, yet no problems have appeared so far in pasteurization plants. Furthermore, when the irradiation dose is chosen to target a specific species of microbe, it is calibrated to doses several times the value required to target the species. This ensures that the process randomly destroys all members of a target species. Therefore, the more irradiation-tolerant members of the target species are not given any evolutionary advantage. Without evolutionary advantage, selection does not occur. As to the irradiation process directly producing mutations that lead to more virulent, radiation-resistant strains, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food found that there is no evidence; on the contrary, irradiation has been found to cause loss of virulence and <b>infectivity,</b> as mutants are usually less competitive and less adapted.|$|E
25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, bevirimat {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag {{is an essential}} structural protein of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form {{the core of the}} mature virus particle. Bevirimat prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the capsid protein (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, bevirimat enters a growing virus particle as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 cleavage site. This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the capsid protein remains bound to SP1, the virus particle core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for <b>infectivity,</b> resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-1 {{has been}} shown to enhance HIV {{infection}} due to its galactose binding specificity. HIV preferentially infects CD4+ T cells and other cells of the immune system, immobilising the adaptive immune system. HIV is a virus that infects CD4+ cells via binding of its viral envelope glycoprotein complex, which consists of gp120 and gp41. The gp120 glycoprotein contains two types of N-glycan, high mannose oligomers and N-acetyllactosamine chains on a trimannose core. The high mannose oligomers are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) and are recognised by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN found on dendritic cells. The N-acetyllactosamine chains are ligands for galectin-1. Galectin-1 is expressed in the thymus. In particular it is secreted in abundance by Th1 cells. In its normal function, galectin-1 binds to glycans on the CD4 co-receptor of T cells to prevent auto reactivity. When HIV is present, the galectin bridges between the CD4 co-receptor and gp120 ligands, thus facilitating HIV infection of the T cell. Galectin-1 is not essential for HIV infection but assists it by accelerating the binding kinetics between gp120 and CD4. Knowledge of the mechanism between galectin and HIV may provide important therapeutic opportunities. A galectin-1 inhibitor can be used in conjunction with antiretroviral drugs to decrease the <b>infectivity</b> of the HIV and increase the efficacy of the drug.|$|E

500|$|Despite much effort, {{significant}} titers of prion <b>infectivity</b> {{have never}} been produced by refolding pure PrP molecules, raising doubt {{about the validity of}} the [...] "protein only" [...] hypothesis.

2500|$|Ideal {{characteristics}} of a biological agent {{to be used as}} a weapon against humans are high <b>infectivity,</b> high virulence, non-availability of vaccines, and availability of an effective and efficient delivery system. Stability of the weaponized agent (ability of the agent to retain its <b>infectivity</b> and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered. [...] Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.|$|E
