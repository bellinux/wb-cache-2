40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Predetermining the {{ultimate}} capacity of piles driven into purely cohesive soils and purely cohesionless soils involves, respectively, {{the consideration of}} soil shear strength in a completely undrained and a completely drained condition. For the intermediate cases concerning soils that possess both cohesion and <b>internal</b> friction (<b>silts,</b> clayey silts, sandy clays, etc.) the capacity prediction may assume either condition of drainage depending upon {{the characteristics of the}} soil, its stress history, and the duration of load. The actual conditions of failure for piles driven into these soils are uncertain unless test piles can be observed under a series of loads to failure. This study involves the determination of the capacity of an individual pile driven into a clayey silt. Capacity predictions based upon static formulas by Terzaghi and Peck, Meyerhof and William Moore are calculated for both drained and undrained conditions around the pile.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s an American researcher, Robert Mitchell, {{claimed that the}} stones of the O'on were not {{scattered}} beneath the Carron waters at all but lay beneath {{the grounds of the}} former Carron Iron Works; a renowned Industrial Age factory. Historians agree that Sir Michael Bruce of Stenhouse had dismantled Arthur's O'on in 1743 and used almost all of the stones as a facing on a dam which fed water from the Carron River to a mill, with the water exiting further downstream. He later sold this mill property to the developers of the eventual Carron Iron Works. Although historians of the time claimed that the dam, and the rather heavy O'on stones, were somehow washed away in a flood as would a tree or common organic debris, Robert Mitchell uncovered substantial documentary evidence that the dam (and the O'on stones)actually remained intact, due to the Carron Iron works having covered over the dam and incorporating the mill race into a system to feed the factory's furnaces. As a byproduct of covering the dam,the Carron Iron Works actually altered the course of the rather narrow Carron River to a modest degree. On site investigation by Robert Mitchell in the late 1980s lead to a discovery of an entry point into the former mill race in the exact area where his documented evidence had pointed. Upon entry into the system, he encountered a heavily <b>silted</b> <b>system</b> of brick construction. When these findings of the likely site of the stones of Artur's O'on were announced by Burke's Peerage in the late 1980s, he held up the possibility of recovery and reconstruction. However, since Scottish antiquities authorities do not consider the possible site of a buried mill dam as a [...] "scheduled" [...] site, and since the overall site is covered with thick concrete foundations. the prospects for actual recovery do not appear high. Of course, the suggestion that the Carron has changed course in this area has been questioned by other researchers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of Collaborative Virtual Geographic Environments (CVGE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} uses of virtual reality in geographic field. Data collaboration can support multi-directional sharing of data and files, allowing ideas and thoughts to be communicated interactively among users. Thus how to integrate diverse and separated data and offer more convenient and intuitive data collaboration service becomes increasingly significant for implementing collaborative work in the CVGE. In this paper, we firstly design a Grid-based CVGE service framework and discuss the data searching mechanism and accessing control. A data collaboration service was built to integrate and share system internal resources and improve collaboration work efficiency. Finally, we built a collaborative virtual environment and implemented data collaboration service in <b>silt</b> dams <b>system</b> planning on a case study area, Jiu-Yuan-Gou watershed of Loess Plateau, China.

The experimental landscape was weakly-cohesive soil mainly made by clay and <b>silt.</b> A <b>system</b> of micro-sprinklers delivered an almost uniform artificial precipitation. Simulations were performed at a constant rainfall intensity of 100 mm/h using different planar slopes. An additional experiment was also made to consider the base-level control. Digital elevation models (DEMs) of the evolving landscape were achieved through detailed soil surveys with a laser distancemeter and/or a laser scanner. The river networks were extracted from the DEMs using the D 8 algorithm. Channel networks were ordered using the Horton-Strahler ranking as well as the Shreve topological classification. Hence, scaling laws were analysed to explore whether the generated systems resembled natural river networks. Thus, findings are provided on basin allometry, exceedance probability of basin areas and stream lengths, and slope-area relationship...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Geology. Carbonate buildups (reefs) {{are present}} in the Kinderhookian Compton and basal Osagean Pierson {{formations}} in SW Missouri and adjoining Arkansas and Oklahoma. Their depositional origin, biota, and diagenesis are key to evaluating their potential as subsurface petroleum reservoirs. They formed on aggradational to progradational distally-steepened ramps. Those in the Pierson are mainly layered bafflestone, non- Waulsortian type reefs, they contain abundant fenestrate bryozoans and crinoids, and are capped by crinoid grainstones. They are interpreted to have been deposited in a moderate water depth environment that passed upward to a relatively shallow, highenergy environment, and locally they are oil-saturated. The older Compton reefs are characterized as Waulsortian and non-Waulsortian type. Non-Waulsortian type reefs are hybrid mud-dominated lithoherms/fenestrate bryozoan-crinoid muddy bafflestones that are associated with nodular-bedded, shaly mudstones. They are interpreted to have been deposited in low-energy, moderate water depth environments like those in the Pierson. One Compton reef examined is a Waulsortian reef with stromatactis-type vugs filled with abundant radiaxial fibrous calcite marine cements. The Compton bafflestone buildups were uplifted and subaerially exposed in mid-Compton time within an E-W trending belt in the study area. Meteoric-dissolution vugs formed and were subsequently occluded by <b>internal</b> vadose crystal <b>silt</b> (locally replaced by dolomite) and coarse pore filling calcite, and then the buildups were dislodged and re-deposited to the north within thick sections of upper Compton that downlap an intraformational exposure surface.

40|$|The study aims to {{determine}} the feasibility of vetiver as silt barriers for surface runoff from open pit mines using the vetiver root systems as the primary means of filtering the silt. Its objectives are to utilize vetiver as silt barriers for open pit mines, to decrease the silted water velocity as it passes through the vetiver root systems, and {{to determine}} the relationship of vetiver density and efficiency in trapping silt. The experiment uses three systems: (1) the no vetiver <b>system</b> with varying <b>silt</b> concentrations (50 g, 100 g, 150 g), (2) varying number of vetiver (1 row, 2 rows, 3 rows) with constant amount of silt, and (3) varying amount of silt (50 g, 100 g, 150 g) with constant number of vetiver.

40|$|The Little Kankakee River (LKR) in LaPorte County, Indiana is an {{uncommon}} {{example of a}} good, cold-water fishery in northwest Indiana. However, the river has variable sedimentation levels; deep silt often covers gravel and sand, smothering invertebrates, a key food source for higher trophic organisms. The LKR contains a naturally-decomposing, abandoned beaver dam. The {{purpose of this study}} is to monitor its impact upon upstream and downstream silt levels. This research intends to identify possible sources of variability in silt levels, benefiting restoration teams in determining effects of dam removals. Furthermore, understanding the impact and pattern of silt levels could aid the monitoring of river health. Water depth, silt depth, flow rate, and a description of the river bed are measured and recorded. Flow rate fluctuations will be charted against monthly precipitation, noting changes in flow. It is predicted that the beaver dam causes fluctuating siltation by collecting silt upstream and then releasing variable amounts during dam decomposition. Preliminary results indicate the narrow sections of the river have faster water flow and less silt. The beaver dam impedes flow, widens the river, and reduces velocity, allowing fine sediment to accumulate. It is predicted that if the beaver dam decomposes rapidly, then trapped silt above the dam will percolate rapidly through the system stopping at wide sections of the river. If the beaver dam deteriorates slowly, then silt accumulations may not be measureable and leave <b>silt</b> in the <b>system</b> much longer...|$|R

Despite their importance, much remains unexplained about these complicated systems. Mucha's research aims to improve understanding of basic properties of suspensions through {{a program of}} simulating model interacting particle systems with critical evaluation of proposed continuum equations, in close collaboration with experimentalists. Natural to this approach, the original proposal centered around collaboration with studies already conducted in various experimental groups. However, as was detailed in the 2004 progress report, following {{the first year of}} this award, a number of the questions from the original proposal were necessarily redirected towards other specific goals because of changes in the research programs of the proposed experimental collaborators. Nevertheless, the modified project goals and the results that followed from those goals maintain close alignment with the main themes of the original proposal, improving efficient simulation and macroscopic modeling of sedimenting and colloidal suspensions. In particular, the main investigations covered under this award have included: (1) Sedimentation instabilities, including the sedimentation analogue of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (for heavy, particle-laden fluid over lighter, clear fluid).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly W. KramerSoils {{conditions}} vary {{throughout the}} United States and effect {{the behavior of}} the foundation system for building structures. The structural engineer needs to design a foundation system for a superstructure that is compatible with the soil conditions present at the site. Foundation systems can be classified as shallow and deep, and behave differently with different soils. Shallow foundation systems are typically used on sites with stiff soils, such as compacted sands or firm <b>silts.</b> Deep foundation <b>systems</b> are typically used on sites with soft soils, such as loose sands and expansive clays. A parametric study is performed within this report analyzing tilt-up concrete structures in Dallas, Texas, Denver, Colorado, and Kansas City, Missouri to determine the most economical tilt-up wall panel and foundation support system. These three locations represent a broad region within the Midwest of low-seismic activity, enabling the use of Ordinary Precast Wall Panels for the lateral force resisting system. Tilt-up wall panels are slender load-bearing walls constructed of reinforced concrete, cast on site, and lifted into their final position. Both a 32 ft (9. 75 m) and 40 ft (12 m) tilt-up wall panel height are designed on three foundation systems: spread footings, continuous footings, and drilled piers. These two wall heights are typical for single-story or two-story structures and industrial warehouse projects. Spread footings and continuous footings are shallow foundation systems and drilled piers are a deep foundation system. Dallas and Denver both have vast presence of expansive soils while Kansas City has more abundant stiff soils. The analysis procedure used for the design of the tilt-up wall panels is the Alternative Design of Slender Walls in the American Concrete Institute standard ACI 318 - 05 Building Code and Commentary Section 14. 8. Tilt-up wall panel design is typically controlled by lateral instability as a result from lateral loads combining with the axial loads to produce secondary moments. The provisions in the Alternative Design of Slender Walls consider progressive collapse of the wall panel from the increased deflection resulting from the secondary moments. Each tilt-up wall panel type studied is designed {{in each of the three}} locations on each foundation system type and the most economical section is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} has been to determine the environments of deposition of the Grindslow Shales and Kinderscout Grit in an area north of the Derbyshire Dome. These units overly the Mam Tor Sandstones and Shale Grit, which are thought to be turbidites showing increasing proximity to scource. The Grindslow Shales had been interpreted as the slope down which the turbidity currents were generated. Little was known of the depositional environment of the Kinderscout Grit, though shallow water conditions had been suggested. The sequence, {{from the base of the}} Mam Tor Sandstones to the top of the Kinderscout Grit, falls within the zone R 1 c of the Namurian. The outcrops of the Kinderscout Plateau, Derwentdale and Longendale have been mapped and numerous sections measured. In all, 17 facies have been recognised, described and interpreted in hydrodynamic terms on the basis of their <b>internal</b> evidence. Three <b>silts</b> tone facies and one of silty sandstone are thought to be largely deposited from suspension, while fine sandstone, showing ripples and cross-lamination, is interpreted as showing lower flow regime conditions. Parallel laminated fine sandstone is interpreted as an upper flow regime deposit. Facies 8, Massive Bedded Coarse Sandstone, is not, in the first instance, interpretable in hydrodynamic terms. Facies 9, Parallel Bedded Coarse Sandstone, is interpreted as an upper flow regime deposit, while Facies 10, Medium Scale Cross-Bedded Coarse Sandstone is attributed to the lower flow regime along with Facies 11, Medium Scale Cross-Bedded Fine Sandstone. Facies 12, Large Scale Cross-Bedding, consists of single tabular sets of cross-bedding up to 40 m. thick, mainly of very coarse sandstone. These are ascribed to the advance of delta-like sedimentation units into bodies of standing water. Other facies, of minor importance,are Sharp-Based Clean Sandstone Beds, Orthoconglomerates, Seat Earths and Coals, Mudstone Melange and Turbidite-like Sandstones. Three types of trace fossil have been recognised, though it is concluded that they are probably of little environmental significance. Five facies associations are recognised, in which facies succeed one another with variable predictability. The Major Channel Association involves Facies 8, 9 and 10, Massive, Parallel and Cross-Bedded Coarse Sandstones, resting in channels up to 40 m. deep. Other details of channel geometry are not clear, though widths of 300 - 400 m. have been calculated. There is a preferred upwards facies sequence within the channels of Erosion Surface → Facies 8 → Facies 9 → Pacies 10. From hydrodynamic considerations of the sequence, it is suggested that the Facies 8 Massive Bedded Sandstone was deposited by currents flowing in the upper part of the upper flow regime, the whole channel sequence representing a waning flow. The Large Scale Cross-Bedding Association involves Facies 12 and 10, the medium scale cross-bedded sandstone being separated from the underlying Large Scale set by an erosion surface. It is suggested that the Association represents delta cones which advanced into bodies of standing water, subsequent to sudden deepening. The Fluviatile Channel Association is a fining upwards sandstone sequence with a horizontal erosion surface at its base. Facies 10, Medium Scale Cross-Decided Coarse Sandstone forms the bulk of the association, though thin beds of Orthoconglomerate and mudflake conglomerate may occur above the erosion surface. In the top of the association, the cross- bedded sandstone passes into parallel or ripple laminated fine sandstone and sometimes into seat earths and coals. The association is interpreted as the result of the lateral migration of a fluviatile channel, probably of the meandering type. The Slope Association, which has limited stratigraphical position, is a broadly coarsening upwards silts tone and silty sandstone sequence. Thin turbidites occur in the base and burrows become abundant towards the top. It has occasional large channels, filled mainly with turbidites. The association is interpreted as the prograding slope of a coastline receiving abundant sediment supply. The Interdistributary Complex Association is a random sequence of predominantly fine grained facies, showing a variety of flow conditions. It is interpreted as forming in shallow water conditions, probably in interdistributary areas of a delta top. An analysis of the relationships of the facies associations throughout the area gives the following generalised sequence:- 'Gracile' Marine Band. Fluviatile Channel Association Slope or Interdistributary Complex Upper Kinderscout Grit Butterley Marine Band Fluviatile Channels and Interdistributary Complex Association Large Scale Cross-Bedding Lower Kinderscout Grit Major Channels Interdistributary Complex Association Grindslow Shales Slope Association From a consideration of this sequence, it is concluded that the Grindslow Shales represent the main southwards advance of the delta slope and delta top environments across the area. The major channels which erode into the Interdistributary Complex Association sediments of the top of the Grindslow Shales were non-migrating distributaries which underwent frequent diversion and cut-off. They had high flow regime currents and were possibly associated with a period of eustatically falling sea level. A subsequent eustatic rise led to the ponding up of sediment on the delta, top with the formation of delta cones. Above the delta cones, meandering river channels and interdistributary areas were the main features of the palaeogeography. The Butterley Marine Band and its overlying unit of Slope Association suggest a further eustatic rise of sea level. The Upper Kinderscout Grit is thought to be the deposit of laterally migrating rivers. Comparison with the succession further north gives additional evidence of eustatic changes of sea level and suggests ways in which the palaeogeography might have responded to these. It is suggested that the turbidity currents in the basin possibly originated as high flow regime traction currents in the major channels on the delta top, at times of flood. </p...|$|R
