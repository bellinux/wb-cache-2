5|$|Brigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and Colonel Atlee were {{stationed}} farther {{north on the}} Gowanus Road. Parsons was a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army; Atlee was {{a veteran of the}} French and Indian War in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and told that the British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> signals to Washington, who was on Manhattan, and then rode south to warn Stirling of the attack.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50a.m. At 8:57a.m., the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby {{security}} camera that had recorded Nichols' pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited {{and locked the}} truck, and as he headed to his getaway vehicle, dropped {{the keys to the}} truck a few blocks away.|$|E

5|$|Next was a Hardcore {{match between}} Randy Orton and Cactus Jack for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. One {{spot in the}} match saw Cactus lie a barbed wire {{baseball}} bat between Orton's legs and perform a leg drop. Cactus continued to use the bat, as he poured gasoline on it and tried to light it on fire. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff interrupted and informed Cactus {{that he would be}} disqualified and the event would end if <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> the bat on fire. Orton executed an RKO on Cactus onto the barbed wire baseball bat to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|Burgoyne lost 1,000 {{men in the}} two battles, {{leaving him}} outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1; American losses came to about 500 killed and wounded. Burgoyne had also lost several of his most {{effective}} leaders, his attempts to capture the American position had failed, and his forward line was now breached. That night <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew {{under the cover of}} darkness. On the morning of October 8, he was back in the fortified positions he had held on September 16. By October 13 he was surrounded at Saratoga, and on October 17 he surrendered his army. The remnants of his expedition retreated from Ticonderoga back to Quebec.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{all three}} {{defendants}} pleaded guilty. Rivera Lopez {{admitted that he}} had urged Escudero Aponte to set the fire and had made statements to the effect that a fire should be set, but did not admit any involvement in shielding him from view as <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> the sterno. In its plea agreements with Rivera Lopez and Jimenez Rivera, the government agreed to recommend sentences of 25 and 24 years, respectively. At the plea hearing, the government made the promised recommendations, but federal judge José A. Fusté sentenced Rivera Lopez to 99 years in prison and Jimenez Rivera to 75 years.|$|E
25|$|In the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the {{cauldron}} {{resembled the}} end of a scroll that lifted out from the stadium rim and spiralled upwards. It was lit by Li Ning, a Chinese gymnast who was raised to the rim of the stadium by wires. He ran around the rim of the stadium while suspended and as he ran, an unrolling scroll was projected showing film clips of the flame's journey around the world. As he approached the cauldron, <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> an enormous wick, which then transferred the flame to the cauldron. The flame then spiralled up the structure of the cauldron before lighting it at the top.|$|E

25|$|Philoctetes was Heracles' friend, {{and because}} <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> Heracles's funeral pyre {{when no one}} else would, he {{received}} Heracles' bow and arrows. He sailed with seven ships full of men to the Trojan War, where he was planning on fighting for the Achaeans. They stopped either at Chryse Island for supplies, or in Tenedos, {{along with the rest of}} the fleet. Philoctetes was then bitten by a snake. The wound festered and had a foul smell; on Odysseus's advice, the Atreidae ordered Philoctetes to stay on Lemnos. Medon took control of Philoctetes's men. While landing on Tenedos, Achilles killed king Tenes, son of Apollo, despite a warning by his mother that if he did so he would be killed himself by Apollo. From Tenedos, Agamemnon sent an embassy to Priam, composed of Menelaus, Odysseus, and Palamedes, asking for Helen's return. The embassy was refused.|$|E
25|$|Gately's bandmates flew to Majorca on 11 October 2009; Walsh was {{expected}} to join them soon after. The remaining members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Michael Graham, Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: We are completely devastated {{by the loss of}} our friend and brother, Stephen. We have shared such wonderful times together over the years and were all looking forward to sharing many more. Stephen was a beautiful person in both body and spirit. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> up our lives and those of the many friends he had all over the world. Our love and sympathy go out to Andrew and Stephen's family. We love you and will miss you forever, 'Steo'.A post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and this examination showed that Gately died of natural causes. He {{died as a result of}} a congenital heart defect. Toxicology also confirmed the statement by Gately's partner Cowles that he had been smoking cannabis that evening.|$|E
25|$|In 1798 Murdoch {{returned}} to Birmingham {{to work in}} the Soho foundry and continued his experiments with gas, as part of which <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> the interior of the Soho main building, although it is likely that it was lit only in part and not (at this time) permanently. In 1802 as part of the public celebrations of the Peace of Amiens he made a public exhibition of his lighting by illuminating the exterior of the Soho Foundry. The first industrial factory to be illuminated by gas was the Philips and Lee cotton mill in Manchester which was fully lit by Murdoch in 1805, four years after the idea was first broached. Initially this mill contained 50 gas lights, although this soon grew to 904. The length of time taken to complete this project was partly due to experimentations and improvements in the process developed by Murdoch to make the lighting of a large factory by gas practicable and cost effective – such as purifying the gas with lime to remove the smell and determining the best temperature to heat coal to obtain the maximum quantity of gas – although Murdoch continued to be involved in other engine work for Boulton and Watt, which took up much of his time.|$|E

500|$|After 1890, Tesla {{experimented with}} {{transmitting}} power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. [...] He attempted {{to develop a}} wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and {{conducted a series of}} public demonstrations where <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He would spend most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.|$|E
500|$|Scenes {{filmed in}} the One Eyed Jacks casino and brothel were shot on {{location}} {{at a house}} on the shore of California's Malibou Lake; footage for several episodes were shot on the same day by different directors so as to scatter the scenes throughout the episodes that required them. Deschanel has expressed regret over the use of a [...] "house style" [...] in the series' direction and cinematography, feeling that <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> certain scenes in this episode in a way he would not usually have done; preferring to have employed a chiaroscuro use of shadow as opposed to the reddish tints used throughout.|$|E

500|$|As captain, Hutton {{believed}} {{that the key to}} success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his selection of several promising fast bowlers. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down the game to allow the fast bowlers to rest, which set a precedent for other captains. Tactically, Norman Yardley found him [...] "sound rather than venturesome". Run saving was his main priority, but during matches, he quickly adjusted his approach to attack the weakness of particular batsmen. Jim Kilburn {{believed that}} Hutton pursued a serious approach to all matches, {{to the point where he}} missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the [...] "outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience." ...|$|E
500|$|A shot where Lester and Ricky share a {{cannabis}} joint {{behind a}} building {{came from a}} misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light {{from the top of}} the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; <b>he</b> <b>lit</b> it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot [...] "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene". Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.|$|E
500|$|The six {{finally agreed}} that Capper {{had to be}} removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her {{stepfather}} was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly [...] "giggled" [...] as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: [...] "Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [...] said 'Get up.' Bernie pushed her down the hill and poured petrol on her." [...] When McNeilly had difficulty getting the petrol to ignite, Glyn Powell asked Dudson for some paper, who handed him a folded envelope which Powell then attempted to light and use as a taper. After three failed attempts, Dudson said: [...] "In the end he just went up to her with a lighter and lit her. <b>He</b> <b>lit</b> her on the back. She went straight up in flames and was screaming. The flames lit up the whole forest." [...] McNeilly began to sing [...] "Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!" [...] from the Trammps' song Disco Inferno. [...] Believing Capper to be dead, the four returned to Jean Powell's house, stopping to buy canned drinks on the way. Both Leigh and Pook were at the house when they arrived and Dudson stated: [...] "Cliff [...] asked Glyn , 'Have you done it?' Glyn said 'Yes' and he was laughing. He gave Cliff his lighter back." ...|$|E
