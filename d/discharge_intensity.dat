Because flood <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity</b> increases in levees on both river banks, and because silt deposits {{raise the level of}} riverbeds, planning and auxiliary measures are vital. Sections are often set back from the river to form a wider channel, and flood valley basins are divided by multiple levees to prevent a single breach from flooding a large area. A levee made from stones laid in horizontal rows with a bed of thin turf between each of them is known as a spetchel.|$|E
5000|$|The first ion pump {{was invented}} by Varian Associates, now Agilent. The {{original}} activity of Varian, co-founded in 1948 by Russell Varian, {{the inventor of the}} Klystron, and his brother Sigurd, was in the field of microwave electron tubes. Robert Jepsen joined the company in 1951 and soon became director of the Klystron research group. His investigation about electronic vacuum pumping led in 1957 to the realization of the first sputter ion pump (SIP), later named VacIon pump, of which he was co-inventor.The pump was developed as an appendage pump for maintaining Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) in microwave power tubes after processing, but soon after honeycomb-shaped anodes and commercial VacIon pumps with speeds of thousands of liters per second were produced. Lewis Hall and John Helmer were members of the research team, involved in the choice of the most suitable cathode material and in the optimization of the ion pump design. Sherm Rutherford joined Varian in February 1959 in the Central Research Department (which, soon after, spun off the Vacuum Division). His activity, working for Robert Jepsen, was to study the behavior of the sputter ion pump (in terms of pumping speed and <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity</b> I/P) over a wide range of parameters, such as magnetic field, voltage, anode cell diameter, anode cell length and pressure. Renn Zaphiropoulos joined the Vacuum Division in 1959 and was engaged in scaling up the ion pump from the original appendage pump to a full range of large pumps up to 5000 l/s [...] His group worked on high voltage feedthroughs, magnets, control units, systems, flanges, valves, sorption pumps and Titanium Sublimation Pumps (TSP). In 1960 the “slotted” titanium cathode, named “Super VacIon Pump”, was introduced on the basis of observations about noble gas pumping mechanism and unstable Argon pumping phenomena. In the same years triode pumps were invented by W.M. Brubaker (Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation) and Varian, now Agilent, began to sell them in the late ‘60s under the name “Noble Ion Pumps”, then changed the name to “Triode Ion Pumps” in the early ‘70s.|$|E

Changes in the two discharges were decomposed into three effects: the economic output effect, the industrial structure effect and the <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity</b> effect. The <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity</b> effect could be further decomposed into the cleaner production (technologies’) effect and the pollution abatement (technologies’) effect. Results showed that the economic output effect was mainly responsible {{for the growth of}} the two discharges; the average annual contribution rates were 10. 77 % and 10. 39 %, respectively. Inversely, the pollution abatement (technologies’) effect presented the most obvious mitigating effects (− 9. 71 % and − 9. 52 %, respectively). Furthermore, the clean production (technologies’) effect followed it (− 4. 36 % and − 5. 22 %). So, we found that the <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity</b> effect {{played a crucial role in}} the reduction of the two discharges. Then, the mitigation effect of industrial structure adjustment was the weakest (− 0. 19 % and 0. 47 %). However, we could still not ignore the potential impact of industrial structure optimization for reducing the absolute amount of discharges in the long run. In addition, to simultaneously reduce the COD and NH 3 -N discharges, the sub-sectors of “Processing of Food from Agricultural Products (I 7) ”, “Manufacture of Foods (I 8) ”, “Manufacture of Raw Chemical Materials and Chemical Products (I 20) ”, “Manufacture of Non-metallic Mineral Products (I 24) ” and “Smelting and Pressing of Non-ferrous Metals (I 26) ” were suggested to be given prior consideration for the design of related mitigation policies. Finally, some particular policy implications were also recommended for reducing the two discharges...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{variation}} in the distribution and abundance of submerse macrophytes in the Mary River, a subtropical Australian river, was examined at 29 sites on four occasions (116 samples) over a 1 year period. Thirteen submersed macrophyte taxa representing seven families were recorded during the study period. Submersed macrophyte cover was generally patchy and mean quadrat cover per sample was below 7 % for every recorded taxon. Classification and ordination identified four distinct groups characterised by differences in submersed macrophyte abundance and associated environmental variables. Three of the four groups were characterised by different abundances of three core taxa, Myriophyllum verrucosum, Vallisneria nana and Potamogeton crispus. The distribution of the four sample groups within the Mary River catchment was associated with two environmental gradients, the first gradient representing <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity,</b> discharge variability and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration and the second gradient representing <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity,</b> substrate composition, riparian canopy cover and total phosphorus (TP) concentration.

The US Bureau of Reclamation [21], Pilarczyk [22] and Escarameia [23] procedures were assessed and determined to be conservative in riprap sizing. Flows with and without hydraulic jump were tested where 8 different sizes of stones, ranging from 8. 75 to 47. 5 mm, were placed at downstream bed of stilling basin. An alternative sizing was developed using the shear velocity, shear stress and shear Reynolds number. The results indicate that ratio between shear velocities at downstream of stilling basin with hydraulic jump to that of uniform flow is 0. 54. Furthermore a new and simplified formula for predicting the riprap sizing downstream of stilling basin is developed.

But the case of discharge is very different; for as there are only half the number of dielectric particles in the rarefied atmosphere, so these are brought up to the <b>discharging</b> <b>intensity</b> by half the former quantity of electricity; discharge, therefore, ensues, and such a consequence of the theory is in perfect accordance with Mr. Harris's results (1365.).|$|R

This paper assesses the environmental efficiency of Chinese regional industrial systems {{to come up with}} some recommendations to policy makers. First, we divided each Chinese regional industrial system into a production process and a pollutant treatment process. Then, we built a scientific input–intermediate–output index system by introducing a new network slacks-based model (NSBM) model. This study is the first to combine NSBM with DEA window analysis to give a dynamic evaluation of the environmental efficiency. This enables us to assess the environmental efficiency of Chinese regional industrial systems considering their internal structure as well as China’s policies concerning resource utilization and environmental protection. Hence, the overall efficiency of each regional industrial system is decomposed into production efficiency and pollutant treatment efficiency. Our empirical results suggest: (1) 66. 7 % of Chinese regional industrial systems are overall inefficient. 63. 3 and of 66. 7 % Chinese regional industrial systems are inefficient in the production process and the pollutant treatment process, respectively. (2) The efficiency scores for the overall system and both processes are all larger in the eastern area of China than those of the central and western areas. (3) Correlation analysis indicates that SO 2 generation intensity (SGI), solid waste generation intensity, COD <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity,</b> and SO 2 <b>discharge</b> <b>intensity</b> have significantly negative impacts on the overall efficiency. (4) The overall inefficiency is mainly due to inefficiency of the pollutant treatment process for the majority of regional industrial systems.
