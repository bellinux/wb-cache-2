The structure of MWSN, critical issues, advantages, and differences between MWSN and WSNs are presented in Section 1.4. An extensive comparative analysis of mobility management protocols based on several characteristics is made in Section 1.5. Section 1.6 deliberates the critical issues and subsequent open issues associated with the mobility protocol studies. Finally, Section 2 concludes the points of this article.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Context {{recognition}} {{is an essential}} aspect of intelligent systems and environments. In most cases, the recognition of a context of interest cannot be achieved in a single step. Between measuring a physical phenomenon and the estimation or recognition of what this phenomenon represents, there are several intermediate stages which require a significant computation. Understanding the resource requirements of these steps is vital to determine the feasibility of context recognition on a given device. In this paper, we propose an adaptive context-recognition architecture that accommodates uncertain knowledge to deal with sensed data. The architecture consists of an adaptation component that monitors the capability and workload of a device and dynamically adapts recognition accuracy and processing time. The architecture is implemented for an audio-based context recognition. A <b>detail</b> <b>account</b> of the tradeoff between recognition time and recognition accuracy is provided. Index Terms—Audio-signal processing, context awareness, context reasoning, context recognition, context-recognition accuracy, context-recognition time. I...|$|E

40|$|Growth of bulk {{crystals}} {{by physical}} vapor transport {{was developed and}} applied to cadmium telluride. The technology makes use of effusive ampoules, in which part of the vapor contents escapes to a vacuum shroud through defined leaks during the growth process. This approach has the advantage over traditional sealed ampoule techniques that impurity vapors and excess vapor constituents are continuously removed from {{the vicinity of the}} growing crystal. Thus, growth rates are obtained routinely at magnitudes that are rather difficult to achieve in closed ampoules. Other advantages of this effusive ampoule physical vapor transport (EAPVT) technique include the predetermination of transport rates based on simple fluid dynamics and engineering considerations, and the growth of the crystal from close to congruent vapors, which largely alleviates the compositional nonuniformities resulting from buoyancy driven convective transport. After concisely reviewing earlier work on improving transport rates, nucleation control, and minimization of crystal wall interactions in vapor crystal growth, a <b>detail</b> <b>account</b> is given of the largely computer controlled EAPVT experimentation...|$|E
