40|$|Flexroute transit (also {{referred}} to as route-deviation) is an innovative public transportation approach in which service is provided at <b>fixed</b> <b>stops</b> on a predetermined schedule, while also providing “on-demand” service to customers between the <b>fixed</b> <b>stops.</b> A significant challenge {{to the implementation of}} flexroute transit has been the complexity inherent in the design process. This research explored two of the key design parameters available to a transit planner: service zone size (the area between <b>fixed</b> <b>stops</b> where deviations are permitted), and slack time distribution (the method used to distribute among zones the total “slack” time built into the schedule to allow for deviations). It was found that the objectives of maximizing feasible deviations and minimizing unused slack time are conflicting and highly sensitive to the design parameters. To assist in the design process, the article formulates a multiobjective binary optimization model {{that can be used to}} develop an efficient frontier—guiding transit planners as they seek to explore design trade-offs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of a maintenance policy generally is the global maintenance cost minimization that involves {{not only the}} direct costs for both the maintenance actions and the spare parts, but also those ones due to the system stop for preventive maintenance and the downtime for failure.

The present paper attempts to individuate the set of elements on which performing maintenance actions so that the system can assure the required reliability level until the next <b>fixed</b> <b>stop</b> for maintenance, minimizing both the global maintenance cost and the total maintenance time. In order to solve the previous constrained multiobjective optimization problem, an effective approach is proposed to obtain the best solutions (that is the Pareto optimal frontier) among which the decision maker will choose the more suitable one. As well known, describing the whole Pareto optimal frontier generally is a troublesome task. The paper proposes an algorithm able to rapidly overcome this problem and its effectiveness is shown by an application to a case study regarding a complex series–parallel system...|$|E

This paper presents a case based reasoning approach for making profit in the foreign exchange (forex) market with controlled risk using k nearest neighbour (kNN) and improving on the results with neural networks (NNs) and a combination of both. Although many professionals have proven that exchange rates can be forecast using neural networks for example, poor trading strategies and unpredictable market fluctuation can inevitably still result in substantial loss. As a result, the method proposed in this paper will focus on predicting the outcome of potential trades with <b>fixed</b> <b>stop</b> loss (ST) and take profit (TP) positions 1, in terms of a win or loss. With the help of the Monte Carlo method, randomly generated trades together with different traditional technical indicators are fed into the models, resulting in a win or lose output. This is clearly a case based reasoning approach, in terms of searching similar past trade setups for selecting successful trades. There are several advantages over classical forecasting associated with such an approach, and the technique presented in this paper brings a novel perspective to problem of exchange trades predictability. The strategies implemented have not been empirically investigated with such wide a range of time granularities as is done in this paper, in any to the authors known academic literature. The profitability of this approach is back-tested {{at the end of this}} paper and highly encouraging results are reported...|$|E
40|$|To {{promote and}} {{contribute}} to the discussion of fiscal federalism in Argentina, this paper presents a proposal to amend the distribution of the revenue from the Income Tax between the Nation and the provinces. The proposal is based on the need to help reinvigorate the discussion on the distribution of federal resources. In recent years we have added new elements to the dynamics of fiscal federalism that in some cases reinforce problems that already exist and in some others, modify active aspects in the last and half decade. The provincial debt refinancing by the Nation after the crisis of 2001 - 2002, the changes in the fundraising composition pro to the National Government or reversion of the pension reform are examples of these changes. Given the above, this paper takes a bounded approach to the Income Tax federal distribution, in contrast to an integral reform vision of the distribution of federal resources. In practice, this approach has produced few results to push for reform, both in times of acute financial constraints, as in periods of recovery and with governments of different political signs. Income Tax, and prior to the partnership, we realize transfers to the pension system, the Suburban Fund and the ATN fund administered by the National Government. The terms of this distribution is a clear example of how changes in the economic, political and fiscal problems have deepened in the ' 90 s for the allocation of federal resources and created new others. Virtually all such transfers are no longer justified or become outdated. First, the reversion of the pension reforms of the nineties, with the elimination of private capitalization system in late 2008 has changed the revenue structure of the pension system, reversing in part the reasons that justified the yield of part of the provinces revenue to finance it. Today, ANSES surplus contrasts with the increasing deterioration of the provincial finances. Moreover, part of the surplus of ANSES is intended to finance the National Government, which in turn provides financial assistance to provinces. This contributes to a scheme that increases the dependence of the provinces of federal transfers and lessens their predictability for policy development. To this situation has also contributed, the change in the tax structure since 2002, with a tax increase with limited partnerships, increasing Nation resources {{to the detriment of the}} provinces. Related to this, there is a fiscal situation deteriorated even more and with greater reliance on National Government funding, in the Province of Buenos Aires. Since the early ' 90 s, recognizing a disadvantage situation in this province in the partnership scheme, it was set up Suburban Fund which was allocated 10 % of the revenue from Income Tax. However, it was later established a <b>fixed</b> <b>stop</b> to this fund, which was never updated, now the Suburban Fund harms the Buenos Aires Province, because it would get more resources if the fund had a normal partnership. Finally, from the Income Tax the 2 % goes to Treasury posts fund (ATN), formally created in order that the nation attend the provinces in case of emergency. This instrument is no longer relevant. On the one hand, the ATN fund accumulates resources that are not distributed by an estimated amount of $ 8, 500 million. Moreover, today are financial assistance programs and other discretionary transfers the mechanism by which the National Government transfers resources to several provinces. With this in mind, we present a proposal to amend the federal distribution of Income Tax, adding resources to the provinces in general and a steal on the Province of Buenos Aires in particular. This will reduce transfers to the pension system, it eliminates the amount allocated to ATN and updating the Suburban Fund. This proposal comes under the parliamentary treatment of the extension of several major taxes, among which include the Income Tax and seeks to contribute to this debate. Additionally, and beyond this situation, the work aims to highlight some aspects that justify the restatement of fiscal federalism in Argentina, adapted to a gradual approach of reform, aligned with current political possibilities. ...|$|E

We prove that with this imposed condition there exists a master equation with nearest-neighbor coupling with the same mean first-passage time as the original dynamical system. We show applications of the method for Brownian motion of particles in one and two dimensional potential energy landscapes and the folding process of small bio-polymers.

This model is tested against a <b>fixed</b> <b>stopping</b> rule (one-reason decision making) and against the class of multi-attribute information integrating models.
