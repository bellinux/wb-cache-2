5|$|According to {{a review}} of 51 studies from 21 countries, the average {{incidence}} of subarachnoid hemorrhage is 9.1 per 100,000 annually. Studies from Japan and Finland show higher rates in those countries (22.7 and 19.7, respectively), <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> are not entirely understood. South and Central America, in contrast, have a rate of 4.2 per 100,000 on average.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in-flight <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> could not be determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled {{to the right and}} crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E

To England, I will admit that the foreknowledge of what is to come would be worth much, {{although}} the eventful result would be the same.

50|$|Sports {{programming}} in Channel 23 was fully expanded with {{the launch of}} ABS-CBN Sports+Action in January 18, 2014, replacing Studio 23 <b>for</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the now-defunct channel is associative to its predominant entertainment content.|$|R
5000|$|More recently, Nikolas Kompridis {{has taken}} issue with Habermas' {{conception}} of rationality as incoherent and insufficiently complex, proposing a [...] "possibility-disclosing" [...] role <b>for</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{goes beyond the}} narrow proceduralism of Habermas' theory.|$|R
5|$|Nasser's first {{battlefield}} {{experience was}} in Palestine during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He initially volunteered {{to serve with}} the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) led by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni. Nasser met with and impressed al-Husayni, but was ultimately refused entry to the AHC's forces by the Egyptian government <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> were unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Chief Constructor, Sir Edward Reed, was ill so {{the design}} of this ship was {{entrusted}} to his assistant and brother-in-law, Nathaniel Barnaby, himself a future Chief Constructor. <b>For</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> have not survived, the Admiralty required that Penelope to be a ship of unusually shallow draught, possibly {{in light of the}} operations in the shallow Baltic Sea during the Crimean War of 1854–55.|$|E
5|$|The city of Eretria {{also sent}} {{assistance}} to the Ionians <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria in a past war against Chalcis.|$|E
50|$|The ACDP was {{the only}} party {{to vote against the}} {{adoption}} of {{the final version of the}} South African Constitution, <b>for</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> it enshrined abortion on demand and the specific protection of sexual orientation.|$|R
60|$|And Israel {{laid down}} His sceptre and his crown, To brood on that River bank, Where the waters flashed and sank, And burrowed in earth and fell, And bided a season below; <b>For</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> none might know, Save only Israel.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also said}} that Tadanaga's face was similar to his cousin's Toyotomi Hideyori and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Ieyasu hated and feared Tadanaga.|$|R
5|$|The {{first half}} of the 19th century saw {{geological}} and paleontological activity become increasingly well organised with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. Interest increased <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> were not purely scientific, as geology and paleontology helped industrialists to find and exploit natural resources such as coal.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Hergé {{changed his}} mind about moving to Argentina <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> remain unknown. Serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun culminated on 22 April 1948. As with {{previous}} adventures, the title had also been serialised in the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants, from 30 November 1947.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{was also}} {{successful}} in persuading {{the city of}} Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously {{high temperature}} of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which {{was found to be}} a suicide, roughly coincided {{with the end of the}} murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E
5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Nevertheless, none of these measures appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E

5|$|Stalemate ensued {{for five}} days, before the Athenians (<b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> are not {{completely}} clear) decided to attack the Persians. Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the hoplites proved devastatingly effective, routing the Persians wings before turning in on {{the centre of the}} Persian line; the remnants of the Persian army left the battle and fled to their ships. Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield; the Athenians lost just 192 men and the Plataeans 11.|$|E
5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} control {{was not without}} dispute, however, with both Vale Royal Abbey and St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester {{claiming}} the valuable church advowson. Legal action dragged on for some years, before Vale Royal Abbey ultimately prevailed. Control was also challenged by the Crown itself in 1398, and by Strata Florida Abbey in 1435. Vale Royal found keeping the appropriated church difficult, with the locals being at times difficult (<b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> were not hard to discover).|$|E

5|$|The story {{involves}} {{a party of}} player characters (PCs) who travel {{to the land of}} Barovia, a small nation surrounded by a deadly magical fog. The master of nearby Castle Ravenloft, Count Strahd von Zarovich, tyrannically rules the country, and a prologue explains that the residents must barricade their doors each night to avoid attacks by Strahd and his minions. The Burgomaster's mansion is the focus of these attacks, and, <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> are not initially explained, Strahd is after the Burgomaster's adopted daughter, Ireena Kolyana.|$|E
5|$|Although having reached legal {{retirement}} age in 1927, and thus unable {{to be offered}} another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed {{on an annual basis}} each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL, <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Edward became {{close to}} Piers Gaveston. Gaveston {{was the son}} of one of the King's {{household}} knights whose lands lay adjacent to Gascony, and had himself joined Prince Edward's household in 1300, possibly on Edward I's instruction. The two got on well; Gaveston became a squire and was soon being referred to as a close companion of Edward, before being knighted by the King during the Feast of Swans in 1306. The King then exiled Gaveston to Gascony in 1307 <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> remain unclear. According to one chronicler, Edward had asked his father to allow him to give Gaveston the County of Ponthieu, and the King responded furiously, pulling his son's hair out in great handfuls, before exiling Gaveston. The official court records, however, show Gaveston being only temporarily exiled, supported by a comfortable stipend; no reason is given for the order, suggesting that it may have been an act aimed at punishing the prince in some way.|$|E
