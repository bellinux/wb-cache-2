5|$|In {{a similar}} legend {{related to the}} birth of Ayyappa, the demon Surpanaka earns the power to turn anyone into ashes by his austerities. The tale mirrors all other aspects of the Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale, where he is forced by Mohini to severe {{fidelity}} by keeping <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head and is burnt.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, {{the pace of the}} pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, {{the pace of the}} pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E

25|$|The {{police arrested}} the young suspects, and found one had two bags of heroin. Halley {{stayed with the}} suspects, and Roteman told Serpico, who spoke Spanish, to make a fake {{purchase}} attempt to get the drug dealers to open the door. The police went to the third-floor landing. Serpico knocked on the door, keeping <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> revolver. The door opened a few inches, just far enough to wedge his body in. Serpico called for help, but his fellow officers ignored him.|$|E
25|$|Bodson found Msiri {{sitting in}} front of a large hut with 300 men in the background, many armed with muskets. Bodson told Msiri he had come to take him to Stairs, and Msiri did not reply but became angry, rose and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sword (a gift brought by Stairs). Bodson drew his {{revolver}} and shot Msiri three times, and one of Msiri's men — his son Masuka — fired his musket hitting Bodson in the abdomen and spinal column. The Dahomeyan askari shot and killed Masuka, and in the general firing Hamadi was hit in the ankle.|$|E
25|$|Chesney {{started his}} Poets and Pirates Tour on April 26, 2008 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the {{introduction}} of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and {{the lip of the}} stage surface, which crushed his foot and produced a severe hematoma from the ankle down, with most of the damage centering within his toes. It took approximately 30seconds to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and kept holding <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knee as he began singing.|$|E

25|$|In the men's free skating, Brian Joubert slashed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> skate {{blade and}} left {{drops of blood}} all over the ice; he {{completed}} the program but later required medical attention. Also during the free skating, a screw in Daisuke Takahashi's skate came loose on his first jump. He {{was able to get}} it repaired and resumed his program within the three minutes allowed. Oda ruined his chances of a medal by doing an extra triple jump, resulting in a loss of 13 points. Florent Amodio used music with lyrics, which is not allowed in competitive skating with the exception of ice dancing. He was not given the normally required one-point penalty because not enough judges voted for it.|$|E
500|$|England {{descended into}} {{civil war in}} the 1640s, {{resulting}} in Charles I's execution in 1649. Under the republic that followed, some questioned whether Magna Carta, an agreement with a monarch, was still relevant. An anti-Cromwellian pamphlet published in 1660, The English devil, said that the nation had been [...] "compelled to submit to this Tyrant Nol or be [...] cut off by him; nothing but a word and a blow, his Will was his Law; tell him of Magna Carta, he would lay <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sword and cry Magna Farta". In a 2005 speech the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Woolf, repeated the claim that Cromwell had referred to Magna Carta as [...] "Magna Farta".|$|E
500|$|Pee-wee's small glen plaid suits seemed ridiculous {{during the}} 1980s, {{but since the}} late 1990s have made him a [...] "style icon", with fashion houses and {{designers}} like Christopher Bailey, Ennio Capasa, Miuccia Prada, Viktor & Rolf, and Thom Browne creating tightly cut suits with high armholes and short trousers that have been compared to Pee-wee's. In early 2007 Nike released a collection of Nike SB sneakers called [...] "Fallen Heroes". The collection was loosely inspired by Milli Vanilli, MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice, and Pee-wee Herman. Pee-wee's sneakers use a gray and white color scheme with red detail, with an illustration on the insole {{of a man in}} a suit sitting alone in a theatre with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> lap suggesting Reubens' 1991 theatre arrest.|$|E

500|$|In December 1998, {{before the}} Third Test between Australia and England at the Adelaide Oval, the {{journalist}} Malcolm Conn of The Australian uncovered {{the story of}} John. His report on the matter won him a Walkley Award for journalism. On 8 December, {{three days before the}} start of the Test, Conn informed Malcolm Speed—the CEO of the ACB—that he was going to reveal the details of a cover-up of the fines that were imposed on Waugh. At the time, Conn was unaware of Warne's involvement. The ACB responded by pre-empting Conn and releasing a statement, revealing that two unnamed players had been fined in 1994–95 for having financial dealings with bookmakers. Later that evening, former Test cricketer David Hookes, who was then a sports broadcaster, named Waugh and Warne on the Melbourne radio station 3AW. The next day, Conn's story was released on the front page, with the headline [...] "Cricket's Betting Scandal". The article was accompanied by a picture of Waugh with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
500|$|Mohini {{also has}} an active history in the {{destruction}} of demons throughout Hindu texts. In the Vishnu Purana, Mohini defeats Bhasmasura, the [...] "ash-demon". Bhasmasura invokes the god Shiva by performing severe penances. Shiva, pleased with Bhasmasura, grants him the power to turn anyone into ashes by touching their head. The demon decides to try the power on Shiva himself. Shiva runs terrified. Vishnu, witnessing the unfortunate turn of events, transforms into Mohini and charms Bhasmasura. Bhasmasura is so taken by Mohini that he asks her to marry him. Mohini agrees, but only on the condition that Bhasmasura follows her move for move in a dance. In the course of the dance, she places her hand on her head. Bhasmasura mimics the action, and in turn, reduces himself to ashes. The legend of Bhasmasura is retold in the Buddhist text Satara Dewala Devi Puvata, with a slight variation. In this tale, Vishnu assumes his female form (the name [...] "Mohini" [...] is not used) and charms Bhasmasura. The female Vishnu asks Bhasmasura to promise never to leave her by placing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head as per the usual practice to swear on one's head. On doing so, Bhasmasura is reduced to ashes.|$|E
500|$|Standing 188cm, Johnston had {{a smooth}} ten-pace {{approach}} to the wicket, with an idiosyncratic dip of his head before the instant of delivery. He had success on moist English pitches, with deliveries from over the wicket because of the increased chances of leg before wicket decisions and to induce edges from balls angling across the batsmen. His stock ball swung into the right-hander, but he mixed this with an away swinger. The late swing in flight which generated the batsman's uncertainty over {{the direction in which}} the ball would move was responsible for the majority of Johnston's wickets in England. Although his pace was lower than that generated by Lindwall or Miller, he was noted for his accuracy and ability to revert to spin bowling on sticky wickets. Nevertheless, his casual run-up belied a deceptive pace. He possessed strong hands, attributed to his milking of the family's cattle herd. Johnston was an economical bowler, conceding only 2.07 runs per over. He was known for his elbow movement and flailing arms during his delivery action, with one commentator noting [...] "one of these days an umpire will get a poke in the eye". Johnston also had a reputation of visibly enjoying himself on field, putting <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hips and grinning, regardless of the result of his delivery. According to teammate Alan Walker, Johnston bowled at least as many bouncers as his colleagues, but because of his happy nature, observers thought that he eschewed the short ball.|$|E

[...] To both Roger and Patty's surprise, Wagoner thumped <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> desk and {{said he was going to}} help her out.

2500|$|G. W. Hoover, the {{passenger}} who said Elwood had run down two passengers in the water, swore out an {{affidavit in support}} of a warrant for the arrest of Captain Lee, claiming that Lee had threatened to kill him. [...] According to Hoover, [...] "Captain Lee called at my place of business and demanded to see me, but was so excited that they would not permit him to do so. [...] He threatened to kill me, and kept <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hip pocket.

2500|$|Nimoy {{also came}} up with the concept of the [...] "Vulcan nerve pinch", which he {{suggested}} as a replacement for the scripted knock out method of using the butt of his phaser. He wanted a more sophisticated way of rendering a person unconscious. Nimoy explained to the show's director that Spock had, per the story, gone to the Vulcan Institute of Technology and had studied human anatomy. Spock also had the ability to project a unique form of energy through his fingertips. Nimoy explained the idea of putting <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> neck and shoulder to Shatner, and they rehearsed it. Nimoy credits Shatner's acting during the [...] "pinch" [...] that sold the idea and made it work on screen.|$|E

2500|$|Kelly then {{heard the}} {{approach}} of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four gang members concealed themselves, some behind logs, {{and one in the}} tent. They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, [...] "Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm." [...] Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went forward and said, [...] "Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded." [...] Kelly at the same time called out, [...] "Put up your hands." [...] Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> revolver case. He was instantly fired at, but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, [...] "It's all right, stop it, stop it." [...] Scanlan jumped down and tried to make for a tree, but before he could unsling his rifle, he was shot and killed.|$|E
2500|$|In 210, after Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu (who died {{of illness}} earlier that year) as the {{frontline}} commander of Sun Quan's forces, he passed by Lü Meng's garrison {{on his way}} to Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him, [...] "General Lü's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder and said, [...] "Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here." [...] He also visited Lü Meng's mother and left after befriending Lü Meng.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{the next}} day, Kennedy and Scanlon {{went down to}} the creek to explore, leaving McIntyre to {{attended}} to camp duty. He fired two shots out of his fowling piece at a pair of parrots. These shots were heard by Kelly, who was on the lookout for the police. At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, [...] "Bail up; throw up your arms." [...] McIntyre testified that Kelly took his fowling piece, and that all the gang members were armed. (Kelly stated that only two had guns.) Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held up his hands as directed. Lonigan went for cover behind a tree and, at the same time, put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> revolver. Kelly shot him in the temple. He fell to the ground and said, [...] "Oh Christ, I am shot." [...] He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, [...] "What a pity; what made the fool run?" [...] Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives: ...|$|E
