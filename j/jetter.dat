[47] Nowhere more pungently than in {{a little}} piece of some half-dozen pages, headed, Prédiction tirée d'un vieux Manuscrit, the form of which is {{borrowed}} from Grimm's squib in the dispute about French music, Le petit Prophète de Boehmischbroda, though it {{seems to me to be}} superior to Grimm in pointedness. Here are a few verses from the supposed prophecy of the man who should come--and of what he should do. [...] "Et la multitude courra sur ses pas et plusieurs croiront en lui. Et il leur dira: Vous êtes des scélérats et des fripons, vos femmes sont toutes des femmes perdues, et je viens vivre parmi vous. Et il ajoutera tous les hommes sont vertueux dans le pays où je suis né, et je n'habiterai jamais le pays où je suis né.... Et il dira aussi qu'il est impossible d'avoir des moeurs, et de lire des Romans, et il fera un Roman; et dans son Roman le vice sera en action et la vertu en paroles, et ses personages seront forcenés d'amour et de philosophie. Et dans son Roman on apprendra l'art de suborner philosophiquement une jeune fille. Et l'Ecolière perdra toute honte et toute pudeur, et elle fera avec son maître des sottises et des maximes.... Et le bel Ami étant dans un Bateau seul avec sa Maîtresse voudra le <b>jetter</b> dans l'eau et se précipiter avec elle. Et ils appelleront tout cela de la Philosophie et de la Vertu," [...] and so on, humorously enough in its way.|$|E
