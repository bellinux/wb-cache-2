40|$|AIMS – Substantial {{increase}} in heavy drinking upon transition {{from high school}} to college is common. Norwegian universities and university colleges arrange yearly introductory weeks to welcome new students. It has been questioned whether these events are too centered on alcohol. We aimed to <b>investigate</b> <b>whether</b> participation in the introductory week is associated with risky drinking (RD). We further aimed to <b>investigate</b> <b>whether</b> RD is associated with academic performance. Finally, we <b>investigated</b> <b>whether</b> alcohol-related attitudes are associated with both RD and introductory week participation...|$|R

5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> there would be {{interest}} in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a consensus that the university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Rotblat {{joined the}} Los Alamos Laboratory {{as part of}} Chadwick's British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The usual {{condition}} for people {{to work on the}} Manhattan Project was that they had to become U.S. citizens or British subjects. Rotblat declined, and the condition was waived. At Los Alamos, he was befriended by Stan Ulam, a fellow Polish-Jewish scientist, with whom he was able to converse in Polish. Rotblat worked in Egon Bretscher's group, <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> high-energy gamma rays produced by nuclear fission would interfere with the nuclear chain reaction process, and then with Robert R. Wilson's cyclotron group.|$|E
5|$|Police {{were also}} <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> a copycat element was {{involved}} after it emerged that both Saari and Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the gunman in the Jokela school shooting, had bought their guns {{from the same}} store. Both gunmen had taken photographs of themselves in similar poses, and both exchanged videos related to school shootings on YouTube and Finnish social networking site IRC-Galleria. In March 2009, Police ruled out contact with Pekka-Eric Auvinen, {{and said that he}} had committed his crimes alone: 200 people were interviewed during the investigation, none of whom said they knew of Saari's plans.|$|E

This was the subject of considerable debate between the Navy and the Air Force at the time. Tests were carried out at Sandia Base with the OV-1 Mohawk, A-1 Skyraider, A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, F-4 Phantom, F-105 Thunderchief, B-52 and B-58 Hustler aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, NSB {{started the}} process of finding a {{replacement}} for the El 9. New locomotives would cost NOK20 million, and the company saw it as unrealistic to invest so much in a marginal branch line. NSB had also concluded its away-with-the-steam program, and therefore had a lack of locomotives in general. If {{a new class of}} locomotives was to be built, it would have to satisfy more than the requirements for the Flåm Line, so NSB instead started <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> any of the older models could be used. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, built between 1951 and 1964, and El 13, built between 1957 and 1966. Neither was considered optimal: El 11 allowed the train weight to increase to , but the train had the steps for the voltage regulator and the commutation set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not suitable for the gradient; the locomotives were also better suited for mainline service and would therefore not be prioritized for branch lines.|$|E

25|$|A {{longitudinal}} study {{is one that}} follows test subjects {{over a long period}} of time — as opposed to a cross-sectional study, which gives a 'snap-shot' of a group at one point in time. Longitudinal studies tend to examine smaller groups in greater detail, whereas cross-sectional studies are often based on a more representative segment of the population over a short time. The longitudinal method was useful in identifying factors in alcoholism, for instance by <b>investigating</b> <b>whether</b> delinquent behaviour started before or after drinking.|$|E
