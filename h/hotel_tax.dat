500|$|During Baker's {{first two}} years as governor, the state income tax has dropped to 5.1%. Baker has opposed {{implementing}} a [...] "millionaire's tax," [...] vetoed a vehicle miles traveled tax, originally supported but then opposed extending the state <b>hotel</b> <b>tax</b> to short-term rentals (such as Airbnb), favored a ballot measure that repealed indexing the state gas tax to inflation, signed into law {{an expansion of the}} state earned income tax credit, opposed the 2016 ballot initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana with a 3.75% excise tax levied on sales of marijuana products, and signed into law a six-month delay in the issuance of licenses for retailing marijuana in shops. In 2016, the Massachusetts general fund budget rose by 6.1 percent and the state budget for the 2016 fiscal year had a year-end shortfall of more than $300 million and could be as large $750 million for the following year. In December 2016, Baker unilaterally cut $98 million from the state budget, including many of the $265 million in items that he had vetoed the previous July, $231 million of which the state legislature overrode. The midyear cuts prompted criticism and opposition from State House of Representatives Speaker Robert DeLeo, State Senate President Stan Rosenberg, and State Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Karen Spilka. However, in February 2017, tax revenues came in 9.1 percent lower than expected and the likelihood of overturning the cuts became unlikely, and in March 2017, Speaker DeLeo stated that reversing those midyear cuts would be [...] "difficult." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of tax revenue data in digital format prompted {{a study of}} Iowa communities {{with respect to their}} general property tax mill rate and {{the presence or absence of}} a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax.</b> Both of these revenue sources are dispersed entirely to the local community. The revenue does not remain in the State 2 Ì† 7 s general fund. Alternative tax revenue sources are an important component in the decision making process of local city planners, city managers and community development administrators.;The intent of this thesis was to determine if there is an association between the general property tax mill rates of Iowa communities and presence of a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax.</b> Do communities with a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> tend to have a higher or lower property tax mill rate? Secondary data available from the U. S. Census Bureau, Iowa Department of Revenue and Iowa Department of Management was used to examine the relationship between the mean property tax mill rate in Iowa communities with the presence of a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> and communities that do not assess the tax. Each community 2 Ì† 7 s population growth rate between 1980 and 2000 was also calculated and used as a control variable. The study years were FY 1998 to FY 2007 and study data for all communities in Iowa was compiled into a master data base.;The findings of this research study were (1) cities with the presence of a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> tend to have, on average, a 2. 05 higher general property tax mill rate than cities without the <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax.</b> (2) When population growth rate was used a s a control variable, cities with a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> tended to have a property tax mill rate of. 90 higher than cities without this alternative tax. The intent of this research study was to determine if there was an association between the general property tax mill rate for cities with and without the <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax.</b> The study was limited by the number of years for which digital data was available from the State of Iowa.;Planners, community development directors, policy makers and citizen action groups have access to these digital data bases. Findings in the study were not reported for individual cities in Iowa either by population, location or current property tax mill rate. The public digital data files allow individuals to investigate current rates, revenue totals and trends for specific cities. The master data base for this study is included. This data base includes a list of the 954 Iowa communities, population totals for 1980 and 2000, population growth rate for each city, the presence or absence of a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> and the general property tax mill rate for Fiscal Years 1998 to 2007. A second data base lists each city with a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> (1979 - 2007), the intervention date, current tax rate and revenue collected for Fiscal Years 1981 - 2005. Conclusions offered by this study indicate the implementation of a <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> by a community may not reduce the general property tax mill rate. The revenue generated by the <b>hotel</b> and motel <b>tax</b> is a viable source of additional revenue to use for both the general operating expenses of a community and the improvement and maintenance of recreation, convention and entertainment facilities and for the promotion of tourism.
