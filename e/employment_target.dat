2500|$|In {{contrast}} with most other European countries, Sweden maintained an unemployment rate around 2% or 3% {{of the work}} force throughout the 1980s. This was, however, accompanied by high and accelerating inflation. It became evident that such low unemployment rates were not sustainable, and in the severe crisis of the early 1990s the rate increased to more than 8%. In 1996 the government set out a goal of reducing unemployment to 4% by 2000. During 2000 employment rose by 90,000 people, the greatest increase in 40 years, and the goal was reached in the autumn of 2000. The same autumn the government set out its new target: that 80% of the working age population will have a regular job by 2004. Some have expressed concern that meeting the <b>employment</b> <b>target</b> may come at a cost of too high a rate of wage increases hence increasing inflation. However, as of August 2006, roughly 5% of working age Swedes were unemployed, over the government-established goal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that {{inflation}} targeting is compatible with Post Keynesian economics, but only if the policies used to achieve the inflation target explicitly acknowledge (1) the demand-determined nature of the real income generating process, and (2) the importance of conflicting claims over the distribution of income for determining the rate of inflation. The paper then questions whether or not policy makers should trouble to engage in inflation targeting. It is shown that there does exist a Post Keynesian case for inflation targeting, but that the appropriate inflation target that emerges from Post Keynesian economics suggests that far too much attention is currently being paid to inflation and that more of policy makers' attention should be devoted to output (and, by extension, <b>employment)</b> <b>targeting.</b> inflation targeting, new consensus, Post Keynesian economics,...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} whether the {{transparency}} {{of the central}} bank's preferences is desirable. We make two major points. First, {{in the literature on}} preference transparency variance-reduction frameworks are often adopted. As a consequence a change in the degree of transparency affects the magnitude of information asymmetries, {{but at the same time}} it implies a rather arbitrary effect on the distribution of preferences. We present a clean framework without this problem. Second, using a very general specification of shocks to the central bank's preferences, we show that society prefers transparency if it sufficiently values the <b>employment</b> <b>target,</b> whereas it prefers opacity if it estimates inflation as sufficiently important.

A contract which is based on self-imposed monetary target announcements proves to be superior to the best monetary rule if conflicts about the inflation target within society are relatively small compared to the initial uncertainty about the medianvoter's objective. It is superior to the laissez faire solution if unemployment exceeds a certain threshold level. The optimal choice of costs of deviations from auto-imposed targets depends on the type of conflict within society, whether the individuals disagree on the weight of the inflation versus the <b>employment</b> <b>target</b> or on the value of the inflation target itself...|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates {{a simple}} model of growth with a Taylor-like {{monetary}} policy rule that includes inflation targeting {{as a special}} case. When the inflation process originates in the product market, inflation targeting locks in the unemployment rate prevailing {{at the time the}} policy matures. Even though there is an apparent NAIRU and Phillips curve, this long-run position depends on initial conditions; in the presence of stochastic shocks, it would be path dependent. Even with an <b>employment</b> <b>target</b> in the Taylor Rule, the monetary authority will generally achieve a steady state that misses both its targets since there are multiple equilibria. With only one policy instrument, Tinbergen's Rule dictates that policy can only achieve one goal, which can {{take the form of a}} linear combination of the two targets. ...|$|E
