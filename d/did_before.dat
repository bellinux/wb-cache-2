Ervine, meanwhile, has heard that her lover has {{returned}} {{and goes to}} the hut in the woods, nearly fainting after being caught in a downpour. Adolf sends a letter to van Kempen telling him where to find Ervine. The family are reunited.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beauregard was {{reluctant}} to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he <b>did</b> <b>before</b> the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He {{was one of many}} Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill on his behalf was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they <b>did</b> <b>before</b> the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it <b>did</b> <b>before</b> the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E

By 2007 Grand Forks had a larger population than it <b>did</b> <b>before</b> the 1997 flood. Area employment and taxable sales had also surpassed pre-flood levels.|$|E

5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they <b>did</b> <b>before</b> emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E

25|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{supply and demand}} for a grain market. S3 and S2 show the supply of grain in high and low yield years respectively, and S1 shows the average supply.

25|$|Islam {{recognises}} God as the fountain-head of all excellences, {{free from}} all imperfection as {{understood by the}} Community.

On account of this, Ahmadi teachings propound the view that God communicates with mankind as he <b>did</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
