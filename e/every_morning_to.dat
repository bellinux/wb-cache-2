Regina notices this, and warns Mary Margaret to stay away from David, and it was their personal life.|$|E

Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> deliver the Times before school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school.

25|$|Often {{described}} as queen mother {{is the first}} daughter of a matriarchal lineage of a family collective. She holds the right to lead the ceremonies incumbent to the clan: marriages, baptisms and funerals. She {{is considered one of}} the most important members of community. She will lead the women of a village when her family collective is the ruling one. Her dominant role has often been confused with or associated to that of a high priestess which she is not. They take part in the organisation and the running of markets and are also responsible for their upkeep, which is vitally important because marketplaces are the focal points for gatherings and social centres in their communities. In the past when the men of the villages would go to war, the Queen Mothers would lead prayer ceremonies in which all the women attended <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> ensure the safe return of their menfolk.|$|E
500|$|While Lennon was [...] "evangelical in {{his enthusiasm}} for the Maharishi", {{according}} to his wife, Cynthia, she herself was [...] "a little more sceptical". [...] Cynthia later wrote that she [...] "loved being in India" [...] and had hoped she and Lennon would [...] "rediscover our lost closeness"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became [...] "increasingly cold and aloof". The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone.

Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: [...] "I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras".|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn's father {{encouraged}} {{his sons}} {{to play ball}} in the makeshift baseball field that he assembled in their backyard. The setup was a narrow strip of grass that was longer than wide. Pulling the ball too much resulted in it being lost over the neighbor's fence, but left field being short ruled out hitting it to the opposite field as well. Once the brothers' supply of wiffle balls [...] was exhausted, they resorted to using a sock rolled in rubber bands, a wad of tape, or a hardened fig from a neighbor's tree. Although Gwynn was able to pull the ball in his back yard, he would naturally hit {{it the other way}} during regular games. Growing up, he attended Los Angeles Dodgers games and watched his hero, Willie Davis; the Dodgers outfielder had twice as many stolen bases as home runs (398 SB, 182 HR) in his career. Gwynn admired Davis for being black, left-handed, and [...] "aggressive but under control"; he respected Davis' work habits as well. Unlike other kids that tracked home run hitters, Gwynn checked the box scores in the newspaper <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> follow high-average hitters like Pete Rose, George Brett and Rod Carew.|$|E

2500|$|Another such episode {{details the}} boy's {{trip on the}} {{outskirts}} of the village, sent over to provide food for the Romani day laborers hired by Ștefan and Smaranda. This episode sees the boy's unsupervised encounter with the village hoopoe (or [...] "Armenian cuckoo"). Miserable over having to wake up early <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> the sound of the bird, Nică exercises his revenge by trapping the bird inside her nest, a time-consuming process which drives the awaiting and isolated laborers to despair. Met with much hostility by his father's employees when he ultimately reaches his destination, the boy makes his way back to the hoopoe's lime tree and easily ties up the exhausted bird, hiding her in the attic of his house, where it no longer can sing. His deed proves detrimental to the entire community, deprived of its alarm clock, and rumors quickly spread that Nică is responsible. While Smaranda decides whether she should trust these reports, the boy assesses that the his best choice is to sell the hoopoe at the fair. He proceeds to do so, but his entire scheme crumbles once a sly old man, pretending to assess the bird, releases it from its bonds. As the bird flies back to her nest, Nică angrily demands reparation. He is instead ridiculed by the old man, who informs him that Ștefan is also attending the fair and might be interested in the conversation, thus exposing the boy and prompting him to rush out of the market in fear of more severe repercussion.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson amassed myriad home demo {{recordings}} which later became informally {{known as the}} [...] "Bedroom Tapes". Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material {{has been described as}} [...] "schizophrenia on tape," [...] and [...] "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state." [...] Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: [...] "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s." [...] Brian's daughter Wendy remembers, [...] "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song." [...] Her sister Carnie has recounted: [...] "My memories of him are him wandering from room to room... thinking about something. I always wanted to know what he was thinking, you know?

2500|$|The tragedies and dislocations that Buck {{suffered}} in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the [...] "Nanking Incident". In a confused battle involving elements of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom insisted, as he had in 1900 {{in the face of}} the Boxers, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family invited them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year, after which they moved back to Nanjing. Pearl later said that this year in Japan showed her that not all Japanese were militarists. When she returned from Japan in late 1927, Pearl devoted herself in earnest to the vocation of writing. Friendly relations with prominent Chinese writers of the time, such as Xu Zhimo and Lin Yutang, encouraged her to think of herself as a professional writer. She wanted to fulfill the ambitions denied to her mother, but she also needed money to support herself if she left her marriage, which had become increasingly lonely, and since the mission board could not provide it, she also needed money for Carol’s specialized care. Pearl went once more to the States in 1929 to find long-term care for Carol, and while there, Richard J. Walsh, editor at John Day publishers in New York, accepted her novel [...] She and Richard began a relationship that would result in marriage and many years of professional teamwork. Back in Nanking, she retreated <b>every</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> the attic of her university bungalow and within the year completed the manuscript for The Good Earth.|$|E
