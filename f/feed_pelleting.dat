The effects of 2 enzyme preparations containing viscosity-reducing or cell wall-degrading ac-tivities on growth performance and nutrient digestibil-ity were evaluated in experiment 1.

40|$|Enzymes {{that are}} used as animal feed {{supplements}} {{should be able to}} withstand temperatures of 60 to 90 °C, which may be reached during the <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting</b> process. The thermostability properties of three histidine acid phosphatases, Aspergillus fumigatus phytase, Aspergillus niger phytase, and A. niger optimum pH 2. 5 acid phosphatase, were investigated by measuring circular dichroism, fluorescence, and enzymatic activity. The phytases of A. fumigatus and A. niger were both denatured at temperatures between 50 and 70 °C. After heat denaturation at temperatures up to 90 °C, A. fumigatus phytase refolded completely into a nativelike, fully active conformation, while in the case of A. niger phytase exposure to 55 to 90 °C was associated with an irreversible conformational change and with losses in enzymatic activity of 70 to 80 %. In contrast to these two phytases, A. niger pH 2. 5 acid phosphatase displayed considerably higher thermostability; denaturation, conformational changes, and irreversible inactivation were observed only at temperatures of ≥ 80 °C. In <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting</b> experiments performed at 75 °C, the recoveries of the enzymatic activities of the three acid phosphatases were similar (63 to 73 %). At 85 °C, however, the recovery of enzymatic activity was considerably higher for A. fumigatus phytase (51 %) than for A. niger phytase (31 %) or pH 2. 5 acid phosphatase (14 %). These findings confirm that A. niger pH 2. 5 acid phosphatase is irreversibly inactivated at temperatures above 80 °C and that the capacity of A. fumigatus phytase to refold properly after heat denaturation may favorably affect its pelleting stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} productive performance and egg quality of Japanese quails fed different types of processed rations (mash, extruded, or pelleted). One hundred and forty-four 18 -w-old quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were housed in galvanized wire cages and fed a 21. 50 % CP and 2850 kcal ME/kg basal feed supplied in mash, extruded, or pelleted form. Experimental data were analyzed by ANOVA as a complete randomized design, with three treatments (ration forms) and six replicates of eight quails each. When necessary, means were compared by Tukey's test at 5 % significance. Quails fed pelleted feed presented higher egg production, feed intake, and egg mass weight as compared to mash- and extruded-diet-fed birds. Under the conditions of the present experiment, it was possible to conclude that the feed physical form did not affect egg quality, except for pelleted diets, which promoted good production performance and high egg mass.

Proper control of the handling and conveying systems is necessary to avoid damage and disintegration of the cylindrically shaped fish <b>feed</b> <b>pellets.</b> Pneumatic conveying is widely used to transport large quantities of fish feed. Proneness of crushing the fish <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> caused by pellets interaction with the inner wall of the pipeline is a major concern to the manufacturer due to the associated economic loss; pellet damage increases exponentially with the conveying air velocity. On the other hand, too low conveying rates would lead to pipeline blockages and severe pipe vibration. In order to address the foregoing issues, it is necessary to optimize the conveying velocity of fish <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> during pneumatic transport. Application of an on-line monitoring technique based on non-invasive passive acoustic measurements and multivariate regression modeling (acoustic chemometrics) was investigated. A partial least squares regression (PLS-R) model was calibrated to predict pellet velocity from 19 m/s to 36 m/s in a pilot scale pneumatic conveying system.

40|$|Background: Xylanases are {{considered}} one of the most important enzymes in many industries. However, their low thermostability hampers their applications in <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting,</b> pulp bleaching, and so on. The main aim of this work was to improve the thermostability of Trichoderma ressei xylanase 2 (Xyn 2) by introducing disulfide bonds between the N-terminal and α-helix and the β-sheet core. Results: In this work, two disulfide bonds were separately introduced in the Xyn 2 to connect the N-terminal and α-helix to the β-sheet core of Xyn 2. The two disulfide bonds were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding residues. The half-life of the mutants Xyn 2 C 14 – 52 (disulfide bond between β-sheets B 2 and B 3) and Xyn 2 C 59 – 149 (disulfide bond between β-sheets A 5 and A 6) at 60 °C was improved by approximately 2. 5 - and 1. 8 -fold compared to that of the wild type Xyn 2. In addition, the enzyme's resistance to alkali and acid was enhanced.

To simplify the feed processing, a protease-resistant α-galactosidase encoding gene from Gibberella sp. strain F 75, aga-F 75, was modified by codon optimization and heterologously expressed in the embryos of transgentic maize driven by the embryo-specific promoter ZM-leg 1 A. The progenies were produced by backcrossing with the commercial inbred variety Zheng 58. PCR, southern blot and western blot analysis confirmed the stable integration and tissue specific expression of the modified gene, aga-F 75 m, in seeds over four generations. The expression level of Aga-F 75 M reached up to 10, 000 units per kilogram of maize seeds. In comparison with its counterpart produced in Pichia pastoris strain GS 115, maize seed-derived Aga-F 75 M showed a lower temperature optimum (50 °C) and lower stability over alkaline pH range, but better thermal stability at 60 °C to 70 °C and resistance to <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting</b> inactivation (80 °C).

An ideal phytase supplement should have a high temperature tolerance, allowing it to survive the <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting</b> process, a high specific activity at low pHs, and adequate gastric performance.

Fourteen single site variants were discovered that retained as much as 10 times the residual activity of the wild-type enzyme after a heated incubation regimen. The addition of eight individual mutations into a single construct (Phy 9 X) resulted in a protein of maximal fitness, i. e., a highly active phytase with no loss of activity after heating at 62 °C for 1 h and 27 % of its initial activity after 10 min at 85 °C, which was a significant improvement over the appA parental phytase.

40|$|ABSTRACT In three trials, male broiler chicks were {{subjected}} to a 6 -day feed restriction regimen designed to retard growth severely. In one trial, the amino acid requirements during refeeding were evaluated by testing the adequacy of diets based on model calculations. In two additional trials, the response of feed-restricted birds to increased dietary energy density and to <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting</b> was {{compared with that of}} birds fed ad libitum. Results of the first trial showed that weight gain and feed efficiency during the first 2 wk of refeeding were reduced when the diet contained less than the model-calculated protein level for this period. No improvement in performance could be obtained when dietary protein was increased by 1 % above model-calculated requirements. An increase in dietary nutrient density resulted in an enhanced growth rate. Feed efficiency was improved by an increase in nutrient density and by early feed restriction with no significant feed restriction x diet density interactions. Pellet-feeding resulted in improved growth without affecting feed efficiency, whereas feed restriction resulted in improved feed efficiency only. Interaction between pelleting and feed restriction was not significant for any of the variables. In all three trials, abdominal fat was reduced by feed restriction without any interaction with energy, protein, or dietary form. The results suggest that the requirements for some amino acid increase after feed restriction and that feed consumption does not limit the accelerated growth response at that time...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial phytases have {{attracted}} industrial interest as animal feed supplement {{due to their}} high activity and sufficient thermostability (required for <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting).</b> We devised an approach named KeySIDE, an iterative Key-residues interrogation of the wild type with Substitutions Identified in Directed Evolution for improving Yersinia mollaretii phytase (Ymphytase) thermostability by combining key beneficial substitutions and elucidating their individual roles. Directed evolution yielded in a discovery of nine positions in Ymphytase and combined iteratively to identify key positions. The “best” combination (M 6 : T 77 K, Q 154 H, G 187 S, and K 289 Q) resulted in significantly improved thermal resistance; the residual activity improved from 35 % (wild type) to 89 % (M 6) at 58 °C and 20 -min incubation. Melting temperature increased by 3 °C in M 6 without a loss of specific activity. Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed reduced flexibility in the loops located next to helices (B, F, and K) which possess substitutions (Helix-B: T 77 K, Helix-F: G 187 S, and Helix-K: K 289 E/Q). Reduced flexibility in the loops might be caused by strengthened hydrogen bonding network (e. g., G 187 S and K 289 E/K 289 Q) and a salt bridge (T 77 K).

40|$|Animal {{agriculture}} may be {{a significant}} source of P and N pollution. In order to maximize animal growth, diets are often supplemented with inorganic P, depleting a nonrenewable resource. Furthermore, towards the same end, animal diets are often supplemented with a rich source of protein, generally soybean meal. This competes with human consumption of soy. The biotechnological application of phytase to supplement animal diets reduces manure P pollution and can completely replace the use of nonrenewable inorganic P. We attempted to increase the stability of Escherichia coli AppA 2 phytase through de novo disulfide bond engineering to withstand the heat of <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting.</b> Though unsuccessful in our goal, we discovered disulfide bonds affect protein kinetics and other characteristics through not only modulation of stability, but also atom motility and position. We also explored potential additional benefits of phytase. Knowing AppA 2 to possess a nucleotide binding site, we explored whether phytase could degrade DNA. Our studies failed to indicate substantial nuclease activity of phytase. Finally, towards the goal of alleviating animal agriculture N pollution in the form of poultry feathers and competition for human food sources, we studied the degradation of feather keratin by Streptomyces fradiae k 11.

40|$|Most of fish <b>feed</b> <b>pellet</b> {{in market}} {{is low in}} terms of water {{stability}} and easily swell when it is immersed in water.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} widely used as a feed {{supplement}} to reduce manure phosphorus pollution of swine and poultry, Aspergillus niger PhyA phytase is unable to withstand heat inactivation during <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting.</b> Crystal structure comparisons with its close homolog, the thermostable Aspergillus fumigatus phytase (Afp), suggest associations of thermostability with several key residues (E 35, S 42, R 168, and R 248) that form a hydrogen bond network in the E 35 -to-S 42 region and ionic interactions between R 168 and D 161 and between R 248 and D 244. In this study, loss-of-function mutations (E 35 A, R 168 A, and R 248 A) were introduced singularly or in combination into seven mutants of Afp. All seven mutants displayed decreases in thermostability, with the highest loss (25 % [P < 0. 05]) in the triple mutant (E 35 A R 168 A R 248 A). Subsequently, a set of corresponding substitutions were introduced into nine mutants of PhyA to strengthen the hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. While four mutants showed improved thermostability, the best response came from the quadruple mutant (A 58 E P 65 S Q 191 R T 271 R), which retained 20 % greater (P < 0. 05) activity after being heated at 80 °C for 10 min and had a 7 °C higher melting temperature than that of wild-type PhyA.

40|$|ABSTRACT Paired {{samples of}} mash and pellets {{made from the}} mash were taken at feed mills and {{compared}} for their mold count and fungal activity as measured by metabolic CO 2 production. Four paired samples contained Mold-X, a commercial mold inhibitor, of which the major active ingredient is propionic acid, and four paired samples did not contain a mold inhibitor. PeIIeting reduced the mold counts {{by a factor of}} about 100 to 10, 000, depending upon the sample. In-cubation of the samples at 29 C after adjusting the water content to 20, 25, or 30 % caused an approximate doubling of the time required for onset of metabolic CO 2 production by the pelleted feed as compared to the mash. Incorporation of the mold inhibitor into mash appeared to give a similar lag in onset of CO 2 production. Pellets made from mash containing the mold inhibitor had an additional doubling in the delay of onset of CO 2 production. In a model system composed of corn meal to which graded doses of propionic acid were added, the concentration of inhibitor that provided 50010 inhibition was found to increase with time of incubation. The lag in onset of CO 2 production in this system was found to be 1 or 2 days depending on whether the corn meal was heated for 5 min at 60 or 70 to 85 C, respectively. Heat and propionic acid also interacted to reduce the mold count of corn meal in the model system. It would appear that the effectiveness of propionic acid as a mold inhibitor can-be greatly increased by the pelleting process and that a decrease in the fungal burden of feed is an attribute of pelleting.

This product {{has the potential to be}} used as a novel feed ingredient for poultry, swine, or cattle diets. [Beta]-carotenes have been supplemented in animal diets to improve animal health, enhance meat color and quality and increase vitamin A concentrations in milk and meat. Microbial fermentations involving growth and product kinetics were performed in 500 mL baffled shake flasks and in a 5 L fermentation bioreactor. Media optimization was conducted in shake flasks to evaluate two carbon sources: glucose and glycerol, and two nitrogen sources: ammonium sulfate and urea. Final [beta]-carotene concentration of 272. 57 ± 4. 34 [mu]g [beta]-carotene/g biomass was found to be highest for the whole stillage, with 10 g/L added glucose and 10 g/L nitrogen added through ammonium sulfate supplementation. Glycerol addition yielded no significant increase (P<. 05) in [beta]-carotene yield, while urea addition significantly decreased (P<. 05) the final [beta]-carotene concentrations. The resulting fermented product can be blended with regular feed using either whole stillage as a dry feed ingredient or thin stillage as a liquid feed additive. The fermentation of whole stillage significantly influenced the physical and flow properties of the material. Even though there was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in bulk density and increase (P< 0. 05) in tapped density between DDGS and fermented whole stillage, there was a less pronounced difference between the whole stillage and fermented whole stillage. The fermentation of whole stillage significantly influenced the physical and flow properties of the material. This showed that the fermentation process and resulting nutritional profile had a significant effect on the resulting fermented whole stillage. A 50 L bioreactor was specifically designed to evaluate the scalability of the process and to perform subsequent feed production trails.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the nutritional consequences of processing chicken feed, {{in particular the}} loss of available amino acids {{as a result of}} the Maillard reaction, both in model protein systems and during poultry feed processing. Model systems containing RNase A and pure or feed-type carbohydrates were incubated at 37 °C, 50 °C or 70 °C for up to 8 days. From lysine analysis, reduction in reactive amino groups in RNase A was shown to occur rapidly at room temperature, with no incubation period necessary. However, protein fragmentation that occurred during incubation, especially at higher temperatures, interfered with the quantification of lysine. SDS-PAGE showed crosslinking reactions of RNase A with the tested carbohydrates to be slow below 70 °C. Incubation of RNase A with cyclotene or xylose produced the greatest rate of crosslinking, while starch and sucrose produced the least. A modified OPA method was developed such that the level of reactive lysine could be quantitated in barley flour proteins, in a manner that was technically straightforward, inexpensive and allowed good through-put of samples. This method was shown to have good agreement with the published ninhydrin method in the measurement of Maillard reacted lysine in barley flours. Up to 25 % loss of reactive lysine was observed in barley flour that had not undergone processing beyond milling. Samples were taken before, during and after the pelleting of chicken feed. Lysine analysis of these samples showed loss in amino group content of at least 18 % could occur during processing, although this was dependent on variations between pelleting runs. Protein fragmentation during processing potentially masked further losses. A growth trial assessed a novel method of lysine addition to the feed, via spraying on free lysine solution post-pelleting. Over the 2 week trial period, 10 % of the lysine applied by this method remained in the uneaten fines. Lysine eaten by chickens aged day 8 - 14, as calculated from measurements taken using the OPA method, correlated well with bird growth. Increased feed intake was also seen as the lysine content of the diet increased. In chickens aged day 15 - 21, lysine addition above the first addition level produced no further significant gain in performance. Therefore, lysine was not growth limiting above this level. Results indicated that over the 2 week period of the trial, equivalent performance for birds on the standard feed could have been achieved with a 50 % reduction in free lysine added to the feed formulation. No lysine loss occurred in the standard sample as a result of pelleting. Therefore, while the potential exists for lysine loss to occur during chicken <b>feed</b> <b>pelleting,</b> this thesis has shown that this is not a significant problem. As up to 25 % lysine blockage in unprocessed barley flour was observed, obtaining feed ingredients with consistently low levels of Maillard reaction damage may be as important as maintaining ideal processing conditions...|$|E

While numerous benefits are documented for <b>feeding</b> pigs <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed,</b> adoption has been mainly limited to large producers who own their own feed mill or those close to a large commercial pellet mill to justify the extra cost. However, with the increased cost of feed ingredients, the economics of pelleting are becoming much more favorable...|$|R

In Arizona, {{these animals are}} fed special processed <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.|$|R
5000|$|... {{reported}} that the easiest and popular way to feed birds are to use <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds.</b> Aside the convenience to the farmer, <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds</b> enable the bird to eat more at a time. In addition to that, some researchers also found the improvement of feed conversion, decreasing feed wastage, improving palatability and destroying pathogens when birds were fed with <b>pellet</b> <b>feed</b> as compared to birds fed with mash feed. Commercial manufacturing of <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> usually involves series of major processes including grinding, mixing and pelleting. The produced pellets are then tested for pellet durability index (PDI) to determine its quality. To enhance good health and growth, antibiotics are often added to the <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Pelleting</b> {{of animal}} <b>feeds</b> is {{important}} for improved feeding efficiency and for convenience of handling. Pellet quality impacts the feeding benefits for the animals and pellet integrity during handling. To compare the effect of repeated handling {{on the quality of}} <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> and corn, a 22. 6 ‐t (1000 ‐bu) lot of <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> made from corn meal and a 25. 4 ‐t (1000 ‐bu) lot of shelled corn, were each transferred alternately between two storage bins in the USDA‐ARS, Grain Marketing and Production Research Center research elevator at Manhattan, Kansas, at an average flow rate of 59. 4 t/h. Samples from a diverter‐type sampler were analyzed for particle size distribution (by sieving) and durability (by the tumbling box method). The apparent geometric mean diameter of pellet samples decreased with repeated transfers, whereas the mass of accumulated broken pellets increased with repeated transfers. The percentage of broken pellets increased by an average of 3. 83 % with each transfer from an initial value of 17. 5 %, which was significantly different from the values obtained from shelled corn (p 0. 05) during the transfers. The durability index of shelled corn was also not significantly different during the transfers. Analysis of dust removed by the cyclone separators showed that the mass of dust < 0. 125 mm was significantly less for <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> (0. 337 kg/t of pellet mass) than for shelled corn (0. 403 kg/t of corn mass) ...|$|R

40|$|A shrimp feed formulation, {{consisting}} of fishmeal, squid meal, prawn head meal, soybean meal, cereal flour (different sources), fish oil, lecithin and other feed additives {{was selected for}} evaluating aquastability of different sources of starch namely, corn flour, maida flour, rice flour, tapioca flour and wheat flour as binders at 15. 3 % each in combination with guar gum at three levels of 1, 2 and 3 %. The <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> were prepared (3 - 5 mm length, 3 mm diameter) by adding 40 ml water for 100 g dry powdered feed mix followed by steaming, pelleting in hand pelletizer and drying at 70 o C. The aqua-stability of <b>feed</b> <b>pellets</b> was determined by measuring the loss in weight of pellets soaked in water and the turbidity of water as Nephlometer reading (NMR). Among the starch sources tested, maida flour in combination with 2 % guar gum in the feed imparted better aqua-stability to pellets followed by tapioca flour, rice flour, wheat flour and corn flour. Further {{increase in the level}} of guar gum in feed had no beneficial effect. It was observed that pellets containing guar gum rapidly swelled and developed cracks and these effects were higher with increase in guar gum level. <b>Feed</b> <b>pellets</b> containing wheat flour and tapioca flour showed highest Nephlometer reading (water turbidity), while pellets with maida flour showed the least NMR followed by corn flour and rice flour. While addition of 1 % guar gum considerably reduced the NMR of tapioca flour and wheat flour, incorporation of 2 % guar gum resulted in the least NMR reading of pellets with wheat flour and maida flour. However, further increase in guar gum (3 %) has no beneficial effect. But raising guar gum level to 3 % decreased the NMR reading in the case of tapioca flour and increased the NMR of rice flour and corn flour. <b>Feed</b> <b>pellets</b> of the same shrimp feed formulation containing wheat flour along with 2 % guar gum and processed in a commercial scale ring-die pellet mill having three stage conditioners and steam injection facility, showed good water stability up to 4 hours (79. 5 % stability) ...|$|R
