5|$|Abbey of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) was {{designed}} in 1878 by J.E. Gnudtzmann in the Neo-Romanesque style. The original Church of Our Lady {{from the early}} 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> and unstable, but the 12th-century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen. The carved pulpit dates to around 1581.|$|E
25|$|In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, {{the highway}} {{followed}} {{what is now}} M-129 from Sault Ste. Marie to Pickford and then west to follow a short portion of former U.S. Route 2, replaced by Mackinaw Trail. It crossed the Straits of Mackinac and then used what is now U.S. Route 23 and old U.S. Route 10 to Detroit. Currently it still exists in Michigan as {{the name of a}} secondary road from Saginaw southeast to the county line (as an alternate route to Flint), from southeast Flint to northwest Pontiac, and from Flat Rock southwest to Monroe ending at the state line. A short section of the Dixie Highway in northwest lower Michigan running north from Eastport in Antrim County to the village of Norwood in Charlevoix County is named Old Dixie Highway—U.S. Route 31 parallels this road to the east. In Ohio, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> U.S. Route 25 to Cincinnati, current U.S. Route 25 and U.S. Route 25W to Knoxville, and U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 27 to Chattanooga. The eastern division took a more direct route than the western between Chattanooga and Atlanta, following the modern U.S. Route 41 all the way, but it followed a more circuitous path south of Atlanta. Traffic left Atlanta to the east on U.S. Route 278, following U.S. Route 441, Georgia State Route 24, a short section of U.S. Route 301, and Georgia State Route 21 to Savannah. There, the route turned south along the coast via U.S. Route 17 to Jacksonville and U.S. Route 1 to Miami. It is today (2016) a major street in towns and cities along the Florida East Coast.|$|E
25|$|The River Loddon rises at West Ham Farm in Basingstoke, and in {{its first}} mile flows under the Festival Place {{shopping}} centre that forms {{the main part of}} the central area of that town; the adjacent bus station sits on the site of the wharf at the start of the Basingstoke Canal. The river emerges again in Eastrop Park, where it now runs alongside and just below Eastrop Way which follows the course of the disused canal. Eastrop Park was the site of Basingstoke Corn Mill in 1873, but by 1932 it was called Vince's Farm, although the buildings still spanned the river. The river then passes through some water meadows where it is joined by small streams from springs and ponds at Black Dam. The flow from these previously had to pass under a wide bend of an embankment which held the Basingstoke Canal. Basingstoke Upper Mill was to the south of the embankment. Again it was a corn mill in 1873, but just a farm in 1932. The area near where the streams meet was a peat moor, and parts of it were used for growing watercress. The Basingstoke Union Workhouse was on the north bank. It later became a hospital and is now the site of a private hospital. The river then flows close by the village of Old Basing and the ruins of Basing House. It is crossed by a brick-built railway viaduct, with four arches, which carries the Southern Railway line to Basingstoke railway station. Just beyond <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Old</b> Basing Mill, still marked as a corn mill in 1932 but now called Barton's Mill. There were more watercress beds to the north of the mill. Pyotts Hill and The Street meet at a narrow bridge over the river, which is built of brick and has three arches. Funding to construct it was obtained by public subscription, and it was opened in 1826.|$|E

500|$|Caryn Ganz of Spin wrote: [...] "Beyoncé is the {{greatest}} performer of her generation and she knows it well. Her Revel concerts were more Liza with a Z than MTV — predicated on nothing but the tour de force of its creator. Saturday night's two-hour show featured no gimmicks, no backing tracks, no hard-to-follow narratives, no whipped cream cannons. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> school Vegas-style Entertainment with a capital E: singing, dancing, and charisma {{wrapped up in a}} few sparkly Ralph & Russo outfits." [...] Dan DeLuca of Philadelphia Inquirer praised Beyoncé's singing with earnest commitment and impassioned intensity further writing that the concert was a [...] "relentlessly entertaining, highly energetic two hours". Jim Farber of Daily News was positive about the show, praising the performance of the ballads as well as the up-tempo songs, adding that she was [...] "shimmying, sashaying and gyrating like she had everything to prove." [...] He further said, [...] "Beyoncé didn't shirk on the razzle or the dazzle in this two-hour event. In fact, this run of shows featured the flashiest lighting, fiercest dancing and most animated theatrics of her starry career... The assurance of the performance, as well as the enormity of the production, makes it unlikely that Beyoncé's latest show will die with this weekend." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times commented that [...] "The show lasted two hours and allowed a dip in the middle for ballads, but otherwise ran rampant, functioning as an almost continuous high point". Celia L. Smith of Essence magazine wrote that, [...] "She sang, danced and put on a show like no other". A writer for Rap-Up noted that Beyoncé didn't miss a step during the choreography and added that [...] "Sasha Fierce is alive and well". Writing that she didn't disappoint, a journalist of Black Entertainment Television described the concert as [...] "phenomenal" [...] further praising the high-energy performance of her up-tempo songs and adding that she [...] "dazzled" [...] her fans. The journalist added that [...] "Though she made it look easy, keeping up to the beat of the vibrant tunes was no easy task" [...] and marked it as [...] " [...] pop queen's return to her throne". Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal praised Beyoncé's dancing and voice during the show saying that they were in [...] "enviable form". Rebecca Thomas of MTV News described the performances as a [...] "spectacular fitting her [...] rising icon status".|$|E
500|$|Sasha Frere-Jones, {{critic of}} The New Yorker praised the self made [...] "unpretentious, stuck {{together}} with Scotch tape" [...] style that M.I.A. achieves with her Roland MC-505 drum machine and keyboard unit, noting {{that many people}} had tried to copy the style since. [...] Her considerable influence on American hip hop music as an international artist is described by Adam Bradley and Andrew DuBois in The Anthology of Rap as making her an [...] "unlikely hip hop" [...] celebrity, given that the genre {{was one of several}} influences behind M.I.A.'s [...] "eccentric and energizing" [...] music and that the musician's unclassifiable sound was one example of how hip hop was changing as it came into contact with other cultures. Similarly, [...] Jeffrey H. Wallenfeldt writes in The Black experience in America : from civil rights to the present that no single artist may have personified hip hop in the 21st century better than M.I.A., in her [...] "politically radical lyrics drawing from widely diverse sources around the world". The Guardian critic Hattie Collins commented of M.I.A.'s influence, [...] "A new raver before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>old.</b> A baile funk/pop pioneer before CSS and Bonde do Rolê emerged. A quirky female singer/rapper before the Mini Allens had worked out how to log on to MySpace. Missing In Action (or Acton, as she sometimes calls herself) has always been several miles ahead of the pack." [...] The twisting of western modalities in her music style using multilingual, multiethnic soundscapes to make electroclash-pop albums is noted by Derek Beres in Global beat fusion: the history of the future of music (2005) to defy world music categorisation. In the book Downloading Music (2007), Linda Aksomitis notes the various aspects of peer-to-peer file sharing of music in the rise in popularity of M.I.A., including {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the internet and platforms such as MySpace in the launch of her career. Andy Bennett and Jon Stratton highlight in Britpop and the English Music Tradition (2010) how M.I.A. alongside musicians such as Sway and Dizzee Rascal created music that explored new soundscapes with new technologies, with lyrics expressing anger at Britain's [...] "racialized subordination of minority groups" [...] and that the innovation that generates new musical forms like grime and dubstep are, inevitably, politically engaged. The chart success of grime-influenced artists like M.I.A. is heralded as a signal in the way that white Britons adapted to a new multicultural and plural musical mix in contrast to bands of the Britpop genre. Furthermore, her work being used as a global resource for the articulation of differently located themes and its connections to many music traditions is noted by Brian Longhurst in Popular music and society (2007) to illustrate such processes of interracial dialogue. Gary Shteyngart writing in GQ notes that [...] "M.I.A. is perhaps the preeminent global musical artist of the 2000s, a truly kick-ass singer and New York-Londony fashion icon, not to mention a vocal supporter of Sri Lanka's embattled Tamil minority, of which she's a member." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reception to the iPhone 7 was mixed. Gordon Kelly of Forbes {{noted that}} rival smartphones, {{such as the}} Samsung Galaxy S7, had {{increased}} battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially {{the size of the}} device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that [...] "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".|$|E

2500|$|When Chief Stewart later {{arrived at}} the Coacci home, Coacci was missing but they found Buda. When he was questioned, Buda said that Coacci owned a [...]32 Savage {{automatic}} pistol, which he kept in the kitchen. A search of the kitchen did not locate the gun, but Stewart found a manufacturer's technical diagram for a Model 1907 [...]32 Savage automatic pistol – the exact pistol type and caliber used to shoot Parmenter and Berardelli – in a kitchen drawer. Stewart asked Buda if he owned a gun, and the man produced a [...]32-caliber Spanish-made automatic pistol. Buda told police that he owned a 1914 Overland automobile, which was being repaired. The car was delivered for repairs {{four days after the}} Braintree crimes, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> and apparently had not been run for five months. Tire tracks were seen near the abandoned Buick getaway car, and Chief Stewart surmised that two cars had been used in the getaway, and that Buda's car might have been the second car. The garage proprietor who was repairing Buda's vehicle was instructed to call the police if anyone came to pick up the car.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 July—the {{day before}} the accident—Forrestal was resupplied with {{ordnance}} from the ammunition ship USS Diamond Head. The load included sixteen 1000-lb AN/M65A1 [...] "fat boy" [...] bombs (so nicknamed because of their short, rotund shape), which Diamond Head had picked up from the Naval Base Subic Bay and were intended for the next day's second bombing sortie. Some of the batch of AN-M65A1s Forrestal received {{were more than a}} decade old, having spent a portion of that exposed to the heat and humidity of Okinawa or Guam, eventually being improperly stored in open-air Quonset huts at a disused ammunition dump on the periphery of Subic Bay Naval Base. Unlike the thick-cased Mark 83 bombs filled with Composition H6, the AN/M65A1 bombs were thin-skinned and filled with Composition B, an older explosive with greater shock and heat sensitivity. Composition B also had the dangerous tendency to become more powerful (up to 50% by weight) and more sensitive if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> or improperly stored. Forrestal's ordnance handlers had never even seen an AN/M65A1 before, and to their shock, the bombs delivered from Diamond Head were in terrible condition; coated with [...] "decades of accumulated rust and grime" [...] and still in their original packing crates (now moldy and rotten); some were stamped with production dates as early as 1953. Most dangerous of all, several bombs were seen to be leaking liquid paraffin phlegmatizing agent from their seams, an unmistakable sign that the bomb's explosive filler had degenerated with excessive age, and exposure to heat and moisture.|$|E
