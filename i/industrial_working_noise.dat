This research is an Ex-Post Facto research. The sample {{of this research was}} 31 second grade students of engineering drawings of SMK N 2 Yogyakarta in academic year of 2010 / 2011 who had done the first periode of <b>industrial</b> <b>working</b> practice. The data collecting of the population for the work of the industrial teacher’s guidance was using questioner of Likert scale with margin score of 1 to 4. Meanwhile to the variable of productive program achievement was using the document of report school grade from grade 1 to 2. 0 The variable achievement of <b>industrial</b> <b>working</b> practice also applied the documentation of <b>industrial</b> <b>working</b> practice grade which was written in the certificate of <b>industrial</b> <b>working</b> practice. The instruments validation questioner implemented items analysis using correlation formula “Product Moment” and the check reliability was using Alpha Cronbach Formula. Testing hypothesis was using correlation analysis product moment and multiple regression analysis which were done before test requirements analysis. It consisted of normalization, linearization, and multikolinierization. The result stows that : (1).
