From 1860 to 1890, 500,000 patents were issued for new inventions—over ten times the number issued in the {{previous}} seventy years. George Westinghouse invented air brakes for trains (making them both safer and faster). Theodore Vail established the American Telephone & Telegraph Company and built a great communications network. Thomas Edison, in addition to inventing hundreds of devices, established the first electrical lighting utility, basing it on direct current and an efficient incandescent lamp. <b>Electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> spread rapidly across Gilded Age cities.

A key challenge is how to redesign, retrofit, and upgrade the existing electromechanically controlled sys-tem into a smart self-healing grid that is driven by a well-designed market approach.

40|$|SOME SCIENTISTS ALLEGE that {{exposure}} to electric and magnetic fields generated by <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> systems is responsible for certain cancers (particularly among children), reproductive dysfunction, birth defects, neurological disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. Some activist groups believe the hazard to be so great that they are calling for closure of schools and other public facilities near power lines and restructuring of the entire <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> system. Some utilities, with equally strong beliefs, claim {{that there is no}} proof of risk. They argue that the science is sufficient to confirm the alleged associations and that no action is warranted. This article provides a broad overview of the current scientific data on the association between magnetic fields and disease, providing summary risk estimates and highlighting the uncertainties in the data. Building on this information, three complementary policy perspectives are presented. From a fiscally conservative perspective, the cost of mitigation already instituted far exceeds the health protection offered and mitigation of other environmental risks is more important. From a cost-benefit view, only limited, low-cost mitigation should be considered. These measures, however, would substantially reduce many exposures. From an aggressive exposure reduction perspective, much can be done to reduce exposure by personal and societal actions. If the suggested association is validated, substantially reducing magnetic field exposure could lower health risks...|$|E

This technology, referred to as Broadband over Power Lines (BPL), uses medium- and low-voltage power lines to provide broadband Internet access to residential users and businesses and is considered by some as a third access technology offering potential competition to xDSL telecommunication lines and cable modems. Recent trends, however, indicate that the focus of BPL technology is shifting from providing broadband connectivity to smart meter usage allowing households to reduce energy costs and allow energy companies to better manage their networks by developing a “smart grid”. ...|$|E

40|$|Disturbances in {{the supply}} of {{electric}} power can have serious implications for everyday {{life as well as}} for national (homeland) security. A power outage can be initiated by natural disasters, adverse weather, technical failures, human errors, sabotage, terrorism, and acts of war. The vulnerability of a system is described as a sensitivity to threats and hazards, and is measured by P (Q(t) > q), i. e. the probability of at least one disturbance with negative societal consequences Q larger than some critical value q, during a given period of time (0,t]. The aim of the thesis is to present methods for quantitative vulnerability analysis of <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> networks to enable effective strategies for prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery to be developed. Paper I provides a framework for vulnerability assessment of infrastructure systems. The paper discusses concepts and perspectives for developing a methodology for vulnerability analysis, and gives examples related to power systems. Paper II analyzes the vulnerability of power delivery systems by means of statistical analysis of Swedish disturbance data. It is demonstrated that the size of large disturbances follows a power law, and that the occurrence of disturbances can be modeled as a Poisson process. Paper III models <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> systems as graphs. Statistical measures for characterizing the structure of two empirical transmission systems are calculated, and a structural vulnerability analysis is performed, i. e. a study of the connectivity of the graph when vertices and edges are disabled. Paper IV discusses the origin of power laws in complex systems in terms of their structure and the dynamics of disturbance propagation. A branching process is used to model the structure of a power distribution system, and it is shown that the disturbance size in this analytical network model follows a power law. Paper V shows how the interaction between an antagonist and the defender of a power system can be modeled as a game. A numerical example is presented, and it is studied if there exists a dominant defense strategy, and if there is an optimal allocation of resources between protection of components, and recovery.

40|$|In Japan, {{with the}} {{reorganization}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry of 1951 the state management introduced in 1939 was abolished, and nine privatelymanaged, regionally intgrated companies were established: Hokkaido <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Tohoku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Tokyo <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Chubu <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Hokuriku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Kansai <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Chugoku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., Shikoku <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co., and Kyushu <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to trace the process in which the 9 -block plan, adopted in {{the reorganization of}} 1951, was formulated. In other words, that is to specify who the opinion leader of the reorganization of Japan's <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry was. There were three candidates for the opinion leader: Nine Haiden Kaisha(electric distributing companies), the General Headquarters/Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers(GHQ/SCAP), and MATSUNAGA Yasuzaemon(the former president of the Toho <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co.). Of the three, Nine Haiden Kaisha completely changed their reorganization plan in 1948 from state management in reality to private management. GHQ/SCAP which made so many plans as 5 -block, 7 -block, 9 -block and 10 -block, also could not keep its own opinion consistently. On the contrary, MATSUNAGA who was the chairman of the <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Industry Reorganization Council from November 1949 to February 1950, kept th 9 -block plan from the beginning to the end. Therefore, it may safely be said that MATSUNAGA was the opinion leader of the reorganization of Japan's <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Industry of 1951, though the commonly accepted theory emphasizes the role of GHQ/SCAP. This paper is based mainly on the GHQ/SCAP Papers in the Washington National Records Center, Suitland, Maryland, U. S.
