5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> a {{respective}} nation's {{jury was}} required to rank every song, except that of their own country.

5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; <b>each</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for <b>each</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} <b>each</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded {{him that it was}} no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita and in <b>each</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, {{it is found}} in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, {{with the exception of}} an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E
