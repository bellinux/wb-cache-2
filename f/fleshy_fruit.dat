5|$|The many stamens are {{arranged}} in two series, which is a distinctive characteristic of the genus. The inner stamens are fused at the base to form a short tubular structure. The outer stamens arise from along the floral tube. The style is usually dark red and has a stigma with 6–8 lobes; the style plus stigma is roughly the same length as the stamens. If the flower is fertilized, a <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit</b> forms, either smooth or with ribs. The brown or black seeds are about 1mm in diameter.|$|E

5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit,</b> known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E

25|$|The seeds {{characteristically}} {{have the}} external epidermis either obliterated (in most species bearing <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit),</b> or if present, have {{a layer of}} black carbonaceous phytomelanin in species with dry fruits (nuts).

25|$|Tinamous are {{opportunistic}} feeders {{and eat a}} {{wide range}} of foods, though each species varies in proportional dietary makeup. Tinamou genera can be roughly divided into three groups based on the vegetable component of their diets. Tinamus, Nothocercus and Crypturellus focus on <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit.</b> Nothura, Nothoprocta and Eudromia, comprising open country birds, eat mainly seeds and other soft vegetative matter. High-altitude genera living in harsh environments, such as Tinamotis, will eat most of the plant, not just the succulent parts.|$|E
25|$|Diversity of {{terrestrial}} wildlife and fishes in igapó is highly influenced by flooding. During periods of inundation, {{vast numbers of}} aquatic species migrate into the flooded forest in search of food. Fish populations are highest during maximum fruiting periods and river dolphins and giant otters move in to prey upon them. Compared to terra firme forests, Igapó features lower nutrients and favors slow-growing plants with low <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit</b> production, which {{has resulted in a}} lower diversity and abundance of animals.|$|E

500|$|Pulveroboletus bembae is {{a species}} of fungus in the Boletaceae family that was first {{described}} in 2009. It is known only from the rainforest of northern Gabon, a region known for its high level of species diversity. Like all boletes, P.bembae has <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies that form spores in tubes perpendicular to the ground {{on the underside of}} the cap. These yellowish tubes form a surface of pores, each about 1–2mm in diameter. The brownish caps may reach up to [...] wide, and rest atop pale brown stems up to [...] long. The stems have a woolly, whitish yellow ring of tissue that is short-lived, and may be absent in older specimens. The spores of P.bembae are spindle- or fuse-shaped, and have rough surfaces—a detail observable when viewed with scanning electron microscopy. The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal relationship with Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, the dominant tree species of the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. Other similar Pulveroboletus species in the area include P.annulus and P.croceus, which may be differentiated from P.bembae by a combination of macro- and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|In botany, a berry is a <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit</b> {{without a}} stone {{produced}} {{from a single}} flower containing one ovary. Berries so defined include grapes, currants, and tomatoes, as well as cucumbers, eggplants (aubergines) and bananas, but exclude certain fruits commonly called berries, such as strawberries and raspberries. The berry {{is the most common}} type of <b>fleshy</b> <b>fruit</b> in which the entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into a potentially edible [...] "pericarp". Berries may be formed from one or more carpels from the same flower (i.e. from a simple or a compound ovary).
