The present research results demonstrates that citronellal and citral can greatly attract L. serricorne adults at lower rates, and repel L. serricorne adults at higher rates. Moreover, rutin significantly repels L. serricorne adults. Provided with a proper formulation, rate, and reasonable application strategy, citronella, citral, and rutin {{may be used to}} effectively prevent L. serricorne infestations. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the citronellal, citral, and rutin against L. serricorne larvae deserves to be further investigated in the future, because the L. serricorne larvae usually results in the most serious loss due to their mass feeding and harmful metabolite (Mahroof and Phillips 2014). The effect of L. serricorne adults and larvae long-term contacting the citronellal, citral, and rutin also needs to be researched, because this will affect the behavioral response of L. serricorne adults and larvae.|$|E

Water apple {{is one of}} the <b>fruit</b> <b>plants</b> <b>which</b> become leading commodity. Demak regency is the centre of earning water apple fruit in Central Java, because of that water apple become the icon of Demak regency. This study aims to analyze the Value Chain of Water apple fruits in Demak regency. Not only to formulate strategies from the empowerment but also to increase farm productivity of water apple fruits. The date are used in this study are primary and secondary data. This study used a descriptive statistical analysis for the description of profile of the respondents in the research area. The method of value chain is used to analyse strategy as development and method of analysis hierarchy process (ahp) through focus group discussion (fgd) to see on empowerment as well as done having interviews with key persons who are competent for farm productivity of water apple. The results of research based of calculation of analysis of Value Chain's water apple in Demak regency or outer regency. In this case, there are differences for amount of profits and marketing margins between farmers, jobber, and small traders. People who got benefit from the selling of water apple fruits are small traders, because they get profit per 1 kg of the highest between farmers and jobbers in amount calculation is USD 4, 875. Small traders also gain marketing margin for the highest point between farmers and jobbers in amount of calculation is Rp 5, 000. This result got financial loss to the farmers, and could be decrease their life welfare, because of that, it is needed an effort to cut the marketing chain are made by jobbers to be more efficient and directly support financial of farmer.

Similar to other groups of plants, very little is known regarding patterns and distances of seed dispersal in orchids. Orchid seeds are generally assumed to be widely dispersed by wind because of their small size and low weight. Between 2006 and 2008, we conducted a field study of the distances at which orchid seeds are dispersed, and determined factors affecting dispersal. Investigations included 13 populations of six terrestrial orchid species – Cypripedium calceolus, Cephalanthera rubra, Epipactis helleborine, Goodyera repens, Neottia ovata, and Platanthera bifolia. To evaluate seed dispersal in orchid populations, 8. 5 -cm Petri dishes (traps) with self-adhesive paper were placed along transects, starting from a group of <b>fruiting</b> <b>plants,</b> <b>which</b> were considered to be the dispersal source.

On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass: and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds (where the water as it might be supposed, never overflowed,) I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a very great and strong stalk: and there were divers other <b>plants,</b> <b>which</b> I had no knowledge of, or understanding about, and that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out.

30|$|Fruit {{is one of}} {{important}} tissues in <b>fruited</b> <b>plants,</b> <b>which</b> harbors seed formation, development, and maturity. According to respiratory intensity during ripening, fruit is divided into climacteric and non-climacteric phenotypes. The climacteric fruit must release massive ethylene at ripening, also called ethylene-dependent fruit. On the contrary, the non-climacteric fruit is ethylene-independent. To date, ethylene-dependent fleshy-fruits are the primary materials for studying fruit ripening, such as tomato, apple, and banana. In ethylene-dependent fruits, ERF, as the final response gene in ethylene signaling pathway, directly regulate fruit ripening by binding to the promoters of their downstream genes, including ACO, ACS, PG, EXP, and PSY (Han et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014). At present, LeERF 1, MaERF 9, MdERF 1, and MdERF 3 has been reported as the positive activator (Li et al. 2007, 2016; Wang et al. 2007; Xiao et al. 2013), whereas SlERF 6, MaERF 11, and MdERF 2 are the negative repressors for fruit ripening (Han et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2012). Of these ERFs, MaERF 9 and MaERF 11 could not only regulate the transcription levels of ACO 1 and ACS 1 by binding to their promoter, but also physically interacted with ACO 1 (Xiao et al. 2013). Interestingly, MaERF 11 also interact with MaHDA 1, the complex repress expression levels of downstream genes targeted by MaERF 11 via histone deacetylation (Han et al. 2016). Moreover, the regulatory route of ERF genes is intricate during fruit ripening. In apple, MdERF 2 presents at least three roads in regulating MdACS expression. MdERF 2 repressor and MdERF 3 activator could regulate the transcription level of MdACS by binding to their promoter, respectively. Meanwhile, MdERF 2 inhibit MdERF 3 activity by combining to the DRE element in the promoter, indirectly suppressed the expression level of MdACS. Thirdly, a directly interaction between MdERF 2 and MdERF 3 restrain the binding of MdERF 3 to the MdACS promoter, and then suppress the MdACS expressed in fruit flesh (Li et al. 2016). In tomato, SlERF.B 3 {{has the ability to}} activate the regulatory network for fruit ripening. A dominant repressor version of SlERF.B 3 (SlERF.B 3 -SRDX) down-regulates ethylene receptor levels, but enhances triple response and up-regulated the expression levels of EIN 3 -like gene, contributing to an acceleration of fruit ripening (Liu et al. 2013). Further study found that SlERF.B 3 -SRDX could alter the expression pattern of other ERF family members. Most notably, SlERF.B 3 -SRDX also stimulate the transcription levels of ripening regulators, including RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), NON-RIPENING (NOR), COLORLESS NON-RIPENING (CNR), and Homeodomain-leucine zipper HOMEOBOX (HB- 1) (Liu et al. 2014). Therefore, the regulatory role of AP 2 /ERF TF is multiple, and their regulated mechanism is very complex during fruit ripening.|$|R

Animals affected include cattle, sheep, horses, goats, and wildlife such as elk and mule deer. Horses are very susceptible to the poisoning, and do not recover from locoism. Cattle, sheep, and horses find the plant palatable and even preferable to other forages, even when grass is readily available. They may become chemically addicted to the plant.
