Methods: This research used a descriptive-comparative method and {{the sample of}} the study included 60 mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> suffering from autism and down syndromes. The sample was selected among all mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> {{in the age of}} 6 - 12 who were suffering from autism and Down syndrome in Kerman in 2014. In order to measure the variables of the research we used 2 questionnaires, the Pennsylvania anxiety questionnaire and the scale of aptitude toward hope among adults. Results: The results showed that the amount of anxiety and hope among mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> suffering from autism was different from mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> suffering from Down syndrome. Conclusion: The anxiety between mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> with autism syndrome was more than mothers <b>having</b> <b>children</b> with Down syndrome.

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study that explores {{the experiences of}} Latin as choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> Research supports that women choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> experience cultural expectations and negative social feedback regarding their decision. Given the research findings regarding the experiences {{of women in the}} general population who choose not to <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> the researcher was curious about the culture-specific themes that might be identified that are relevant to the experience of being a female choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> in the Latino culture. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was selected and 10 Latina participants from Central America were interviewed about their experiences with choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> Four broad themes were identified: participants 2 ̆ 7 perspectives regarding their decision process to not <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> factors influencing their decision, social interactions experienced regarding their decision, and their sense of identity as women and Latinas choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> The findings suggest that interpersonal approaches toward understanding gender do not take into account complex gender identities that include non-traditional traits and behaviors, such as choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> The results also suggest that the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s decision process in choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> is a multidimensional process involving cultural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors that may occur concurrently and vary with time and situation. In addition, the findings suggest that despite cultural expectations, negative social interactions, and complex intrapersonal process, Latinas choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> are able to continue with their decision through the help of social support and perseverance.

40|$|Background Taiwan {{currently}} {{has one of}} lowest birth rates {{in the world and}} is predicted to lead to &lsquo;zero or negative population growth&rsquo; in the foreseeable future. Despite many incentives and policies being implemented to encourage Taiwanese women to <b>have</b> a <b>child,</b> the birth rate still remains low. Aim This study aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the personal, social, and cultural factors influencing Taiwanese women&rsquo;s motherhood decision-making. In addition, this study aimed to provide knowledge about what factors enable or constrain Taiwanese women to <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> which may inform strategies for more fully informed decision-making in light of cultural and contemporary issues. Methodology Grounded theory was used to understand the influencing factors contributing to Taiwanese women&rsquo;s decision making to <b>have</b> a <b>child.</b> Semi-structured interviewing from first time mothers and theoretical sampling were applied to recruit participants until data saturation was achieved with 34 participants in Taipei, Taiwan. Constant comparative analysis with open, axial, and selective coding was used to generate a substantive theory of Taiwanese women decision making to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> process. Findings The finding indicated the influencing factors of Taiwanese women&rsquo;s decision making to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> From this the core category, &lsquo;balancing between <b>having</b> <b>children</b> and maintaining the quality of life&rsquo;, integrates all categories and incorporates the process of Taiwanese women&rsquo;s decision making to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> Causal conditions included cultural norms and being a woman. Living with invisible pressure to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> was identified as phenomena. Childbearing and quality of life, and woman&rsquo;s attitudes toward <b>having</b> <b>children</b> were emerged as context. Weighing up the choices, husband&rsquo;s attitudes toward children, age and personal choices were found as intervening conditions which influenced their decision-making and coping strategies. Path to childbearing, making the alternative decision to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> and maintaining the quality of life were the strategies for decision-making and coping. Balancing between <b>having</b> <b>children</b> and maintaining the quality of life was the consequences of strategies for decision-making. Discussion The process of how women seek to balance between <b>having</b> <b>children</b> and maintaining their quality of life when making a decision to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> <b>has</b> not been previously addressed. The influences were identified as childbearing attitudes in contemporary Taiwan which included persistent traditional role of being women, and Confucian values of filial piety and social pressures. Moreover, women&rsquo;s education attainment empowers them to be autonomous. Financial circumstance and pursuing the better quality of life were identified as two of key factors when they made a decision to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> Recommendations For research, {{there is a need to}} explore Taiwanese women&rsquo;s decision to have a second or third child, husband&rsquo;s attitudes towards childbearing, women&rsquo;s views in relation to childless, or termination need to be investigated. Conclusion, this grounded theory study demonstrates the process of &lsquo;balancing between <b>having</b> <b>children</b> and maintaining the quality of life&rsquo; when women made a decision to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> or became pregnant and decided to continue their pregnancy. These findings from this study extend the understanding of the real situation of Taiwanese women&rsquo;s decision making to <b>have</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R
