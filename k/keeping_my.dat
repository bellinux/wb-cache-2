In an interview with Rolling Stone, Thile said: [...] "The studio needs to be dark. I don't want to be reminded by my surroundings that what I'm singing about isn't happening right then.

500|$|The diamond was {{originally}} bought by Harriet Annenberg Ames, {{the sister of}} the billionaire publisher Walter Annenberg, in 1967. Annenberg Ames felt unable to wear the diamond in her native New York City, and decided to sell the stone. She later said that [...] "I found myself positively cringing and <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> gloves on for fear it would be seen.... It sat in a bank vault for years. It seemed foolish to keep it if one could not use it. As things are in New York one could not possibly wear it publicly".|$|E

It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists.|$|E
500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E

500|$|After {{consulting}} with his lawyers in October 2005, Stollery {{responded to the}} Church with a far more aggressive stance. Now believing the accusation to be completely frivolous, Stollery publicly refused, challenging the Church with: [...] "I'm <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> domain, see you in court." [...] Again {{in an interview with}} ONE News, Stollery reiterated {{that he was going to}} retain rights to [...] "ScienTOMogy", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive [...] "annoying calls" [...] from local Scientologists. [...] "The first few I was stupid enough to answer, but now they just call and call and call. When I did speak to 'a church member here in Auckland' he kept insisting over and over that we meet to talk about my 'vendetta' with the church." ...|$|E
500|$|While at AFIT, Chaffee {{continued}} {{to participate in}} astronaut candidate testing as the pool of candidates dropped to 271 in mid-1963. It was noted during testing {{that he had a}} very small lung capacity, but that he used it better than most people with greater capacity. He returned from a hunting trip to Fairborn, Ohio, on October 14, 1963, when he found a message from NASA in Houston, Texas. He called them back, and discovered he had been chosen as an astronaut. On October 18, 1963, it was officially announced {{that he was one of}} fourteen chosen for Astronaut Group 3. He said, [...] "I was very pleased with the appointment. I've always wanted to fly and perform adventurous flying tasks all my life. Ever since the first seven Mercury astronauts were named, I've been <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> studies up." ...|$|E
500|$|World {{number one}} Mark Williams was {{defeated}} 1–5 by Anthony Hamilton, {{who made a}} break of 133.

[...] Hunter and Hendry made high breaks of 49 and 55 in defeating Brian Morgan and Jimmy Michie 5–1, respectively. After the match Hendry—the world number two and a seven-time world champion said [...] "I feel like going to apologise to each fan one by one because {{it was such a}} bad match". John Higgins whitewashed Barry Pinches 5–0, compiling a 132 break in the last frame in a match where Pinches made a high break of 33. Jimmy White overcame James Wattana 5–4 having trailed 2–3.

2500|$|At {{the close}} of my sophomore year [...] my Greek {{professor}} [...] asked me to teach the course in elementary physics in the preparatory department during the next year. To my reply that I did not know any physics at all, his answer was, [...] "Anyone who can do well in my Greek can teach physics." [...] "All right," [...] said I, [...] "you {{will have to take}} the consequences, but I will try and see what I can do with it." [...] I at once purchased an Avery's Elements of Physics, and spent the greater part of my summer vacation of 1889 at home – trying to master the subject. [...] I doubt if I have ever taught better in my life than in my first course in physics in 1889. I was so intensely interested in <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> knowledge ahead of that of the class that they may have caught some of my own interest and enthusiasm.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are serious}} reasons for <b>my</b> <b>keeping</b> up appearances," [...] she said. [...] "I shall {{go in the}} carriage. You mustn't go at all." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then Sir Mellegrans laughed again, and {{he closed}} the trap-door and went away, {{and he said to}} himself: [...] "Now indeed have I such hostages in <b>my</b> <b>keeping</b> that King Arthur must needs set right this wrong he hath aforetime done me. For I now have in <b>my</b> <b>keeping</b> not only his Queen, but also the {{foremost}} knight of his Round Table; wherefore King Arthur must needs come to me to make such terms with me as I shall determine." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chomsky {{endeavors to}} keep his family life, {{linguistic}} scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another, calling himself [...] "scrupulous at <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> politics out of the classroom". An intensely private person, he is uninterested in appearances and the fame that his work has brought him. McGilvray suggested that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, {{but that he was}} impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so. He also has little interest in modern art and music. He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the U.S., he subscribes to The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Christian Science Monitor. He acknowledges that his income and the financial security that it accords him means that he lives a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population. He characterizes himself as a [...] "worker", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Van Gogh's {{activities}} during the two years {{he lived with his}} brother, Theo, in Paris, 1886–1888. The fact that he had painted Sunflowers already is only revealed in the spring of 1889, when Gauguin claimed one of the Arles versions in exchange for studies he had left behind after leaving Arles for Paris. Van Gogh was upset and replied that Gauguin had absolutely no right to make this request: [...] "I am definitely <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> sunflowers in question. He has two of them already, let that hold him. And if he is not satisfied with the exchange he has made with me, he can take back his little Martinique canvas, and his self-portrait sent me from Brittany, at the same time giving me back both my portrait and the two sunflower canvases which he has taken to Paris. So if he ever broaches this subject again, I've told you just how matters stand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harold {{said of the}} rehearsals, [...] "I {{have known}} about this live episode {{for such a long}} time but all of a sudden it has crept up on us. I am really nervous but now we have started rehearsing, I am feeling equally excited. It will {{definitely}} be an experience and I hope Perry runs smoothly!" [...] She also said she was [...] "terrified" [...] of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she [...] "was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was [...] "really, really nervous" [...] and that the prospect of acting the birth was [...] "very scary", but added, [...] "I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at EastEnders for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm <b>keeping</b> <b>my</b> fingers crossed that it'll go well." [...] To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told [...] "It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!" [...] She found it [...] "quite difficult" [...] to imagine what it would be like to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show One Born Every Minute to help, as she did not want to [...] "overdo the scene or make it look really fake." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{went right}} through the academy, from the lowest to the highest class, and when I left, the professor, as we called our principal, said that I {{was ready to go}} to college, and urged me very much to do so. But I was not in any hurry, and my parents agreed with me that, after four years of school-life, I had better wait a while before {{beginning}} a new course. All this disturbed the professor very much, but he insisted on <b>my</b> <b>keeping</b> up <b>my</b> studies, so as not to get rusty, and he came up to our house very often, for the purpose of seeing what I was doing in the study line, and how I was doing it.|$|R
