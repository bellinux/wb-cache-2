5|$|Images of trench warfare became iconic {{symbols of}} <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b> and endurance. The post-war world had many {{veterans}} who were maimed or damaged by shell shock. In 1921 1,187,450 {{men were in}} receipt of pensions for war disabilities, with a fifth of these having suffered serious loss of limbs or eyesight, paralysis or lunacy.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as the {{defender of the}} Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction of}} the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he treated fairly, and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained from doing so for the <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b> it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale <b>human</b> <b>suffering.</b> Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E

5|$|The Holy Bible is {{the third}} studio album by Welsh {{alternative}} rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 29 August 1994 by record label Epic. At the time the album was written and recorded, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards was struggling with severe depression, alcohol abuse, self-harm and anorexia nervosa, and its contents are considered by many sources to reflect his mental state. The songs focus on themes relating to politics and <b>human</b> <b>suffering.</b> The Holy Bible was the band's last album released before Edwards' disappearance on 1 February 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in <b>human</b> <b>suffering.</b> For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E
5|$|The gilding and monumentality of {{the cross}} link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of <b>human</b> <b>suffering,</b> the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E

5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} <b>humans</b> <b>suffering</b> some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that {{his use of the}} word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the first to use the term in a publication.|$|R

5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Podàrgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for <b>human</b> <b>suffering,</b> but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste for the effects of the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow <b>human</b> <b>suffering.</b> Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on <b>human</b> <b>suffering.</b> As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E

The memorial complex was conceptualized and designed by the Ukrainian folk artist Anatoliy Haydamaka and architect Yuriy Kovalyov.

25|$|Hermeneutic {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset {{that human beings are}} relational and it attempts to explain <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b> and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is saying {{is that it is not}} through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b> and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of {{behavioral}} therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a therapist wanted {{to understand how the}} world affects his clients, he might integrate behavioral therapy into his practice. But, once he wanted to understand the inner dynamics of the psyche, he would have to integrate psychodynamic therapy in with behavioral therapy. The problem is that psychodynamic therapy says <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b> is caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while behavioral therapy says that <b>human</b> <b>suffering</b> is caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{conducted}} in rats {{have indicated that}} their degree of sexual arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone. When testosterone-deprived rats were given medium levels of testosterone, their sexual behaviors (copulation, partner preference, etc.) resumed, but not when given low amounts of the same hormone. Therefore, these mammals may provide a model for studying clinical populations among <b>humans</b> <b>suffering</b> from sexual arousal deficits such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder.|$|R

25|$|A related {{argument}} {{revolves around}} non-human organisms' ability to feel pain.

25|$|In sum, the {{argument}} is that an understanding of the mental disorders must not only have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999).
