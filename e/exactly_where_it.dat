If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was placed in the summands.|$|E
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E

Sam Prell of Joystiq praised the environment, writing that the uninhabited dreamscapes feel [...] "almost haunted; there is a constant, pervasive feeling that something is not right here". He also favourably compared the game to the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz. Richard Cobbett of IGN also praised the way the game [...] "sets up a hauntingly cryptic atmosphere with no real hint of <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it's</b> going, slowly opening up the watercolour town of Pinwheel for exploration".|$|R

25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} case {{and one which}} {{has given rise to}} long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by Ascanius and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.|$|E
25|$|At the June 1994, {{grand jury}} hearing, Ross Cutlery {{provided}} store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305mm) stiletto knife {{six weeks before}} the murders. The knife {{was determined to be}} similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that store employees had sold their story to The National Enquirer for $12,500. The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating the knife had never been used. The police searched Simpson's Rockingham estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was in the house and it was promptly recovered.|$|E

My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were also}} more mixed reviews.

[...] Natalie Nichols of Los Angeles Times compared the album to a pinball machine and said that [...] "listening to these 13 songs is a bit like pinging around inside one of those old-fashioned amusement devices. Giant grinding beats slam you from pole to pole, there are lots of flashy effects, the environment is completely artificial, and once the ball is launched, you can see <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it's</b> going."

2500|$|Nevertheless, the Allied {{campaign}} was {{hampered by the}} poor intelligence available, which included antiquated maps, unfamiliarity with the terrain, and limited aerial photography. Senior military commanders including MacArthur and Blamey were unaware of the extraordinarily difficult terrain and the extreme conditions in which the battles would be fought, and orders given to the commanders were sometimes unrealistic given the conditions on the ground. In the end though, the strategy used against the Japanese in Papua—widely criticised at the time—led to an eventual, though costly, victory. The American official historian Samuel Milner judged that [...] "the only result, strategically speaking" [...] of the Kokoda track campaign and subsequent fighting in Papua [...] "was that {{after six months of}} bitter fighting and some 8,500 casualties, including 3,000 dead, the Southwest Pacific Area was <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> would have been the previous July had it been able to secure the beachhead before the Japanese got there". More recently, Australian historian Nicholas Anderson has concluded that while the Kokoda Track was a significant Allied victory, it was less important to the outcome of the Pacific War than the defeat of the main Japanese effort at this time during the Guadalcanal Campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{he began}} his mission around 1900, he {{continued}} to have other business interests as well. [...] One of those interests was gold mining. [...] In 1897, the Los Angeles Times published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of [...] "X-Ray Prospecting" [...] for gold. [...] Yoakum {{reported that he had}} laid [...] a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the x-ray plate while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. [...] The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to [...] "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> lies and in what quantities." [...] Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. [...] In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement (pictured at left) offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke {{for the first time in}} [...] "tongues." [...] He reported: [...] "I was in the heart of Mexico in a church, speaking through an interpreter to the Mexicans and Indians, when suddenly a distinct rush of some might wind came upon me, and when I opened my mouth it was not English, but a beautiful smooth Castilian language, and for 20 or 30 minutes I held that large audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the filing}} {{deadline}} for candidates looming, Lawrence said in January that [...] "we have adopted this other formula - a makeshift redistricting - and that's {{what it will}} be - to hurtle this present situation of avoiding having an election of all 27 member of Congress at large. Subsequent legislatures, I hope, will {{be in a position to}} redistrict the state properly, and have an equitable division somewhere close to the 419,000 mean". The governor called a special session of the legislature to convene on January 22, for the purpose of drawing up congressional districts. Chester's Democratic state representative, John E. Gremminger (aka [...] "Reds Gremminger"), attacked Bell's plan to combine Delaware and Chester counties into one district, with two congressmen elected at-large, calling it [...] "unworkable and un-American". After an inconclusive meeting with Lawrence and Morse, Bloom declared: [...] "If this matter had been left to the legislature to decide early last year, without outside interference, we would have had a solution now and there would have been no reason for a special session. As Republican state chairman I shall assist and advise in every way that I can, but the final decision on what districts will be eliminated is a matter for the legislature and its committees to decide." [...] Morse, in turn, retorted: [...] "It would appear that responsibility for the delay is going to be placed <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> belongs - with the Republicans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, on {{the other}} hand, thought it was [...] "the best of the recent {{roadshow}} musicals...

Finian's Rainbow is an exception... <b>it</b> knows <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> <b>it's</b> going, and is getting there as quickly and with {{as much fun as}} possible... it is the best-directed musical since West Side Story. It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the New York Times review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken." ...|$|R
