500|$|... "Down to Earth" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber, Mason [...] "MdL" [...] Levy, Carlos and Steven Battey of The Jackie Boyz, and Kevin Risto and Waynne Nugent of Midi Mafia. It was {{recorded}} at Icon Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and it was mixed at Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. The track {{was one of three}} songs on the standard edition of My World that Bieber co-wrote. In an interview in the November 14, 2009 issue of Billboard, Bieber explained the meaning behind the song stating, [...] "It's a ballad about the feelings I had when my parents split up and how I <b>helped</b> <b>my</b> family get through it. I think a lot of kids have had their parents split up, and they should know that it wasn't because of something they did. I hope people can relate to it." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 1984 season, Audi added two-time world {{champion}} Walter Röhrl to their star line-up and Mouton {{now had a}} part-time role, competing in five WRC events. For {{the first time in}} nine years, she did not enter the Monte Carlo Rally. However, Mouton signed up to commentate the event for Radio Monte Carlo. She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second was fantastic. When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side. My dancing background <b>helped</b> <b>my</b> rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!" [...] This would remain her last podium position in the World Rally Championship.|$|E
500|$|According to Harrison's later recollection, Spector {{suggested}} that [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp" [...] might attract a few cover versions if {{he changed the}} lyrics. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison acknowledges that the song was [...] "a piece of personal indulgence", but [...] "those words were written because that's what it was" [...] – a tribute to Frank Crisp. A number of Crisp's homilies directly inspired other Harrison songs {{during the first half}} of the 1970s, such as [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] and [...] "The Answer's at the End". Harrison went on to identify philosophically with Crisp, of whom he writes elsewhere in I, Me, Mine: [...] "Sir Frank <b>helped</b> <b>my</b> awareness; whatever it was I felt became stronger, or found more expression by moving into that house, because everything stepped up or was heightened." [...] Leng considers that the song, along with [...] "All Things Must Pass", predicts Harrison's eventual [...] "retreat into an internal musical dialogue, set amid the woods and gardens of Friar Park", a change of perspective marked by his 1979 eponymous solo album.|$|E

500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and <b>helped</b> <b>my</b> confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E

Barbara Stanwyck later reflected, [...] "...and for an actress, {{let me tell you}} the way those sets were lit, the house, Walter’s apartment, those dark shadows, those slices of harsh light at strange angles – all that <b>helped</b> <b>my</b> performance. The way Billy staged it and John Seitz lit it, it was all one sensational mood." ...|$|E

[...] "I think it’s great to play Fed Cup," [...] said Radwańska, [...] "I’ve been playing {{for the last couple}} of years and I really think it <b>helped</b> <b>my</b> team to go up and, you know, I’m very happy about it and I’m always ready to play".|$|E

He treated me more like a child than an adult and not much was discussed between us, in character or out. When you idolize someone like I did, you tend to submit rather than assert yourself.
