50|$|Red-shouldered hawks are forest raptors. In the East, {{they live}} in {{bottomland}} hardwood stands, flooded <b>deciduous</b> <b>swamps,</b> and upland mixed deciduous-conifer forests. They tend to live in stands with an open subcanopy, which {{makes it easier for}} them to hunt. They are not exclusively birds of deep forest, though; one can find red-shouldered hawks in some suburban areas where houses or other buildings are mixed into woodlands. In the West, {{they live in}} riparian and oak woodlands, and also in eucalyptus groves and some residential areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} protects {{a variety of}} {{landscape}} types, like forested sand dunes, several different types of bogs and <b>swamp</b> <b>woods.</b> Estonia's largest area of loose sand (14 ha) {{is located in the}} reserve. The nature reserve is an important habitat for several threatened species, e.g. Bog Orchid, Fly Orchid and Brown Beak-Sedge.|$|R
50|$|The vast Swamp was {{a network}} of forests, wetlands, and grasslands. In the lowest, flattest areas, prone to {{permanent}} inundation, <b>deciduous</b> <b>swamp</b> forests predominated, characterized especially by species of ash, elm, cottonwood and sycamore. In slightly higher areas with some topographic relief and better drainage, beech, maples, basswood, tuliptree and other more mesic species were dominant. On elevated beach ridges and moraines with good to excessive drainage, more xeric species, especially oak and hickory, were dominant. Unlike other swampy areas of the Great Lakes, such as northern Minnesota, there were no conifers (Sampson, 1930). The area contained non-forested wetlands, particularly marsh and wet prairies, with marshes being particularly extensive along the Lake Erie shoreline east of Toledo.|$|R
50|$|The cinereous tinamou {{lives in}} a lowland {{rainforest}} or swamp forest, up to 700 m altitude. They also live in second growth forest, along with bushy areas with scattered trees.They {{have been known to}} take advantage of coffee and cocoa plantations and, on occasion, will utilize savanna. They prefer to live near streams or thick <b>swamp</b> <b>woods.</b> Their preferred habitat is thick, dark, and dense. They are abundant, within the upper Amazon, in the varzea.|$|R

50|$|The Petrie Island Park area is {{classified}} as Significant Wetlands by the province of Ontario, which defines it as an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest. One of the last relatively natural environments on the Ontario side of the Ottawa River below the nation’s capital, the archipelago features a Carolinian <b>deciduous</b> <b>swamp</b> forest, possibly {{the only one in}} Eastern Canada north of Toronto. Seasonal flooding, extensive sand deposits, abundant water plants and thin but fertile soils have helped maintain a variety of life not found in many other places and its habitats are extremely rich. There are several species of turtles, some rare, and well over 130 species of birds have been identified at Petrie. There are also provincially rare plants, including stands of hackberry trees. There is a network of trails through a nature preserve, and a small interpretive center, both maintained by volunteers.|$|R

50|$|This secretive {{species is}} only known to feed at night. Its diet {{consists}} of seeds, aquatic plants, grain, rice, snails, small fish and insects. It inhabits stagnant or slow-flowing natural and artificial wetlands, within or adjacent to evergreen, <b>deciduous</b> or <b>swamp</b> forests, {{on which it}} depends for roosting and nesting, usually in tree-holes.

50|$|The {{forests of}} Cambodia include evergreen, semi-evergreen, <b>deciduous,</b> <b>swamp,</b> {{mangrove}} and bamboo forest in various conditions from closed to disturbed and mosaic formations. There are also re-growth and plantation forests {{as well as}} open forest types including evergreen shrub land and dry deciduous shrub land. About 10% of Cambodia’s flora is endemic. Cover is largely dominated by moist lowland evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest and deciduous forest. A unique seasonally inundated forest is found along the flood plains surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake. Extensive and fairly intact mangroves are found along the southern marine coast. forests, which cover approximately 70 {{percent of the country}} and which potentially constitute a second pillar of the economy in addition to the primary one, agriculture. A survey in the 1960s disclosed that Cambodia had more than 130,000 square kilometres of forests that contained many species of tropical growth and trees but not teak or other valuable sources of hardwood. Some destruction of the forest environment undoubtedly occurred in the war that followed in the 1970s, but its extent has not been determined. Most of the heavy fighting took place in areas uncovered by dense tropical jungle.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{summarizes}} {{all data}} on molluscan fauna from the Šúr National Nature Reserve between 1918 – 2005. It represents the largest Central-European remaining {{area of the}} autochthonous virgin alder <b>swamp</b> <b>wood</b> lying in a low basin (Carici elongatae-Alnetum Swickerath, 1933). Adjacent protected biotopes (flooded meadows, thermophilous Pannonian oak woods, forest-steppe-like shrub formations, drainage ditch and fishpond) were also surveyed. Altogether, 82 species in the target area were found during 1918 – 2005. In total we found 38 mollusc species (13 freshwater) in six biotopes in 2005; 24 species (7 freshwater) in alder wood; woodland and hygrophilous species were the most numerous. Presence of Viviparus acerosus, Anisus leucostoma, Pseudanodonta complanata, and Pisidium amnicum is dubious.
