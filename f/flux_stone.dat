40|$|Kelleys Island Lime &amp; Transport Company laid narrow-gauge {{railroad}} tracks to facilitate its large scale production of <b>flux</b> <b>stone.</b> Stone was loaded into dump cars by steam shovels and hauled to crusher plants, {{where it was}} broken nd graded according to size. It was then reloaded into the dump cars and transported to the storage bins...|$|E
30|$|At present, it is {{accepted}} {{that the increase}} of GHG concentration in atmosphere is attributed to human activities. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced as the by-products of various non-energy-related industrial activities. Industrial processes can chemically transform raw materials, which often release waste gases such as CO 2. The processes include production of iron, steel, metallurgical coke, cement, lime, carbonate consuming processes (e.g., <b>flux</b> <b>stone,</b> flue gas desulfurization, and glass manufacturing), ammonia and urea, petrochemical, aluminum, soda ash, titanium dioxide, ferroalloy and glass. The production of some petrochemicals results in the release of small amounts of CO 2 emissions. Petrochemicals are chemicals isolated or derived from petroleum or natural gas. The chemical and petrochemical industry accounts for 30  % of global industrial energy use and 16  % of direct CO 2 emissions. More {{than half of the}} energy demand is for feedstock use, which cannot be reduced through energy efficiency measures [2, 3].|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The static {{stability}} @ z ¯ ` and the meridional gradient @ y ¯ ` of the longitudinally averaged potential temperature ¯ ` both play prominent roles in theories for baroclinic eddy <b>fluxes</b> (<b>Stone</b> 1972; Green 1970). Despite much ongoing work, {{there is still}} no consensus on how radiative and dynamic processes interact to maintain the {{static stability}} and the mean meridional potential temperature gradient in the extratropics. Establishing relationships between these quantities is therefore an important step towards enhancing our understanding of fundamental atmospheric dynamics. Here we focus on the isentropic slope I = Γ@ z ¯ `=@ y ¯ `, which relates the static stability to the meridional potential temperature gradient. It is convenient to normalize the isentropic slope I<F 6...|$|R
5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, <b>flux</b> <b>stones</b> {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1870, a plan {{to reduce}} the costs of {{maintaining}} the Trench incline resulted in the company leasing Lubstree wharf from the third Duke of Sutherland. A new railway was built from the wharf to the Lilleshall Company works, and a wharfage charge of one halfpenny per ton for coal and other merchandise was agreed. The Shropshire Union set aside 30 boats {{to cope with the}} traffic, and in 1878 tolls for iron ore from Ellesmere Port to Lubstree were reduced, but by 1880, the only traffic on the Humber Arm was <b>fluxing</b> <b>stone.</b> In order to improve its use, the Shropshire Union agreed rates for carrying 300 to 400 tons of limestone and 100 to 150 tons of iron ore per week, and these measures were successful, as a further railway siding was built when the lease was renewed in 1891, and it was renewed for a further 14 years in 1905. Longdon aqueduct was in a poor state of repair by 1899, when the company looked at closing the canal from Eyton to Shrewsbury, but the legal difficulties of a railway company closing a canal meant that it stayed open.|$|R
50|$|Main {{feed into}} a sinter plant is base mix, which {{consists}} of iron ore fines, coke fines and <b>flux</b> (lime <b>stone)</b> fines. In addition to base mix, coke fines, flux fines, sinter fines, iron dust (collected from plant de-dusting system & ESP) and plant waste are mixed in proportion (by weight) in a rotary drum, often called mixing and nodulizing drum. Calcined lime is used as binder of the mixed material along with water (all in particular proportion by weight) to form feed-sinter of about 5 to 7 mm in size. This sinter globules are fed to sintering machine and burnt there-in to produce blast furnace feed sinter.|$|R
