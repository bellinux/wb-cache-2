5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> immense harm {{when in the}} hands of the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E

25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

500|$|During the Second Reading of the NCMP bill, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{presented}} to Parliament three main justifications for the NCMP scheme. First, {{he said that}} having a minimum number of opposition members in Parliament through the NCMP scheme would provide younger People's Action Party ("PAP") MPs with sparring partners to [...] "sharpen their debating skills". Secondly, the presence of opposition members in Parliament would educate the younger generation of voters {{about the role of}} a constitutional opposition and the limits of what <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> He said this was especially important because the younger generation who had not lived and witnessed the conflicts within Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s [...] "harbour myths about the role of an Opposition" [...] and [...] "had no idea how destructive an Opposition could be". Thirdly, the presence of non-PAP MPs in Parliament would act as a check and balance against any governmental impropriety. According to Lee, [...] "some non-PAP MPs will ensure that every suspicion, every rumour of misconduct, will be reported to the non-PAP MPs". The readiness of non-PAP members to bring forth any allegation of misfeasance, or corruption, or nepotism would [...] "dispel suspicions of cover-ups of alleged wrongdoings".|$|E

It's one thing for a song with these lyrics to be included on a CD so that fans who wish to hear <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so, but it's an entirely different matter when this song is played over the publicly owned airwaves, especially {{at a time when}} children are likely to be in the listening audience."

It rated it appropriate for age 13 and up, but made no specific mention of 'If U Seek Amy'.

500|$|As a protege of Slessor, Hardman proclaimed: [...] "An {{air force}} without bombers isn't an air force". He {{maintained}} {{that the only way}} to attain [...] "true and enduring air superiority" [...] was by attacking the enemy's vital centres, which included its means of producing fighters. He recommended that the RAAF purchase one of Britain's nuclear-capable [...] "V bombers"—the Vickers Valiant, Handley Page Victor, or Avro Vulcan—though this never eventuated, and Australia's jet bomber remained the English Electric Canberra until the long-delayed introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C in 1973. Towards the end of his tenure as CAS, Hardman gave an interview in which he criticised Army and Navy operations against a backdrop of continuing interservice rivalry for the defence budget. He was quoted as saying: [...] "The Air Force in this country, for either defence or offence, is the only force worth while. It can be sent anywhere in the world to the point where <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> most good and be rapidly switched to any other point." [...] In contrast to the initial disquiet at his appointment, upon his departure from Australia Hardman was described by The Age as [...] "the outstanding CAS in the RAAF's history", a [...] "brilliant organiser", and a [...] "master of the theory of air power". He was succeeded by McCauley on 18January 1954.|$|E

500|$|In Kamui, Amaterasu assists the Oina tribe defeat two recently-revived demons, Lechku and Nechku, {{who were}} {{creating}} a deadly blizzard {{that threatened to}} destroy the island. In addition to this, Amaterasu discovers that Issun ran away from his home of Ponc'tan to escape his responsibility of being a Celestial Envoy - a messenger of the gods - and his abusive grandfather. After defeating Lechku and Nechku, Amaterasu discovers the wreckage of a flying ship made of iron: the [...] "Ark of Yamato", trapped in the frozen plains of Kamui. Waka appears and reveals {{himself to be a}} member of the Moon Tribe, a long-living race who used the Ark to sail and escape from the Celestial Plain that Orochi invaded. The demons attacked and killed the rest of the Celestials before the Ark fell to earth, releasing the demons upon the mortal world. After defeating the spirits of the felled demons again at the Ark, Amaterasu confronts Yami, the machine-esque leader of the demons who led the genocide of the gods ages ago. After a long battle, Yami drains her power and nearly destroys the Celestial Gods. Before <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> so, Issun, finally accepting his role as a Celestial Envoy, encourages all those they have helped to send their thoughts and prayers to Amaterasu, who regains her powers and defeats Yami, ridding Nippon of all [...] demons.

500|$|Suggesting {{that many}} of the {{philosophical}} and political underpinnings of the author's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life, Palmer's focus turned to Dick's common use of sterility as a metaphor. In [...] "The Gun", [...] "Second Variety", The Penultimate Truth, and [...] "The Last of the Masters", people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility. As Palmer noted of [...] "The Last of the Masters", Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility: [...] "It is not clear why he does not replicate himself, or educate his human servants: it is simply a given that he is sterile. The old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but now under Bors <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> no more than maintain itself." [...] Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility, Palmer asserts that Dick's work presented a social and existential protest. Palmer interpreted Dick's social critique to be that if the act of creation validates existence, and genuinely expresses a form of individuality, then the process of reproduction is alienating, oppressive, and retards an individual's liberty. As Palmer explains, [...] "...this process disempowers consumers, and even technocrats, by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant." [...] Existentially, Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author's concept of what made an object unique and valuable: [...] "A thing can't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject if <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without one". One critic found the prose {{to be as}} [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E
