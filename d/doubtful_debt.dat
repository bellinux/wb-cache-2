40|$|M. Comm. Due to {{uncertainties}} experienced {{while working}} for the South African Revenue Services {{and the fact that}} there are no specific sections in the Income Tax Act no. 58 of 1962 dealing with interest, foreign exchange and bad and <b>doubtful</b> <b>debts</b> of commercial banks there were a need to undertake a study. The study therefore undertakes an examination to determine if the existing sections of the Income Tax Act dealing with interest, foreign exchange and bad and <b>doubtful</b> <b>debts</b> are enough legislation to deal with the interest, foreign exchange and bad and <b>doubtful</b> <b>debts</b> of commercial banks. The study also try to clear all existing uncertainties experienced and mentioned in this study. The study can be divided into the following four parts: A literature study of the definition of "bank" and "banking operations", in terms of history and current legislation. A study of the definition of "interest" and "finance charges", in terms of sections of the Income Tax Act, Act no. 58 of 1962 and applicable court cases. The chapter also concentrates on the application of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act on the interest-transactions of commercial banks as well as the identification of any short falls of the section. Before interest can be treated in terms of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act, the source of the interest will have to be in South Africa. General sourse principles applicable to commercial banks as well as the deductability of interest expenses when expenced to generate exempt income will therefore also be covered in this chapter. A study of the application of section 241 of the Income Tax Act dealing with the foreign exchange of commercial banks. An examination of the way commercial banks should treat their bad and <b>doubtful</b> <b>debts</b> and the factors taken into account in court decisions relating thereto. The most important activities of a bank are identified in this study as the acceptance of deposits, the provision of credit, rendering of financial services and the trade in exchange and the utilisation of money and interest received. In terms of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act, interest include finance charges, premiums or disconto's, all interests and the difference between all amounts payable or receivable in terms of a sale and leaseback agreement. It was found that all the interest of a commercial bank are included in the definition of interest and all the transactions of a commercial bank are treated in terms of section 24 J of the Income Tax Act for income tax purposes. Section 241 of the Income Tax Act focuses on foreign exchange transactions and are found to be enough legislation for the foreign exchange transactions of commercial banks. Although bad and <b>doubtful</b> <b>debts</b> are not part of the activities of a commercial bank they are part of the uncertainties experienced {{while working for}} the South African Revenue Services. During the study it was found that <b>doubtful</b> <b>debts</b> can not be deducted in terms of section 11 (a) of the Income Tax Act but only in terms of section 11 (j) of the Income Tax Act. It is practice for the South African Revenue Services to only allows 25 % of the full amount of <b>doubtful</b> <b>debts,</b> but as this discretion is subject to objection and appeal, the bank is entitled to claim a higher percentage as a deduction if they can provide proveto justify a higher deduction.

40|$|The Commonwealth Government {{could save}} more than $ 800 {{million a year}} by 2017, {{according}} to this report, if it recovers outstanding student loans from deceased estates and people living overseas. Overview: Student loans have helped millions of Australians finance their higher education since the Government introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, HECS, in 1989. The successor to HECS — the Higher Education Loan Program, HELP — lends more than $ 6 billion a year. It {{has been a very}} effective policy. But it has become expensive. By 2017 the Commonwealth will have $ 13 billion of loans on its books that it does not expect to collect. Students and former students repay their education debt only if they earn more than a threshold amount — currently $ 51, 309 a year. Income contingent loans cleverly help cash-poor students pay for their education when they can afford to do so. Some of them never earn enough in Australia to repay what they borrowed. About 17 per cent of new lending is now classified as doubtful, meaning it is not expected to ever be fully repaid. This expense, which appears each year in the Commonwealth Budget, is projected to be $ 1. 1 billion this financial year. With student numbers rapidly increasing, and new uses being found for income contingent loans, <b>doubtful</b> <b>debt</b> costs will continue to rise. This report investigates several ways of reducing <b>doubtful</b> <b>debt</b> while still protecting against financial hardship. One reason for <b>doubtful</b> <b>debt</b> is that HELP debtors leave Australia. Because HELP is repaid through the Australian income tax system it is not collected from people living elsewhere. England and New Zealand have similar student loan schemes and both require debtors in other countries to pay. This report recommends the New Zealand policy of requiring a flat annual repayment from student loan debtors living overseas. For debtors staying in Australia, some never earn more than the income threshold or do so for too few years to repay all their debt. Because the threshold is linked to average weekly earnings, it is increasing in real terms. Over time, this means that fewer debtors are obliged to repay. Linking the threshold to inflation would maintain its real value while increasing future repayment levels. Although these reforms would reduce HELP’s costs, on their own their effect on <b>doubtful</b> <b>debt</b> is modest. Its main cause is that HELP debt in deceased estates is written off. This is not a good use of scarce higher education funding. Most beneficiaries of the HELP write-off will not be financially dependent on the HELP debtor. Partnered HELP debtors earning less than the threshold are not usually the household’s main income earner. Their children will be adults by the time the estate is distributed. Introducing asset contingent HELP repayment for estates over $ 100, 000 would radically improve HELP’s finances. If all these reforms were implemented now, they would save $ 860 million a year by 2016 – 17, and remove the need for planned cuts to teaching and research expenditure. HELP’s repayment system was never designed for lending on the scale we see today. With the reforms in this report, we can achieve the goals of HELP at a much lower cost...|$|E

40|$|Provides the Bank 2 ̆ 7 s {{assessment}} of the current condition of the financial system and potential risks to financial stability. Overview The global financial system continues to be buoyed by strong investor risk appetite. International financial markets have been remarkably stable {{for much of the}} past six months, with historically low volatility and ‘search for yield’ behaviour evident in many asset classes amid highly expansionary monetary policy. This environment has supported economic growth and an ongoing improvement in most banking systems. Nonetheless, a significant re{{assessment of}} risk could lead to a sharp repricing of assets, particularly if markets are less liquid than anticipated. Potential triggers for such a reappraisal include revised expectations for monetary policy in advanced economies. Up to this point, however, market prices have reacted remarkably little to credit and geopolitical events that might have been expected to affect investor risk appetite. Risks surrounding European banks and sovereigns have lessened but not disappeared, given the slow growth environment. European banks have made some progress with balance sheet repair in the lead-up to the release of the European Asset Quality Review, though if the results are unexpectedly negative, it could impede these banks’ ability to raise additional capital. Conditions in many emerging markets have stabilised since early 2014. However, credit and property prices have grown strongly in some emerging economies, including China, which may have made these economies more sensitive to adverse shocks. Financial system stability in Australia is being underpinned by the continued strong financial performance of the banking system. Australian banks have improved their resilience to future shocks by increasing capital ratios, and their profitability remains robust, aided by further declines in bad and <b>doubtful</b> <b>debt</b> charges. They are also benefiting from improved wholesale funding conditions globally. This in turn has put downward pressure on deposit pricing and fostered an environment of stronger price competition in lending. Non-banks are also benefiting from the lower funding costs, with issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities by a wider range of entities (including mortgage originators) picking up and associated spreads narrowing.  ...|$|E

40|$|Overview Reducing the {{thresholds}} {{at which}} former students repay their {{debt to the}} Higher Education Loan Program would increase repayments by an initial $ 500 million a year and more over time. Without change, HELP costs will soar, putting teaching and research at risk of cuts. An estimated $ 1. 6 billion lent to students in 2014 - 15 – a fifth of all lending under the program that year – will not be repaid. Interest subsidies on outstanding debt add $ 200 {{million a year to}} HELP’s costs, but would be five times higher if interest rates return to previous levels. Reducing the initial repayment threshold to $ 42, 000 next year from its current level of $ 54, 126 would cut interest costs and HELP’s rapidly expanding <b>doubtful</b> <b>debt</b> bill while maintaining the fairness and effectiveness of the program. Since 1989 nearly four million Australians have taken out HELP loans, greatly expanding access to tertiary education. It is a vital program, but today too many borrowers either do not repay what they owe, or take too long to clear their debts. Without change, HELP’s costs will escalate, putting teaching and research at risk of cuts. A major cause of HELP’s problems is that a growing proportion of all graduates work part-time, but most part-time jobs earn less than the current threshold. In addition, vocational education diploma students now get HELP, and are less likely than higher education graduates to earn the repayment threshold of $ 54, 126 or more. International experience suggests that even with a lower threshold, students are still attracted to tertiary education. The English student loan repayment threshold is set at a level similar to $ 42, 000, while in New Zealand the threshold is much lower. The reform would affect more women than men, due to high rates of part-time work. Yet half of the debtors who would be affected live with a partner, and the combined disposable income of 70 per cent of these couples exceeds $ 80, 000 a year. With this reform, the subsidies built into HELP loans would be more targeted toward people facing real financial hardship. In tough times, it’s a reform Australia can’t afford to ignore...|$|E
