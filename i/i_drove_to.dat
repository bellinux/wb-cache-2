25|$|On {{returning}} to the UK Robertson received no official welcome at Victoria Station and later recorded that “having secured a broken-down taxi <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> my residence in Eccleston Square; and thereupon joined {{the long list of}} unemployed officers on half-pay”.|$|E
60|$|Then Philippa and <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> town, Philippa {{asking me}} conundrums, like Nebuchadnezzar.|$|E
60|$|Resolved to {{make sure}} that no {{possible}} mischance could occur, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Miss Batchford's house, and saw the cabman give my letter into the servant's hands.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} town <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> straight <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} at which {{my mother was}} staying.|$|R
25|$|Do {{you want}} any more? I did not. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> off <b>to</b> Adelaide...to face the next ordeal...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does it matter?" [...] demanded Gregory, {{lifting his}} heavy eyes. [...] "Whether {{he meant it}} or not, I caused it. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him <b>to</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the farm. Philip's entreaties persuaded {{me to let}} him be my companion, on one condition--that he waited in the {{carriage}} while I went into the house.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} I {{told him of}} what had passed, and of how my own diary {{had come to be}} of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion, at which the Professor {{interrupted}} me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the club}} {{on my way}} to the station, where I had {{arranged}} for my baggage to be sent. As I crossed Pall Mall I met Lamartine. He was standing on the pavement, on the point of entering a motor-car on which was piled some luggage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty well, considering," [...] {{answered}} Sam, {{with a quiet}} smile. [...] "But I've had a {{whole lot}} of happenings since <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> down <b>to</b> the depot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him <b>to</b> Abbotstoke yesterday--never started, {{except at}} {{a fool of}} a woman with an umbrella, and at the train--and we'll take care not to meet that." ...|$|R
60|$|I meditated pretty freely as <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> down <b>to</b> Brinkley {{in the old}} {{two-seater}} that afternoon. The news of this rift or rupture of Angela's and Tuppy's had disturbed me greatly.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the shops}} first, {{and made the}} {{purchases}} which I had mentioned to Eustace by way of giving a reason for going out. Then I devoted myself to the object which I really had at heart. I went to old Benjamin's little villa, in the by-ways of St. John's Wood.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the rector's, after {{saying good-bye}} to Lucretia, {{with a clear}} {{determination}} that before I left Richmond she should have consented to become my wife. Of course there were social differences, but those would be forgotten in South Kensington, and nobody need ever know what Lucretia had been in Canada. Besides, she was fit to shine in the society of duchesses--a society into which I cannot honestly pretend that I habitually penetrate.|$|E
60|$|Except {{the lodge}} at the Orphanage, {{which was still}} on fire, none of the houses had {{suffered}} very greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the chimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there {{did not seem to}} be a living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road--the road I had taken when <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Leatherhead--or they had hidden.|$|E
60|$|ROSE. [Over her shoulder.] <b>I</b> {{shall be}} <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> tell her a story, Miss.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I ken wha ye are!' {{cried the}} husky voice. 'I mind ye now. Ye're a Nucholson. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> ye <b>to</b> Hermiston to a Christmas party, and ye {{came back on}} the box, and I let ye drive.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Beg pardon, sir,' {{he whispered}} to Vannicock, 'but I've waited so long on Mellstock hill that at last <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> down <b>to</b> the turnpike; and seeing the light here, I ran on {{to find out what}} had happened.' ...|$|R
60|$|Twilight {{was closing}} in very fast. In the late autumn {{afternoon}} <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> St. Cergues, after which I left the chaise {{in the village}} and boldly started to walk up the mountain pass. I had studied the map so carefully that I was quite sure of my way, but though my appointment with the rascals was for eight o'clock, I wished to reach the appointed spot before the last flicker of grey light had disappeared from the sky.|$|E
60|$|We {{achieved}} {{the rest of}} our journey pleasantly, sometimes recurring to Doctors' Commons, and anticipating the distant days when I should be a proctor there, which Steerforth pictured in a variety of humorous and whimsical lights, that made us both merry. When we came to our journey's end, he went home, engaging to call upon me next day but one; and <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Lincoln's Inn Fields, where I found my aunt up, and waiting supper.|$|E
6000|$|So at noon today Livy and <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Archducal palace, and got by the sentries all right, {{and asked}} the grandly-uniformed porter for the book and said we wished to write our names in it. And he called a servant in livery and was sending us up stairs; and said her Royal Highness was out but would soon be in. Of course Livy said [...] "No--no--we only want the book;" [...] but he was firm, and said, [...] "You are Americans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ken wha ye are!" [...] {{cried the}} husky voice. [...] "I mind ye now. Ye're a Nucholson. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> ye <b>to</b> Hermiston to a Christmas party, and ye {{came back on}} the box, and I let ye drive." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> at once <b>to</b> {{the office}} of my lawyers. The senior partner--the tried friend and adviser of our family--received me.|$|R
60|$|On {{my return}} to London, whither I went by mail direct, leaving the yacht to follow after me, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> {{straight}} <b>to</b> the Lathams' from Waterloo Station. Mrs. Latham was out, the servant said, but Miss Irene {{was in the}} drawing-room.|$|R
60|$|That morning <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the village}} and spent {{an hour or two}} there. On my return I found Euphemia sitting in our room, with little Pat on her lap. I was {{astonished}} at the change in the young rascal. He was dressed, from head to foot, in a suit of clothes belonging to Pomona's baby; the glowing fuzz on his head was brushed and made as smooth as possible, while his little muslin sleeves were tied up with blue ribbon.|$|E
6000|$|In these circumstances, {{what could}} I do? We {{had meant to}} land at Nice in passing. I now {{resolved}} to leave my mother and sister there and proceed eastward--it might be to Egypt or the Black Sea--with Naranovitsch. The latter had ordered his letters to be forwarded to Nice; we therefore ran into the port, and, while my mother and sister and <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> [...] "the Chateau" [...] to see the splendid view from that commanding position, {{he went off to}} the post-office.|$|E
6000|$|On {{my return}} from Richmond and after another duty had been {{performed}} <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> his chambers. It {{was the first}} time, but I had often wanted to see them. On the staircase, which, as the house contained twenty sets of rooms, was unrestrictedly public, I met his servant, who went back with me and ushered me in. At {{the sound of my}} entrance he appeared in the doorway of a further room, and the instant we were alone I produced my news: [...] "She's dead!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{saw her in}} my life. She's painted {{entirely from}} fancy. She owns the little piece of {{property}} where I earn my bread and butter--the Rancho de las Sombras. <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> meet her according to arrangement with her lawyer." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> from Tokyo <b>to</b> Nagoya. My car {{was driven}} {{at the speed}} of 100 km per hour on a highway and the journey took 4  h. Find the {{distance}} <b>I</b> <b>drove.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "How do {{you know}} I didn't RUIN him?" [...] she said, turning upon him bitterly. [...] "How {{do you know}} that it wasn't to get rid of OUR monotony, OUR {{solitude}} that <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him <b>to</b> this vulgar distraction, this pitiful--yes, you were right--pitiful ambition?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My little {{daughter}} goes with us, of course. Early this morning <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the school in}} the suburbs at which she is being educated, and took her away with me. It is needless {{to say that she}} was delighted at the prospect of traveling. She shocked the schoolmistress by waving her hat over her head and crying 'Hooray,' like a boy. The good lady was very careful to inform me that my daughter could not possibly have learned to cry 'Hooray' in her house.|$|E
60|$|One night, a {{very long}} time ago, <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> an Indian {{military}} cantonment called Mian Mir to see amateur theatricals. At the back of the Infantry barracks a soldier, his cap over one eye, rushed in front of the horses and shouted that he was a dangerous highway robber. As a matter of fact, he was a friend of mine, so I told him to go home before any one caught him; but he fell under the pole, and I heard voices of a military guard in search of some one.|$|E
6000|$|I {{glanced at}} the clock, then taking a {{telegraph}} form I wrote: [...] "Shall be at Dunchester Station 8:30. Meet me there or later at the club." [...] Taking a cab <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> St. Pancras, {{just in time to}} catch the train. In my pocket--so closely was I pressed for money, for my account at the bank was actually overdrawn--I had barely enough to pay for a third-class ticket to Dunchester. This mattered little, however, for I always travelled third-class, not because I liked it but because it looked democratic and the right sort of thing for a Radical M.P. to do.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>drove</b> first <b>to</b> {{the small}} hotel where I {{had last seen}} Delora. Here, however, I was confronted with a certain difficulty. The name of Delora was quite unknown to the people. I {{described}} him carefully, however, to the landlady, and she appeared to recognize him.|$|R
60|$|I {{refrain from}} encumbering {{this part of}} my {{narrative}} with any detailed account of the little accidents, lucky and unlucky, which alternately hastened or retarded our journey home. Let me only say that, before midnight on the eighteenth, Oscar and <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the rectory gate.|$|R
60|$|I stopped {{about an}} hour {{altogether}} at Emily's, had lunch, and arranged {{that she and her}} mother should accompany me that evening to the Lyceum. Then <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> off <b>to</b> the British Museum, and asked for leave to examine the Anglo-Saxon coins of the Mercian period.|$|R
