At the time the most expensive French film ever made, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> commercial and critical success, both domestically and internationally, and was nominated for eight César awards, and ten BAFTAs.

5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 14, 1910. Theater advertisements for the film were found in newspapers in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. The film was alternatively known and advertised as Taming a Woman Hater. One theater in Pennsylvania would advertise Thanhouser's Jane Eyre as a magnificent and costly production and follow it up with The Woman Hater with the generic advertisement promotion that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> film. It is unknown if published trade reviews for this work exist, {{but there is an}} absence of a citation Bowers. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications. The film was labeled a comedy in an advertisement, using the name Taming a Woman Hater in The New York Dramatic Mirror on June 18, 1910.|$|E

5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 season saw new staff, a new coach, Trent Robinson, {{and several}} new players, {{including}} big signings Michael Jennings, James Maloney, Luke O'Donnell and Sonny Bill Williams, {{arrive at the}} club. This culminated in the Roosters finishing the 2013 season with a 24–12 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs, securing the minor premiership for the 2013 season and were the NRL's best attacking and defensive team. The Roosters defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 4–0, in week one of the finals, earning a week's rest. The Roosters defeated the Newcastle Knights 40–14 in week three of the NRL finals, progressing to the 2013 NRL grand final, facing the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, winning 26–18. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> comeback by the Roosters, down by 10 {{points in the second}} half they went on to score three consecutive tries to seal the win and their 13th premiership. They then {{went on to win the}} 2014 World Club Challenge against Wigan 36–14 to claim the treble of club titles. No team in premiership history had come from a lower ladder position to win the following season’s title.|$|E

After a few games in 1922, Thompson's career ended tamely.|$|E

It was discovered to be a fabrication shortly after publication. It was {{the most prominent of}} many such pamphlets. Numerous ex-priests and ex-nuns were on the anti-Catholic lecture circuit with lurid tales, always involving heterosexual contacts of adults—priests and nuns with dead babies buried in the basement.|$|E
25|$|Six {{members of}} the 1946 team would later become Springboks: Hannes Brewis, Fonnie du Toit, Jorrie Jordaan, Flip Geel, Fiks van der Merwe, Louis Strydom and Daan Retief.

25|$|The {{first attempt}} at conquest by Shah Zaman was in 1793.

When he returned, Ranjit Singh dislodged the Afghans from Rohtas.|$|E
25|$|The club {{ended the}} 1948–49 season in tenth place. The next season would see their first major {{achievement}} in the league—Dépor finished as runners-up just one point behind Atlético Madrid under the management of Argentinian Alejandro Scopelli, who brought to the club a group of South American players such as Julio Corcuera, Oswaldo García, Rafael Franco and Dagoberto Moll, a group that made the team more competitive and able to remain top flight status for nine consecutive seasons until 1957. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> period for the club, as honoured managers like Helenio Herrera and players as Pahiño and local Luis Suárez (the only Spanish player to receive the Golden Ball honour) played at the Riazor.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night sleeping in his seat on a train trip from Buffalo to Westfield, New York, George Pullman was inspired to design an improved passenger railcar that contained sleeper berths for all its passengers. During the day, the upper berth was folded up somewhat like a modern airliner's overhead luggage compartment. At night the upper berth folded down and the two facing seats below it folded over to provide a relatively comfortable bunk for the night. Although this was somewhat spartan accommodation by today's standards, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> improvement on the previous layout. Curtains provided privacy, and there were washrooms {{at each end of}} the car for men and women.|$|E

25|$|Sunline {{started her}} five-year-old {{campaign}} in Melbourne, against the sprinters - streaking {{away in the}} Manikato Stakes (1,200 metres) at Moonee Valley. She then had wins in the Memsie (1,400 metres) and Feehan Stakes (1,600 metres), but was narrowly beaten by Fairway in the Turnbull Stakes (2,000 metres). A natural frontrunner, like Sunline, Fairway refused to hand up the lead to Sunline, who was forced to chase, and held her at bay down the straight. It was Sunline's third defeat over the distance from as many starts away from Moonee Valley, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> improvement on her previous defeats, especially since Fairway was a multiple Group One winning three-year-old the previous season.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{all round}} team effort from the Australians; the captain Lindsay Hassett made 366 runs (40.66), Neil Harvey 362 runs (40.22), Keith Miller 350 runs (43.75) and Jim Burke 125 runs (41.66). The fast bowler Ray Lindwall took 15 wickets (22.93), his new-ball partner Keith Miller 17 wickets (17.70), Bill Johnston 22 wickets (19.18) and the mystery spin of Jack Iverson 21 wickets (15.23) in his only Test series.

He recalled to the minds of those present that both Morris and Compton had been honoured similarly four years previously when each of those batsmen had scored a hundred in each innings of the Test played at Adelaide.
