50|$|The driven {{elements}} are usually half-wave dipoles, fed in phase, mounted {{in a plane}} 1/4 wavelength {{in front of the}} reflector plane. The reflector wires are oriented parallel to the dipoles. The dipoles may be vertical, radiating in vertical polarization, but are most often horizontal, because horizontally polarized waves are less absorbed by <b>earth</b> <b>reflections.</b> The lowest row of dipoles are mounted more than 1/2 wavelength above the ground, to prevent ground reflections from interfering with the radiation pattern. This allows most of the radiation to be concentrated in a narrow main lobe aimed a few degrees above the horizon, which is ideal for skywave transmission. A curtain array may have a gain of 20 dB greater than a simple dipole antenna. Because of the strict phase requirements, earlier curtain arrays had a narrow bandwidth, but modern curtain arrays can be built with a bandwidth of up to 2:1, allowing them to cover several shortwave bands.|$|R

40|$|A major {{assumption}} for retrieving the <b>earth’s</b> <b>reflection</b> response with seismic interferometry by cross-correlation of {{ambient noise}} is that subsurface sources are uniformly distributed. It {{has been shown}} that interferometry by multi-dimensional deconvolution can cope with non-uniform source arrays, but implementation of this concept requires a separation of the incident wavefield from the free-surface multiples. For transient passive sources, this separation can be implemented by time-gating in the recorded transmission panels before cross-correlation, but such methodology cannot be applied for simultaneously acting noise sources. Here we show that time-gating can also be applied after an intermediate cross-correlation step. In cross-correlated data, we isolate events around t= 0, which inhabit the illumination imprint of the subsurface sources, the so-called point spread function. Next, we apply multi-dimensional deconvolution with the isolated events to the events away from t= 0. In this way we can effectively correct for the effects of a non-uniform subsurface source distribution in data that is already cross-correlated. With this new approach, multi-dimensional deconvolution becomes feasible for simultaneously acting noise sources...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three parts, each devoted to a particular issue of significant importance for satellite-based remote sensing of cirrus clouds. In the first part, we develop and present a fast infrared radiative transfer model {{on the basis of}} the adding-doubling principle. The model aims to facilitate the radiative transfer computations involved in hyperspectral remote sensing applications. The model is applicable to a variety of cloud conditions, including vertically inhomogeneous or multilayered clouds. It is shown that for hyperspectral applications the model is two order-of-magnitude faster than the well-known discrete ordinate transfer (DISORT) model, while maintains a similar accuracy. The second part is devoted to the investigation of uncertainties in the FSSP (Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe) measurement of cloud extinction by small ice particles. First, the single-scattering properties of small ice particles in cirrus clouds are derived and compared to those of equivalent spheres according to various definitions. It is found that, although small ice particles in cirrus clouds are often ?quasi-spherical?, their scattering phase functions and asymmetry factors are significant different from those of ice spheres. Such differences may lead to substantial underestimation of cloud extinction in FSSP measurement, if small ice particles are assumed to be spheres. In the third part, we present a comparison of cirrus cloud optical thickness retrievals from two important instruments, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) and POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of <b>Earth?s</b> <b>Reflection),</b> on board NASA?s A-train satellite constellation. The comparison reveals a large difference. Several possible reasons are discussed. It is found that much of the difference is attributable to the difference between the MODIS and POLDER retrieval algorithm in the assumption of cirrus cloud bulk scattering properties. Potential implications of the difference for climate studies are investigated. An important finding is that the use of an unrealistic cirrus bulk scattering model might introduce artificial seasonal variation of cirrus optical thickness and shortwave radiative forcing into the retrieval...|$|R

We inverted synthetic traces and recorded seismic data for the velocity model by WT. Our results demonstrated that the wave-equation solution overcame the high-frequency approximation of ray-based tomography, was largely insensitive to the accurate modeling of amplitudes, and mitigated problems with ambiguous event identification. The synthetic examples illustrated the effectiveness of the WT method in providing a highly resolved estimate of the velocity model. A real data example from the Gulf of Mexico demonstrated these benefits of WT, but also found the limitations in traveltime residual estimation for complex models...|$|R

40|$|Seismic Interferometry (SI) with {{ambient noise}} is a {{recently}} developed method for subsurface imaging that involves cross-correlating ambient noise from passive seismic data {{to reveal the}} <b>earth’s</b> <b>reflection</b> response. Based on this technique, TNO aims at developing a methodology for efficient monitoring of CO 2 geological sequestration in Carbon Capture and Storage projects. In 2009, as a collaboration with the CO 2 SINK research project on CO 2 sequestration taking place in Ketzin, Germany, TNO installed a permanent seismic array that has now already been recording passive data for 2 years during the CO 2 -injection. The correlation of the large real datasets requires a prior assessment on the feasibility of SI with ambient noise for time-lapse monitoring of the C 02 storage process. Using a 1 D layered acoustic velocity model of the Ketzin storage site {{as well as the}} layout of the TNO’s permanent array, we perform passive experiments that involve finite-difference modelling of passive wavefields from random noise sources and the cross-correlation of these passive synthetic data to retrieve reflection responses. By repeating the experiment for base and monitor velocity scenarios from CO 2 saturation changes in the reservoir, we study the influence of various noise parameters (the number of sources, the sources’ duration, the spatial distribution) on the retrieved base and monitor reflection responses as well as their induced amplitude differences. We show that, for a sufficient number of sources with sufficient durations, the accuracy of the retrieved reflection responses from the CO 2 reservoir are close enough to the reference responses from an active surface shot. More generally, the retrieved reflections are improved when more sources lie at or close to stationary points. In addition, when the sources characteristics are identical for both the base and the monitor passive experiments, the amplitude differences between the retrieved base and monitor reflection responses exhibit clear information on reflection changes from the reservoir. However we show that, when the sources’ characteristics, such as their spatial random distribution only, are not close enough for the base and the monitor passive experiments, the induced amplitude differences are difficult to interpret. Processing of the recorded body-wave noise prior to cross-correlation might be then necessary. We conclude that the repeatability of the passive noise is crucial for time-lapse interpretation. Finally, we choose an ideal noise configuration to enhance repeatability of the passive experiments when using different random distributions of the sources. In this special case, plotting picked amplitudes from the retrieved reflection responses for different velocity scenarios illustrates the potential of monitoring the velocity changes from SI with ambient noise.
