40|$|Kisspeptin (KP) is {{now well}} {{recognized}} as a potent stimulator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion and thereby a major regulator of the neuroendocrine-reproductive axis. <b>KP</b> <b>signals</b> via KISS 1 R, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that activates the G proteins Gαq/ 11. Modulation of the interaction of KP with KISS 1 R is therefore a potential new therapeutic target for stimulating (in infertility) or inhibiting (in hormone-dependent diseases) the reproductive hormone cascade. Major efforts are underway to target KISS 1 R {{in the treatment of}} sex steroid hormone-dependent disorders and to stimulate endogenous hormonal responses along the neuroendocrine axis as part of in vitro fertilization protocols. The development of analogs modulating KISS 1 R signaling will be aided by an understanding of the intracellular pathways and dynamics of KISS 1 R signaling under normal and pathological conditions. This review focuses on KISS 1 R recruitment of intracellular signaling (Gαq/ 11 - and β-arrestin-dependent) pathways that mediate GnRH secretion and the respective roles of rapid desensitization, internalization, and recycling of resensitized receptors in maintaining an active population of KISS 1 R at the cell surface to facilitate prolonged <b>KP</b> <b>signaling.</b> Additionally, this review summarizes and discusses the major findings of an array of studies examining the desensitization of <b>KP</b> <b>signaling</b> in man, domestic and laboratory animals. This discussion highlights the major effects of ligand efficacy and concentration and the physiological, developmental, and metabolic status of the organism on <b>KP</b> <b>signaling.</b> Finally, the potential for the utilization of KP and analogs in stimulating and inhibiting the reproductive hormone cascade as an alternative to targeting the downstream GnRH receptor is discussed.

40|$|Kisspeptins (Kp), peptide {{products}} of the Kisspeptin- 1 (KISS 1) gene are endogenous ligands for a G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR 54). Previous findings have shown that KISS 1 acts as a metastasis suppressor in numerous cancers in humans. However, recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} an increase in KISS 1 and GPR 54 expression in human breast tumors correlates with higher tumor grade and metastatic potential. At present, whether or not <b>Kp</b> <b>signaling</b> promotes breast cancer cell invasiveness, required for metastasis and the underlying mechanisms, is unknown. We have found that kisspeptin- 10 (Kp- 10), the most potent Kp, stimulates the invasion of human breast cancer MDA-MB- 231 and Hs 578 T cells using Matrigel-coated Transwell chamber assays and induces the formation of invasive stellate structures in three-dimensional invasion assays. Furthermore, Kp- 10 stimulated an increase in matrix metalloprotease (MMP) - 9 activity. We also found that Kp- 10 induced the transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Knockdown of the GPCR scaffolding protein, β-arrestin 2, inhibited Kp- 10 -induced EGFR transactivation as well as Kp- 10 induced invasion of breast cancer cells via modulation of MMP- 9 secretion and activity. Finally, we found that the two receptors associate with each other under basal conditions, and FRET analysis revealed that GPR 54 interacts directly with EGFR. The stability of the receptor complex formation was increased upon treatment of cells by Kp- 10. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which <b>Kp</b> <b>signaling</b> via GPR 54 stimulates breast cancer cell invasiveness...|$|R
40|$|Peptidergic neurons synthesizing kisspeptin (KP) and neurokinin B (NKB) in the {{hypothalamic}} infundibular nucleus {{have been}} implicated in negative sex steroid feedback to GnRH neurons. In laboratory rodents, testosterone decreases KP and NKB expression in this region. In the present study, we addressed {{the hypothesis that the}} weakening of this inhibitory testosterone feedback in elderly men coincides with enhanced <b>KP</b> and NKB <b>signaling</b> in the infundibular nucleus. This central hypothesis was tested in a series of immunohistochemical studies on hypothalamic sections of male human individuals that were divided into arbitrary "young" (21 - 49 yr, n = 11) and "aged" (50 - 67 yr, n = 9) groups. Quantitative immunohistochemical experiments established that the regional densities of NKB-immunoreactive (IR) perikarya and fibers, and the incidence of afferent contacts they formed onto GnRH neurons, exceeded several times those of the KP-IR elements. Robust aging-dependent enhancements were identified in the regional densities of KP-IR perikarya and fibers and the incidence of afferent contacts they established onto GnRH neurons. The abundance of NKB-IR perikarya, fibers, and axonal appositions to GnRH neurons also increased with age, albeit to lower extents. In dual-immunofluorescent studies, the incidence of KP-IR NKB perikarya increased from 36 % in young to 68 % in aged men. Collectively, these immunohistochemical data suggest an aging-related robust enhancement in central <b>KP</b> <b>signaling</b> and a moderate enhancement in central NKB signaling. These changes are compatible with a reduced testosterone negative feedback to KP and NKB neurons. The heavier KP and NKB inputs to GnRH neurons in aged, compared with young, men {{may play a role in}} the enhanced central stimulation of the reproductive axis. It requires clarification to what extent the enhanced <b>KP</b> and NKB <b>signaling</b> upstream from GnRH neurons is an adaptive response to hypogonadism or, alternatively, a consequence of a decline in the androgen sensitivity of KP and NKB neurons...|$|R
40|$|Kisspeptin (KP) plays a {{key role}} in the {{regulation}} of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis via the release of GnRH. As normal <b>KP</b> <b>signaling</b> is essential for reproductive function, it could be an interesting new target for therapeutic interventions, e. g., nonsurgical contraception in dogs. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of KP- 10 administration on plasma LH concentration in different stages of the reproductive cycle and to investigate the suitability of p 271 as KP antagonist in the bitch. Two groups of six adult Beagle bitches were used. In one group, plasma LH concentration was determined before (40 and 0 minutes) and 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes after the intravenous administration of 0. 5 -μg/kg body weight (BW) canine KP- 10. In the other group, the bitches received a continuous intravenous infusion with p 271 (50 μg/kg BW/h) for 3 hours, and 0. 5 -μg/kg BW canine KP- 10 was administered intravenously 2 hours after the start of the p 271 infusion. Their plasma LH concentration was determined before (- 40 and 0 minutes) and 30, 60, 90, 120, 130, 140, 160, and 180 minutes after the start of the p 271 infusion. In both groups, the experiments were performed during the follicular phase, the first and second half of the luteal phase, and during anestrus. Canine KP- 10 induced an increase of plasma LH concentration during all estrous cycle stages and anestrus. There was no difference in LH response between the two groups. The lowest LH response was seen during the follicular phase and the highest response during anestrus. The area under the curve (AUC) for LH and LH increment in the follicular phase were lower than those in anestrus. The AUC LH and LH increment in the first half of the luteal phase were lower than those in the second half of the luteal phase and anestrus. The AUC LH and LH increment in the second half of the luteal phase were not different from those in anestrus. Continuous administration of the antagonist p 271 did not alter basal plasma LH concentration and could not prevent or lower the LH response to KP- 10 in any of the cycle stages and anestrus. It can be concluded that the LH response to KP- 10 is dependent on estrous cycle stage and that peripheral administrated p 271 cannot be used as KP antagonist in the dog. This provides new insight in reproductive endocrinology of the bitch, which is important when <b>KP</b> <b>signaling</b> is considered for therapeutic interventions, such as for estrus induction or nonsurgical contraception in the bitch...|$|R
40|$|Kisspeptins (KPs) {{and their}} {{receptor}} (GPR 54 or KiSS 1 R) play a key-role in {{regulation of the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and are therefore interesting targets for therapeutic interventions {{in the field of}} reproductive endocrinology. As dogs show a rapid and robust LH response after the administration of KP 10, they can serve as a good animal model for research concerning <b>KP</b> <b>signaling.</b> The aims of the present study were to test the antagonistic properties of KP analogs p 234, p 271, p 354, and p 356 in vitro, by determining the intracellular Ca 2 + response of CHEM 1 cells that stably express human GPR 54, and to study the in vivo effects of these peptides on basal plasma LH concentration and the KP 10 -induced LH response in female dogs. Exposure of the CHEM 1 cells to KP- 10 resulted in a clear Ca 2 + response. P 234, p 271, p 354, and p 356 did not prevent or lower the KP 10 -induced Ca 2 + response. Moreover, the in vivo studies in the dogs showed that none of these supposed antagonists lowered the basal plasma LH concentration and none of the peptides lowered the KP 10 -induced LH response. In conclusion, p 234, p 271, p 354, and p 356 had no antagonistic effects in vitro nor any effect on basal and kisspeptin-stimulated plasma LH concentration in female dogs...|$|R
40|$|Xenoestrogens from {{synthetic}} {{or natural}} origin represent an increasing risk of disrupted endocrine functions including the physiological {{activity of the}} hypothalamo-pituitary-gonad axis. Ethinyl estradiol (EE 2) is a synthetic estrogen used in contraceptive pills, whereas zearalenone (ZEA) is a natural mycoestrogen found with increasing prevalence in various cereal crops. Both EE 2 and ZEA are agonists of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and accelerate puberty. However, the neuroendocrine mechanisms {{that are responsible for}} this effect remain unknown. Immature female Wistar rats were treated with EE 2 (10 mu g/kg), ZEA (10 mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 days starting from postnatal day 18. As a marker of puberty, vaginal opening was recorded and neuropeptide- and related transcription factor mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real time PCR and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Both ZEA and EE 2 accelerated vaginal opening, increased uterine weight and the number of antral follicles in the ovary and resulted in increased central expression of gnrh. These changes occurred in parallel with an earlier increase of kiss 1 mRNA in the anteroventral and rostral periventricular (AVPV/PeV) hypothalamus, and increased kisspeptin (KP) fiber density and KP-GnRH appositions in the preoptic area. These changes are compatible with a mechanism in which xenoestrogens overstimulate the developmentally unprepared reproductive system, which results in advanced vaginal opening and enlargement of the uterus at the periphery. Within the hypothalamus, ZEA and EE 2 directly activate AVPV KP neurons to stimulate GnRH mRNA. However, GnRH and gonadotropin release and ovulation are disrupted due to xenoestrogen-mediated inhibitory <b>KP</b> <b>signaling</b> in the arcuate nucleus...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} and catalytic {{reactions of the}} enzyme nitrogenase purified from Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied by electron-paramagnetic-resonance (e. p. r.) spectroscopy at temperatures down to 8 °K. The two protein fractions, Kp 1 (the iron–molybdenum protein) and Kp 2 (the iron protein), were examined alone and in steady-state mixtures and also in pre-steady-state experiments, by using the rapid-freezing method. Kp 1 protein in dithionite solution shows a rhombic type of spectrum with g 1 4. 32, g 2 3. 63, g 3 2. 009 at pH 6. 8 (0 °C). Small changes in the spectrum produced by protons (pK= 8. 7 at 0 °C) or by acetylene indicate binding of these oxidizing substrates to this protein fraction. Kp 2 protein shows a rhombic spectrum with g 1 2. 053, g 2 1. 942, g 3 1. 865, which integrates to about 0. 45 electron/molecule. Binding of ATP, with a dissociation constant of 4 × 10 − 4 m, changes the spectrum to an axial form with g∥ 2. 036, g⊥ 1. 929, thus indicating a conformation change of Kp 2 protein. The Kp 2 protein spectrum disappears reversibly on cautious oxidation. The signals of both proteins are diminished in their steady-state mixtures, obtained {{in the presence of}} ATP and dithionite (with an ATP-generating system and Mg 2 + ions) and with protons, N 2 or acetylene as oxidizing substrate. At the same time as dithionite is consumed in such reactions, the <b>Kp</b> 1 protein <b>signal</b> is gradually restored and the <b>Kp</b> 2 protein <b>signal</b> diminishes to zero. In rapid-freezing experiments the signals from the two proteins decreased at indistinguishable rates (t½ about 10 ms), then they remained constant. Results are interpreted in terms of a scheme in which reducing equivalents pass from dithionite to Kp 2 protein, then, in an ATP-dependent reaction to Kp 1 protein, this being finally reoxidized by N 2 or another oxidizing substrate. In this scheme Kp 1 protein cycles between its signal-giving state and a very highly reduced signal-free state...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{protects against}} cardiovascular disease, and physiological cardiac hypertrophy associated with regular exercise is usually beneficial, {{in marked contrast}} to pathological hypertrophy associated with disease. The p 110 α isoform of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) plays a critical role in the induction of exercise-induced hypertrophy. Whether it or other genes activated in the athlete's heart might have an impact on cardiac function and survival in a setting of heart failure is unknown. To examine whether progressive exercise training and PI 3 K(p 110 α) activity affect survival and/or cardiac function in two models of heart disease, we subjected a transgenic mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) to swim training, genetically crossed cardiac-specific transgenic mice with increased or decreased PI 3 K(p 110 α) activity to the DCM model, and subjected PI 3 K(p 110 α) transgenics to acute pressure overload (ascending aortic constriction). Life-span, cardiac function, and molecular markers of pathological hypertrophy were examined. Exercise training and increased cardiac PI 3 K(p 110 α) activity prolonged survival in the DCM model by 15 – 20 %. In contrast, reduced PI 3 K(p 110 α) activity drastically shortened lifespan by ≈ 50 %. Increased PI 3 K(p 110 α) activity had a favorable effect on cardiac function and fibrosis in the pressure-overload model and attenuated pathological growth. PI 3 <b>K(p</b> 110 α) <b>signaling</b> negatively regulated G protein-coupled receptor stimulated extracellular responsive kinase and Akt (via PI 3 K, p 110 γ) activation in isolated cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that exercise and enhanced PI 3 K(p 110 α) activity delay or prevent progression of heart disease, and that supraphysiologic activity can be beneficial. Identification of genes important for hypertrophy in the athlete's heart could offer new strategies for treating heart failure...|$|R
40|$|Kaempferia parviflora (KP) {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} folk remedy to treat several diseases including cancer, and several studies have reported cytotoxic activities of extracts of KP against {{a number of different}} cancer cell lines. However, many aspects of the molecular mechanism of action of KP remain unclear. In particular, the ability of KP to regulate cancer cell growth and survival signaling is still largely unexplored. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of KP on cell viability, cell migration, cell invasion, cell apoptosis, and on signaling pathways related to growth and survival of cervical cancer cells, HeLa. We discovered that KP reduced HeLa cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. The potent cytotoxicity of KP against HeLa cells was associated with a dose-dependent induction of apoptotic cell death as determined by flow cytometry and observation of nuclear fragmentation. Moreover, KP-induced cell apoptosis was likely to be mediated through the intrinsic apoptosis pathway since caspase 9 and caspase 7, but not BID, were shown to be activated after KP exposure. Based on the observation that KP induced apoptosis in HeLa cell, we further investigated the effects of KP at non-cytotoxic concentrations on suppressing signal transduction pathways relevant to cell growth and survival. We found that KP suppressed the MAPK and PI 3 K/AKT signaling pathways in cells activated with EGF, as observed by a significant decrease in phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2, Elk 1, PI 3 K, and AKT. The data suggest that KP interferes with the growth and survival of HeLa cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect on EGF-stimulated <b>signaling,</b> <b>KP</b> potently suppressed the migration of HeLa cells. Concomitantly, KP was demonstrated to markedly inhibit HeLa cell invasion. The ability of KP in suppressing the migration and invasion of HeLa cells was associated with the suppression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 production. These data strongly suggest that KP may slow tumor progression and metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. Taken together, the present report provides accumulated evidence revealing the potent anti-cancer activities of Kaempferia parviflora against cervical cancer HeLa cells, and suggests its potential use as an alternative way for cervical cancer prevention and therapy...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing chronic {{diseases}} of the 21 st century. Diabetic patients are at increased risk of developing heart failure. Diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by early diastolic dysfunction and adverse morphological changes, develops independently of macrovascular and microvascular complications. The development of these changes are often attributed to increased oxidative stress, resulting from elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and diminished antioxidant defences. Supplementation with the potent endogenous antioxidant coenzyme Q 10 has been shown to be beneficial in improving cardiac function and reducing left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy outside of diabetes; its benefit in protecting the diabetic heart remains unknown. The first aim of the project was to determine the efficacy of coenzyme Q 10 supplementation in protecting the heart from type 2 diabetes-induced damage, using the spontaneous db/db mouse model (obese and hypertensive). Mice were treated with coenzyme Q 10, or with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) ramipril daily for 10 weeks. Untreated db/db mice exhibited significant diastolic dysfunction in vivo, as well as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis. These adverse cardiac changes were accompanied by a significant upregulation in systemic lipid peroxidation and cardiac superoxide (•O 2 -) generation, with concomitant modest hypertension. Supplementation with coenzyme Q 10 administration significantly attenuated diastolic dysfunction and was associated with reduced markers of hypertrophy, fibrosis and apoptosis in diabetic mice. Interestingly, coenzyme Q 10 treatment in diabetic animals also tended to modestly improve glycemic control and lower blood pressure in diabetic animals. The efficacy of coenzyme Q 10 and ramipril were comparable in this model. The second aim of the project was to determine the efficacy of coenzyme Q 10 in protecting the non-obese, non-hypertensive type 1 diabetic heart from diabetes-induced damage. Insulin-deficient streptozotocin (STZ) mice were treated with either coenzyme Q 10 or ramipril. As evident in db/db mice, untreated STZ type 1 diabetic mice exhibited diastolic dysfunction, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, elevated cardiac collagen deposition and enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Markers of oxidative stress, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit expression (Nox 2, p 22 phox, p 47 phox), 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT) protein levels, NADPH-driven •O 2 - generation and systemic lipid peroxidation were all upregulated in untreated STZ mice. These mice also exhibited increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β). Coenzyme Q 10 attenuated all the adverse functional and structural changes in the diabetic heart, as well as reducing all markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. We have evidence that increased phosphoinositide 3 -kinase(p 110 α) [PI 3 K(p 110 α) ] signaling is protective (and diminished PI 3 <b>K(p</b> 110 α) <b>signaling,</b> detrimental) to the diabetic heart, and that this may be linked to PI 3 K(p 110 α) negative regulation of ROS generation. Hence, the third aim of the project was to determine whether coenzyme Q 10 protects the diabetic dnPI 3 K heart from damage. Diabetic dnPI 3 K untreated mice exhibited reduced diastolic function and evidence of adverse cardiac remodeling, as previously observed. Coenzyme Q 10 treatment of diabetic dnPI 3 K mice significantly attenuated diastolic function and the adverse changes in cardiac morphology. Interestingly, NADPH-driven •O 2 - generation was exacerbated in dnPI 3 K diabetic mice compared to non-transgenic (Ntg) diabetic mice. Coenzyme Q 10 supplementation also reduced LV •O 2 - generation and diminished systemic lipid peroxidation in treated dnPI 3 K diabetic animals as part of its cardioprotection. In summary, this study highlighted the characteristic features of the type 1 and type 2 diabetic heart, which includes early diastolic dysfunction, and morphological changes including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis and enhanced apoptosis. This study showed for the first time that coenzyme Q 10 was able to attenuate diastolic dysfunction and structural remodeling in the diabetic heart, likely via reduced LV •O 2 - generation and lipid peroxidation. Coenzyme Q 10 was also effective in protecting the hearts of diabetic dnPI 3 K transgenic mice (in spite of exacerbated ROS levels). As coenzyme Q 10 was at least as effective as ramipril in protecting the hearts of diabetic mice against damage, coenzyme Q 10 may be a possible alternative or adjunct therapy to ACE-Is for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy in the clinical setting...|$|R
