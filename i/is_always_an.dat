The great and only remedy for unemployed labor, is the revival of business, and the encouragement of a judicious political system by which it will be brought about.|$|E
5|$|Jolin {{started to}} depict Stockholm {{when he moved}} to Fiskargatan, on the tall cliffs of {{southern}} Stockholm in 1914. From his studio he could see most of the city. He divided the view, facing Stadsgården or Riddarholmen, into smaller frames for his painings. Noted works from that time are: Strömmen mot Kastellholmen (Over the Strömmen on to the Kastellholmen) 1914, now in the Stockholm City Museum; Utsikt över Riddarholmen (View of Riddarholmen) 1914, bought by the Nationalmuseum but kept in the Moderna Museet, and Utsikt mot Kastellholmen (View towards the Kastellholmen) 1915, now in the Malmö Konstmuseum. In the Stockholm från Söders höjder (Stockholm from the heights of Söder) 1938, elements from Oriental art are present in the naked, branches of the trees and the red buoys looking like Chinese lanterns hanging in the trees. These paintings are defined by swift, flowing brushwork and forceful contours framing fresh, light colours. His composition of the motif involved putting details against big blocks of cool pink, sheer blue, ivory turquoise and emerald, thereby creating a populated setting. There <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> air of teaming citylife along the docks and busy boating on the water of the Strömmen in these paintings.|$|E

25|$|Like Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman–Ford {{is based}} on the {{principle}} of relaxation, in which an approximation to the correct distance is gradually replaced by more accurate values until eventually reaching the optimum solution. In both algorithms, the approximate distance to each vertex <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> overestimate of the true distance, and is replaced by the minimum of its old value and the length of a newly found path.|$|E
25|$|When {{this process}} works, {{this type of}} {{neurosis}} may be considered a life-guiding gift from the unconscious, even though the personal journey forced upon the individual sometimes takes decades. This may seem absurd to someone looking at a neurosis from the attitude that it <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> illness that {{should not have to}} happen, expects the doctor to have a quick cure, and that fantasies are unreliable subjective experiences.|$|E
25|$|Analysis <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> {{analysis}} {{ad infinitum}} {{and one can}} never reach the absolute. It consists in dividing the object based on the chosen viewpoint and translating the divided fragments into symbols, wherein a spectre of the original can be reconstructed. These symbols always distort {{the part of the}} object they represent, as they’re generalized to include it and every other part they represent. Thus they ignore the object’s uniqueness.|$|E

In practice, counselors in the First Presidency are almost always apostles as well. There are usually at least twelve apostles in the LDS Church, though at times there has been as many as 21.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{eukaryotic}} nuclear intron has consensus sequences defining important regions. Each intron has GU at its 5' end. Near the 3' {{end there}} is a branch site. The nucleotide at the branchpoint <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> A; the consensus around this sequence varies somewhat. In humans the branch site consensus sequence is yUnAy. The branch site {{is followed by a}} series of pyrimidines – the polypyrimidine tract – then by AG at the 3' end.|$|E
25|$|Given {{a subset}} U of An, can one recover {{the set of}} polynomials which {{generate}} it? If U is any subset of An, define I(U) to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains U. The I stands for ideal: if two polynomials f and g both vanish on U, then f+g vanishes on U, and if h is any polynomial, then hf vanishes on U, so I(U) <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> ideal of the polynomial ring k.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E
25|$|Muons are {{unstable}} elementary {{particles and}} are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter {{than all other}} matter particles. They decay via the weak interaction. Because leptonic family numbers are conserved {{in the absence of}} an extremely unlikely immediate neutrino oscillation, one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type antineutrino (antimuon decay produces the corresponding antiparticles, as detailed below). Because charge must be conserved, one of the products of muon decay <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>an</b> electron of the same charge as the muon (a positron if it is a positive muon). Thus all muons decay to at least an electron, and two neutrinos. Sometimes, besides these necessary products, additional other particles that have no net charge and spin of zero (e.g., a pair of photons, or an electron-positron pair), are produced.|$|E
