5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{interpreted as}} the result of a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events. According to this interpretation, at least three occasions of mortality are recorded, and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span (?10–100 years), this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> these Iguanodon were herding animals.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{is called}} a τέκτων (tektōn) in , {{traditionally}} understood as carpenter but could cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders. The gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, but this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that he received formal scribal training.|$|E
5|$|Just {{because an}} SSD {{supports}} the TRIM command <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> {{it will be}} able to perform at top speed immediately after a TRIM command. The space which is freed up after the TRIM command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD. It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance.|$|E
5000|$|Sermon 47, Ali {{tells his}} people that inordinate cravings and bad deeds would only bring harm. He {{also points out}} that good deeds, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> a reward in this life, but will {{definitely}} be rewarded in the hereafter.|$|R
50|$|The title Al-hurra {{was often}} granted {{to women who}} wielded {{political}} power, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> they were sovereigns: Alam al-Malika and Sayyida al Hurra, for example, bore this title. Both had political offices; not as sovereigns, but as political adviser and governor respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The label's {{number of}} points <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> anything, {{although}} the label of three points was supposed to represent the heir during the lifetime of his father; five points, during the lifetime of his grandfather; seven points, while the great-grandfather still lived, etc.|$|R
5|$|The four {{conditions}} {{listed above}} MUST be simultaneously present {{in order to}} turn an economic asset food into a political instrument. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that the asset will be used whenever the four conditions above are present. Such a decision would be considered only if there were further conditions, for example, {{the nature of a}} given conflict and judgment, goals, alternative means, and judgment of utility.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that their number {{reflects}} the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> better sexual function; for example, people with {{injuries}} in the sacral region {{are less likely to}} be able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5000|$|However, Wayne {{concluded}} that this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> the high-water mark, as claimed by Georgia. Rather, the Compact of 1802 specified the western bank, {{and the bank}} {{was different from the}} high-water mark. Drawing on the sources cited, Wayne defined the bank as follows (emphasis in original): ...|$|R
50|$|Conquest {{and defeat}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> the {{extirpation}} of one {{culture and its}} replacement by another. The Brittonic region of northwestern England was absorbed by Anglian Northumbria in the 7th century, yet it would re-emerge 300 years later as South Cumbria, joined with North Cumbria (Strathclyde) into a single state.|$|R
5000|$|Milan Budimir {{presented}} and published {{results of his}} research which entered the best-known dictionaries and reference books {{in more than two}} hundred articles, discussions, studies and books with the following being the most important (titles given in English <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that an actual English translation has been published): ...|$|R
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} lands of Robert d'Oilly, who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of {{the lands of}} William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that there was an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo-Saxon gods and the worship of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E
50|$|According to Dr. Kent Bunting, the {{research}} results <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> {{that people who}} wish to lose weight should continue to consume alcohol because consumption {{is known to have}} an enhancing effect on appetite. Due to these discrepancies in findings, the relationship between alcohol and weight remains unresolved and requires further research.|$|R
5000|$|Impression - The {{most common}} {{definition}} of [...] "Impression" [...] is {{an instance of}} an advertisement appearing on a viewed page. Note that an advertisement can be displayed on a viewed page below the area actually displayed on the screen, so most measures of impressions <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> an advertisement has been view-able.|$|R
30|$|These numbers {{tell us that}} China’s {{investment}} rate has increased very rapidly {{in the last decade}} and its level is extraordinarily high among major economies. However, these numbers alone <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that China is investing too much as is explained in the introduction. It is necessary to examine other factors to make the judgment.|$|R
5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> they browsed on items there, and the short neck of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E
5|$|The single known living specimen, a {{young adult}} male, was {{collected}} at 80m (260ft) altitude in the Andaladomo forest (part of the Mikea Forest) in 2003. The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation {{from the rest of}} the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar. The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry deciduous forest amid land cleared for maize cultivation. The trap was set at the foot of a tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants. Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include the bastard big-footed mouse, the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus), several species of tenrecs, and the shrew Suncus madagascariensis. Although only a single individual of Petter's big-footed mouse was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100trap-nights, they argue that this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season. Nothing is known of its behavior, but the animal's morphology suggests it lives on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E
2500|$|GSA's {{decision}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that {{a federal}} building would be built {{at the north end}} of 10th Street NW. [...] In fact, the dispute between the Smithsonian and Zeckendorf over the Air Museum had still not been resolved by June 1955. But the General Services Administration had more political influence in Congress than either of them.|$|R
50|$|This <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> {{that they}} had become radicalised as such, or that it was their {{intention}} to radicalise the finance sector. Indeed, both the ABOA and the AISF remained deeply conservative organisations for many years; terms such as association and federation were quite deliberately chosen to distinguish these organisations from their militant, blue-collar cousins.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} Norman conquest of England this area became a Royal Forest. The word forest {{in this sense}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> a wooded area but one that was set aside for hunting though several areas of Inglewood were heavily wooded. The animals that were hunted in this area were mainly deer and wild boars.|$|R
25|$|Stooks Smith {{does not}} specify any party allegiances for this {{constituency}} before 1818. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that the MPs were {{not associated with}} a Party in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{rejection}} {{occurs in}} 10–25% of people after transplant {{during the first}} 60 days. Rejection <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> loss of the organ, but it may necessitate additional treatment and medication adjustments.|$|E
25|$|Ordination to {{an office}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> {{ordination}} {{to a position of}} leadership. Priesthood holders are organized into quorums, which each have a president or presidents. Each quorum president holds priesthood keys. The president or presidents {{may or may not be}} given counselors to assist them.|$|E
50|$|GSA's {{decision}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that {{a federal}} building would be built {{at the north end}} of 10th Street NW.

But the General Services Administration had more political influence in Congress than either of them.|$|R

50|$|When William and his queen {{signed the}} {{document}} with crosses, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> they were unused to writing, infirm or even illiterate. They {{and all the}} bishops signed with crosses, as illiterate people would later do, but they did so in accordance with current legal practice, not because they or the bishops could not write their own names.|$|R
25|$|Differentially {{methylated}} {{regions are}} generally segments of DNA rich in cytosine and guanine nucleotides, with the cytosine nucleotides methylated on one copy {{but not on}} the other. Contrary to expectation, methylation <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> silencing; instead, the effect of methylation depends upon the default state of the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} there will be a {{significant}} amount for distribution after the costs of sequestration have been satisfied <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that sequestration will be to the advantage of creditors. Sequestration is, in a sense, merely an elaborate means of execution and, because of its costs, an expensive one too.|$|E
25|$|Hardin's ecophilosophy reveals one {{particular}} method to mitigate healthcare costs. With respect to population growth, the fewer {{people there are}} to take care of, the less expensive healthcare will be. And in applying this logic to what medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber previously suggested, less expensive healthcare <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> poorer quality healthcare.|$|E
5000|$|The Social Security Administration {{interpreted}} the statutes broadly to include individuals whose names were matched against a warrant database. [...] Some individuals lost benefits {{even though the}} warrant in question was for a different person. [...] For others, {{the presence of a}} warrant <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> that an individual was [...] "fleeing," [...] or that the individual had violated probation or parole.|$|R
25|$|As shown above, {{both those}} claims are debated by scholars. The word {{by which the}} Gospels {{referred}} to the gibbet on which Jesus died {{had more than one}} meaning. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> a stake, nor did it <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> a cross with cross-bar, but Christian writers long before 300 specifically spoke of that gibbet as having a cross-bar, being either cross-shaped or T-shaped.|$|R
40|$|Several postmodern {{literacy}} {{practices have}} been associated with plagiarism. However, the adaptation and appropriation of texts, from a traditional perspective, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>mean</b> literary theft. At the same time, new technologies and the concept of electronic literature enrich production, exchange and fusion of works. This paper reflects on the limits of postmodernism and literary plagiarism, both elusive concepts, and their potential partnerships in the current literature...|$|R
