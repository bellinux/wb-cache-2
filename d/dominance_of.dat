40|$|Abstract The {{analysis}} of genetic correlations between fiber length (Len), strength (Str), micronaire, and 12 other traits was conducted using the additive (A) -dominance (D) genetic model, which considers genotype 9 environment interaction effects, in intra-specific upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) hybrids to effectively {{improve the quality}} of cotton cultivars in high planting density cases. Decision-making coefficients were computed based on the genetic correlation and path {{analysis of}} three fiber quality traits. The decision-making coefficient analy-sis of three fiber traits in cross breeding was beneficial for the improvement of Len by increasing the additive effects of Str and length of boll (LB) and decreasing lint percentage (LP), boll number of the top three fruit-bearing branches. The analysis was also beneficial for the improvement of Str and fiber fineness by increasing or decreasing the additive effects of other traits. Utilizing heterosis in hybrids was beneficial to the heterosis of Len by selecting the high <b>dominance</b> effects <b>of</b> number of nodes of the 1 st fruit-bearing branch and LB and decreasing the <b>dominance</b> effects <b>of</b> diameter of boll (DB) and LP and for improving Str by increasing the <b>dominance</b> effects <b>of</b> DB and decreasing the <b>dominance</b> effects <b>of</b> number of fruit-bearing branches and number of nodes of the main stem (NNMS). Utilizing heterosis was also beneficial for improving fineness by increasing the <b>dominance</b> effects <b>of</b> LB, Str, and lint yield and decreasing the <b>dominance</b> effects <b>of</b> NNMS and Len...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The concept <b>of</b> <b>dominance</b> poses several dilemmas. First, while {{entrenched in}} {{genetics}} education, the metaphor <b>of</b> <b>dominance</b> promotes several misconceptions and misleading cultural perspectives. Second, the metaphors of power, prevalence and competition extend into science, shaping assumptions and default concepts. Third, because genetic causality is complex, the simplified concepts <b>of</b> <b>dominance</b> found in practice are highly contingent or inconsistent. The conceptual problems {{are illustrated in}} the history of studies on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>dominance.</b> Conceptual clarity may be fostered, I claim, by viewing diploid organisms as diphenic and by framing genetic causality modestly through individual alleles and their corresponding haplophe-notypes...|$|R

5|$|In December 1964, Kenya {{was officially}} proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its {{executive}} President, a role combining {{the head of}} state and head of government. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, various constitutional amendments were made that enhanced the President's power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if the security of the state was regarded as threatened. Kenyatta sought to attain the support of Kenya's second largest tribal group, the Luo, thus appointing the Luo activist Odinga as his Vice President. However, the Kikuyu‚Äîwho made up around 20 percent of the Kenyan population‚Äîstill held most of the important government and administrative positions in the country. This contributed to a perception among many in the country that independence had simply seen the <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> a European elite replaced by the <b>dominance</b> <b>of</b> a Kikuyu elite.|$|E
