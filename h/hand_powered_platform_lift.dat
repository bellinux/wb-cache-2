50|$|An Access for All scheme, {{funded by}} the Department for Transport, gave easier access {{to all of the}} <b>platforms.</b> <b>Lifts</b> were built to give step-free access to the entire station, though the station had no steps {{previously}} as there were ramps to all platforms.|$|R
50|$|While some wheelchair-accessible vans use a {{powered lift}} {{to assist the}} {{occupant}} in boarding, a wheelchair ramp is usually less expensive for this purpose and is often installed on minivans. Full-size vans, however, require use of a <b>platform</b> <b>lift.</b> There {{are two types of}} <b>platform</b> <b>lifts</b> installed on wheelchair-accessible vans: single-arm and dual-arm. Single-arm wheelchair lifts are only used in side-entry applications. They take up less interior space and leave the passenger entry open; however, they have less lifting capacity than dual-arm lifts. Most dual-arm wheelchair lifts have a lift capacity up to 800 pounds. These lifts consume more interior space and block the side entry and, for these reasons, are often mounted {{in the back of the}} vehicle for rear-entry applications.|$|R

Growing number of fishing gears (especially the set fishing gear like the bambbo <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> net) in the Pang Pang bay {{even though its}} presence is not allowed, this is might be the caused of the decreased fisheries production. As for the bamboo <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> net itself has many factors that affect the catch effort productivity. Some of them were {{examined in this study}} which are the density (unit/ha), water depth (m) and time of hauling (min). From this study, we expected to know how far the influence of each factors as well as the mathematical models of it. This study results shows that the density of the bamboo <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> net greatly affect the fishing gear productivity, that the higher the density number will lead to further decline in the fishing gear productivity. The water depth also has an effect, in which the deeper the waters of the fishing gear, the more catch result get. The other factors such as the time dummy and hauling time influence less on the catch. The optimum density number is < 5 unit/ha, as the optimum water depth is ? 26, 2 m...|$|R
50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> and a spiral conveyor. A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift</b> is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or <b>platform</b> <b>lift,</b> input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|R

40|$|Milk {{adulteration}} {{has become}} a major problem in Indian subcontinent with commercially avail- able milk being adulterated with variety of adulterants, which may cause hazardous and irreversible health damage to the consumers. The current trend to detect the adulterants in the milk are adul- terant specific, or require a high end laboratory equipment. This work focuses on developing a <b>hand</b> held low <b>power</b> <b>platform</b> to detect adulterants in the milk so that pure milk and contaminated milk can be distinguished on-site, rather than focusing on the particular adulterant. Here conductivity of milk as inherent physical property of milk is studied, and chosen as a marker to differ pure milk from adulterated one. Experiments are performed to study the effects of various adulterants on milk conductivity. An on-chip impedance sensor with glass substrate and gold electrode is fabricated to further lab-on-chip platform. Based on the conducted study an on-chip impedance read-out circuit is designed to with concluded specifications, so that low-power handheld platform can be implemented. An on-chip circuit for impedance spectroscopy circuit is realized using a UMC- 180 nm technology. This low power, on-chip impedance spectroscopy based system for milk adulteration detection con- sists of an instrumentation amplifier(IA) with rail-to-rail ICMR, a high resolution comparator, Gm cancellation based integrator, peak detector and a low pass Biquad filter.
