5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed {{over a period of}} two months to three years). Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> death. Indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{video game}} {{adaptation}} of the film, titled Fight Club, was released by Vivendi in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial <b>failure,</b> <b>and</b> was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, Game Informer, and IGN.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{some early}} adopters, the 808 was a {{commercial}} <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> fewer than 12,000 units were sold. Roland ended production in 1983 after semiconductor improvements made the faulty transistors that were essential to its design impossible to restock.|$|E
40|$|Despite a {{proliferation}} {{of a number of}} studies on service <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> recovery in e-service settings, there is a paucity of knowledge of ways in which service <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> recovery practices are implemented in the fashion industry. Drawing on constructivist perspective, this study offers a new perspective on an effective relational mechanism that would bridge the rupture between consumers and companies particularly in the on-line fashion sector. The analysis adds to studies on service <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> recovery by elucidating recovery strategies relevant to retailers’ operations in on-line environments. This analysis advances knowledge of on-line service <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> recovery in the UK fashion industry. Findings indicate that consumer expectations of service <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> recovery are context driven, which requires companies to fine-tune their recovery strategies to improve recovery satisfaction...|$|R

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking ethylene glycol. Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, headache, and seizures. Long term outcomes may include kidney <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> brain damage. Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{criteria}} {{exist for}} each of the main subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction <b>failure)</b> <b>and</b> therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed.

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal <b>failure,</b> <b>and</b> cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E

5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> pneumonia.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} the timed asynchronous distributed system model to describe existing asynchronous distributed systems subject to unbounded processing <b>and</b> communication delays, <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> recoveries. We then describe five increasingly strong specifications for processor-group membership services in timed asynchronous systems subject to partitioning. We also propose five distributed protocols that implement these specifications despite arbitrary numbers of crash/performance processor <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> omission /performance communication <b>failures,</b> <b>and</b> prove their correctness. Finally, we show how {{two of the}} protocols {{can be adapted to}} implement a highly available processor leadership service that ensures the existence of at most one leader at any point in real-time...|$|R
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from racing, {{he continued to}} work for Daimler-Benz as a salesman, targeting NATO troops stationed in Europe.

In early 1959, he became sick and developed signs of jaundice, which worsened despite treatment. Later in the year he was diagnosed with advanced cirrhosis. On 28 September 1959, in Kassel, Germany, he suffered liver <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> died, aged 58. He was buried in his home town of Lugano.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, {{the history of the}} region is shrouded in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop <b>failure,</b> <b>and</b> can also offer higher returns.|$|E
40|$|We study secure RAID, i. e., low-complexity {{schemes to}} store {{information}} in a distributed manner that is resilient to node <b>failures</b> <b>and</b> resistant to node eavesdropping.

The shortening technique allows us to obtain secure EVENODD schemes of arbitrary lengths, which is important for practical application. We also construct a new secure RAID scheme from the STAR code.
