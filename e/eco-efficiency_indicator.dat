By using a simple theoretical model, we evaluate the effects of technological greening on creation value, pollution level, and eco-efficiency. We show three contrasting effects of technological greening. First, technological greening may increase the pollution of a firm, and also of the whole industry. Second, the indicator of eco-efficiency can be misleading because it may improve in situations where pollution increases and/or profit decreases after technological greening. Third, technological greening that induces an improvement of the <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> does not necessarily lead to a no-regret strategy.

Despite the popularity of the term in both business and government circles, limited {{attention has been paid to}} measuring and reporting eco-efficiency to government policy makers. Aggregate measures of eco-efficiency are needed, to complement existing measures and to help highlight important patterns in eco-efficiency data. This paper aims to develop aggregate measures of eco-efficiency for use by policy makers. Specifically, this paper provides a unique analysis by applying principal components analysis (PCA) to <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> in New Zealand. This study reveals that New Zealand's overall eco-efficiency improved for two out of the five aggregate measures over the period 1994 / 95 to 1997 / 98. The worsening of the other aggregate measures reflects, among other things, the relatively poor performance of the primary production and related processing sectors.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{evolution}} of environmental performance {{in the context of}} the European Union (EU), over the period 1993 – 2010. The context is particularly relevant, due to the traditionally high concerns of the EU about these issues, which has triggered off several initiatives and regulations on environmental protection. In this setting, we conduct a two-stage analysis which develops environmental performance indicators in the first stage for each pair country-year, and evaluates its evolution in the second. More specifically, in the first stage we estimate specific efficiencies for three air-pollutants (CO 2 e, SO 2, NOx), along with an <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicator,</b> for which we use the slack-free directional distance functions in the Data Envelopment Analysis framework (as opposed to the more extended intensity ratios), whereas in the second stage we propose to using a model of explicit distribution dynamics which takes into account how the entire distributions of these indicators evolve. Our results indicate that the dynamics underlying {{the evolution of}} the indicators analyzed are indeed remarkable. Although the <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> has improved over the last two decades, it has been during the last decade when performance has shown a more convergent path. However, in the case of the more traditional indicators (CO 2 e, SO 2, NOx) the abatement opportunities are still remarkable, especially in the case of SO 2.

40|$|Eco-efficiency links {{economic}} efficiency with environmental efficiency. The {{main purpose of}} the concept is to identify and implement activities to enable production that is both economically more efficient and cleaner. This means that parameters with a high indicative value have to be used. Since both the environmental and the economic performance of industries must be described concurrently, environmental intensity {{appears to be a}} good indicator of eco-efficiency. Environmental intensity is environmental impact per unit of economic performance. In this paper, the environmental impact of industry classes is derived from emission data, released by the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER), and then aggregated and assessed using Eco-Indicator 99, a single-score life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. The calculated ratio is thus an accurate description of the environmental-economic state of industry classes. The main advantage of this approach is the underlying consistent statistical framework, that permits, on a disaggregated level, economic data to be correlated with ecological data and to be frequently updated. This single indicator facilitates a comparison of environmental intensity of different industry classes.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for eco-efficiency reporting is proposed with eco-efficiency indicators for climate change, acidification, photo-oxidant formation, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, eutrophication, energy consumption and waste generation. The method {{is applied to}} emission, consumption and production data of the Flemish industry provided by the Flemish environmental agency for the period 1995 - 2006. For climate change, acidification, photo-oxidant formation, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity and eutrophication, the eco-efficiency improved by 39, 55, 41, 58, 72 and 53 %, respectively. For each of these impact categories, the total environmental impact decreased despite an increase in production, indicating absolute decoupling of environmental impact from economic growth. The <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> for energy consumption and waste generation improved by 16 and 14 %, respectively. However, due {{to the increase in}} production, the total energy consumption and the amount of waste generated increased: for these two environmental themes decoupling from economic growth was relative. Despite the improved eco-efficiency, industry remains one of the main polluters in Flanders. The application of the method to emission, energy consumption and production data of the Flemish industry resulted in a comprehensive and correct source of information for the general public and the government. Moreover, it can serve as a basis for economically and environmentally sound decisions and for the evaluation of the impact of former decisions. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{eco-efficiency}} {{has become increasingly}} popular in the environmental debate of product systems, processes, and/or companies in resent year. Eco-efficiency is generally described as a ratio between environmental impact and value of production. This paper presents the <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicator,</b> called environmental improvement productivity (EIP), for assessing the environmental improvement from 3 R waste of the petroleum and petrochemical (PP) group in the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate (MTPIE), Thailand. The EIP {{is defined as the}} ratio of total 3 R waste, as a value of production, to the total amount of CO 2 reduction by the 3 R activities, as an environmental impact value or environmental improvement of 3 R waste, which was evaluated by the CO 2 emission calculated from the basis of 3 R waste incineration. The total amount of waste and 3 R waste generated from the PP group in fiscal year 2007, which was separated into 4 quarters, were collected and used to create the waste flow diagram of the PP group. The results show that more than 60 % of the total waste generated from the PP group in the MTPIE was classified to be as a 3 R waste. The evaluation of eco-efficiency shows the decrease of EIP values from quarter 1 to quarter 4, which refers to the increase of environmental improvement. The research can demonstrate the environmental benefits from the 3 R waste, which will feed into strategic development and would enable to encourage the 3 R activities for industrial sector in Thailand. 1...|$|E

Based on the Material Flow Analysis (MFA) framework, the status and potential improvement level of <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> for this industry were assessed by the construction of a systematic material flow model that integrated the production, usage and waste management of cement and concrete on a national level in China. This model was also developed as a tool for monitoring and predicting the resource consumption and emissions of his industry based on the framework of material flow analysis. China's cement and concrete material cycle for 2010 was constructed on a quantitative basis by using this model. The results demonstrated that in 2010, the whole industry consumed over 15 billion tons of material to produce 1. 88 billion tons of cement, 3. 38 billion cubic meters of mortar and 3. 59 billion cubic meters of concrete. The industry released 2. 5 million tons of air pollutants and 1. 0 billion tons of CO 2, which accounted for approximately 5 % and 12. 5 % of China's total amounts, respectively. The eco-efficiency indicators of this industry showed bright outlook though these indicators are still at a low level now. The resource productivity was 11 USD per ton of raw material (1 USD= 6. 8 RMB in 2010), and the total emission efficiency was 164 USD per ton of CO 2 and air pollutants emission. The implications for further policymaking based on the assessment of this study suggested that the promotion of end-of-pipe treatment technology, more reasonable emission standards, sustainable resource management policies and government encouragement of non-resource material utilization are in urgent need for improving the eco-efficiency of this industry...|$|E
40|$|Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) is {{the centre}} for various major {{activities}} in Thailand including political, industry, agriculture, and commerce. Consequently, the BMR {{is the highest}} and most densely populated area in Thailand. Thus, the demand for houses in the BMR is also the largest, especially in subdivision developments. For these reasons, the subdivision development in the BMR has increased substantially in the past 20 years and generated large numbers of subdivision developments (AREA, 2009; Kridakorn Na Ayutthaya & Tochaiwat, 2010). However, this dramatic growth of subdivision development has caused several problems including unsustainable development, especially for subdivision neighbourhoods, in the BMR. There have been rating tools that encourage the sustainability of neighbourhood design in subdivision development, {{but they still have}} practical problems. Such rating tools do not cover the scale of the development entirely; and they concentrate more on the social and environmental conservation aspects, which have not been totally accepted by the developers (Boonprakub, 2011; Tongcumpou & Harvey, 1994). These factors strongly confirm the need for an appropriate rating tool for sustainable subdivision neighbourhood design in the BMR. To improve level of acceptance from all stakeholders in subdivision developments industry, the new rating tool should be developed based on an approach that unites the social, environmental, and economic approaches, such as eco-efficiency principle. Eco-efficiency is the sustainability indicator introduced by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) since 1992. The eco-efficiency is defined as the ratio of the product or service value according to its environmental impact (Lehni & Pepper, 2000; Sorvari et al., 2009). <b>Eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> is concerned to the business, while simultaneously, is concerned with to social and the environment impact. This study aims to develop a new rating tool named "Rating for sustainable subdivision neighbourhood design (RSSND) ". The RSSND methodology is developed by a combination of literature reviews, field surveys, the eco-efficiency model development, trial-and-error technique, and the tool validation process. All required data has been collected by the field surveys from July to November 2010. The ecoefficiency model is a combination of three different mathematical models; the neighbourhood property price (NPP) model, the neighbourhood development cost (NDC) model, and the neighbourhood occupancy cost (NOC) model which are attributable to the neighbourhood subdivision design. The NPP model is formulated by hedonic price model approach, while the NDC model and NOC model are formulated by the multiple regression analysis approach. The trial-and-error technique is adopted for simplifying the complex mathematic eco-efficiency model to a user-friendly rating tool format. Credibility of the RSSND has been validated by using both rated and non-rated of eight subdivisions. It is expected to meet the requirements of all stakeholders which support the social activities of the residents, maintain the environmental condition of the development and surrounding areas, and meet the economic requirements of the developers...|$|E

ArcelorMittal Gent, an integrated steelwork producing ca. 5 x 10 (6) tons of steel per year, not only decreased its specific energy consumption and CO 2 -emissions, but also reduced {{the environmental impact of}} its other emissions. This is illustrated by means of the evolution of 6 partial <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> for the impact categories acidification, photo-oxidant formation, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, eutrophication and water use.

In the period 1995 - 2005 these indicators decreased by 45, 4, 52, 9, 11 and 33 % respectively, whereas the steel production increased by 17 %. The net impact of discharges of wastewater is negligible for human toxicity and is negative (concentrations lower than in the canal water used) for freshwater aquatic toxicity and eutrophication.

40|$|This paper reports China's {{eco-efficiency}} {{trends and}} the cause of their dynamic behavior during the period 1978 - 2010. We show three main results. First, in general, <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> increased for resource utilization, energy consumption and emissions for air and water, and relative decoupling occurred in China at a high level in the global context. Second, decoupling from economic growth has been absolute for the discharge of soot, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen. Third, during the years 2001 - 2010, the decoupling level was very low, and resource utilization was almost coupled with GDP due to the high consumption and dramatic increase of mineral extraction. The causes of the observed dynamics of eco-efficiency and decoupling were also explored, with the conclusion drawn that the effect of technology was the predominant positive factor while structure effects were the negative factors for resource and energy efficiency; the technological effect of pipe-end treatment played a dominant role in the improving eco-efficiency of pollutant emissions and decoupling from economic growth. Furthermore, implications for further policymaking to setting proper targets for the relative decoupling of resource use, especially for mineral resource use and economic growth, are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{eco-efficiency}} {{emerged in the}} 1990 s as a "business link to sustainable development " and {{if this were the}} case it would be a key concept for industrial transformation. In order to achieve such a transformation several organisations have made frameworks on how eco-efficiency could be reported, e. g. the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The whole eco-efficiency concept has, however, also been criticised as just an industrial buzz word by which traditional environmentalism is hijacked. In our study we examine whether the concept of eco-efficiency is incorporated into Finnish EMAS reports. Our empirical sample consisted of 40 EMAS statements and eight group environmental reports. Our results show that the concept of eco-efficiency has clearly not become popular in corporate environmental reporting in Finland. If eco-efficiency has had an impact, then it is the underlying thinking that has been adopted not the word. This could be the case, since weak <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> are frequently used. This is, however, in most cases not due to internalising of eco-efficiency thinking, but rather because it has been common to relate e. g. emissions or energy use to production irrespectively of the eco-efficiency concept. While i...|$|R
40|$|A set of 10 {{environmental}} impact indicators is {{proposed for the}} evaluation the {{environmental impact}} of industrial installations and processes or industrial companies and sites: global warming, destruction of the ozone layer (ozone depletion), acidification, photochemical ozone creation, human toxicity, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, resource consumption (abiotic depletion), water consumption and waste production. These are "weighed" indicators: the individual emissions or discharges of components contributing to a certain theme are multiplied with a weighing factor and aggregated. <b>Eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> are calculated by dividing the "weighed", indicators by a value related to production. These relative indicators make it possible to quantify the evolution of the environmental performance for a process, company or industrial site and to evaluate which component(s) contribute(s) most to a given theme, thus allowing to set priorities for lowering the environmental impact. Examples illustrate the proposed method. Attention is also given to the emission of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during the incineration of waste, trying to answer the question: are waste incinerators sinks or sources of POPs? It is shown that for non-carcongenic effects according to the incineration scenario, the weighed input/output ranges from 0. 3 to 20, 500 when considering the POPs in flue gases and solid residues. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{eco-efficiency}} {{was introduced by}} the World Business Councils on Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in 1992. Since then it has been widely adopted among companies to measure and improve the value added while progressively reducing the environmental influence per product or service to the market. However, emphasise has until now mainly {{been put on the}} creation stage and to some extent the user stage of products or services, not on the end-of-life stage. In this paper, which is one part of the research project “Eco-efficiency in recycling systems” within the Norwegian research program Productivity 2005 -Industrial ecology, we have, by using WBCSDs eco-efficiency as a starting point, developed three categories of indicators that should be used to evaluate and improve the eco-efficiency of recycling systems. The general applicable indicators should be used to measure the eco-efficiency of all kinds of recycling systems. Additionally, If needed, the system specific indicators should be developed for the particularly recycling system analysed. These <b>indicators</b> are the <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> to be used to evaluate the performance of the whole recycling system. However, in order to change/improve the eco-efficiency an existing recycling system, the company specific indicators should be developed for each of the most contributing company/activity/actor/stage of the life cycle chain for the analysed material or produc...|$|R
40|$|Measures of eco-efficiencyâ??broadly {{understood}} as "getting more from less"â??often include {{an economic and}} an environmental variable. The latter is often seen as the more problematic variable, particularly when used in relation to impacts of public concern. But an analysis of resource and value trends in the U. K. steel and aluminum industries over the last 30 yr showed that there are significant problems associated with using economic variables in measures of eco-efficiency at the sectoral level. The research found that the U. K. steel and aluminum industries have improved the effectiveness with which they use natural resources, but {{that this has been}} accompanied by a decline in the economic output (value added) per unit of material or energy consumed. These seemingly contradictory results {{can be explained by the}} fall in the price of metals in real terms, and by the competitive pressures that necessitate the cutting of production costs and indirectly lead to a fall in the measure of economic output of the relevant industry. The research also suggests a logical terminology to bring consistency and coherence to the broad field of <b>eco-efficiency</b> <b>indicators,</b> with an important distinction made between measures that examine the value output per unit of physical input, and measures that examine the physical output per unit of physical input. Both these types of indicators are important, as they highlight different aspects of eco-efficiency. ...|$|R
