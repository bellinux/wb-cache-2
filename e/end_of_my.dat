25|$|I {{beg your}} graces, with the zeal of {{faithful}} Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, {{to read all}} my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I was at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, {{that it would be}} impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that {{it seemed to me that}} they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|After {{success in}} the early 80s, Yankovic {{released}} Polka Party! in 1986. Although featuring parodies of hit songs like [...] "Living in America" [...] and [...] "Addicted to Love", the album was a critical and commercial failure. It did not yield a charting single and it peaked at number 177 on the Billboard 200. After the disappointment with Polka Party!, Yankovic went on record saying, [...] "I {{thought it was the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career." [...] For most of 1987, Yankovic took a break from recording.|$|E
500|$|Hamming {{attempted}} {{to rectify the}} situation with a new text, Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics (1985). In 1993, he remarked that [...] "when I left BTL, I knew {{that that was the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it's really the end." [...] And so it proved. He became Professor Emeritus in June 1997, and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before his death from a heart attack on January 7, 1998. He was survived by his wife Wanda.|$|E

[...] He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain within the band. Flea later stated that [...] "the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that stopped me, was the idea of telling Anthony." ...|$|E

500|$|For working her thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted a large team of songwriters and producers.

500|$|An inquiry {{on the day}} {{following}} Plath's death gave {{a ruling}} of suicide. Hughes was devastated; they had been separated six months. In a letter to {{an old friend of}} Plath's from Smith College, he wrote, [...] "That's the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life. The rest is posthumous." [...] Plath's gravestone, in Heptonstall's parish churchyard of St Thomas the Apostle, bears the inscription that Hughes chose for her: [...] "Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be planted." [...] Biographers variously attribute the source of the quote to the Hindu text, the Bhagavad Gita or to the 16th-century Buddhist novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en.|$|E
500|$|After {{at first}} {{having failed to}} see {{the appeal of the}} image, Tittle {{eventually}} grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. [...] "That {{was the end of the}} road," [...] he told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. [...] "It was the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dream. It was over." [...] Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool. He was elected and went on to serve for 24 years. Tittle also held a fundraiser to assist Baker in his bid for a fourth term in 1989.|$|E

[...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else.

500|$|In one scene, Orpheus's head is {{attached}} to a scarecrow body. [...] According to Matthew Chamberlain, the actor who portrayed Orpheus, he was told to jump on a horse while wearing the scarecrow costume. [...] Chamberlain said he [...] "just gave the horse a quick pat before hopping on" [...] but found himself [...] "getting tugged the other way as the horse was munching away on the straw poking out of the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sleeve!" [...] An animatronic version of Chamberlain's head which operated by remote control was used in some scenes. [...] Some of the actors had to only pretend to look at the animatronic head during their scenes, because if they looked at it while it responded, they would laugh and break character.|$|E

But I don't consider this humane or merciful. This is a lie."

500|$|On November 27, 1956, he {{fled from}} Budapest to Austria with {{his future wife}} Enid, his sister, brother-in-law, {{and a few others}} after the Soviets invaded the city. He had no prior {{intention}} to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said if they found him, [...] "That would have meant the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. Not that I had done anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime." [...] He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands.|$|E
500|$|In the spring, Raonic {{played his}} first three matches against world No. 3 Federer on three {{different}} surfaces: hard court {{in the third round}} of the Indian Wells Masters; clay in the second round at the Madrid Open; and grass in the quarterfinals at the Halle Open. On each occasion, Raonic won the first set before losing the next two. After the Halle Open match, Federer remarked: [...] "I am happy to have beaten him now because by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career, he’ll be serving at 300km/h." [...] He defeated world No. 4 Murray in straight sets in the quarterfinals at the Barcelona Open. This marked his first victory over a member of the Big Four. In the semifinal, he lost to world No. 6 Ferrer. Raonic lost to Juan Mónaco in the third round of the French Open, and followed this with a second round loss to Querrey at Wimbledon.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, Madonna posted {{an image of}} a sunset with the words [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] on them, and a caption which the media {{interpreted}} as lyrics from a new song. The lines posted were: [...] "Day turns into night. I won't give up the fight. Don't {{want to get to the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> days... saying I wasn't amazed". Additional images showed Madonna with singer Natalia Kills in front of a microphone, and with Martin Kierszenbaum, the founder and chairman of Cherrytree Records, and senior executive of A for Interscope Records, Madonna's label. By mid-April 2014, she had also revealed on Instagram the names of songwriters Toby Gad and Mozella and record producer Symbolyc One with images of the group working in studio. The list of personnel grew to include producer Ariel Rechtshaid and sound engineer Nick Rowe. In an interview with Sirius XM Radio, Kierszenbaum described the recording process: ...|$|E

500|$|Cleave {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in West Africa, which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand. Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said why are you here? Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked enough for that to be the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer." [...] Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent, as he does not wish for his children [...] "to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|She then won a {{supporting}} role in the futuristic 1995 film Tank Girl, winning the role of [...] "Jet Girl" [...] after nine auditions. While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it {{has gone on to}} become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: [...] "there were always little bites. Whenever I felt I was at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> rope, something would come up. Something bad. But for me it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto." [...] In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; and as the lead role in , in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of both teams' supporters reacted negatively to the merger proposal. While many Oxford supporters acknowledged that Maxwell had {{been instrumental in}} saving the club the previous year, most perceived merging with another club as tantamount to killing both Oxford United and professional football in the city. A spokesman for the Oxford United Supporters Club called the idea [...] "crazy and unworkable". Most Reading fans likewise reacted to the scheme with revulsion; Mike Habbits, chairman of the Reading Supporters Club, said [...] "Our fans can't stand Oxford fans and I can't see them travelling to Oxford to watch the new team". Supporters and pressmen alike ridiculed the [...] "Thames Valley Royals" [...] name, which the sports historian John Bale later described as [...] "mid-Atlantic"; observers at the time variously perceived it as sounding more like an American football, ice hockey or speedway team than a football club. Some Oxford fans supported Maxwell's proposal, saying that with a new stadium and the pooled financial resources of Oxford and Reading, an amalgamated team might be successful, but these were a minority. One angry fan wrote to the Oxford Mail that [...] "I will not follow Thames Valley Royals or whatever their name is if they played at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> street".|$|E

Then I scraped it over slowly and gently with my nails. My second finger-nail stuck a little at one place. I parted the pile of the carpet over that place, and saw a thin slit which had been hidden by the pile being smoothed over it--a slit about half an inch long, with a little <b>end</b> <b>of</b> brown thread, exactly {{the color of the}} carpet ground, sticking out about a quarter of an inch from the middle of it. Just as I laid hold of the thread gently, I heard a footstep outside the door.|$|R

It almost seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep. I'll give it to you, Marmee, just to {{remember}} past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don't think I shall ever have a mane again." ...|$|R
