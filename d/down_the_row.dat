2500|$|She {{sat quietly}} {{at the meeting}} for 30 or 40 minutes, before pulling out a 9mm handgun [...] "just before" [...] 4:00p.m. CST, {{according}} to a faculty member. Joseph Ng, an associate professor who witnessed the attack, said: [...] " [...] got up suddenly, took out a gun and started shooting at each one of us. She started with the one closest to her, and went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> shooting her targets in the head." [...] According to another survivor, Debra Moriarity, dean of the university's graduate program {{and a professor of}} biochemistry, [...] "This wasn't random shooting around the room; this was execution style." [...] Those who were shot were {{on one side of the}} oval table used during the meeting, and the five on the other side, including Ng, dropped to the floor.|$|E
2500|$|One {{reason for}} not taking up an {{offering}} at all meetings is to avoid causing any unbelievers who may be present {{to think that they}} might gain a spiritual benefit by making a donation. Some assemblies never send an offering bag round the congregation, even at the Breaking of Bread meeting. They prefer to simply have a box or two located {{at the back of the}} meeting hall, thus avoiding even the appearance of solicitation for funds. Many assemblies operate a [...] "back seat" [...] or [...] "guest row" [...] during the Breaking of Bread so that neither the offering bag nor the emblems of bread and wine will pass <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of those not in fellowship. An offering bag, basket or box may be sent around after these two [...] "emblems" [...] have been passed, collecting money given voluntarily for use in maintaining the building, hall or room, to remunerate full-time or labouring members, or for distribution to the needy. In some cases an offering box may be placed at the door and not circulated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{objective}} in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than [...] "carry" [...] (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes {{the right side}} of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as [...] "riding the rail" [...] among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball moves <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row,</b> it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as [...] "mixing"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGraded {{distances}} are generalizations of the Euclidean {{distance on}} points in R 1. They {{have been used}} in the study of special cases of NP-hard problems. In this paper, we study the k-center and K-median problems with graded distance matrices. We first prove that the K-center problem is polynomial time solvable when the distance matrix is graded up <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> or graded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> We then prove that the K-median problem is NP-complete when the distance matrix is graded up <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> or graded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> An easy special case of the K-median problem with graded distance matrices is also discussed...|$|R
6000|$|The deep, {{impressive}} voice ended. The leader's huge fist descended {{upon the}} table with a crash. He gazed up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> of sinister masked figures. [...] "Have you anything to say?" ...|$|R
50|$|Example: To find 0.69, {{one would}} look <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> to find 0.6 and then across the columns to 0.09 which would yield a {{probability}} of 0.25490 for a cumulative from mean table or 0.75490 from a cumulative table.|$|R
60|$|As Doc Linyard {{finished}} {{he led the}} {{way into}} the outer office of a newspaper about midway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Row.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again {{a hoarse}} murmur {{answered}} him, and Grant, glancing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of set faces {{under the big}} lamps, was satisfied.|$|E
60|$|She had {{got all the}} pegs put in by this time, and Alice {{looked on}} with great {{interest}} as {{she returned to the}} tree, and then began slowly walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{wine was}} filled, and {{everybody}} was talking boisterously. At {{the far end of}} the table sat the mother, with her loosely-looped hair. She had Birkin for a neighbour. Sometimes she glanced fiercely <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> of faces, bending forwards and staring unceremoniously. And she would say in a low voice to Birkin: ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} silence as he gazed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>rows</b> of faces before answering.|$|R
30|$|The {{orientation}} of the images is such that in the vertical direction, the contrast increases as we move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> In <b>the</b> horizontal direction, the holes of the phantom become smaller from right to left, and due to the partial volume effect, the observed size of the holes levels off and, instead, the contrast becomes smaller.|$|R
6000|$|... "It must be another," [...] said Mrs. Demijohn, after a pause, {{during which}} she had been looking intently at the empty saddle of the horse which the groom was leading slowly up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Row.</b>|$|E
60|$|Archie {{looked up}} and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> with a keen eye. He was anxious to see who had been chump enough to give forty-five dollars for such a frightful object. He {{became aware of the}} dog-faced Willie leaning towards him.|$|E
6000|$|It brought Tommy back to earth, and {{he could}} accept her now as an old friend {{he was glad to}} meet again. [...] "You could not guess what I was in pursuit of, Mrs. Jerry," [...] he assured her, and with confidence, for words are not usually chased <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Row.</b>|$|E
60|$|MacIan looked <b>down</b> at <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> of tins and bottles, and {{the cloud}} of doubt still lowered upon his face.|$|R
6000|$|He {{bowed and}} walked back westwards with a graver look than usual upon his boyish face, for he had a task before him which was very little to his liking. Ernestine swung open the {{entrance}} door to the [...] "Hour", and passed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> of desks until she reached {{the door at the}} further end marked [...] "Sub-Editor." [...] She knocked and was admitted at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{look very}} tired, {{and they have}} done so much," [...] she said, glancing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>rows</b> of piled-up grain. [...] "Is not that {{sufficient}} to justify your resting a little?" ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Violet Harby removed Ursula's {{waterproof}} {{from the}} peg {{on which it}} was hung, to one a little farther <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row.</b> She had already snatched the pins from her own stuff hat, and jammed them through her coat. She turned to Ursula, as she pushed up her frizzed, flat, dun-coloured hair.|$|E
60|$|The {{minutes passed}} by. The Three Tranters Inn sank into a mere heap of red-hot charcoal: the fire pushed its way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> {{as the church}} clock {{opposite}} slowly struck the hour of midnight, and the bewildered chimes, scarcely heard amid the crackling of the flames, wandered through the wayward air of the Old Hundred-and-Thirteenth Psalm.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{universal}} custom thereabout {{to wake the}} bees by tapping at their hives whenever a death occurred in the household, under the belief that if this were not done the bees themselves would pine away and perish during the ensuing year. As soon as an interior buzzing responded to her tap at the first hive Mrs. Hall {{went on to the}} second, and thus passed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row.</b> As soon as she came back he met her.|$|E
50|$|Resource Step: You may {{place one}} card face <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> {{resource}} <b>row.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{clutched}} nervously {{at the end}} of his rug. She {{looked up}} and <b>down</b> along <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of chairs. There were one or two slumbering forms, but most were empty. There were no promenaders in sight.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Wittamer caf√© {{is still}} located on 6 Place du Grand Sablon. A larger shop on 12 was opened <b>down</b> <b>the</b> same <b>row</b> {{which offers a}} wider choice and variety of chocolates and Belgian pralines.|$|R
6000|$|Without a word, {{the young}} woman put her hand up to her back hair, sidled swiftly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of chairs, ran down the aisle, and vanished. There {{was no one else}} in the chapel. Mr. Lavender, after {{surveying}} the considerable wreckage, made his way to the door and passed out into the night. [...] "Like a dream," [...] he thought; [...] "but I have done my duty, for no meeting was ever more completely broken up. With a clear conscience and a good appetite I can how go home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so close," [...] he said, stooping {{over her}} potatoes, taking some out and rearranging the others. She stood by with the painful terrified {{helplessness}} of childhood. He was so unseeing and confident, {{she wanted to}} do the thing and yet she could not. She stood by looking on, her little blue overall fluttering in the wind, the red woollen ends of her shawl blowing gustily. Then he went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row,</b> relentlessly, turning the potatoes in with his sharp spade-cuts. He took no notice of her, only worked on. He had another world from hers.|$|E
60|$|The next evening, {{when he was}} sauntering <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of {{glittering}} shops {{beside the}} Tepl, with Mrs. March, they overtook the general and his daughter {{at a place where}} the girl was admiring some stork-scissors in the window; she said she wished she were still little, so that she could get them. They walked home with the Triscoes, and then he hurried Mrs. March back to the shop. The man had already put up his shutters, and was just closing his door, but Burnamy pushed in, and asked to look at the stork-scissors they had seen in the window. The gas was out, and the shopman lighted a very dim candle, to show them.|$|E
50|$|In the Half World, custom reigns supreme {{and natural}} laws are negotiable. They go before Old Nick and demand to inspect his demons, as custom allows. Faced with {{seemingly}} endless legions of horrific creatures, Royce and Archie, helped by Mrs. Jennings' cat, travel up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> Jedson and Amanda {{have to remain}} behind as hostages. After what seems years they identify and tackle Ditworth. Being a demon, Ditworth can kill them, but another demon breaks ranks and subdues their enemy. At this point their helper reveals himself to be an FBI agent. Archie faints.|$|R
6000|$|He sat his basket <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> <b>row,</b> and, looking up, said, [...] "Into thy hands I commend my spirit! Thou hast {{redeemed}} me, oh Lord God of truth!" [...] {{and then}} quietly yielded {{himself to the}} rough, brutal grasp with which Quimbo seized him.|$|R
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows,</b> straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in <b>the</b> adjoining <b>row.</b> A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|R
60|$|Mr Verloc, moody {{and spread}} {{largely on the}} sofa, {{continued}} to look <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of his waistcoat buttons; but his cheeks became tinged by a faint blush. Of late even the merest derivative of the word science (a term in itself inoffensive and of indefinite meaning) had the curious power of evoking a definitely offensive mental vision of Mr Vladimir, in his body as he lived, with an almost supernatural clearness. And this phenomenon, deserving justly to be classed amongst the marvels of science, induced in Mr Verloc an emotional state of dread and exasperation tending to express itself in violent swearing. But he said nothing. It was Karl Yundt who was heard, implacable to his last breath.|$|E
6000|$|The {{soldier and}} his girl rose, passing {{in front of}} him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Row.</b> He watched their scarlet and blue figures, moving slowly towards the sun, and another couple close to the rails, {{crossing}} those receding forms. Very straight and tall, there was something exhilarating in the way this new couple swung along, holding their heads up, turning towards each other, to exchange words or smiles. Even at that distance they could be seen to be of high fashion; in their gait was the almost insolent poise of those who are above doubts and cares, certain of the world and of themselves. The girl's dress was tawny brown, her hair and hat too of the same hue, and the pursuing sunlight endowed her with a hazy splendour. Then, Courtier saw who they were--that couple! ...|$|E
6000|$|Pete flung his lock-pick {{out among}} the agave scrub that faced the bank shanty and ran out wildly into {{the midst of the}} dusty white road that led <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>row</b> of huts which the people of Aylmer's Pike euphemistically {{described}} as the Main Street. There he raised such an unearthly whoop as roused the sleepers in the nearest huts to turn over in their beds and listen in wonder, with a vague idea that [...] "the Injuns" [...] were coming down on a scalping-trail upon the diggings. Next, he hurried down the street, beating heavily with his fist on every frame door, and kicking hard at the log walls of the successive shanties. In a few minutes the whole Pike was out and alive. Unwholesome-looking men, in unwashed flannel shirts and loose trousers, mostly barefooted in their haste, came forth to inquire, with an unnecessary wealth of expletives, what the something was stirring. Pete, breathless and wrathful in the midst, livid with rage and disappointment, could only shriek aloud, [...] "Cap'n Pierpoint has cleared out of camp, and taken all the plate with him!" [...] There was at first an incredulous shouting and crying; then a general stampede towards the bank shanty; and, finally, as the truth became apparent to everybody, a deep and angry howl for vengeance on the traitor. In one moment Captain Pierpoint's smooth-faced villany dawned as clear as day to all Aylmer's Pike; and the whole chorus of gamblers, rascals, and blacklegs stood awe-struck with horror and indignation at the more plausible rogue who had succeeded in swindling even them. The clean-washed, white-shirted, fair-spoken villain! they would have his blood for this, if the United States Marshal had every mother's son of them strung up in a row for it after the pesky business was once fairly over.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{satisfactory}} {{way to see}} the fleet is {{to take one of}} the Santa Fe excursion trips around [...]the bay. For nearly two hours, each trip, the steamer Ocean Wave steams slowly up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> of battleships, cruisers and torpedo boats, giving passengers an excellent opportunity to view the beautiful vessels from every side. Fred Harvey maintains a splendid cafe on board. There is no overcrowding. On Saturday and Sunday trips will be as follows: Leave, from Santa Fe waiting room,Ferry building, 9:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m.; 3:00 p.m., 5:00 [...]p.m; and 7:00; p.m. Fare $1.00. Tlckets at ferry office or 673 Market street.|$|R
2500|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} they made them up as they moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> cotton <b>rows</b> or not," [...] Wills once told Charles Townsend, author of San Antonio Rose: The Life And Times Of Bob Wills, [...] "but they sang blues you never heard before." ...|$|R
60|$|Gallwey made {{a little}} gesture of {{concurrence}} as he once more glanced <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>rows</b> of sheaves. <b>The</b> stubble stood among them knee-high and above the strip of ploughing that cut it off from the prairie, for straw has no great value in that country.|$|R
