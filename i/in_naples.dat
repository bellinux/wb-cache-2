5|$|Born <b>in</b> <b>Naples,</b> Italy, {{he came to}} the United States in 1895 {{with his}} parents at the age of nine. His father Francesco Cotillo, had been a caterer <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> The family {{originally}} came from Avellino (Montella), in the hinterland of Naples. The family settled in East Harlem in East 113th Street among the increasing numbers of Italian immigrants. His father took up catering again and opened a popular pastry and confectionery shop. He has been credited with introducing the Italian ice cream spumoni into the United States.|$|E
5|$|In December 1818, the Shelleys {{travelled}} {{south with}} Claire Clairmont and their servants to Naples, where they stayed for three months, receiving only one visitor, a physician. In 1820, {{they found themselves}} plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi, former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> shortly after the Foggis had married. The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 <b>in</b> <b>Naples,</b> Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two-month-old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby's mother. Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events: that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child; that the baby was his by Elise, Claire, or an unknown woman; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant, but {{it is unclear how}} much she really knew. The events <b>in</b> <b>Naples,</b> a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils, remain shrouded in mystery. The only certainty is that she herself was not the child’s mother. Elena Adelaide Shelley died <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> on 9 June 1820.|$|E

5|$|Back in Italy, Alfano stood {{trial at}} Viterbo for the Cuocolo murders. On March 27, 1909, the Assistant Public Prosecutor {{committed}} 47 persons for trial by the Court of Assizes <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> However, due to many attempts to corrupt the authorities and other obstacles {{the trial was}} transferred to the Court of Assizes in Viterbo, 250kilometres from Naples and 80kilometres north of Rome.|$|E
5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested {{the timing was}} fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.|$|E
5|$|Francis, {{convinced}} that he would regain his freedom if he could obtain a personal audience with Charles, pressed d'Avalos and Lannoy, who had intended to transport the king to the Castel Nuovo <b>in</b> <b>Naples,</b> {{to send him to}} Spain instead. Concerned by Bourbon's scheming, they agreed and Francis arrived in Barcelona on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|Handel {{then spent}} time in Rome, where the {{performance}} of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel {{and asked him to}} set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season.|$|E

5|$|Petrosino {{received}} anonymous {{letters from}} Neapolitans in New York that confirmed Alfano's {{presence in the}} city, where he allegedly had given a banquet to several local Camorra members in a Grand Street restaurant. On April 17, 1907, Petrosino and his agents raided the apartment at 108 Mulberry Street where Alfano was living and arrested him. The arrest caused a sensation <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> He {{had been convicted of}} a crime involving moral turpitude in Italy and was turned over to the Federal authorities. Within three days he was expelled and put on a ship to Le Havre in France, where he was picked up by the Italian police. He was put behind bars <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> According to some sources, Alfano was the man behind Petrosino's murder in Palermo on March 12, 1909, which has since been attributed to the Sicilian Mafia, and to Vito Cascioferro in particular.|$|E
5|$|The royal group {{spent two}} hours at Naples National Archaeological Museum before having an {{audience}} with King Umberto I and Queen Margherita.

5|$|A two-chamber {{parliament}} in Palermo and <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> was formed. The {{formation of the}} parliament brought the end of feudalism in the Kingdom. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 Ferdinand repealed all reforms. The people of Sicily rebelled but were defeated by Spanish and Austrian forces. In 1848 another Sicilian revolution of independence occurred, which was put down by FerdinandII of the Two Sicilies, who was nicknamed Rè Bomba after his 5-day bombardment of Messina. From 1816 to 1861 the kingdoms were united under the name Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> He was surprised to find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
5|$|Born on 14 March 1822 <b>in</b> <b>Naples,</b> TeresaCristina {{became an}} orphan {{when her father}} died in 1830. Her mother {{is said to have}} {{neglected}} her after marrying a young officer in 1839. Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, intolerance and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Captain Roderick Dew, {{the ship}} was {{initially}} assigned to the Channel Fleet where she spent three months as temporary flagship before she {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean in 1868. Lord Clyde made one cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet during which she fractured her steel mainyard in a squall. Her engines continued to deteriorate and they were condemned as no longer safe to use by the fleet engineer when she arrived <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> The ship was sent to the Malta Dockyard under sail for repair, but they could only make temporary repairs that would enable her to reach home.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} charged 33 JNA officersincluding Brčić who {{was tried}} in absentia and convicted to 15 years in prisonfor the bombardment of Split, Šolta and Brač.

Most of the other charged officers were also tried in absentia. , fifteen officersincluding Brčićwere convicted, one was acquitted and seventeen cases were ordered by the Supreme Court of Croatia to be retried because of irregularities during previous trials.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Verdi {{began to}} work more {{consistently}} with his librettists. He relied on Piave again for I due Foscari, performed in Rome in November 1844, then on Solera once more for Giovanna d'Arco, at La Scala in February 1845, while in August that year {{he was able to}} work with Salvadore Cammarano on Alzira for the Teatro di San Carlo <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> Solera and Piave worked together on Attila for La Fenice (March 1846).|$|E

5|$|June 19, 1972– Hurricane Agnes strikes Panama City {{with minimal}} hurricane-force winds and a storm surge peaking at 7feet (2.1m) in Cedar Key. Agnes {{produces}} moderate rainfall throughout the state, amounting {{to a maximum}} of 8.97inches (228mm) <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> The hurricane spawns 28tornadoes in the state which destroy 15houses and 217 trailers.

5|$|Louis I of Anjou died on 10 September 1384, {{enabling}} his rival, CharlesIII of Naples, {{to stabilize}} his rule in Southern Italy {{during the next}} months. The consolidation of CharlesIII's position <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> {{also contributed to the}} formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary. John Horvat, Ban of Macsó (now Mačva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading figures of their movement. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary, but she refused him. He left Hungary in early 1385.|$|E
5|$|Napoli added {{their second}} Serie A title in 1989–90, {{defeating}} Milan by two {{points in the}} title race. However, this was surrounded by less auspicious circumstances as Napoli were awarded two points for a game, when in Bergamo, an Atalanta fan threw a 100 lira coin at Alemão's head. A controversial set of events set off at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when Maradona made comments pertaining to North–South inequality {{in the country and}} the risorgimento, asking Neapolitans to root for Argentina in the semi-finals against Italy <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 1921, Katori, {{escorted by}} Kashima, {{departed}} Yokohama bound for Great Britain carrying Crown Prince Hirohito, the first Japanese crown prince to travel abroad. The ships arrived at Portsmouth on 9 May and Hirohito left {{the ship to}} tour Europe; he boarded the battleship again <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> several months later for the voyage home. The ship was disarmed in April 1922, stricken from the Navy List on 20 September 1923 and scrapped at Maizuru Naval Arsensal by 29 January 1925 {{to comply with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|On May 12 President Arthur sailed on {{her second}} voyage to Palestine, {{counting}} Hemda Ben-Yahuda, {{the widow of}} Hebrew linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, among her passengers. During the trip, an altercation between a Steward and the ship's master-at-arms resulted {{in the death of}} the latter while the ship was <b>in</b> <b>Naples.</b> Though the steward was arrested by Italian authorities, he was acquitted of murder by the Assize Court at Naples. After a return to New York, President Arthur sailed for Haifa on July 19 for what would be her last voyage for American Palestine.|$|E
5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company <b>in</b> <b>Naples,</b> but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E
5|$|Some {{sources have}} {{suggested}} that the opera was performed in Dublin in March or April 1711, though according to Dean and Knapp there is no record of such an occasion. In November 1715 a version mainly in German was performed in Hamburg. This production, based on a translation by the playwright Barthold Feind, proved to be very popular and was revived in the city on numerous occasions during the 1720s. A pastiche of the opera, with additional numbers by Leonardo Leo, was presented by Leo at the Royal Court <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> in 1718, with Nicolini singing his original role.|$|E
5|$|The group {{traveled}} to Italy in early 1818. They first surrendered Allegra to Byron in April, much to Claire's distress. In August, Percy Shelley took Claire to see Allegra, at her request. Percy arrived in Venice, telling Byron {{he had the}} entire family. Mary was thus summoned to Venice to substantiate Percy's story. However, baby Clara Shelley was sick and traveling made her even more ill. She died shortly after arriving in Venice. In the winter of 1818, Percy registered a child <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> to himself and Mary: Elena Adelaide. However, it is unclear who this child's parents really were.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{stationed}} <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> in 1900, {{along with the}} old ironclads , , and , the armored cruiser , the other three Goito-class cruisers, Tripoli, and the two new s.

5|$|The tomb {{monument}} was {{the first}} collaboration between Donatello and Michelozzo, {{who went on to}} collaborate on the tomb of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci in the Church of Sant'Angelo a Nilo <b>in</b> <b>Naples,</b> the tomb of Papal Secretary Bartolomeo Aragazzi in what is now the Duomo of Montepulciano, and the external pulpit of the Duomo of Prato. At the time of their partnership, Donatello was already well known for his statues of prophets and saints for the Duomo and Orsanmichele, while Michelozzo was more obscure. Both had worked for a time for Ghiberti, whose workshop then led Florentine sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{is closely}} {{monitored}} by the Osservatorio Vesuvio <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> with extensive networks of seismic and gravimetric stations, {{a combination of a}} GPS-based geodetic array and satellite-based synthetic aperture radar to measure ground movement and by local surveys and chemical analyses of gases emitted from fumaroles. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1880s George's health {{began to}} decline, and Josephine spent {{increasing}} time looking after him. They holidayed <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> in 1889, but George contracted influenza in the 1889–90 pandemic. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890; Josephine suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death. Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in Wimbledon, London, which she shared with her eldest son and his wife.|$|E
5|$|Verdi had {{intended}} to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, most probably, by his increasing attachment to Strepponi. Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849, the immediate cause being an outbreak of cholera, and Verdi went directly to Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera, Luisa Miller, for a production <b>in</b> <b>Naples</b> later in the year.|$|E
