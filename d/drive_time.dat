We have developed a model of microseism propagation through a linear seismic array and use the model to obtain time correction shifts. By simulating time offsets in real data which does not have offsets, we determined that this method is able to repair the offset to less than 0. 2 seconds. Our ongoing work will attempt to refine the model to correct the offsets to 0. 05 seconds and evaluate how errors in the correction affect seismic results such as event location.

During the 1980s when the SANFL was still the number one game in town, KG hosted a 30-minute {{football}} wrap-up show on Channel 9 Adelaide called KG's Footy Show. The show was run on Saturdays during the football season and ran in the 5:30-6pm time slot. KG and guests who included players usually from the days winning teams, would give their comments and show highlights of the games. KG was also the weekend sports presenter for Channel 9 news in Adelaide for over 20 years until he joined Channel 7 in 2005.

His show started on 13 October 1997, the same day that Zoë Ball started as Evans' replacement on Radio 1. The initial contract would only be for ten weeks, until the MMC announced its decision on the Capital Radio takeover. Evans approached David Campbell to discuss buying the radio station and, with Michael Foster's help, they put together a deal to buy the radio station with venture capital supplied by Apax Partners and Paribas, with Virgin Group retaining a 20% stake in the business. The deal was announced on 8 December 1997, and would see the formation of the Ginger Media Group, an umbrella company overseeing Virgin Radio and producing programmes such as TFI Friday.|$|E

The missing portion of I-8 was expected to cost $45million and be constructed in three parts, with one part being started each year. The segments between Japatul Valley Road and west of Laguna Junction, and from La Posta Road to west of Boulevard, were delayed {{for an entire year}} at the end of 1969 due to a nationwide effort to fight inflation by reducing spending. A [...] segment from Buckman Springs to Crestwood received funding in May 1970, which would leave only an [...] stretch of the freeway uncompleted when built.

500|$|Ken Gormley, {{author of}} The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals {{in his book}} that Clinton {{narrowly}} escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During {{his visit to the}} Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while {{he was on his way}} to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED). According to officials, the IED was large enough to [...] "blow up the entire presidential motorcade". Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge. This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila. Once more, the word [...] "wedding" [...] was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt. Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the <b>drive</b> <b>time.</b> Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high. Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag. Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base. The president was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden. Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.|$|E
