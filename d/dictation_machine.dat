25|$|In 1885, {{when the}} Volta Associates were {{sure that they}} had a number of {{practical}} inventions, they filed patent applications and also began to seek out investors. They were granted Canadian and U.S. patents for the Graphophone in 1885 and 1886 respectively. The Graphophone was originally intended for business use as a dictation recording and playback machine. The Graphophone Company of Alexandria, Virginia, was created on January6,1886 and formally incorporated on February3,1886 by another of Bell's cousins. It was formed to control the patents and to handle the commercial development of their numerous sound recording and reproduction inventions, one of which became the first <b>dictation</b> <b>machine,</b> the 'Dictaphone'.|$|E

2500|$|The John F.

Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Made on a common Dictaphone <b>dictation</b> <b>machine</b> that recorded sounds in grooves pressed into a thin vinyl-plastic belt, the recording gained prominence among Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists from 1978, in which the HSCA used it to conclude that there was a [...] "high probability" [...] that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone and that the Kennedy assassination {{was the result of a}} conspiracy. Later scientific examination discredited this interpretation of the evidence.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{dictation}} is {{a method}} of recording and editing the spoken word in real-time. The recording {{is done by the}} use of a digital recorder.

The Mini-Cassette had a tape cassette format, mainly for the use with dictation recorders, which is still today's standard in professional analog dictation. The cassettes were subsequently used in the Philips Pocket Memo devices, which were launched in the same year.|$|E

50|$|Philips {{introduced}} the audio Compact Audio Cassette tape in 1963, {{and it was}} wildly successful. Compact cassettes were initially used for <b>dictation</b> <b>machines</b> for office typing stenographers and professional journalists.

2500|$|The Compact Cassette {{originally}} {{was intended for}} use in <b>dictation</b> <b>machines.</b> In this capacity, some later-model cassette-based <b>dictation</b> <b>machines</b> could also run the tape at half speed (15⁄16 in/s) as playback quality was not critical. The cassette soon became a popular medium for distributing prerecorded music—initially through The Philips Record Company (and subsidiary labels Mercury and Philips in the U.S.). As of 2009, one still finds cassettes used {{for a variety of}} purposes, such as journalism, oral history, meeting and interview transcripts, audio-books, and so on. Police are still big buyers of cassette tapes, as some lawyers [...] "don't trust digital technology for interviews". However, they are starting to give way to Compact Discs and more [...] "compact" [...] digital storage media.

Stanton marketed his device as a <b>dictation</b> <b>machine,</b> but he was unable to persuade businesses to adopt his creation.

50|$|To {{eliminate}} the nuisance of tape-threading, various manufacturers introduced cartridges {{that held the}} tape inside a metal or plastic housing to eliminate handling. Most were intended only for low-fidelity voice recording in <b>dictation</b> <b>machines.</b> The first tape cartridge designed for general consumer use, including music reproduction, was the Sound Tape or Magazine Loading Cartridge (RCA tape cartridge), introduced in 1958 by RCA.
