50|$|Prior to {{numerical}} control, <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> evolved first, {{because they}} evolved by putting milling tables under lathe-like headstocks.

Even in the CNC era, a heavy workpiece needing machining on multiple sides lends itself to a horizontal machining center, while diesinking lends itself to a vertical one.|$|R
50|$|CNC {{machines}} {{can exist}} in virtually {{any of the}} forms of manual machinery, like <b>horizontal</b> <b>mills.</b> The most advanced CNC milling-machines, the multiaxis machine, add two more axes {{in addition to the}} three normal axes (XYZ). <b>Horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> also have a C or Q axis, allowing the horizontally mounted workpiece to be rotated, essentially allowing asymmetric and eccentric turning. The fifth axis (B axis) controls the tilt of the tool itself. When all of these axes are used in conjunction with each other, extremely complicated geometries, even organic geometries such as a human head can be made with relative ease with these machines. But the skill to program such geometries is beyond that of most operators. Therefore, 5-axis <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> are practically always programmed with CAM.|$|R

50|$|A <b>{{horizontal}}</b> <b>mill</b> has {{the same}} sort but the cutters are mounted on a horizontal spindle (see Arbor milling) across the table. Many <b>horizontal</b> <b>mills</b> also feature a built-in rotary table that allows milling at various angles; this feature is called a universal table. While endmills and the other types of tools available to a vertical mill {{may be used in}} a <b>horizontal</b> <b>mill,</b> their real advantage lies in arbor-mounted cutters, called side and face mills, which have a cross section rather like a circular saw, but are generally wider and smaller in diameter. Because the cutters have good support from the arbor and have a larger cross-sectional area than an end mill, quite heavy cuts can be taken enabling rapid material removal rates. These are used to mill grooves and slots. Plain mills are used to shape flat surfaces. Several cutters may be ganged together on the arbor to mill a complex shape of slots and planes. Special cutters can also cut grooves, bevels, radii, or indeed any section desired. These specialty cutters tend to be expensive. Simplex mills have one spindle, and duplex mills have two. It is also easier to cut gears on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>mill.</b> Some <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> are equipped with a power-take-off provision on the table. This allows the table feed to be synchronized to a rotary fixture, enabling the milling of spiral features such as hypoid gears.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{burnishing}} is chip less machining {{which can}} be used to improve the surface roughness and surface hardness on any metal work piece. The purpose of the research was to demonstrate the multi roller burnishing process on non ferrous metals namely Aluminum, Brass and Copper to improve surface roughness and surface hardness. Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were carried on non-ferrous metals in a vertical <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> with various spindle rotations, feed rate and depth of penetration. Findings: The surface roughness on various no-ferrous metals improved by high spindle rotations with high feed rate and depth of penetration. Research limitations/implications: Due to high spindle rotations with multi roller in action, the vibration of the equipment could not be controlled. Some mechanisms have to be devised to reduce the vibrations. However, it is not in the scope of this research. Practical implications: The experiments were conducted with out coolant and this is added advantages for the environment and pollution free. Originality/value: The burnishing process can be carried in a lathe and vertical/ <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> with suitable fixtures to hold the work piece.

3000|$|In this study, strains {{that are}} caused by wood-based panels on <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> and other cutting devices were examined. In order to fulfill this aim, samples of wood-based panels such as particleboard, medium density {{fiberboard}} (MDF), blockboard, okoume (Aucoumea klaineana) plywood, poplar (Populus × euramericana) plywood, and oriented strand board (OSB) were examined. The strains that <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> and planer head with reversible knives suffered were measured by an amperemeter using an experimental mechanism with six different wood-based panels, three different engine revolution speeds (rev/min), and three drive forward speeds (m/min). Using the experimental data and the data derived from wood-based panels, engine revolution speed, and drive forward speed, several regression equations were developed in order to anticipate probable strains {{for each of the}} wood-based panels. As a consequence, the utmost strains observed on machinery during planing were caused by okoume plywood, followed by MDF, OSB, particleboard, blockboard, and poplar plywood in decreasing order of intensity. It was also observed that the spent current values (A) increased during planing in which engine revolution speed and drive forward speed are always kept high. It was also clearly seen that the wood-based panels were more resistant to the machinery and the knives when they were operated at higher speeds.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{mathematical}} model is suggested {{with a view to}} the study of dynamic behavior of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> under the action of the three cutting force components, of which Fy produces the horizontal vibration of the machine, while Fx and Fz determine a vertical vibration.

This analysis opens up with the dynamic concentration of the distributed mass. The deformed position of the machine might be obtained as a result of successive rotations. Starting from the system of fixed axes, it is successively obtained the systems of moving axes, solidly bound to various parts of the machine.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for tuning the stiffness of machine tool supports is described {{based on a}} stiffness model using the contact stiffness approach. Using this model, the mathematical relationship between the load of the support and its stiffness is established. The relationship is separated into three regions. When the total stiffness of all supports is maximized, the load must be tuned so that the stiffness–support load relationship is in the critical region, whereby the contact stiffness is slightly larger than the bulk stiffness. Correspondingly, a placement method of supports is proposed that increases their stiffness without anchor bolts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in two experiments. In the first experiment, the natural frequency of a small machine tool prototype is compared for several placements of three supports. The lowest natural frequency of the machine tool under the proposed placement scheme is maximized. In the second experiment, the proposed method is applied to increase the lowest natural frequency of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> The lowest natural frequency with a distinct arrangement of three supports is increased by 15 – 55 %, compared to other popular placements of these three supports. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed placement method is effective for enhancing the stiffness of machine tool supports...|$|E

40|$|Certain 30 mm munitions used {{in various}} {{military}} applications are configured with a glass-reinforced nylon band {{that acts as}} a firing ring or rotating band. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether storage environments compromise the strength and integrity of the glass-reinforced nylon rotating bands by researching the environmental factors that will degrade nylon and by performing tests to investigate if these factors will embrittle nylon composites. Moisture and temperature are found to be the environmental factors that will {{have an effect on the}} rotating bands in their respective storage environments. Absorbed moisture is found to increase the impact strength of nylon while at the same time expanding surface defects and attacking fiber/matrix bonds. Two impact tests using a Tinius Olsen impact tester are used to determine the effects of different storage environments on the impact strength of neat resin nylon 6 / 12 and 33 % glass-reinforced nylon 6 / 12. The relative Shore D hardness of each reinforced sample is also measured to determine if any correlation between impact strength and hardness exists. Absorbed moisture is found to increase the toughness of both neat resin and reinforced nylon samples, but once dried again no significant difference in impact strength is found.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} is to analyse dependence of roughness of machined surface on adhesion performance of various anticorrosion systems. In order to prepare samples for the experiment, samples were milled on a knee and column type of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> Depending on cutting conditions and machining tool, there were set intervals of roughness of machined surface which are commonly achievable on this type of machine. It is a roughness in the interval of 0. 4 – 1. 6 µm (finishing), 1. 6 – 6. 3 µm (standard milling) a 6. 3 – 12. 5 µm (roughening). Removable cutting tips were used as a machining tool and for roughening, a shell end milling cutter NAREX 63 x 40 HSS 90 was used.

Hence these unwanted vibrations are needed to be suppressed or damped out while machining.

The part to be machined is kept on sandwich of plates made up of polymer and composite material. The sandwich along with the part to be machined, fixed on the slotted table of <b>horizontal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> The parameters that can easily be controlled are feed, RPM of cutter, depth of cut, and number of plates that form the secondary bed material. Polymers like Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Polypropylene (PP) plates and composites like Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy (GFE) plates are used in the experiments to form the sandwich (secondary bed material) on which work-piece (MS Plate) was mounted and fed to the milling cutter. Four holes are made on the specimen and the plates to ensure that the sandwich of plate including the work-piece can be bolted to the slotted table. Common up-milling operation was carried out in controlled manner. Vibration signals were recorded on the screen of phosphorous storage oscilloscope and surface roughness of machined plate was found from the Talysurf. Finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to know the resonance frequencies at which the structure should not be excited.

They are two important matters under study of the scientific community with the final goal of improving the process performances and to make it reliable to allow its use for rapid prototyping and for small batch production. In recent years, the application of neural network techniques to forming processes has been a research topic for optimizing and predicting process parameters and ISF process has not been an exception. Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks in using Backpropagation (BP) neural networks, such as easily falling into local minimum point. Because of that, recently Genetic Algorithms (GA) are applied to BP networks in order to optimize them.

40|$|In general, {{machine tool}} {{structures}} like lathe, milling, broaching, and grinding machines, etc. {{are subjected to}} regular unwanted vibrations. These machine tool vibrations or chatter are deleterious to machining operations. It results in degraded quality on the machined parts, shorter tool life, and unpleasant noise, hence are to be necessarily damped out. The important characteristics of the machine tool structures for metal cutting are high damping and static stiffness which ensure manufacture of work pieces of the required geometries with acceptable surface finish at the required rate of production in the most economical way. The unwanted vibrations must be arrested in ordet to ensure higher accuracy along with productivity. In the present work, the chatter vibrations on a slotted table <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Milling</b> <b>Machine</b> have been damped out using composite structure {{as a substitute for}} the base of the work piece. Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy plates are fixed on to the slotted table as a secondary bed material and the workpiece is mounted on this bed for feeding to the rotating milling cutter. Initially four holes are drilled on each plate of the composite and a set of five plates of each type of composite are mounted for conducting the experiments. A mild steel specimen of similar dimension of the composite plate is placed on the pile of the composites and the setup is fixed to the slotted table using bolts and nuts. An up milling operation is carried out and the vibration signal is recorded on the screen of the digital phosphorus storage oscilloscope. The signal and RMS amplitude, frequency and time period of vibrations are recorded. The experiment is repeated for different sets of composite plates by decreasing the number and the corresponding readings are recorded and tabulated. Moreover, experiments are also conducted without any composite material below the mild steel specimen. It is observed that the vibration amplitude decreases with increase in number of layers of sheets of composites and then increases with increase in number of plates. Moreover, the optimum number of composites are also experimentally determined. The design of the experimental setup has been modeled using CatiaV 5 R 15. Apart from total damping of the system, emphasis has also been focused to find out the material damping of the composite materials so as to select the same for effective damping of the structures. An energy balance approach has been used for calculating the material damping of the fiber reinforced composites used in the experiment. ...|$|E
