Street <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> gun violence are two prevalent, partially overlapping phenomena that constitute social challenges. Empirically supported legal, policy and practical frameworks are needed {{in order to reduce the}} prevalence of <b>gangs</b> <b>and</b> <b>gang</b> violence in Sweden.

40|$|This article discerns {{the role}} that Mexican American gang members play in drug markets, and the {{relationship}} between <b>gang</b> members’drug use <b>and</b> drug selling in South Texas. A four-part typology based on the two dimensions of <b>gang</b> type <b>and</b> <b>gang</b> member emerged from this qualitative analysis of 160 male gang members: Homeboys, Hustlers, Slangers, and Ballers. Major findings include the following: (1) many gang members are user/sellers and are not profit-oriented dealers, (2) gangs commonly do extend “protection ” to drug-selling members, and (3) proximity to Mexican drug markets, adult prison <b>gangs,</b> <b>and</b> criminal family members may play important roles in whether these gang members have access and the profit potential to actually deal drugs.

5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the <b>gang</b> <b>and</b> saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains.
