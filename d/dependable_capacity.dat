The dam is a run-of the river style dam, in {{that there is no}} reservoir. Due to the lack of a reservoir, the <b>dependable</b> generating <b>capacity</b> is only 10 MW, as that is the normal flow of the river during the dry season. Prior to the First Liberian Civil War the plant produced 64MW of electricity, which accounted for 35% of all electricity generated in the nation. In addition to electricity, the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation used the project to provide drinking water to Monrovia and surrounding areas before the war.|$|R
50|$|By 2012, KE {{achieved}} Gross <b>Dependable</b> Generation <b>Capacity</b> of 1670 Megawatts. The latest {{addition to}} its generation fleet took place in May 2015 when its Korangi plant saw the addition of another Combined Cycle unit. This added another 27 MW to the existing 220 MW that the power plant was generating. Before that, in April 2012, KE’s newly constructed prime power station called Bin Qasim Power Station No. II started to generate 560 additional megawatts when it was converted to Combined Cycle technology. Overall, 1057 MWs had been added to KE’s installed power generation capacity, from January 2009 to May 2015, by construction of new power plants, improvement of existing fleet efficiency by 21.7 per cent through the measures stated above {{in addition to the}} replacement of old machines with highly efficient machines, timely and digital annual maintenance and overhaul of Bin Qasim Power Station I’s old units and by optimum dispatch of electricity. Reliability of the system has been improved by reducing unit tripping by 33% and by 31% reduction in the loss of un-served energy.

40|$|Botswana has a basic need {{to explore}} its energy concept, this being its energy sources, {{generation}} and {{percentage of the population}} with access to electricity. At present, Botswana generates electricity from coal, which supplies about 29 % (on average) of the country’s demand. The other 71 % is imported mainly from South Africa (Eskom). Consequently, the dependence of Botswana on imports posses threats to the security of its energy supply. As a result, there is the need to understand the bases for a possible generation expansion that would substantiate existing documentation. In view of this need, this study investigates the existing energy sources as well as energy consumption and production levels in Botswana. The study would be further developed by making projections of the energy demand up until the year 2020. The key techniques that were used include; literature review, questionnaire survey and an empirical study. The results presented indicated that, current <b>dependable</b> operation <b>capacity</b> (i. e. 100 MW) should be increased to 2, 595 MW or more assuming 85 % plant efficiency. This would then be able to meet the growing demand for energy use. In addition, the installed capacity would be able to support commercial and mining activities for the growth of the economy...|$|R
40|$|Externally-bonded Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) {{when used}} as jackets in {{reinforced}} concrete (r. c.) members {{are effective in}} increasing shear, lap-splice strength and deformation capacity. For this reason they are currently used extensively as a fast remedy in earthquake-damaged structures, or to strengthen under-designed structures in areas of high seismicity. FRP jackets impart little or no stiffness to the encased element, whereas experimental evidence indicates that the demand on bar anchorages increases after jacketing of the adjacent plastic hinges near supports. Under excessive rotation demand the jackets, being susceptible to stress concentrations, {{are at risk of}} rupture due to buckling of primary reinforcement, when the embedded stirrups are very sparse (substandard detailing). These performance issues are explored in the paper through a combined evaluation of published experimental evidence and simple mechanistic constructs that highlight the mechanical contribution of the jacket to the various failure modes of an r. c. element. <b>Dependable</b> deformation <b>capacity</b> at yield and ultimate and the various strength components are examined through collective evaluation of available tests and design lower bound expressions are derived.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} issues of {{confinement}} in plain and reinforced concrete under concentric compression and summarizes {{the state of the}} art regarding the available confinement models for strength and stress-strain behaviour of encased confined concrete, and the corresponding magnitude of <b>dependable</b> strain <b>capacity.</b> The mechanisms of confinement failure, the evolution of Poissons’ effects under low and high confinement, and the ensuing material compaction at high confining pressures (plastification) are discussed. The effects of stress concentrations near corners, the effectiveness of layers and influence of adhesive, other scale effects and the influence of specimen morphology on mechanical behaviour are also outlined. Next, the chapter concentrates on the effects of embedded reinforcement both longitudinal and transverse. Confinement effectiveness in the presence of combined flexure and shear (in plastic hinge regions), local effects due to rotation capacity increase, and effects of FRP confinement on overall member behaviour are discussed. Shape effects that occur in hollow or oblong sections are also considered. Furthermore, the chapter gives an outline regarding the characteristics of the international database of tests for confinement, and its calibration with the database of the available confinement models including those included in the design standards (ACI, CNR and EC 8 -III) ...|$|R

40|$|The International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) {{based in}} India carries out {{research}} into {{what has been}} termed the 'hardest end of the research spectrum': rainfed farming in the semi-arid tropics. The objective {{is to improve the}} yield, stability and quality of five staple foods commonly found in such regions: sorghum, pearl millet, pigeonpea, chickpea and groundnut. ICRISAT is also committed to the parallel objective of finding systems that could produce higher output and more <b>dependable</b> results. Its <b>capacity</b> to provide information is considered important not just to keep its own scientists abreast of the latest developments but also to satisfy the information requirements of those who are working on its mandate crops in areas where such information is either non-existent or meagre. That explains why ICRISAT established the Sorghum and Millets Information Centre (SMIC) in 1976 as a specialized part of its Library and Documentation Services to collect, collate and disseminate information on sorghum and millets to research workers throughout the semiarid tropics. Financial support for this project was partially provided by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in Canada. The information products and services provided by SMIC included comprehensive bibliographies, a Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) service, a literature search service, an information analysis service, and a document delivery service. It also published a newsletter three times a year in English and French to update researchers working in areas with poor library facilities. A worldwide directory of researchers working on sorghum and millets was also compiled and distributed. An external review of ICRISAT's activities found that SMIC had contributed significantly to worldwide research on the two crops and recommended that its activities be expanded to cover all five of ICRISAT's mandate crops. This replacement project is known as the Semi-Arid Tropical Crops Information Service (SATCRIS). It is also funded partly by IDRC and has an initial duration of three vears. Apart from ICRISAT staff, the primary users of SATCRIS are scientists, academics and extension personnel working on the five mandate crops in national or regional institutions. The information products that are expected to be generated include: - monthly SDls to individual users all over the semi-arid tropics based on a carefully constructed and tailor-made user profile, - literature searches on demand, - abstract journals and annual bibliographies, in collaboration with CAB International, on all five mandate crops. CABI already produces the sorghum and millet abstracts and will produce two new abstract services: one for chickpeas and pigeonpeas and the other for groundnuts. - literature reviews and critical evaluations of literature on specific topics written by scientists. In selecting the topics, emphasis will be put on the usefulness of the repackaged information to researchers in Africa since this continent does not yet have the benefit of regular interaction with the expertise available at ICRISAT. A central resource for these products will be the SATCRIS machine readable database. This database will be compiled from locally generated bibliographic descriptions integrated with subsets from AGRIS and CABI databases. Apart from these services distributed from ICRISAT headquarters, an important goal is to establish a SATCRIS sub-centre at the ICRISAT Sahelian Centre (ISC) in Niamey, Niger. This sub-centre will provide document delivery services to researchers and handle other requests in francophone West Africa. Finally, a number of workshops in East Africa and the SADCC region are proposed in order to improve the local awareness of the resources and services available from SATCRIS.
