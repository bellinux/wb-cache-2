Due to the potential importance of the approach for the ecotoxicological risk assessment of poorly soluble, highly lipophilic organic substances, the project aims to test with selected chemicals whether the ETNCaqu concept can be applied to assess the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of such ingredients of personal care products.|$|E
40|$|Application of the single-cell gel {{electrophoresis}} or comet assay has revolutionized {{the field of}} genetic ecotoxicology or eco-genotoxicology. It is a rapid, sensitive and relatively inexpensive method providing the opportunity to study DNA damage (including oxidative damage), repair and cell death (apoptosis) in different cell types without prior knowledge of karyotype and cell turnover rate. The assay has, however, often attracted criticism for its lack of <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance.</b> In addition, in contrast to genetic toxicology where rapid technical {{progress has been made}} to improve cell- and tissue-specific adoption of the assay, only limited advancement has been made to transfer the methodologies to ecotoxicological studies. While reviewing the recent information available in the literature and underscoring the importance of induced genetic damage in natural species, the aims of this article are to (i) highlight and judiciously analyse the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of the assay; (ii) attempt to correlate the comet response with other relevant biological responses or biomarkers; (iii) identify the technical challenges and various factors affecting its application {{in order to make it}} reliable, reproducible and robust; (iv) critically compare the technical developments in genetic toxicology and genetic ecotoxicology and (v) evaluate the future develop-ments with respect to applications of the assay. It is suggested that while complementing other ecotoxicological parameters and further improving the methodologies, the comet assay will continue to play an important role in genetic ecotoxicology to determine induced genetic dam-age, which has significant consequences for short- and long-term survival of the natural or wild species. In-formation obtained through integrated studies using simultaneous applications of multiple biomarkers on different wild organisms could also provide an holistic dimension of toxicological impact of environmental con-taminants for the protection of human health...|$|E
30|$|This session {{focused on}} some of the {{challenges}} in aquatic toxicity assessment. Carolina Di Paolo (RWTH Aachen, Germany) provided an overview of the NORMAN inter-laboratory study on biotesting of spiked water extracts, highlighting both the challenges of performing such studies and the need for more method harmonization in environmental testing. Sebastian Beggel (Technical University Munich, Freising, Germany) presented a study on the aquatic risk of antiscalants, which are present in wastewater from water desalination processes. The results indicate that the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of these substances is higher than previously assumed. Finally, Lucas Jagodzinski (University College Cork, UK) discussed the challenges of measuring the toxicity of energy ashes from virgin wood fuels. In aquatic plants, these ashes can have both growth-promoting and toxic effects. The nature of the effect largely depends on conditions in the receiving environment.|$|E
30|$|Among {{the number}} of {{chemical}} compounds used in cosmetic products, some with a high lipophilicity (log KOW > 6) and low biodegradability (not ready biodegradable) may be considered as potential PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic) or vPvB (very persistent, very bioaccumulative) substances as defined in REACH, Annex XIII [6]. Because of the low solubility and the experimental challenges, most of these substances have not been satisfactorily tested {{with regard to their}} ecotoxicological effects. Due to this, in the first instance, 'passive dosing' methods shall be developed to test the range of ecotoxicity of poorly soluble substances and to gain data for the examination of the 'poorly solubles approach'. The discussed 'poorly solubles approach' may enable a differentiation between substances that have no explicit <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> and those still requiring further work to reliably assess their PBT properties.|$|E
30|$|One of the {{challenges}} and research needs is to fill the many gaps in toxicity data of emerging pollutants. In addition to experimental biotesting, in silico tools such as QSAR models and read-across tools [48, 49] {{may be used to}} predict toxicity of data-poor chemicals. Pragmatic approaches, considering specific modes of action resulting in excess compared to baseline toxicity [19] may help evaluating and prioritizing sites and water bodies for management. Although there will be no legally binding EQS on the basis of ∑HQ, ∑TU or msPAF for large sets of chemicals and based on uncertain and predicted toxicity data, these values are very helpful to set priorities for further monitoring and abatement. Research should suggest benchmarks of <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> and linkages to ecological effects. These suggestions need to consider that under environmental conditions, which are typically characterized by multiple stress, effects on aquatic communities can occur at toxicant concentrations that are two or three orders of magnitude below laboratory effect concentrations [26, 50, 51].|$|E
30|$|Discussion The {{decrease}} of the continuously {{decrease of}} heavy metals reflects the improving air {{quality in the}} past 15 years. Compared to other environmental monitoring and modelling programmes the moss surveys registered increasing concentrations of toxic metal elements between 1990 and 2005, e.[*]g. Cr. High Cr loads in mosses were also registered in other European countries like in Switzerland. Further investigations are therefore necessary to investigate whether {{this is due to}} different emission conditions or biogenic effects (e.[*]g. as a result of increasing nitrogen depositions). Contrary to deposition measurements that exhibit a higher temporal resolution the moss surveys provide measurement data {{on a wide range of}} elements. Some of these elements are important with regard to human-toxicological aspects (e.[*]g. As, Al, Hg, Sb, V). Due to its <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> nitrogen was monitored in the European moss survey 2005 for the first time. Compared to the metals regionally high emissions of nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere can be detected in Lower Saxony.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAs {{a part of}} the {{multidisciplinary}} program Biological Effects of Environmental Pollution in Marine Coastal Ecosystems of the European Commission, {{this study}} aimed to validate immunological alterations as biomarkers of exposure to chemical contamination in polluted areas of Western Mediterranea. The status of the immune system has been assessed in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) by measuring several immunopathological and immunocompetence parameters. Alterations of total hemocyte counts, lysosomal stability, and phagocytosis were among the most reliable effects observed in polluted sites and suggested immunosuppressive conditions in contaminated mussels. An immunotoxicological index was calculated from the set of individual data. By providing a single value per sampling station to score immunological alterations in mussels, this novel approach allowed recognition of a gradient of perturbation correlated to pollution intensity in two of the three sites monitored. Processing a set of biological parameters by this method was found to increase the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of such multiparametric studies for the assessement of chemical contamination in coastal waters...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a dab, Limanda limanda, homologue of {{the human}} retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor gene. The L. limanda partial Rb cDNA encodes a partial predicted protein of 753 amino acids. DNA sequence analysis with other vertebrate Rb sequences demonstrates that the L. limanda Rb cDNA is highly conserved in regions of functional importance. The sequence reported herein, combined with {{the high degree of}} conservation observed in critical domains, has also facilitated an investigation of the molecular etiology of environmentally-induced liver tumor samples in a feral fish species. Mutational alterations were detected in liver adenoma samples, also in apparently normal regions of liver samples dissected from fish displaying adenoma, but not in normal liver samples from otherwise healthy feral fish. These results are the first reporting the appearance of Rb mutations in wild-caught fish and suggest that the molecular etiology of fish cancer appears to involve Rb-implicated tumorigenesis. The <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of the Rb mutations in feral fish liver tumors, in terms of future genome instability and possible development of a genotoxicity biomarker, is discussed...|$|E

This paper aims at identifying the modelling needs of research (fundamental) vs. practice (design) vs. regulation (compliance) with a focus on the interactions. Different model developments that have occurred recently are first presented with a discussion on the key-question of the ‘optimum complexity’. Sampling strategies are also discussed since they influence the model uncertainty. Finally, the paper proposes suggestions for how models might be modified to incorporate our evolving knowledge about MP fate to improve model utility into the future. For instance, the relative role of heterotrophic bacteria versus ammonia oxidizing autotrophic bacteria towards the fate of MPs should be addressed, and the elaboration of a unified agreement on experimental protocols would be necessary to advance model calibration. The degree to which by-products that have <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> are created during treatment is also a key issue that needs to be considered in future model as well as the use of ecological models as a means to benchmark modifications to wastewater treatment...|$|E

40|$|A proper soil risk {{assessment}} needs {{to estimate the}} processes that affect the fate and the behaviour of a contaminant, which are influenced by soil biotic and abiotic components. For this reason, the measurement of biomarkers in soil bioindicator organisms, such as earthworms, has recently received increasing attention. In this study, the earthworm Eisenia andrei {{was used to assess}} the pollutant-induced stress syndrome after exposure to sublethal concentrations of Cd (10 or 100 microg g- 1) in OECD soil, after 14 d of exposure. Cadmium bioaccumulation and potential biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde (MDA), phenoloxidase (PO), metallothioneins (MTs) and genotoxic damage were determined. Results suggested that the exposure to 10 and 100 mg g 1 Cd significantly increased Cd bioaccumulation, MTs and MDA; 100 microg g- 1 Cd contamination evidenced significantly higher values of H 2 O 2 content and PO activity; CAT activity was inhibited at the higher concentration while GST and Comet assay did not show any significant differences from the control. Rank-based biomarker index showed that both different contaminated soils had an effect on the earthworms and allowed to validate the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of this battery of biomarkers for a promising integrated multi-marker approach in soil monitoring and assessment...|$|E

40|$|Already {{as a child}} I {{was doing}} {{chemistry}} experiments, probably encouraged by my uncle holding a PhD in chemistry. This enthousiasm never really faded out at high school, causing me to study a Master’s degree in Chemistry at Ghent University. After coming back from my Erasmus period at Bordeaux University, I went to several group leaders of research groups {{in order to find}} an interesting topic for my Master thesis. Prof. Frank Vanhaecke immediately provided me with a clear and useful project in the field of mass spectrometry concerning the detection of metabolites in biological samples. It turned out that the project was so well of quality and guidance that I finished it with a lot of scientific enthousiasm and sincere gratitude. However, when the time arrived to apply for a PhD grant, my research was at a slow pace and somewhere during this period I followed a course from Prof. Laszlo Vincze concerning X-ray analysis using synchrotron radiation facilities.

40|$|The {{management}} of contaminated soils and wastes {{is a matter}} of considerable human concern. The present study evaluates the genotoxic potential of aqueous extracts of two soils (leachates) and of bottom ash resulting from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWIBA percolate), using amphibian larvae (Xenopus laevis). Soil A was contaminated by residues of solvents and metals and Soil B by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals. MSWIBA was predominantly contaminated by metals. Two genotoxic endpoints were analysed in circulating erythrocytes taken from larvae: clastogenic and/or aneugenic effects (micronucleus induction) after 12 days of exposure and DNA-strand-breaking potency (comet assay) after 1 and 12 days of exposure. In addition, in vitro bacterial assays (MutatoxR and Ames tests) were carried out and the results were compared with those of the amphibian test. Physicochemical analyses were also taken into account. Results obtained with the amphibians established the genotoxicity of the aqueous extracts and the comet assay revealed that they were genotoxic from the first day of exposure. The latter test could thus be considered as a genotoxicity-screening tool. Although genotoxicity persisted after 12 days’ exposure, DNA damage decreased overall between days 1 and 12 in the MSWIBA percolate, in contrast to the soil leachates. Bacterial tests detected genotoxicity only for the leachate of soil A (Mutatox). The results confirm the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of the amphibian model and underscore the importance of bioassays, as a complement to physicochemical data, for risk evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Most {{members of}} the large ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) gene family are transporters involved in substrate translocation across biological membranes. In eukaryotes, ABC proteins functioning as drug transporters {{are located in the}} plasma membrane and mediate the cellular efflux {{of a wide range of}} organic chemicals, with some transporters also transporting certain metals. As the enhanced expression of ABC drug transporters can confer multidrug resistance (MDR) to cancers and multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) to organisms from polluted habitats, these ABC family members are also referred to as MDR or MXR proteins. In mammals, ABC drug transporters show predominant expression in tissues involved in excretion or constituting internal or external body boundaries, where they facilitate the excretion of chemicals and their metabolites, and limit chemical uptake and penetration into "sanctuary" sites of the body. Available knowledge about ABC proteins is still limited in teleost fish, a large vertebrate group of high ecological and economic importance. Using transport activity measurements and immunochemical approaches, early studies demonstrated similarities in the tissue distribution of ABC drug transporters between teleosts and mammals, suggesting conserved roles of the transporters in the biochemical defence against toxicants. Recently, the availability of teleost genome assemblies has stimulated studies of the ABC family in this taxon. This review summarises the current knowledge regarding the genetics, functional properties, physiological function, and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of teleostean ABC transporters.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} a sensitive, specific, rapid and {{cost-effective}} assay that can be used as an early warning signal of contamination of aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this work was to develop a sensitive stress-specific microbial bioreporter responsive to pro-oxidants. Furthermore, the bioreporter was designed to be applicable in environments possibly affected by metal processing activities. An E. coli bioreporter was developed containing a plasmid with the katG promoter sequence as the sensing sequence and with mCherry as the reporter protein. The bioreporter responded to metal pro-oxidants (Cd, As, Zn, Pb, Ag and Ag nanoparticles). A new assay growth-medium was developed and contributed to improve the sensitivity of our assay that has the best detection limit to inorganic pro-oxidants compared to other oxidative-stress sensitive bioreporters in the literature. The bioreporter detected pro-oxidants in environmental samples. The assay has a reasonable sensitivity, however, it still lacks sensitivity to detect pro-oxidants at concentrations lower than those shown to be toxic to many aquatic species. Within-lab reproducibility and robustness were determined to be acceptable. For stress-specific bioreporters to be incorporated in regulative legislations and industrial monitoring programs there {{is a need}} to improve the sensitivity of these assays, they need to be calibrated with other relevant pro-oxidants, inter-lab reproducibility needs to be established and robustness to environmental samples needs to be further tested.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of a new ecotoxicological test system which allows the assessment of the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of contaminants in environmental relevant concentrations for e. g. cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polyhalogenated biphenyle, steroids, herbizids and pharmaceutics. As the screening system quantification of xenobiotically induced gene expression was performed using two different types of DNA-Arrays. The soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was selected as the test organism, because it has been used successfully in ecotoxicological tests in the last decades and its whole genome is sequenced. For the gene expression screen phase I and II genes of the biotransformation system were the favoured genes. In addition further genes with a high xenobiotic specific induction potential (e. g. coding for heat shock proteins or vitellogenins) were selected. The selection of these xenobiotic inducible genes based on whole genome C. elegans DNA-Microarray experiments. The evaluation of the data of these experiments revealed 64 genes as inducible through the applied xenobiotics &# 946;-Naphthoflavone, Atrazine, Clofibrate, Diethylstilbestrol and Fluoranthene. After the selection of relevant genes, a matching gene fragment for each gene was produced by PCR. The quality and quantity of the fragments was checked, the fragments were purified and afterwards spotted as a low densitiy DNA array. The so called Celegans Toxchip is a new system to investigate the gene expression of several xenobiotic inducible genes in one experiment. The Celegans Toxchip hybridisation experiments were performed with &# 946;-Naphthoflavone, Atrazine, Endosulfan, Fluoranthene, Clofibrate, Diethylstilbestrol and Tributyltinchlorid The experiments for the used xenobiotics revealed an induction of 33 genes of total 66 genes on the Celegans Toxchip. From the induced genes belong 11 to the CYP gene family. Five genes are coding for vitellogenines, each three for UDP-Glucoronosyltransferases, heatshock proteins, carboxylesterases and two for glutathione S-transferases. Further five genes, the cytochrom b 5 gene vem- 1, the gene col- 38 coding for collagene, the gene mtl- 1 coding for metallothionine and the two genes C 29 F 7. 2 and F 58 H 1. 2, coding for proteins with unknown function were as well induced through the applied xenobiotics. The sensitivity of this new ecotoxicological testsystem was up to 200 times higher as a reproduction test in liquid medium. The results of this study show very clear that the xenobiotically induced gene expression of the nematode C. elegans is a very sensitive new endpoint for the detection of biological active substances in the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{ban on the}} use of {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFC's), {{the amendment}} of the second ordinance of the federal immissions control act and as well the general public's concern about the dangers of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents has initiated an intensive search for substitutes suitable for all use categories. The substitutes are mainly hydrocarbon solvents (HCS) which are defined as aliphatic (n- and iso-paraffins) and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons with a chainlength between 9 and 13, a boiling range of 180 to 220 C and a flashpoint above 55 C. These substances are hazardous not only because of their inflammability but also because of the poor knowledge about their longterm toxicologic properties. For these reasons a hearing on the health related assessment has been conducted by the Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veterinary Medicine (BgVV) and the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA). Estimates are that the total production and marketing of HCS ranges between 260 - 450 000 t/a. However, there is no information concerning the amount of HCS used in the different use categories. HCS' generated vapours can lead to explosive mixtures with air. Safety margins are poorly comparable {{because of the lack of}} standardized techniques to determine this physicochemical property. The toxicological relevance of additives like cleaning enhancers, stabilizers, viscosity adjusters and anticorrosives is not clear. The main route of emissions for HCS is the air. The knowledge about the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> is poor as well. The need for further research activities is deducted. Concerning the human exposure, a satisfactory amount of measurements are available only for the workplace in dry cleaning facilities. The burden in the housing area is much lower (values are given here up to 100 #mu#g/m" 3 [90 %]). The acute toxicity via the oral, inhalative or dermal pathway seems to be low. For rats, there is evidence for isoparaffins to have nephrotoxic as well as neurotoxic effects. Further studies on the longterm toxicology or on the carcinogenicity of the HCS were not reported. Gentoxic effects could not be deducted, although there is concern for the tumor promoting activity of HCS. Lamp oils are clearly hazardous for children.

40|$|Predation is {{considered}} to significantly alter dynamics and diversity of aquatic communities. The current thesis was therefore aimed at assessing mechanisms behind the predation by the backswimmer Notonecta maculata {{in the context of}} ecology, ethology and physiology. Moreover, a foraging model was developed, parameterized and evaluated on the basis of individual foraging behaviour, for application in ecology and ecotoxicology. An iterative process of model development thereby provided insights into several research questions. In a first step the ecological and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of backswimmer predation was examined. Therefore, population dynamics of Daphnia magna was observed under predation pressure, xenobiotic stress and a combination of both predation and chemical disturbance. The experiment revealed that size selective predation of the backswimmers did alter population demography, which in turn led to higher vulnerability of D. magna population to toxic stress. The results mentioned above have raised the question to what extend the functional response and size selectivity of juvenile backswimmers changes with predator instar. Therefore, ecological parameters that were considered influential in prey selection were quantified experimentally and subsequently led to the parameterization of an individuals model to be used for the prediction of predation rates. Testing the model against independent data revealed that prey selection in backswimmer might not be determined by active preference, but by passive selectivity mediated by variations in the components of predation. Application of the model revealed that predation rates in juvenile backswimmers are reduced under dark conditions compared to light. These differences are accounted for by the presence/absence of light and are not regulated by any endogenous circadian rhythm. Behavioural observations led to the conclusion that in the dark backswimmers probably detect prey items at a shorter distance as compared to light and that the resulting reduction in the encounter rate is compensated by gaining a higher amount of food per item during a lengthier, more thorough handling of the prey. Comparing model output to independent functional response data did support this hypothesis. In order to account for variations in food availability, and thus allow for long term prediction of predation rates, the model was extended by a physiological component. Therefore, behavioural observations on the components of predations were correlated with gut state of the predator. Moreover, the empirical results showed that food-deprived backswimmers attack their prey more frequently and that they extract more biomass from a single prey item than their well-fed conspecifics do. Model application provided further evidence for compensatory feeding under variable environmental conditions. In the current study, proximate factors in the foraging behaviour were identified and implemented in a simulation model. The model developed here is able to adequately predict size selectivity and long term predation rates of juvenile backswimmers under laboratory conditions. A major future task will be the generalization of mechanistic rules that will allow predictions for a broad range of species...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. POPs are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} that have been extensively studied {{over the last few}} years. The main reason that these chemicals have received so much scientific attention is the myriad of negative effects they have on the environment and human health. The properties that cause the deleterious effects include a high molecular stability, rendering them highly persistent. Added to this is the lipophilic and hydrophobic nature of the compounds. POPs will thus tend to bio-accumulate and bio-magnify in the environment, causing a direct threat to humans and wildlife. To address this threat, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, under the supervision of United Nations Environment programme (UNEP), was initiated and became legally binding on 17 May 2004. All countries, including South Africa, which ratified this agreement, will be expected to monitor and regulate the formation of POPs. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are all members of the dioxin-like family of POPs. This family of chemicals pose serious health threats such as carcinogenic effects and negative effects on reproduction. These substances, with the exception of PCBs, are formed unintentionally as by-products of industrial and thermal processes. One of the main sources of dioxin-like chemicals is medical waste incinerators. In this project the area surrounding a medical waste incinerator was monitored using a bio-assay technique. The determination of dioxin concentrations is usually preformed by chemical analysis, however, bio-assays have proven themselves to be a cheaper and time-saving screening method. The Toxic Equivalency Quotient (TEQs) determined through bio-assays can support chemical analysis in determining biologically-relevant risk assessments since bio-assay data has <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance.</b> These assays represent an integrated biological response to chemical pollutants, where biological effects are accounted for which is not possible in chemical analyses. One of the bio-assays used in the determination of the dioxin-like chemical TEQ is the H 411 E reporter gene bio-assay. This assay is based on the Ah-receptor mediated toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals. Using this technique the TEQs for areas surrounding an active incinerator were determined, to indicate the distribution of these substances. The TEQs for the soil samples collected ranged between nondetectable and 154 ngTEQ/kg. There was no clear distributional pattern and the total organic carbon content in the soil did not seem to {{play a crucial role in}} the distribution of dioxin-like chemicals. Although a decrease in soil tillage showed a corresponding increase in TEQ. The predominant wind direction was taken into account but no correlation could be seen. However, meteorological parameters such as the ambient temperature and low precipitation in the area may have contributed to lower TEQ values. Cytotoxicity excluded data points and the phenomenon has to be addressed. High TEQ values in a residential area where free-range chickens are raised pose a serious concern to the level of dietary dioxin-like chemical intake. Eggs in the area could theoretically contain between 2. 75 and 28. 75 pgTEQ/g egg fat. Further studies are needed to determine how much dioxin-like chemicals are being transferred to humans through the consumption of free-range eggsMaster...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{consensus}} within the scientific community that sediments act as a long term sink {{for a variety of}} organic and inorganic pollutants which, however, can re-enter the water column upon resuspension of deposited material under certain hydraulic conditions such as flood events. In the last years, interdisciplinary research has become increasingly important in response to new challenges related to the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). This directive commits European Union member states to achieve a good ecological and chemical status in European river catchments. Furthermore, the importance of sediments as a secondary long-term source for pollutants and, hence, as an important factor for water quality has been integrated into the WFD. Within the implementation of the WFD, {{it is important to understand}} the potential short and long term impact of suspended particulate matter (SPM) -associated contaminants on aquatic organisms as well as the related uptake mechanisms for a sound risk assessment. Increasingly frequent flood events usually cause remobilization of contaminated sediment layers in rivers and, thus, are of high relevance for a sound understanding of associated ecotoxicological impacts. The Floodsearch project framework, performed in close collaboration between the Institute for Environmental Research and the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management (both RWTH Aachen University), aimed to establish a novel approach combining methods of hydrodynamic engineering and ecotoxicological assessment to enable the investigation of the potential risks associated with such remobilization events. This new approach, developed by an interdisciplinary team was entitled the hydrotoxicological approach by Cofalla (2015). It can be used as a tool with practical relevance to investigate and assess contaminated sediments and their influence on aquatic organisms upon resuspension. The present PhD thesis consisting of three individual studies aims at the evaluation of the hydrotoxicological approach and has a focus on the ecotoxicological aspects without neglecting the engineering side. In the first proof-of-concept study, hydraulic engineering and ecotoxicology were combined in a new interdisciplinary approach to assess the toxicity of resuspended polluted sediments after a simulated flood event. Specifically, the objective of this study was to bridge the gap between the physical resuspension of pollutants and resulting toxicological impacts on aquatic organisms. Formulated sediment was prepared according to OECD guideline 218 and spiked with a mixture of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to resuspended sediments. A suite of different molecular, biochemical and histological markers was used to verify the hypothesis that resuspension of sediments can lead to the remobilization of PAHs and subsequently to effects in aquatic organisms. The experiments were carried out in an annular flume designed to investigate the transport behavior of fine-grained sediments. Several physicochemical and sedimentological parameters as well as exposure concentrations of contaminants were measured to characterize environmental conditions and erosion behavior of sediments. During the elaboration of a biomarker battery comprising biomarkers with suitable endpoints, rainbow trout proved to be a suitable test species (a) being easy to rear, (b) being sufficiently robust for exposure experiments and (c) providing sufficient amounts of sample material for bioassays and chemical analysis. The micronucleus frequency was significantly 4. 3 -fold elevated after exposure and biliary metabolite concentration was shown to be the most sensitive marker of PAH exposure. The original setup of the annular flume was successfully modified including a flow-through cooling unit and an aeration system to maintain suitable and stable environmental conditions for the test animals. Flood events were successfully simulated, resulting in the resuspension of formulated sediment, and different erosion behaviors of sediments during the simulated flood events were observed and could be characterized. This proof-of-concept study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of a combined hydrotoxicological approach in support of the investigation of the potential <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>relevance</b> of sediment resuspension events and showed that sediment remobilization during short simulated flood events in the annular flume can lead to uptake and effects of sediment-bound pollutants in rainbow trout. In the second study, preliminary tests were carried out in resuspension containers to provide a broader knowledge base for subsequent experiments in the annular flume. The main purpose of those experiments were (a) the assessment of the dissipation of PAHs from sediment/water systems and of the subsequent differences between desorption and bioavailability of spiked contaminants, and its implications for the following experiments in the annular flume, (b) kinetic monitoring of the chosen biomarkers to provide detailed insights in their dynamics as a function of extended exposure to suspended matter and (c) the assessment of a combination of chemical exposure and another environmental stressor, temperature, in aquatic biota. Due to recent changes in climate, temperatures of German rivers frequently exceed 25 °C during summer. Effects of resuspension of sediments on biota under elevated temperature regimes are likely to differ from those under lower temperature regimes. To elucidate this differential response of aquatic vertebrates, rainbow trout were exposed to suspensions of sediment from the Rhine River that was spiked with a mixture of PAH. The experiments were conducted under two different temperature regimes (24 °C or 12 °C) and physicochemical parameters, including concentration of PAHs in SPM, and biomarkers in fish such as biliary PAH metabolites were measured over the course of a 12 d study. Concentrations of pyrene and phenanthrene decreased over time, while no decrease was observed for chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene. The biomarker cascades, more specifically the temporal dynamics of biomarker reactions, did not only show quantitative differences (i. e. different induction intensity or rate of biomarker responses) at the two temperatures but also qualitative differences, i. e. different biomarker responses were observed. In bile of fish exposed to PAHs spiked sediment, concentrations of 1 -hydroxypyrene and 1 -hydroxyphenanthrene increased significantly during the first two days, and then decreased. At 12 °C, the uptake of PAHs was slower and maximum metabolite concentrations in bile were lower than in fish exposed at 24 °C. Following a latency of two days, the concentration of PAH metabolites in bile of fish exposed at 24 °C was followed by a peak in lipid peroxidation. PAHs spiked into sediments under laboratory conditions were significantly more bioavailable than the PAHs that were already present in un-spiked field-collected sediments. In the final study described in this thesis, findings from both preceding studies were joined to refine the hydrotoxicological approach and to re-evaluate the new interdisciplinary method. To elucidate the effects of sediment-bound organic pollutants, such as PAHs, rainbow trout were exposed to three resuspended natural sediments with different contamination levels. Physicochemical parameters including dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and temperature, total PAH concentration in sediments and SPM as well as different biomarkers of exposure in fish such as 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and biliary PAH metabolites were measured following 7 d exposure within an annular flume. Concentrations of PAHs in SPM remained constant and represented the different contamination level in the un-suspended sediments. Significant differences in bile metabolite concentrations as well as in EROD induction compared to control experiments (untreated animals and animals that were exposed in the annular flume without sediment) were observed for all exposure scenarios. The ratio between 1 hydroxypyrene in bile from fish exposed to the three different contamination levels was 1. 0 : 3. 6 : 10. 7 and correlated well with (1) the ratio of pyrene concentrations in corresponding sediments which was 1. 0 : 3. 1 : 12. 7 and (2) with the ratio of particle-bound pyrene in SPM which was 1. 0 : 2. 7 : 11. 7. In contrast, hepatic lipid peroxidation and micronuclei formation represented the different contamination levels less conclusively. The results of this study clearly demonstrated that firmly-bound PAH from aged sediments can become bioaccessible upon resuspension under flood-like conditions and are readily absorbed by aquatic organisms such as rainbow trout. Associated short term effects were clearly documented and possible adverse long-term impacts due to genotoxicity are likely to follow. The present thesis demonstrates that the interdisciplinary approach created an innovative research tool to assess the hydrotoxicological relevance of contaminated sediments after resuspension events. However, there are certain drawbacks and limitations of this innovative approach such as the influence of larger animals on erosion characteristics within the annular flume and the dependency on vertebrate test animals. In a next step and with future method optimizations, however, those shortcomings can be resolved and the hydrotoxicological approach can be used to the full extent as a tool with practical relevance to investigate and assess contaminated sediments and their influence on aquatic organisms upon resuspension...|$|E
