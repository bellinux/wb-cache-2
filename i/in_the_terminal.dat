5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater {{public access to}} the acropolis; as the threat of warfare grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} of the city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic {{appears to have been}} violent, with evidence of a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|During the Terminal Classic, El Chal {{maintained}} its primary {{place in the}} San Juan valley. This is evidenced by major building activity in the site core where the massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by the erection of new monuments to accompany the already existing Late Classic monuments. The continued importance of El Chal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic resulted in other centres in the region being eclipsed, such as El Edén and El Tigrillo {{to the west and}} Copoja, La Puente and El Ocote to the southeast. During the Terminal Classic, El Chal developed its own ceramic production industry.|$|E

5|$|Excavations in {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} at least two superimposed platforms built with finely dressed stone blocks and covered with good quality stucco flooring. At a later date the platforms and courtyard were covered with unworked stones bound with mortar and covered with another stucco floor. The two platforms were built in the Late Classic and appear to have been covered over <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic.|$|E
5|$|Grønlandsfly also {{purchased}} {{its first}} jet aircraft, a Boeing 757–200 which began operation in May 1998. The airliner was named Kunuunnguaq {{in honour of}} the Greenlandic explorer and ethnologist Knud Rasmussen, whose bust decorates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> of Kangerlussuaq hub. The airliner allowed the company to run the profitable Kangerlussuaq–Copenhagen route directly, without affiliates or a layover in Iceland. Thus, in 1999, the airline served 282,000 passengers, nearly triple the number {{at the end of}} the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the West Group have {{revealed}} an occupation {{beginning in the}} Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic. The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior {{to those of the}} acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex. The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported perishable superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.|$|E

5|$|One of London's {{international}} airports, Gatwick Airport, {{was moved}} into the Borough of Crawley in 1974. A year earlier, a multi-faith chaplaincy had been established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> building (now the South Terminal). The chaplaincy is coordinated by the Anglican minister, whose licence was renewed in November 2008. Roman Catholic and Free Church ministers are also on site. When the North Terminal was built, a similar chapel was provided there. Both chapels are open at all times for prayer and meditation, and offer regular services throughout the week.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5C-45 is {{the east}} {{range of a}} palace complex that also {{incorporates}} 5C-46 (the south range) and 5C-47 (the west range). This structure was remodelled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic with the closing of some doorways, addition of some benches {{and the construction of}} new sections with multiple doorways. Although Tikal was completely abandoned soon afterwards, this continuation in complex construction activity indicated that the elite residents were still inhabiting the palace at this time.|$|E

5|$|The MSC Railway {{was able}} to receive and {{despatch}} goods trains to and from all the UK's main line railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> docks. Two were {{to the north of}} the canal, operated by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway. The third was to the south, operated by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), where by the MSC Railway had taken over the old and abandoned route of the CLC, giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Toniná {{continued}} after most other Classic Maya cities had fallen, perhaps {{aided by the}} site's relative isolation.

5|$|The most {{important}} role of molybdenum in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes. In bacterial nitrogen fixation, the nitrogenase enzyme involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> step of reducing molecular nitrogen usually contains molybdenum in the active site (though replacement of molybdenum with iron or vanadium is also known). The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme {{is similar to that}} in iron-sulfur proteins: it incorporates a Fe4S3 and multiple MoFe3S3 clusters.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic {{there appears}} to have been greater public access to the acropolis, with {{stairways}} communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range. During the Terminal Classic, these stairways were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself, with some buildings being sealed completely. This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time. The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city's elite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic, a time when most of the city centre was also deserted by its residents. Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis, this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.|$|E

40|$|The {{induction}} of tyrosine hydroxylase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nerve <b>terminals</b> of <b>the</b> rat heart by reserpine {{lags behind}} that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stellate ganglion by {{two to three}} days.

The increase of enzyme activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sciatic nerve after reserpine administration resembles that found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart nerve <b>terminals.</b> Determination of enzyme activity in segments of sciatic nerves indicates a two-day lag and then a proximal-distal transport of enzyme, but the apparent rate {{is not sufficient to}} account for <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> enzyme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nerve <b>terminals.</b> These findings are compatible with the local synthesis of induced tyrosine hydroxylase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nerve <b>terminals</b> rather than <b>the</b> peripheral movement of the completed enzyme...|$|R

5|$|That a large {{population}} remained in residence in the north sector of Mundo Perdido during the Terminal Classic {{is evidenced by the}} quantity of burials of differing gender and age. Some were interred inside collapsed buildings or in casual graves. They were usually accompanied by very few funerary offerings, generally bone and lithic artefacts. The dense occupation of the north sector, which included elite activity, continued for at least a hundred years after the abandonment of the rest of Tikal and is perhaps linked to the nearby water supply and to continued ritual activity at Temple III. While the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido continued in use, the rest of the complex was partially abandoned. The occupation of the Mundo Perdido came to an end <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic and very few traces of Postclassic activity have been recovered, limited to a few ceramic finds in Structure 3D-43 to the north.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela that was found inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E
