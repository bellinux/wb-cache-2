This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Dr. Miettinen {{has called for}} a debate on his ideas about the single <b>etiologic</b> <b>study</b> and the use of trial data for the construction of smooth-in-time risk prediction functions [1]. He did so admittedly as an attempt to influence the possible achievement of a paradigm shift. Dr. Miettinen is one of the founding fathers of modern epidemiology. Many of the concepts and terms he has introduced have found their way into current epidemiological thinking and discourse, respectively. Why has the same not yet happened with his ideas on the single <b>etiologic</b> <b>study</b> and with the significance of this new paradigm for intervention-prognostic research? Dr. Miettinen wonders and so do presumably many of those who have made a serious effort to study his writings. Although the roots of the single <b>etiologic</b> <b>study</b> {{can be traced back to}} Miettinen’s 1985 book [2], the formal concept is a bit more recent than the other concepts that are already accepted in epidemiology. So is it simply a matter of time? It might well be, but Dr. Miettinen’s concern is to change the’prognostic profile’ by opening a debate, which is fair enough and offers an exciting prospect. Remarkably, Pearl, a founder of modern causal theories with wide potential for implementation notably theories and methods of structural causal modelling, recently noted a similar difficulty in getting th...|$|E

40|$|Background: Several {{previous}} studies have documented region or country-specific liver cancer incidence trends around the world. However, no study has systematically examined the international pattern using the most recently updated incidence data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Methods:We examined recent trends in liver cancer incidence rates from 1993 to 2002 by joinpoint analysis for 32 cancer registries worldwide, using Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. We also examined the male to female rate ratios for these and four additional registries, based on the 1998 – 2002 incidence data. Results: Liver cancer incidence rates for bothmen andwomen statistically significantly increased from 1993 to 2002 for 8 of 32 cancer registries considered in the analysis. Increases were largely confined to economically developed countries ofWestern Europe, NorthAmerica, andOceania. In contrast, rates decreased in bothmen and women in 5 registries including 3 in Asia. Despite this, the incidence rates in Asian countries are {{twice as high as}} those in Africa and more than four times as high as rates in North America. Male to female rate ratios varied from 0. 9 in sub-Saharan African and South American registries to 5. 0 in France and Egypt. Conclusions: Liver cancer incidence rates continue to increase in some low-risk parts of the world whereas they are decreasing in some of the highest risk countries in Asia. <b>Etiologic</b> <b>studies</b> are required to further elucidate factors contributing to the divergent liver cancer incidence trends worldwide.

Design: A special multicenter study of sarcoidosis (A Case Control <b>Etiologic</b> <b>Study</b> of Sarcoidosis), supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Patients and control subjects: Patients and control subjects were recruited at 10 institutions in the United States. Control subjects (controls) were of the same gender and race, and within 5 years of age as matching patients with sarcoidosis (cases). Results: Cultures were incubated from 347 blood specimens (197 cases, 150 controls). Two investigators trained to recognize CWDF mycobacteria examined material obtained from culture tubes after 3 weeks.

40|$|The matched {{trend test}} (MTT), {{developed}} using a conditional logistic regression, {{has been proposed}} to test for association in matched case-control studies to control the bias of known confounding effects and reduce {{the potential impact of}} population stratification. The MTT requires a known genetic model. When the genetic model is unknown, a Monte Carlo robust test, MAX, has been proposed for the analysis of matched case-control studies. The MAX statistic takes the maximum of three MTTs optimal for three common genetic models. We derive the asymptotic power for MTTs and robust tests. In particular, we derive the asymptotic p-value for MAX. Using these analytical results, we conduct simulation studies to compare the performance of MAX and the two-degree-of-freedom Chi-square test for matched case-control studies, where the latter is implemented in most computing software. Our simulation results show that MAX is always asymptotically more powerful than the two-degree-of-freedom Chi-square test under common genetic models.

Family studies indicate that genes {{play a role in}} the etiology and extent of organ involvement in sarcoidosis.

40|$|To set a {{diagnosis}} {{in a patient}} {{is one of the}} key challenges in medical practice and forms the basis for clinical care. Diagnosis is not an aim in itself but is relevant in as far as it directs treatment and indicates the prognosis of the patient. Diagnosis amounts to an estimation of the probability of the presence of a particular disease in view of all diagnostic information (patient history, physical examination and test results) in order to decide whether treatment should be initiated or not. A diagnosis is rarely based on one single variable or test and therefore is a multivariable concern per se. However, most diagnostic studies or studies in which diagnostic tests are evaluated still follow a univariable approach. This means that a diagnostic test is evaluated in isolation without explicit regard to the clinical context in which the test is applied.

40|$|Introduction: The most {{frequent}} causes of acute pancreatitis are biliary stones, alcohol consumption, smoking and tumors. Some {{of them do}} not have any established cause, and they are catalogued as idiopathic pancreatitis. Case report: We report the case of a 56 -year-old woman with a history of bilateral adrenalectomy on hormone replacement therapy with corticosteroids, who has recurrent episodes of mild acute pancreatitis with an <b>etiologic</b> <b>study</b> (laboratory and imaging tests) without significant findings. A drug-induced etiology was suspected, so corticosteroids were removed and antihypertensive treatment was modified, but the clinical manifestations persisted. Later regular consumption of horsetail infusions was detected, and after their suspension the patient became asymptomatic and has not presented new episodes. Discussion: The drug-induced acute pancreatitis is a strange cause of pancreatitis that is frequently underdiagnosed because of the difficulty to establish a relationship between the drugs and the pancreatitis. Lots of drugs have been related with acute pancreatitis, while the information available for herbal products is limited. They usually present like mild and recurrent episodes, without significant findings in both laboratory and imaging tests (abdominal ultrasound, abdominal computed tomography [CT], cholangiography and endoscopic ultrasound).

Studying limb anomalies provides insights into limb development which may be useful for <b>etiologic</b> <b>studies</b> and public health monitoring. We pooled our data for 12 limb anomaly cases presenting from January 2008 to May 2009 and investigated their associated conditions. A descriptive system for the nomenclature and classification of congenital limb malformations suitable for clinical, epidemiological, and experimental use is discussed.

40|$|Among paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) {{associated}} with malignant hemopathies, {{there are few}} reports of PNS of {{the central nervous system}} {{and most of them are}} {{associated with}} lymphomas. Limbic encephalitis is a rare neurological syndrome classically diagnosed in the context of PNS. We report the case of a 81 -year-old man who presented with a relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with minimal maturation. He was admitted for confusion with unfavorable evolution as he presented a rapidly progressive dementia resulting in death. A brain magnetic resonance imaging, performed 2 months after the onset, was considered normal. An electroencephalogram showed non-specific bilateral slow waves. We received the results of the blood screening of neuronal autoantibodies after the patient's death and detected the presence of anti-voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies at 102 pmol/l (normal at < 30 pmol/l). Other <b>etiologic</b> <b>studies,</b> including the screening for another cause of rapidly progressive dementia, were negative. To our knowledge, this is the first case of anti-VGKC paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis related to AML...|$|R
40|$|Although limb defects {{associated}} with other congenital anomalies are rarely studied, they may provide insights into limb development {{that may be}} useful for <b>etiologic</b> <b>studies</b> and public health monitoring, me pooled data from II birth defect registries {{that are part of}} the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Monitoring Systems. We identified 666 infants, born from 1983 through 1993, who had a non-syndromal limb defect plus at least one other major malformation (rate 12. 9 / 100, 000 population). We used observed/expected ratios and log-linear models to detect association patterns. We found that specific limb defects occurred with relatively distinct sets of malformations. Preaxial limb defects occurred more frequently with microtia, esophageal atresia, anorectal atresia, heart defects, unilateral kidney dysgenesis, and some axial skeleton defects; postaxial defects with hypospadias; transverse defects with craniofacial defects, micrognathia, ring constrictions, and muscular defects; intercalary defects with omphalocele; split hand/foot with encephalocele; and amelia with anorectal atresia, omphalocele, severe genitalia defects, unilateral kidney dysgenesis, gastroschisis, and ring constriction. Log-linear modeling identified higher order associations among some of these same malformations. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
