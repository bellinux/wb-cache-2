40|$|In the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization {{time-of-flight}} {{mass spectrometry}} (MALDI TOF MS) analysis of various compounds synthesized in our laboratory, strong [M - H]+ ion peaks were often observed for the molecules with tertiary amino groups. In this work, the MALDI TOF MS behavior of {{two groups of}} compounds that incorporate tertiary amino moieties was investigated. One group is bisurea <b>dimethylanilines</b> (BUDMAs) prepared {{for the study of}} molecular recognition in thermoplastic elastomers, and the other group is the poly(propylene imine) diaminobutane dendrimers. The results clearly demonstrate the appearance of the [M - H]+ ions. In order to understand the possible mechanisms for the generation of these ions, a series of model compounds, ranging from primary to tertiary amines, were investigated. Unlike the tertiary amines, no [M - H]+ ion peaks were recorded for the primary amines, and only barely detectable ones, if any, for some secondary amines. It appears that the tertiary amino groups {{play an important role in}} the formation of these ions. In addition to MALDI TOF MS analysis, these samples were also applied to electrospray ionization (ESI) MS where no [M - H] + ions were observed. The results indicate that the generation of [M - H]+ ion is due to the unique MALDI conditions and is likely to be formed via dehydrogenation of a protonated tertiary amine resulting in an N=C double bond. The absence of [M - H]+ ion peaks for the primary and secondary amines is probably because upon their formation these ions could easily transfer one proton to the corresponding amines in the MALDI gas-phase plume, yielding neutral imines that cannot be detected by MS.

40|$|Alkyl-substituted anilines {{have been}} implicated as {{important}} etiological agents in human carcinogenesis. Specifically, 2, 6 -dimethylaniline (2, 6 -DMA), 3, 5 -dimethylaniline (3, 5 -DMA), and 3 -ethylaniline (3 EA) {{have been associated}} with an increased risk of human bladder cancer, independent of cigarette smoking, in a published case-control study. Understanding the metabolic activation of and DNA adduct formation by these chemicals is an important first step in elucidating their mechanisms of carcinogenesis and toxicity. Cytochrome P 450 -mediated metabolism was profiled based on the hypothesis that N-hydroxylated metabolites are critical intermediates in the formation of DNA adducts. This work was extended to assess in vitro DNA adduct formation with the cell-free and cell-based assays. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) was used for detection and semi-quantification of DNA adducts formed by 14 C-labeled alkylanilines. Data indicated 3, 5 -DMA formed high levels of DNA adducts, suggesting that it is a potent carcinogen. Additionally, the levels of adducts exhibited inter-species variation. The effects of phase II metabolism on adduct formation were evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the two types of assays and by assessing the effects of phase II enzyme cofactors on the results of cell-free assay. (cont.) Results implied that sulfotransferase-mediated metabolism promotes cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of all three alkylanilines; however, glucuronidation may provide a protective mechanism. The effects of N-acetyltransferase-mediated metabolism on DNA adduct formation differed for the three alkylanilines; acetyl-CoA enhanced adduct formation by 3 -EA and 2, 6 -DMA, but it reduced 3, 5 -DMA adduct formation. Human CYP 2 A 6 universally catalyzed the oxidation of all structural isomers of <b>dimethylanilines</b> and ethylanilines, except 3 -EA. In the present work, the hypothesis that 3 -EA is a mechanism-based inactivator toward human P 450 2 A 6 through covalent binding was examined by using AMS. 3 -EA was characterized as a mechanism-based inactivator with a Ki of 34 !iM and a kinact of 0. 055 min'. Results suggest that 3 -EA might be involved in more than one biological effect in the human body through multiple pathways. Adduct formation and inhibition of CYP 2 A 6 by 3 -EA might shift the biological effects of other compounds activated by CYP 2 A 6 dynamically and kinetically while appearing in the biological systems simultaneously. by Hsiao-Lan Patty Sun.
