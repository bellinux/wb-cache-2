5|$|Normally shy or <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the {{presence}} of divers, the Caribbean reef shark {{has been known to}} become aggressive in {{the presence}} of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 27 attacks attributable to this species, 4 of them unprovoked, and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|The Kombo Moyana series {{refers to}} a series of {{banknotes}} which carried Kombo Moyana's signature after being appointed governor of the Reserve Bank from 1983 to August 1993. The series bears the new name of Zimbabwe's capital (Harare) and is <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the last two series except for the date and signature.|$|E

5|$|An {{alliance}} between Przemysł II and Henry IV placed Bolesław the Pious {{in a very}} uncomfortable situation, because he {{being a member of}} Pro-Hungarian coalition of Polish princes (in addition to him, it included Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black and Konrad II of Masovia) could not remain <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> this close cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, which was the leader of the Pro-bohemian coalition (where other Silesian princes also belonged).|$|E
5|$|Dundas {{subsequently}} {{became a}} journalist for the Yorkshire Post and its editorial staff. Another {{who worked on}} the paper at the time, Richard Pape, recalled him as a man <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> his personal appearance, who wore frayed trousers, frequently had ink-stained hands and would spill beer over himself when drinking, yet who was also popular with the newspaper's younger, female staff members.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} palace, three {{servants}} and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E

5|$|Olaf died in 1006, and Olaf's widow Thorgerd {{subsequently}} {{directed a}} number of revenge-killings herself, including that of Thorkel, {{a man who had}} witnessed Kjartan's death but been <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> it and had not intervened. Bolli was killed by Olaf's sons and their allies in a raid led by Thorgerd. Some twelve years later, Gudrun, {{with the help of her}} friend Snorri Goði, had {{a number of}} Bolli's murderers killed in revenge.|$|E
5|$|The New Testament {{gives no}} {{description}} of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death—it is generally <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> racial appearances and does not refer to {{the features of the}} people it mentions. Jesus probably looked like a typical Jew of his time and according to some scholars was likely to have had a sinewy appearance due to his ascetic and itinerant lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The bill's {{appearance}} {{is important in}} the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company. The The New York Dramatic Mirror found it to have good acting which could still be more expressive, but was more <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the use of unnecessary connecting scenes. The Moving Picture World stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberation of}} Belgium begun in September 1944 as Allied forces moved eastwards. Brussels was liberated on 3 September. On 8 September, Pierlot and the {{government}} in exile arrived in the city by aeroplane. The return of the government was met with general indifference by the population, which felt the government had been <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> {{the plight of the}} population during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
6000|$|Townshead {{shook his}} head as though he were tired of the subject. [...] "No," [...] he said resignedly. [...] "I have too much regard for my very <b>indifferent</b> health <b>to</b> worry unnecessarily." ...|$|R

5|$|Although largely <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> awards, Gielgud had {{the rare}} {{distinction}} of winning an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He was famous {{from the start}} of his career for his voice and his mastery of Shakespearean verse. He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare's. Among his honours, he was knighted in 1953 and the Gielgud Theatre was named after him. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the presence of humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to {{a dozen or more}} birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
60|$|The {{man turned}} on his heel and walked off to a {{neighbouring}} public-house, leaving the small boy to follow or not as he pleased, and apparently quite <b>indifferent</b> as <b>to</b> what his decision might be.|$|R
50|$|Leicester City {{were hoping}} to make an {{immediate}} return to the FA Premier League following relegation the previous season, but {{got off to a}} poor <b>to</b> <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> the season, seeing them drawing too many games and prompting Micky Adams to resign in October despite claims by the club that they wanted him to continue. He was replaced by Hearts' Craig Levein, but he couldn't inspire Leicester to improve and the club finished the season in a disappointing 15th place.|$|R
50|$|Gertrude, a peripatetic nun, only {{accessible}} on {{the telephone}} at her own convenience. She grants prosaic and <b>indifferent</b> advice <b>to</b> the inner circle and has an apparently godlike awareness of what is said in her absence.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{military}} background, Andronikos failed {{to deal with}} Isaac Komnenos, Béla III of Hungary (r. 1172–1196) who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and Stephen Nemanja of Serbia (r. 1166–1196) who declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to William II of Sicily's (r. 1166–1189) invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185. Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, {{but other than that}} he was <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the populace. He was finally overthrown when Isaac Angelos, surviving an imperial assassination attempt, seized power with the aid of the people and had Andronikos killed.|$|E
5|$|Inclined {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with the Habsburgs (and even give up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). <b>Indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> the yōkais presence, and fail to see them as they go about their lives.|$|E
