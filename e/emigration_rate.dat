25|$|Romania has a {{universal}} health care system, and total health expenditures by the government are roughly 5% of the GDP.

The state is obliged to fund public hospitals and clinics. The most common causes of death are cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Transmissible diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis or viral hepatitis, are quite common by European standards. In 2010, Romania had 428 state and 25 private hospitals, with 6.2 hospital beds per 1,000 people, and over 200,000 medical staff, including over 52,000 doctors. , the <b>emigration</b> <b>rate</b> of doctors was 9%, higher than the European average of 2.5%.|$|E

40|$|During {{the winter}} of 2003 / 04, we studied <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> of teal Anas crecca in two major wetlands: the Camargue (southern France) and the Loire estuary (western France). We derived local {{survival}} probabilities as a step in ultimately estimating <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> from individual mark-resighting (visual recaptures) history of birds fitted with nasal saddles. In goodness-of-fit tests of time-dependent models for local survival, we only detected the presence of transients among young females in the Loire estuary, which indicated that this category of individuals includes an ‘unstable compartment’ continuing its migratory journey further to the south. We observed low monthly local survival and high <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> (range: 0. 01 - 0. 81) in both areas, which suggests high turnover rates. In the Loire estuary, temporal changes in <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> matched the post- and pre-nuptial migration peaks (i. e. October-November and February-March). By combining local survival probabilities and count data, we derived {{an estimate of the}} ratio between the winter peak count of teals in our study areas and the minimum number of birds that actually frequented the areas over the entire wintering period (October-March). In both cases, we estimated the number of teal visiting the two wintering sites be about twice as large as the maximum number of birds counted instantaneously...|$|R
25|$|Between 1833 and 1950 the {{population}} of the canton doubled from 38,351 to 71,082 people, though this increase was slower than the national average. The railroad to Küssnacht allowed that town to grow much faster than average between 1870-1914. At about the same time, a wave of immigrants from Europe (mostly from Italy) moved into the canton and a larger group of Schwyzer emigrated to the United States. On a per capita basis, Schwyz had the third highest <b>emigration</b> <b>rate</b> in Switzerland as people left for jobs. During late 19th and early 20th century, internal migration also changed the composition of {{the population}}. In 1860 almost 80% of the residents lived in the village of their birth, by 1950 it was only 50%.|$|E

30|$|To {{analyze the}} {{consistency}} of the previous results to other specifications, we estimate the endogenous component of migration followed by foreigners as in Eq. (6). This new approach is informative since, as mentioned previously, immigration flows of foreigners started in a moment when there were no foreigners in Spain, something similar to what is happening nowadays with Spaniards going abroad. Estimates show the persistence of immigration flows in Spain in the period of the creation of the foreigner networks with an autoregressive parameter of 0.6. Applying this parameter to the current <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> of Spaniards born in Spain leads to similar conclusions to the ones presented before. In particular, the unemployment rate in Spain should have decreased 5  pp in 2014 in order to stop the growth in <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> in that particular year. Moreover, in 2015, <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> will continue increasing unless the unemployment rate in Spain would decrease by around 3  pp.|$|R

2500|$|Based on Bismarck's message, the Reichstag filed three {{bills to}} deal with the {{concepts}} of accident and sickness insurance.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} overseas mass migration from eleven European countries in the late 19 th century. They typically passed through something like a half-century life-cycle: a steep rise in <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> from low levels in preindustrial decades, followed by a plateau of very high emigration, and then a subsequent fall during more mature stages of industrialization. Using a new real wage data base, {{we are able to}} isolate the impact of economic and demographic forces (associated with the industrial revolution) on this emigration experience. The steep rise in <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> was driven mainly by fertility boom and infant mortality decline, events early in the demographic transition which, with a two decade lag, tended to glut the age cohort most responsive to wage gaps between the labor-abundant Old World and the labor-scarce New World. The steep fall in <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> was driven mainly by the forces of convergence and catching up ? more rapid real wage growth at home encouraged an increasingly large share to stay at home. Since we show elsewhere that these mass migrations contributed significantly to an impressive late 19 th century economic convergence, they can be viewed as an important part of a long run equilibrium adjustment manifested by an evolving global labor market...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose to}} extend {{demographic}} multistate models {{by adding a}} behavioural element: behavioural rules explain intentions and thus transitions.

Model parameters are determined using empirical data where available. Parameters for which no empirical correspondence exists are determined by calibration. Age- and period-specific migration rates are used for model validation. Our approach adds to the toolkit of demographic projection by allowing for shocks and social influence, which alter behaviour in non-linear ways, while sticking to the general framework of multistate modelling. Our simulations yield that higher income growth in Senegal leads to higher <b>emigration</b> <b>rates</b> in the medium term, while a decrease in fertility yields lower <b>emigration</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
