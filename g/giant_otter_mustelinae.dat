40|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>otter</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{populations are}} {{increasing}} {{in many parts}} of the Peruvian Amazon, and are coming into contact with people more regularly. <b>Giant</b> <b>otters</b> are piscivores and fishermen often see them as potential competitors for fish stocks. We report on <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> - fisherman conflict on the River Yanayacu. During informal discussions, we found that fishermen considered the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> a competitor for fish, and one of their main concerns was for the fisheries of arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum). This fishery, for young arowanas for sale to the ornamental fish trade, is very important for the communities in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, and fishermen believe that stocks of this species are declining. Although arowana can be preyed upon by <b>giant</b> <b>otter,</b> smaller fish are preferred and there is no evidence for <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> impacting on populations of this species. We identify a need for more research into <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> populations, arowana populations, the exploitation of arowana, and the diet of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> in northeastern Peru, to support conservation initiatives aimed at changing the perception of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> as competitors for fish...|$|R

50|$|The niches and {{ranges of}} the <b>Giant</b> river <b>otter</b> and the Neotropical otter overlap widely. Both species are diurnal and mainly piscivorous. The <b>Giant</b> <b>otter</b> {{is less of}} a generalist in habitat, preferring slow-moving water and {{overhanging}} vegetation, but where the Neotropical otter may also occur. The <b>Giant</b> <b>otter</b> is much larger and hunts in groups, so it can take larger prey. Some areas, like the Pantanal, have high enough productivity, so both otter species can exists with little or no competition. Additionally, Neotropical otters prefer deeper and wider streams than <b>Giant</b> <b>otters.</b>|$|R
5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of <b>giant</b> <b>otters).</b> Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the <b>giant</b> <b>otter.</b>|$|R

Thus, the information given is essential for anybody interested in <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters.</b> Sheila Sykes-Gatz has not only focussed on the external factors of <b>Giant</b> <b>Otter</b> keeping but has also paid close attention to the “inside ” of the animals themselves, trying to examine their basic needs and find out about the factors that are most influential in the lives of <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters.</b> She has accumulated a large amount of biological and ethological knowledge about a species whose future is quite unsure. The <b>Giant</b> <b>Otter</b> is still ranking among the most threatened mammal species in the world. The major reasons for that are all human-induced: the destroying of their environment (forests along the river systems) and they are still being hunted for their pelts and as rivals to the local fishing industries. Thus, any contribution to the welfare of <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> in captivity will add to the conservation of the species as part of our natural heritage...|$|R
40|$|Territoriality carries {{costs and}} benefits, which are {{commonly}} {{affected by the}} spatial and temporal abundance and predictability of food, and by intruder pressure. <b>Giant</b> <b>otters</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis) live in groups that defend territories along river channels {{during the dry season}} using chemical signals, loud vocalizations and agonistic encounters. However, {{little is known about the}} territoriality of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> during the rainy season, when groups leave their dry season territories and follow fish dispersing into flooded areas. The objective of this study was to analyze long-term territoriality of <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> groups in a seasonal environment. The linear extensions of the territories of 10 <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> groups were determined based on locations of active dens, latrines and scent marks in each season. Some groups overlapped the limits of neighboring territories. The total territory extent of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> was correlated with group size in both seasons. The extent of exclusive territories of <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> groups was negatively related to the number of adults present in adjacent groups. Territory fidelity ranged from 0 to 100 % between seasons. Some groups maintained their territory for long periods, which demanded constant effort in marking and re-establishing their territories during the wet season. These results indicate that the defense capacity of groups had an important role in the maintenance of <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> territories across seasons, which may also affect the reproductive success of alpha pairs...|$|R

500|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> is an apex predator, and its {{population}} status reflects the overall health of riverine ecosystems. It feeds mainly on fish, including cichlids, characins (such as piranha), and catfish. One full-year study of <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> scats in Amazonian Brazil found fish {{present in all}} fecal samples. Fish from the order Perciformes, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of scats, and Characiformes, such as characins, in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, {{to the advantage of}} the probably visually oriented <b>giant</b> <b>otter.</b> Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> in predation. Hunting in shallow water has also been found to be more rewarding, with water depth less than [...] having the highest success rate. The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> seems to be opportunistic, taking whatever species are most locally abundant. If fish are unavailable, it will also take crabs, snakes, and even small caimans and anacondas.|$|R
40|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} mammal species in the Neotropical region.

Between March and December 2011, we conducted 41 interviews with riverine residents {{in the region of}} the National Forest of Amapá (AP, Brazil). These interviews revealed a strong negative attitude towards <b>giant</b> <b>otters,</b> highlighted by recent reports of otters being killed in 12. 2 % of the interviews.

40|$|The <b>Giant</b> <b>Otter</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis) is {{the largest}} of the 13 species of otters. Living in the rainforests of South America, it has since 1973 been {{considered}} the most threatened in the world by by the IUCN Otter Specialist Group. The species is considered "vulnerable" by the IUCN and has been on CITES Appendix I since 1973. At the First Symposium for the Conservation of the <b>Giant</b> <b>Otter</b> organized by INRENA (National Institure of Natural Resources) in Lima, it was decided that field work should be undertaken to survey the area round Port Maldonado in south-eastern Peru; and the implementation of environmental education and public awareness was continued. The objective of the field work was to evaluate three areas of great importance for the survival of <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> in Peru:i) Lake Sandoval, about 14 km from Port Maldonado, is the easiest place in Peru to observe <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> and they have been studied there between 1990 and 1992. It is also a perfect tourist destination, but badly organised tourism has led to the animals becoming very timid. As requested by INRENA, we produced an outline for more effective management of Lake Sandoval: creation of areas where human activity is restricted; construction of observation towers platforms; restriction on how closely the boats can approach the otters; obliging tourists to be accompanied by an official guide; production of posters and pamphlets on the biology of the species and explaining the necessity for following rules; restrictions on the number of boats at any time on the lake, no-swimming zones; no entry zones; no fishing zones; a system of fines for transgressing these rules, and an entry fee to pay for infrastructure improvements. Current activities could continue but in a more controlled form. Evaluation {{of the success of the}} scheme will be based on the behaviour and reproductive success of the otters. The survival of <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> in Lake Sandoval implies the existence of a corridor between nearby populations. ii) Lake Valencia, 24 km from Lake Sandoval, on the other side of the Madre de Dios River, and is subject to more human disturbance; otters had not been reported for 10 years, but recently a family group was filmed there, and we were able to confirm their presence when we visited. This has important implications for linking isolated Peruvian populations. iii) Rio Palma Real is in the protected zone in its middle and upper reaches; to the east runs the Heath river, and to the West, the ‘Quebrada’ Briolo, and <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> were confirmed in both these rivers in 1992. During our field work, we found <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> in the Rio Palma Real, which could bridge between the two nearby populations. Both <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> and Neotropical Otters (Lontra longicaudis) were found in the Palma Real. Field activities also included the training of a group of technicians and biologists in methods of investigation of <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters.</b> During the Lima Symposium, 1000 posters of <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters</b> with a conservation message, 500 technical posters, 500 pamphlets on the <b>Giant</b> <b>Otters,</b> and 80 educational slide packs were distributed. In an area in theenvirons of the National Reserve Pacaya-Samiria, in the North of Peru, 1500 copies of a <b>Giant</b> <b>Otter</b> colouring book, "Pepe, the Giant Otter" for children were distributed, and a drawing competition was organized to stimulate the involvement of children and their understanding and appreciation of its environment...|$|R
