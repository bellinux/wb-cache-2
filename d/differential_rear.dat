40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PsychologyMary E. CainGlutamate {{contributes}} to the neurological and behavioral changes that occur during <b>differential</b> <b>rearing,</b> and those that occur during conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5) in particular {{contributes to}} the psychostimulant reward pathway, plasticity, and <b>differential</b> <b>rearing.</b> The present study examined the role of mGluR 5 in conditioning and sensitization in differentially reared rats. Rats were reared in an enriched (EC), impoverished (IC), or social (SC) condition for 30 days, after which they received repeated amphetamine (0. 3 mg/kg) or saline injections. Following training, rats received an injection of the mGluR 5 antagonist MTEP or saline prior to undergoing conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization tests. Results showed that MTEP attenuated conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization in IC but not EC and SC rats, suggesting that glutamatergic changes occur during <b>differential</b> <b>rearing</b> that alter the effects of MTEP on amphetamine conditioning and sensitization. Additionally, results demonstrated that enrichment rearing has a protective effect against conditioned hyperactivity at low doses of amphetamine...|$|R

50|$|The {{torque split}} across axles, between {{left and right}} wheels, has been {{achieved}} through the various evolutions of the quattro system, through a driver-selectable manually locking <b>differential</b> (<b>rear</b> axle only), and, eventually, through open differentials with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL). EDL is an electronic system, utilising the existing anti-lock braking system (ABS), part of the Electronic Stability Programme (ESP), which brakes just the one spinning wheel on an axle, therefore allowing the transfer of torque across the axle to the wheel which does have traction.|$|E

CainRats {{reared in}} an enriched {{condition}} (EC) with novel stimuli and social contact with cohorts display less sensitization to nicotine than rats reared under impoverished conditions (IC). However, {{it is currently}} unknown what effect <b>differential</b> <b>rearing</b> has on nicotine-induced conditioned hyperactivity. The present study determined whether <b>differential</b> <b>rearing</b> affects conditioning to a nicotine-associated context. In addition, this study also {{examined the effects of}} mecamylamine, an antagonist to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization. This antagonistic drug has been shown to attenuate the locomotor effects of nicotine. In the current study, EC, IC, and social condition (SC) rats were reared from 21 to 51 days of age before training for the acquisition of conditioned hyperactivity and sensitization. Nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg) was administered prior to 1 -h locomotor sessions. Conditioned hyperactivity testing followed. Rats then received 5 sessions of sensitization training followed by a 16 -day drug-free rest period before being tested for sensitization. Mecamylamine (1. 0 mg/kg) was administered to rats prior to the conditioned hyperactivity test and sensitization test. Nicotine treatment resulted in sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity in all <b>differential</b> <b>rearing</b> groups. EC rats displayed less locomotor activity in response to nicotine than both IC and SC rats. Pretreatment with mecamylamine blocked the expression of conditioned hyperactivity in EC and SC rats and attenuated sensitization in all three rearing groups. These findings suggest that environmental enrichment may alter nAChR binding during development and may be a protective factor in the initiation and relapse of smoking behavior...|$|R

50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the front <b>differential,</b> <b>rear</b> differential, center differential, the transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. The transmission, front differential, center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The front differential distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|E

40|$|Differential is {{used when}} a vehicle takes a turn, the outer wheel on a longer radius than the inner wheel. The outer wheel turns {{faster than the}} inner wheel that is {{when there is a}} {{relative}} movement between the two rear wheels. If the two rear wheels are rigidly fixed to a rear axle the inner wheel will slip which cause rapid tire wear, steering difficulties and poor load holding. Differential is a part of inner axle housing assembly, which includes the <b>differential</b> <b>rear</b> axles, wheels and bearings. The differential consists of a system of gears arranged {{in such a way that}} connects the propeller shaft with the rear axles. The analysis is conducted to verify the best material for the gears in the gear box at higher speeds by analyzing stress, displacement and also by considering weight reduction. The analysis is done in Cosmos software. Modeling is done in the Pro/Engineer. 1...|$|E

Plos One, 10 (7), 21. doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0131709 Environmental factors play a {{key role}} in the {{etiology}} of depression. The rodent forced swim test (FST) is commonly used as a preclinical model of depression, with increases in escape-directed behavior reflecting antidepressant effects, and increases in immobility reflecting behavioral despair. Environmental enrichment leads to serotonergic alterations in rats, but it is unknown whether these alterations may influence the efficacy of common antidepressants. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were reared in enriched (EC), standard (SC), or isolated (IC) conditions. Following the rearing period, fluoxetine (10 or 20 mg/kg, i. p.) was administered 23. 5 hrs, 5 hrs, and 1 hr before locomotor and FST measures. Following locomotor testing and FST exposure, rats were weighed to assess fluoxetine-, FST-, and environmental condition-induced moderations in weight gain. Results revealed an antidepressant effect of environmental enrichment and a depressant effect of isolation. Regardless of significant fluoxetine effects on locomotor activity, fluoxetine generally decreased swimming and increased immobility in all three environmental conditions, with IC-fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) rats and EC-fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) rats swimming less than vehicle counterparts. Subchronic 20 mg/kg fluoxetine also induced significant weight loss, and <b>differential</b> <b>rearing</b> appeared to moderate weight gain following FST stress. These results suggest that <b>differential</b> <b>rearing</b> has the ability to alter FST behaviors, fluoxetine efficacy, and post-stressor well-being. Moreover, 20 mg/kg fluoxetine, administered subchronically, may lead to atypical effects of those commonly observed in the FST, highlighting the importance and impact of both environmental condition and dosing regimen in common animal models of depression...|$|R
