40|$|Abstract â€“ A <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>device</b> ideally {{possesses}} rigid-plastic force/shortening characteristics. When such {{a device}} is introduced in a compression member, {{and if the}} limit load of the device is set somewhat below the buckling load of the member, the member will behave in an elastic-plastic manner. The present paper outlines the non-liner behaviour of a novel multi-tubular, ductile compression member which exhibits an initial axial stiffness, followed by a steady load plateau and subsequent enhanced stiffness and strength, before the final failure. The multi-tubular member acts as an energy absorber and force redistributor. The theoretical cyclic response of the device, obtained using ABAQUS, is presented. For {{a comparison of the}} energy absorbing characteristics, two X braced frameworks have been considered, one with conventional tubular bracing, and one with the force limiting devices used for bracing. For relatively large horizontal displacements, the framework incorporating the force limiting devices exhibited greater ductility and energy absorbing characteristics than the conventionally braced framework...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{compliant}} mechanisms {{is crucial in}} several technologies and relies {{on the availability of}} solutions for nonlinear structural problems. One of these solutions is given and experimentally validated in the present article for a compliant mechanism moving along a smooth curved profile. In particular, a deformable elastic rod is held by two clamps, one at each end. The first clamp is constrained to slide without friction along a curved profile, while the second clamp moves in a straight line transmitting its motion through the elastic rod to the first clamp. For this system it is shown that the clamp sliding on the profile imposes nontrivial boundary conditions (derived via a variational and an asymptotic approach), which strongly influence buckling and nonlinear structural behaviour. Investigation of this behaviour shows that a compliant mechanism can be designed, which gives an almost neutral response in compression. This behavior could easily be exploited to make a <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>device.</b> Finally a proof-of-concept device was constructed and tested showing that the analyzed mechanical system can be realized in practice and it behaves tightly to the model, so that it can now be used in the design of machines that use compliant mechanisms.

40|$|The force-limited {{vibration}} test approaches discussed in NASA- 7004 C {{were developed to}} reduce overtesting associated with base shake {{vibration test}}s of aerospace hardware where the interface responses are excited coherently. This handbook outlines several different methods of specifying the <b>force</b> <b>limits.</b> The rationale for <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> {{is based on the}} disparity between the impedances of typical aerospace mounting structures and the large impedances of vibration test shakers when the interfaces in general are coherently excited. Among these approaches, the semi-empirical method is presently the most widely used method to derive the <b>force</b> <b>limits.</b> The inclusion of the incoherent excitation of the aerospace structures at mounting interfaces has not been accounted for in the past and provides the basis for more realistic <b>force</b> <b>limits</b> for qualifying the hardware using shaker testing. In this paper current methods for defining the <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> specifications discussed in the NASA handbook are reviewed using data from a series of acoustic and vibration tests. A new approach based on considering the incoherent excitation of the structural mounting interfaces using acoustic test data is also discussed.

40|$|Vibration {{tests were}} {{performed}} to develop and validate the <b>forced</b> <b>limited</b> vibration testing capability at the NASA Langley Research Center. The <b>force</b> <b>limited</b> vibration test technique has been utilized at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other NASA centers to provide more realistic vibration test environments for aerospace flight hardware. In standard random vibration tests, the payload is mounted to a rigid fixture and the interface acceleration is controlled to a specified level based on a conservative estimate of the expected flight environment. In <b>force</b> <b>limited</b> vibration tests, both the acceleration and force are controlled at the mounting interface to compensate for differences between the flexible flight mounting and rigid test fixture. This minimizes the over test at the payload natural frequencies and results in more realistic forces being transmitted at the mounting interface. Force and acceleration response data was provided by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for a test article that was flown in 1998 on a Black Brant sounding rocket. The measured flight interface acceleration data {{was used as the}} reference acceleration spectrum. Using this acceleration spectrum, three analytical methods were used to estimate the <b>force</b> <b>limits.</b> Standard random and <b>force</b> <b>limited</b> vibration tests were performed and the results are compared with the flight data. Implementing the <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> technique resulted in a reduction in the interface force and response acceleration at the payload natural frequency by over two-orders of magnitude as compared to the standard vibration test. The response acceleration and interface force data from the <b>force</b> <b>limited</b> vibration test still provided a conservative envelope of the flight data over the range <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> was in effect...|$|R

40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} concept and applications of <b>Force</b> <b>Limited</b> Vibration Testing. The goal of vibration testing of aerospace hardware is to identify problems {{that would result in}} flight failures. The commonly used aerospace vibration tests uses artificially high shaker forces and responses at the resonance frequencies of the test item. It has become common to limit the acceleration responses in the test to those predicted for the flight. This requires an analysis of the acceleration response, and requires placing accelerometers on the test item. With the advent of piezoelectric gages it has become possible to improve vibration testing. The basic equations have are reviewed. <b>Force</b> <b>limits</b> are analogous and complementary to the acceleration specifications used in conventional vibration testing. Just as the acceleration specification is the frequency spectrum envelope of the in-flight acceleration at the interface between the test item and flight mounting structure, the <b>force</b> <b>limit</b> is the envelope of the in-flight force at the interface. In <b>force</b> <b>limited</b> vibration tests, both the acceleration and force specifications are needed, and the force specification is generally based on and proportional to the acceleration specification. Therefore, <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> does not compensate for errors {{in the development of the}} acceleration specification, e. g., too much conservatism or the lack thereof. These errors will carry over into the force specification. Since in-flight vibratory force data are scarce, <b>force</b> <b>limits</b> are often derived from coupled system analyses and impedance information obtained from measurements or finite element models (FEM). Fortunately, data on the interface forces between systems and components are now available from system acoustic and vibration tests of development test models and from a few flight experiments. Semi-empirical methods of predicting <b>force</b> <b>limits</b> are currently being developed on the basis of the limited flight and system test data. A simple two degree of freedom system is shown and the governing equations for basic <b>force</b> <b>limiting</b> results for this system are reviewed. The design and results of the shuttle vibration forces (SVF) experiments are reviewed. The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) also was used to validate <b>force</b> <b>limiting.</b> Test instrumentation and supporting equipment are reviewed including piezo-electric force transducers, signal processing and conditioning systems, test fixtures, and vibration controller systems.
