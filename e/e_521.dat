We now demonstrate further nuances in nerve preservation during Robotic assisted Radical Prostatectomy. METHODS: The {{present study is}} a combination of a single surgeon experience after 5000 patients and a compilation of videos detailing some possible scenarios that surgeons might face when performing nerve sparing. RESULTS: Case 1 : 55 year old man with PSA of 5, SHIM score 25, DRE reveals T 1 c with and low volume disease. Complete bilateral nerve sparing is performed. Case 2 : 60 year old man with SHIM score of 25, PSA of 7. 2, and normal DRE.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome) is an X linked {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{resulting from}} heterogeneous mutations in the iduronate- 2 -sulphatase (IDS) gene. To detect IDS gene mutations, direct sequencing of IDS cDNA fragments coupled with assays on IDS genomic amplicons {{was applied to}} 18  unrelated patients with MPS II. Seventeen mutations were detected from the 18  patients including seven missense mutations (S 71 R, A 82 E, A 85 T, R 88 C, R 468 W, R 468 Q, and <b>E</b> <b>521</b> V), five deletions (ΔR 95, 383 delAT, 596 delAACA, 1148 delC, and 1216 delCT), two insertions (208 insC and 1063 insA), two splicing mutations (1006 + 5 g→c in intron 7,  1122 C→T in exon 8), and an intragenic deletion of IDS exons 4,  5,  6, and 7.  Nine of the small mutations were novel mutations. Mutation 596 delAACA was detected in two unrelated patients. The mutation in intron 7  was found to cause aberrant splicing and resulted in a 22  bp insertion into its mRNA transcript. The intragenic deleted IDS gene expressed two aberrant mRNA transcripts consisting of exons 1 - 2 - 8 - 9  and 3 - 8 - 9.  Analysis of mutations A 85 T, R 88 C, R 468 Q, R 468 W, and 438 C/T found no polymorphism for the four missense mutations but about 36 % heterozygosity for the 438 C/T silent mutation. These results provide further evidence of mutational heterogeneity for MPS II. Also, underlying sequence directed mutagenesis mechanisms for some recurrent mutations in the IDS gene were proposed.    Keywords: mucopolysaccharidosis type II; Hunter syndrome; iduronate- 2 -sulphatase gene; mutation detectio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) {{are rare}} and {{heterogeneous}} group of tumors classified anatomically into intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and gallbladder adenocarcinomas. Patient-derived tumor cell (PDC) models with genome analysis {{can be a}} valuable platform to develop a method to overcome the clinical barrier on BTCs. Material and Methods: Between January 2012 and June 2015, 40 BTC patients’ samples were collected. PDCs were isolated and cultured from surgical specimens, biopsy tissues, or malignant effusions including ascites and pleural fluid. Genome analysis using targeted panel sequencing as well as digital multiplexed gene analysis was applied to PDCs as well as primary tumors. Results: Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (N =  15, 37. 5 %), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (N =  10, 25. 0 %), gallbladder cancer (N =  14, 35. 0 %), and ampulla of Vater cancer (N =  1, 2. 5 %) were included. We identified 15 mutations with diverse genetic alterations in 19 cases of BTC from primary tumor specimens. The most common molecular alterations were in TP 53 (8 / 19, 42. 1 %), including missense mutations such as C 242 Y, E 285 K, G 112 S, P 19 T, R 148 T, R 248 Q, and R 273 L. We also detected two NRAS mutations (G 12 C and Q 61 L), two KRAS mutations (G 12 A and G 12 S), two ERBB 2 mutations (V 777 L and pM 774 delinsMA) and amplification, and three PIK 3 CA mutations (N 345 K, E 545 K, and <b>E</b> <b>521</b> K). PDC models were successfully established in 27 of 40 samples (67. 5 %), including 22 / 24 from body fluids (91. 7 %) and 5 / 16 from tissue specimens (31. 3 %). Conclusions: PDC models are promising tools for uncovering driver mutations and identifying rational therapeutic strategies in BTC. Application of this model is expected to inform clinical trials of drugs for molecular-based targeted therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Insulin stimulates {{exocytosis}} of GLUT 4 from an intracellular {{store to}} the cell surface of fat and muscle cells. Fusion of GLUT 4 -containing vesicles with the plasma membrane requires the SNARE proteins Syntaxin 4, VAMP 2 and the regulatory Sec 1 /Munc 18 protein, Munc 18 c. Syntaxin 4 and Munc 18 c form a complex that is disrupted upon insulin treatment of adipocytes. Munc 18 c is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin in these cells. Here, we directly test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of Munc 18 c {{is responsible for the}} observed insulin-dependent abrogation of binding between Munc 18 c and Syntaxin 4. Results: We show that Munc 18 c is directly phosphorylated by recombinant insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in vitro.

40|$|The role of {{the third}} domain of CryIAa, a Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxin, in toxin-induced {{membrane}} permeabilization in a receptor-free environment was investigated. Planar lipid bilayer experiments were conducted with the parental toxin and five proteins obtained by site-directed mutagenesis in block 4, an arginine-rich, highly conserved region of the protein. Four mutants were constructed by replacing the first arginine in position 21 by a lysine (R 521 K), a glutamine (R 521 Q), a histidine (R 521 H), or a glutamic acid (R <b>521</b> <b>E).</b> A fifth mutant was obtained by replacing the fourth arginine by a lysine (R 527 K). Like CryIAa, the mutants formed cation-selective channels. A limited but significant reduction in channel conductance was observed for all mutants except R 521 H. The effect was more dramatic for the voltage dependence of the channels formed by R 521 K and R 521 Q, which was reversed {{compared to that of}} the parental toxin. This study provides the first direct evidence of a functional role for domain III in membrane permeabilization. Our results suggest that residues of the positive arginine face of block 4 interact with domain I, the putative pore-forming region of CryIAa...|$|R

40|$|We {{promote the}} {{microscopic}} theory of standard model (MSM) [1, 2] into supersymmetric framework {{in order to}} solve its technical aspects of vacuum zero point energy and hierarchy problems, and attempt, further, to develop its realistic viable minimal SUSY extension. Among other things that- the MSM provides a natural unification of geometry and the field theory, has clarified the physical conditions in which the geometry and particles come into being, in microscopic sense enables an insight to key problems of particle phenomenology and answers to some of its nagging questions- a present approach also leads to quite a new realization of the SUSY yielding a physically realistic particle spectrum. It stems from the special subquark algebra, from which the nilpotent supercharge operators are derived.

40|$|Background Rotavirus {{vaccination}} (RV) {{is recognized}} by international health authority {{as the best}} strategy to prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in children. Costs of RVGE were estimated in several studies and were classified into direct and indirect costs, that should be further divided into Health care and social perspective. This study aims to evaluate RVGE hospitalization costs in Sicily, before and after universal mass RV (UMRV) introduction. Methods Cases of RVGE were defined as all hospitalizations with an ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis code of 008. 61 on any diagnosis position among children aged 0 to 59 months. Data were obtained from Hospital discharge records (HDR) of the Health Regional Office from 2009 to 2014. Direct and indirect costs of RVGE hospitalization for health care and social perspective were calculated on data reported in the REVEAL study. RV costs was extrapolated from a budget impact analysis published in 2013 by Vitale et al. Results In Sicily, during the pre-vaccination era (2009 - 2012) were reported 963 RVGE hospitalizations per year with a mean HDR cost of 1, <b>521</b> <b>E</b> (1, 465, 000 E per year), against 511 RVGE cases per year (mean HDR cost of 1, 321 E; 675, 000 E per year) after UMRV introduction (direct hospitalization Health care costs).

40|$|Isotopically {{fractionated}} {{material is}} found in many solar system objects, including meteorites and comets [1]. It is considered, in some cases, to trace interstellar material that was incorporated into the solar system without undergoing significant processing, thus preserving the fractionation. In interstellar molecular clouds, ion-molecule chemistry continually cycles nitrogen between the two main reservoirs - Nand N 2 - leading to only minor N- 15 enrichments [2]. Charnley and Rodgers [3, 4] showed that depletion of CO removes oxygen from the gas and weakens this cycle such that significant N- 15 fractionation can occur for N 2 and other N-bearing species in such cores. Observations are being conducted at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths employing various facilities in order to both spatially and spectrally, resolve emission from these cores. A preliminary study to obtain the N- 14 /N- 15 ratio in nitriles was conducted at the Arizona Radio Observatory's 12 m telescope on Kitt Peak, AZ. Spectra were obtained at high resolution (0. 08 km/s) in order to resolve dynamic properties of each source {{as well as to}} resolve hyperfine structure present in certain isotopologues. This study included four dark cloud cores, observed to have varying levels of molecular depletion: Ll <b>521</b> <b>E,</b> Ll 498, Ll 544, and Ll 521 F. Previous studies of the N- 14 /N- 15 ratio towards Ll 544 were obtained with N 2 H(+) and NH 3 yielding ratios of 446 and greater than 700, respectively [5, 6]. The discrepancy observed in these two measurements suggests a strong chemical dependence on the fractionation of nitrogen. Ratios (C,N, and D) obtained from isotopologues for a particular molecule are likely tracing the same chemical heritage and are directly comparable within a given source. Results and comparisons between the protostellar evolutionary state and isomer isotope fractionation as well as between other N-bearing species will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Cellulase {{constitute}} {{the third largest}} group of enzymes employed in the industry for the processing of food, textile, detergents, paper and pulp and conversion of agricultural biomass into bio fuel and other useful products. The present study therefore was focused on production of cellulases from Trichoderma harzianum for employing in various applications. Trichoderma harzianum after qualitative screening on carboxymethyl cellulose agar and cellulose Azure was utilized {{for the production of}} endoglucanase, exoglucanase and Ã¢- glucosidase. Mandel`s mineral salt medium was found to be suitable for the production of cellulases in submerged culture at 120 rpm. Significant improvements in specific activities of cellulases were recorded in the Mandelâ€™s salt medium supplemented with 3 % wheat bran and 0. 06 % lactose as an inducer and addition of Tween 80 further facilitated cellulase production. Maximum production of all the enzymes was achieved between 72 - 96 hours of fermentation in most of the production parameter notable activities were achieved at 96 hours. The enzyme production was favorable at temperature of 25 Â°C and 30 Â°C with optimum production reported at 30 Â°C with significant specific activities of endoglucanase (137. 3 U/mg), exoglucanase (80. 63 U/mg) and Ã¢-glucosidase (106. 88 U/mg). pH 5. 0 brought significant production of endoglucanase (139. 26 U/mg), exoglucanase(90. 12 U/mg) and Ã¢-glucosidase (109. 88 U/mg). Purification was carried out on Sephadex G- 100, which revealed two distinct peaks of enzyme activity. Lyophilized fractions with 425. 7 % yield for endoglucanase, 464. 6 % exoglucanase and 468 % Ã¢-glucosidase were subjected to SDS-PAGE for the determination of molecular weights that resulted in separation of protein into five bands of 95 KDa, 75 KDa, 65 KDa, 60 KDa and 20 KDa. Characterization of crude and purified cellulases indicated maximum residual activities of crude cellulases between 35 - 55 Â°C with maximum activities attained at 45 Â°C. The temperature optima of purified cellulases shifted from 45 Â°C to 50 Â°C for endoglucanse and exoglucanase and to 55 Â°C for Ã¢-glucosidase. Study of residual activity of crude and purified cellulases in varying pH revealed that the enzymes have a broad pH range both crude and purified fractions were most active at pH 5 6. 5 with maximum residual activities retained at pH 5. 5. Metal ions like Mn 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K, and Na had stimulatory effect on the activity of crude as well as purified cellulases Fe 2 + ion neither inhibited nor had a stimulatory effect. Lead, Hg 2 + and Cu 2 + had maximum inhibitory effect. Co 2 + inhibited endoglucanase and exoglucanase activity while a slight inhibition was reported in case of Ã¢-glucosidase. Enzyme activities of purified enzymes were stimulated by mercaptoethanol. SDS and EDTA had a slight inhibitory effect. Crude enzyme were supplemented in a high fiber formulated poultry feed. Seven dietary treatments comprising of four dietary doses of cellulases only, two dietary mixed doses with cellulases and proteases and a dietary dose without enzyme supplementation that was kept as a control were fed to birds over a period o f 43 days. Enzyme supplementation resulted in increase in average weight gain of all the treatments when compared with control. 156 g more weight than control group (A) was recorded in group E (16 ml cellulase /kg feed) on 43 rd day. A decrease in feed conversion ratio was recorded in all the treatment groups that were linear with increasing enzyme doses. With increasing cellulase dose a decrease in viscosity was noted. In vitro maximum viscosity (1. 29 cP) was recorded in control group (A) and minimum was in group E (0. 712 cP). Similar results were reported for In vivo viscosity studies of digesta from live birds with maximum figure (1. 089 cP) in control group (A) and maximum reduction was attained in group <b>E</b> (0. <b>521).</b> Dry matter digestibility in control group (80. 58 %) was less than in all treatment groups with maximum reported in group G (91. 08 %). Deinking of different type of waste paper resulted in increase in color units of all treated pulps over their respective controls. An average of 2 % increase in brightness index of all treated pulps was achieved. Image analysis revealed reduction of residual ink (%) in all the enzyme treated hand sheets. The crude enzyme was found to be stable in all five commercial detergents used, with 90 % of residual activity retained after 1 hour of incubation at 40 Â°C in detergent A. More than 40 % residual activity was retained in rest of the detergents after one hour. The crude enzyme was active in removing/fading different type of stains and along with detergent the cleaning power was enhanced further. The crude preparation of cellulases was also successful in biostoning of denim bringing out an even faded look of the garment with an additional advantage of negligible back staining...|$|R
