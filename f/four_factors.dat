5|$|The Jain {{theory of}} karma proposes that karma {{particles}} are attracted and then {{bound to the}} consciousness of souls {{by a combination of}} <b>four</b> <b>factors</b> pertaining to actions: instrumentality, process, modality and motivation.|$|E
5|$|All {{actions have}} the above four factor present in them. When {{different}} permutations of the sub-elements of the <b>four</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated, the Jain teachers speak of 108 {{ways in which}} the karmic matter can be attracted to the soul. Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E

The researchers noted that many of the VIA character strengths cross-loaded onto multiple factors. Rather, the strengths were best represented by a one and <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> model. A one factor model would mean that the strengths are best accounted for by, “one overarching factor,” such as a global trait of character (p. 797). [...] A <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> model more closely resembles the 'Big Five' model of personality. The character strengths in the <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> model could be organized into the following four groups: Niceness, Positivity, Intellect and Conscientiousness.|$|R

25|$|Semantic memory {{disorders}} {{fall into}} two groups. Semantic refractory access disorders are contrasted with semantic storage disorders according to <b>four</b> <b>factors.</b> Temporal factors, response consistency, frequency and semantic relatedness are the <b>four</b> <b>factors</b> used to differentiate between semantic refractory access and semantic storage disorders. A key feature of semantic refractory access disorders is temporal distortions. Decreases in response time to certain stimuli are noted when compared to natural response times. Response consistency is the next factor. In access disorders you see inconsistencies in comprehending and responding to stimuli that have been presented many times. Temporal factors impact response consistency. In storage disorders, you do not see an inconsistent response to specific items like you do in refractory access disorders. Stimulus frequency determines performance at all stages of cognition. Extreme word frequency effects are common in semantic storage disorders while in semantic refractory access disorders word frequency effects are minimal. The comparison of 'close' and 'distant' groups tests semantic relatedness. 'Close' groupings have words that are related because they are drawn from the same category. For example, a listing of clothing types would be a 'close' grouping. 'Distant' groupings contain words with broad categorical differences. Non-related words would fall into this group. Comparing close and distant groups shows that in access disorders semantic relatedness had a negative effect. This is not observed in semantic storage disorders. Category specific and modality specific impairments are important components in access and storage disorders of semantic memory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Four</b> <b>factors</b> {{exist that}} cause {{a person to}} be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their {{cognitive}} mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood.

For example: people believing that they are less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers believing that {{they are less likely to}} contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers believing that they are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders who think they are less exposed to losses in the markets.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop and {{validate}} the Locus of Evaluation Inventory (LEI), and examine the relationships among locus of evaluation, self-esteem, and measures of personality. Despite being heralded as critical to successful psychotherapy (Raskin, 1952) and central to optimal psychological functioning (Rogers, 1959), insufficient measurement has contributed to a dearth of empirical research investigating locus of evaluation.

40|$|Background: Support for the <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> {{construct}} validity of the third edition of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) has been found in clinical and non clinical populations but some studies question whether more complex models consistent with the concepts of fluid and crystallised intelligence provide a better explanation of the data. The WAIS-III is frequently used in the diagnosis of learning disability, however, previous exploratory factor analysis of data from a population with low IQ did not support the explicit <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> structure of the WAIS-III. Method: A confirmatory factor analysis of the WAIS-III was carried out on data from people with severe and significant learning disability and people with borderline IQ (IQ = 70 - 79). Results: The data from the borderline IQ sample and the sample with significant learning disability showed at best a weak fit to the explicit <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> models and more complex five or six factor models. However fit of the data from the sample with severe learning disability was poor for all models. Discussion: The findings show little support for the explicit <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> {{construct validity}} of the WAIS-III for people with borderline IQ or significant or severe intellectual impairment. Some support is found for the direction taken by the new Wechsler children’s and adult scales (WISC-IV & WAIS-IV) in aligning interpretation of the scales more closely to concepts such as fluid and crystallised theory. The research also suggests the cut-off point of IQ 70 is not reflective of an actual difference in cognitive profile as measured by the WAIS-III. Limitations of this study and implications for further research are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

2500|$|Motivation {{involves}} three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity. Arousal is what initiates action. It {{is often}} {{fueled by a}} person's need or desire for something that is missing {{from his or her}} life, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Intensity is the amount of energy employees put into goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity often reflects the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes involve <b>four</b> <b>factors.</b> [...] First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. Second, it serves to stimulate effort. Third, motivation influences persistence. Finally, motivation influences the choice and application of task-related strategies.|$|E
30|$|Deception {{is defined}} as purposefully concealing the truth, either by {{omission}} or commission. In the present study, our general hypothesis is that 911 callers who deceive exhibit systematic differences in the words they use compared to 911 callers who are telling the truth. Possible underlying causes for the differences in deceptive speech are described by deception theories, including <b>four</b> <b>factor</b> theory [20], interpersonal deception theory (IDT) [21], information manipulation theory [22], and reality monitoring [23]. Deception detection researchers rely on theory to identify strategically employed clues that can discriminate between those who deceive {{and those who do}} not.
