The results from the numerical simulation show that nearly all the peak values of the stress components {{as well as the}} von Mises equivalent stress distributed in both mid-bondline and adherend near the interface of the adhesively bonded joggle <b>double</b> lap <b>joint</b> are significantly decreased to the normal one. It was pointed out that the load bearing capacity of the joggle <b>double</b> lap <b>joint</b> may be higher than that of the <b>double</b> lap <b>joint</b> for its decrease of peak stress, much evenly stress distribution in the middle part of the overlap zone so that more load can be subjected by the joggle <b>double</b> lap <b>joint...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} three {{methods to}} solve the inverse position kinematics position problem of the <b>double</b> universal <b>joint</b> attached to a manipulator: (1) an analytical solution for two specific cases; (2) an approximate closed form solution based on ignoring the wrist offset; and (3) an iterative method which repeats closed form position and orientation calculations until the solution is achieved. Several manipulators are used to demonstrate the solution methods: cartesian, cylindrical, spherical, and an anthropomorphic articulated arm, based on the Flight Telerobotic Servicer (FTS) arm. A singularity analysis is presented for the <b>double</b> universal <b>joint</b> wrist attached to the above manipulator arms. While the <b>double</b> universal <b>joint</b> wrist standing alone is singularity-free in orientation, the singularity analysis indicates the presence of coupled position/orientation singularities of the spherical and articulated manipulators with the wrist. The cartesian and cylindrical manipulators with the <b>double</b> universal <b>joint</b> wrist {{were found to be}} singularity-free. The methods of this paper can be implemented in a real-time controller for manipulators with the <b>double</b> universal <b>joint</b> wrist. Such mechanically dextrous systems could be used in telerobotic and industrial applications, but further work is required to avoid the singularities...|$|R

In this study, numerical analysis {{is used to}} study the joint strength for three types of <b>double</b> containment <b>joints</b> having a circular corner support, a regular right angle support, and a modified right angle support. Steel and aluminum are considered for the joint supports. In general, {{it was found that}} the joint strength is nearly the same for joints having steel and aluminum circular cross-section supports. Further strength enhancement was obtained in the case of aluminum regular supports. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of <b>double</b> containment <b>joints</b> with a circular cross-section was dynamically tested.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tightening}} torques {{on the life}} of plates bolted using single and <b>double</b> lap <b>joints</b> was investigated. The effect of plate thickness using an aircraft grade aluminium alloy with <b>double</b> lap <b>joints</b> was also studied. Constant amplitude fatigue tests, under load control, were carried out, with a near zero stress ratio, on plain specimens (for bench mark purposes) and on both single and <b>double</b> lap <b>joint</b> specimens, for which several torque levels were applied on the bolted joints. The objective of the fatigue tests was to demonstrate failure trends for each joint type, material thickness and torque loading, rather than the generation of comprehensive S-N curves. Possible factors that affected the fatigue life of the bolted joints are discussed and conclusions are drawn with respect to the beneficial effects of tightening torques on the bolted single and <b>double</b> lap <b>joints.</b> (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

For the conventional <b>double</b> lap <b>joint</b> (DLJ), the high shear stress and peer stress {{taking place in}} the adhesive layer near the patch termination significantly influenced the joint strength. In order to diminish the amount of the stresses, a new design of stepwise patch was introduced in the fabrication of the double-lap joint. Based on the finite element stress analysis (FEA), it was found that both shear stress and peer stress within the adhesive layer was reduced appreciably by the employment of the stepwise attachment.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the mechanical performance of steel/CFRP adhesively-bonded <b>double</b> strap <b>joints</b> at elevated temperatures around the {{glass transition temperature}} (Tg, 42 &# 0176;C) of the adhesive. A series of joints with different bond lengths were tested to failure at temperatures between 20 &# 0176;C and 60 &# 0176;C. It {{was found that the}} joint failure mode changed from adherend failure to debonding failure as the temperature approached Tg. In addition, the ultimate load and joint stiffness decreased significantly at temperatures near to and greater than Tg, while the effective bond length increased with temperature. Based on the ultimate load prediction model developed by Hart-Smith for <b>double</b> lap <b>joints</b> and kinetic modelling of the mechanical degradation of the adhesive, a mechanism-based model is proposed to describe the change of effective bond length, stiffness and strength degradation for steel/CFRP <b>double</b> strap <b>joints</b> at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate aspects of hybrid joint design for a shear connection. Part 1 is design considerations and a case study based on a engine mount. In Part 2, an experimental study is conducted regarding how relaxation and creep affects properties of a hybrid joint between carbon fiber vinylester and steel. Failure modes, loss of clamped force and ultimate strength of the joint and how these are affected by elevated temperature and different clamped forces are presented. Test specimens were 184 × 45 × 5 mm CFRP, in <b>double</b> lap <b>joint</b> between two steel plates of same dimensions, with either a single or double M 10 hexagon flange screw. Creep/ relaxation testing was preformed over a 28 day period. Results shows that the amount of initial clamped force does not effect amount of loss of clamped force, but increase in temperature significantly does. Average loss was between 8. 3 an 8. 8 % for single joint specimens, initial torque of 28, 37 and 46 Nm, and 10. 8 % for <b>double</b> <b>joint</b> specimens, 37 Nm. But losses for specimens subjected to heat, 80 °C, was 35. 5 %. Ultimate bearing strength of the lamina was not effected by any circumstances. Slip load was lower for specimens clamped with lower clamped force, the loss over the 28 day period was not enough to produced any clear results regarding the amount of loss. But tendencies point towards a lowered slip load of the same magnitude as the loss of clamped force i. e around 8 - 9 %. Slip load for specimens subjected to 80 °C did not decreased, even though the clamped force had been lowered. All specimens fail in bearing, single bolted joints had a far more progressive failure than the <b>double</b> <b>joints,</b> which failed catastrophically...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{application}} of CFRP {{has become a}} popular strengthening technique for retrofitting of metallic structures. However, knowledge is very limited on the durability of CFRP composites under different environmental conditions. This paper presents the outcomes of a research program on the bond characteristics and environmental durability of degraded CFRP-strengthened steel plate <b>double</b> strap <b>joints.</b> Investigations were carried out on failure mode, ultimate load, joint strength, effective bond length {{and the effect of}} embedded GFRP layers for <b>double</b> strap <b>joints.</b> Shear stress-slip curves were developed for degraded CFRP-steel composite using the experimentally measured strain data. Results show that the failure modes and joint capacities are highly dependent on the number of CFRP layers utilised in the composite systems under environmental conditioning. The use of embedded GFRP layers can improve the long-term durability of the composite system. However, optimum structural properties could not be achieved using embedded GFRP as the innermost layer. The bond-slip responses for degraded CFRP <b>double</b> strap <b>joints</b> were shown to have an approximately bilinear relationship.
