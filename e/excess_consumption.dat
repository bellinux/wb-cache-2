5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic <b>excess</b> <b>consumption</b> {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Mexico and the Aztec people changed {{every aspect of}} the native population's lives. The Spanish {{attempted}} to modernize and develop Mexico, focusing much of their attention on what would become Mexico City. This conquest and the accompanying technology provided many of the local inhabitants with new types of work and leisure activity. Buildings erected with modern construction methods and other infrastructure brought immigrants to the city. Along with industrial development and modernization, the Spanish also brought Catholicism. With Catholicism came many festivals and celebrations in which pulque was the drink du jour. Unlike the Aztec reverence for the sacred drink, the Spanish conquistadors did not prohibit <b>excess</b> <b>consumption.</b> Common people were allowed to drink as much pulque as they wished, and with the increase in urban jobs as well as money and leisure time, the consumption and sale of pulque began to rise. By the 1530s, commoners were selling pulque in the streets, and at least twelve pulque stands operated regularly in the city.|$|E
