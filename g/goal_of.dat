40|$|Abstract Background Residents are {{commonly}} involved in establishing <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care for hospitalized patients. While education {{can improve the}} quality of these conversations, whether and how postgraduate training programs integrate such teaching into their curricula is not well established. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize perceptions of current teaching and assessment <b>of</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversations, and program director interest in associated curricular integration. Methods An electronic survey was sent to all postgraduate program directors at the University of Calgary. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative comments were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The survey response rate was 34 % (22 / 64). Formal <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversation teaching is incorporated into 63 % of responding programs, and most commonly involves lectures. Informal teaching occurs in 86 % of programs, involving discussion, direct observation and role modeling in the clinical setting. Seventy-three percent <b>of</b> programs assess <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversation skills, mostly in the clinical setting through feedback. Program directors believe that over two-thirds of clinical faculty are prepared to teach <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversations, and are interested in resources to teach and assess <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversations. Themes that emerged include 1) general perceptions, 2) need for teaching, 3) ideas for teaching, and 4) assessment <b>of</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversations. Conclusions The majority of residency training programs at the University of Calgary incorporate some <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversation teaching and assessment into their curricula. Program directors are interested in resources to improve teaching and assessment <b>of</b> <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> care conversations...|$|R

5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E
