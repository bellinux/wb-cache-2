5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren were early {{opportunities}} for the Germans to learn lessons about the challenges their poorly equipped and often substandard occupation troops faced fighting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain and weather conditions of Bosnia. However, these lessons were to be repeated many more times in the following years as German commanders persisted with their encirclement tactics and unreasonable expectations {{of what could be}} achieved in a given time and space.|$|E

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, play resumed in poor visibility, with {{frequent}} interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers {{to bear a}} greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the entire day to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run ahead {{at the close of}} play, on 345/6. Compton's innings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if the lower order could bat for {{a large part of the}} final day. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets; opener Sid Barnes made his second half-century for the match in the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effort to}} raise Monitors {{propeller}} was successful on 8 June 1998, although {{the amount of}} effort required to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull {{so that it would}} not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers shored up the port side of the hull with bags of grout, installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E

Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation of Athens by Axis forces in April 1941. She and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece (the mother of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent), lived in Athens {{for the duration of}} the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa. She moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law George's three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross, helped organize soup kitchens for the starving populace and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Louise, who was married to the Crown Prince. She organized two shelters for orphaned and stray children, and a nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.|$|E

5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E

She emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1975 to join her son. She lived a low-key life and avoided attention by using the name Pan Baojuan.

Following promotion to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) he transferred to the staff of the 13th Infantry Regiment at Esseg in Slavonia, and then the 6th Infantry Division in Graz. This was followed by a promotion to Hauptmann (captain) in 1911 along with a position {{on the staff of the}} XV Army Corps in Sarajevo, where he specialised in mobilisation and communications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{came in at}} {{the start}} of the second day's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added, before falling at 7/86, part of a {{collapse}} of 5/27. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced, feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> conditions. Australia ended at 101, and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury. Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire, 6/51. Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings, which followed a similar pattern to their first effort. Wickets fell steadily as Johnston (6/18) and Miller (3/49) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs.|$|E

Stone helped initiate the first National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts and she supported and sustained it annually, along with a number of other local, state and regional activist conventions. Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women. She assisted in establishing the Woman's National Loyal League to help pass the Thirteenth Amendment and thereby abolish slavery, after which she helped form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which built support for a woman suffrage Constitutional amendment by winning woman suffrage {{at the state and local}} levels.|$|E
5|$|The 1961–62 season {{proved to}} be highly disappointing, as Leicester {{finished}} 14th {{in the league and}} exited the FA Cup at the hands of Stoke City. The only highlight was the club's participation in the European Cup Winners' Cup, which actually put Banks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> position of choosing to play for his club against Spanish club Atlético Madrid or choosing to attend the England versus Portugal match as a non-playing squad member. He elected to attend both games, leaving London at full-time to reach Leicester 30 minutes before the kick-off against Madrid. A last-minute goal earned the Spaniards a 1–1 draw at Filbert Street. In the return leg, Banks saved an Enrique Collar penalty, but Atlético were awarded a second penalty which Collar converted, and Leicester lost the game 2–0 (losing the tie 3–1 on aggregate).|$|E

5|$|The Second World War {{meant that}} {{construction}} {{work on the}} main college buildings could not begin until 21April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings {{had to be made}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{they were}} ordered to Roslavl, {{south-east}} of Smolensk, but this was soon changed to Yelnya, east of Smolensk. When they reached Smolensk, they marched on through Yartsevo to Safonovo before being ordered to turn north towards Bely to help stop a Soviet breakthrough south of Rzhev. At {{the head of the}} division, the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment attacked off the route of march towards elements of the 1st Panzer Division holding out around the village of Komary. The fighting continued in snowstorms and extreme cold until 16 December, with Mickl forward directing the battle, which ended with the destruction of eight Soviet tank and rifle brigades in the Bely area. After a few days rest, on 23 December Mickl's regiment marched to the north-east of Bely to stop Soviet forces moving into the Luchesa river valley. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain and weather conditions, the regiment was exhausted from constant fighting over hamlets that often changed hands. On 30 December, the fighting escalated as the Red Army forces in the sector were reinforced, and Mickl's II Battalion was forced to temporarily withdraw into the surrounding forest. Fierce fighting continued until the 12th Panzer Division was detached at short notice on 14 January 1943, but not before the divisional staff had reported Mickl's brave leadership in the fighting to the Oberkommando des Heeres (German Army High Command). On 16 January 1943, the division was on the move, this time headed north-west to Velikiye Luki, but its move to the front was countermanded.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{followed}} up on the victory at Cerquín by sending two companies of soldiers to the Comayagua valley, {{under the command of}} Xuárez de Ávila and Alonso de Reinoso. He sent more soldiers into the mountainous regions around San Pedro, and personally commanded forays around Gracias a Dios to eliminate any isolated pockets of resistance there. The campaign in the Comayagua valley proved difficult; the Spanish were hindered by the broken terrain, while the natives were still determined to resist and had established fortified mountaintops in a similar fashion to the Peñol de Cerquín. In spite of supplies provided by Montejo, food was scarce, and it was difficult to replenish their stocks locally in the face of native hostility. The Indians launched fierce assaults from their fortresses, then would retreat to their mountain-tops, raining showers of arrows and boulders upon the attacking Spanish. Cavalry were nearly useless <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain, and the Spanish were forced to resort to foot soldiers supported by light artillery. In response to the difficulty of the campaign, the two Spanish expeditions under Xúarez and Reinoso joined into a combined force. Cáceres had now returned to Gracias from the Peñol de Cerquín, so Montejo sent him to Comayagua with a strong detachment of soldiers and plentiful supplies. Although the campaign in the Comayagua valley drew on into 1538 without a decisive victory, the Spanish were able to reestablish the town of Santa María de Comayagua.|$|E
