25|$|In 1960, {{during an}} <b>inspection</b> <b>visit</b> to Portuguese India and {{referring}} to a predictable start of guerrilla activities in Angola, the Under Secretary of State of the Army Costa Gomes stated the necessity to reinforce the Portuguese military presence in that African territory, partly {{at the expense of}} the military presence in Goa, where the then existing 7,500 men were too many just to deal with anti-Portuguese actions, and too few to face an Indian invasion, which, if it were to occur, would have to be handled by other means. This led to the Portuguese forces in India suffering a sharp reduction to about 3,300 soldiers.|$|E

[...] On 16 June 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $1.75 million to construct an airfield next to the Consolidated manufacturing plant. [...] The Army wanted to have the airfield ready quickly before the plant was put into production and construction of the [...] "Lake Worth Bomber Plant Airport" [...] began almost immediately.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} studies into effects and side effects of control mechanisms in education. We focus on effects and side effects of <b>inspection</b> <b>visits</b> and public performance indicators. A first conclusion is that the studies do not {{provide us with a}} clear {{answer to the question of}} whether <b>inspection</b> <b>visits</b> have positive causal effects on quality of schools. Results of studies on publications of public performance indicators are more unambiguous. They lead us to draw the conclusion that, although principals and teachers believe performance indicators are important, parents and pupils take very little notice of these indicators when choosing schools. A third conclusion concerns the occurrence of side effects of school inspections and other control mechanisms in education. A number of the studies discussed clearly refer to the existence of these side effects, like 'window dressing' and other types of 'gaming'...|$|R
