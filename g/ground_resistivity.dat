30|$|From the {{scientific}} and technological aspect, GIC studies are interdisciplinary and include research in Earth’s electromagnetism, magnetospheric and ionospheric physics, interplanetary physics, and solar physics. The GIC {{is determined by the}} geomagnetically induced electric field (GIE) and the DC characteristics of the electric power grid. GIEs are controlled by magnetic variations in the ground and the Earth’s resistivity. Ground magnetic variations are composed of magnetic variations caused by magnetospheric and ionospheric disturbances and by currents induced in the ground. The magnetospheric disturbances in turn are driven by coronal mass ejections and other solar disturbances transmitted through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the effective application of a GIC study (e.g., disaster mitigation) requires assessment of how large and how often severe GICs occur in a specific area. Thus, the frequency of severe space weather events also needs to be characterized. At the same time, the heterogeneous distribution of the <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> is important to assess local enhancements of the GIE. Scientists try to understand extreme space weather and predict a realistic GIC, and this special issue of 19 papers publishes recent research achievements about extremely severe space weather and the GIC in the realistic heterogeneous <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> structure.|$|E

Both the <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> and the conductivity of the discharged groundwater indicated that the freshwater–saltwater interface moved towards offshore at high tide, i. e. in the direction opposite to commonly made observations. SGD comprised a combination of Submarine Fresh Groundwater Discharge (SFGD) of terrestrial origin, and of Recirculated Saline Groundwater Discharge (RSGD) of marine origin. The maximum of the terrestrially derived fraction SFGD/SGD was found at a distance of 50 m offshore. A lower SFGD/SGD ratio was found closer to shore, where the highest SGD flux was measured.

40|$|Direct and {{indirect}} lightning events result in transient disturbances in electric power systems that may cause damages {{of the components}} of the power system and interruptions of the power supply. The resistivity and permittivity of the ground have a significant influence on these transient disturbances due to both lightning events. In order to study this influence, five research tasks have been implemented using the finite-difference time-domain method. The 1 st and 2 nd tasks are relevant to indirect lightning problems where lightning-induced voltages (LIVs) on overhead lines have been investigated due to nearby return strokes on the ground. The 3 rd and 4 th tasks are related to direct lightning problems where the electromagnetic fields have been studied due to direct stroke to a grounding system and a grounded wind turbine (WT) considering the impact of the horizontal stratification of the ground. The 5 th one includes both direct {{and indirect}} lightning problems where the electromagnetic fields are studied for a grounded WT struck by a return stroke beside a nearby overhead line. For a proper design of the overhead line insulation, it is required to accurately compute LIVs. The influences of the <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity,</b> permittivity and the rate of rise of lightning current are investigated on the lightning electromagnetic fields and LIVs impinging overhead lines. A formula has been proposed to calculate the peak values of LIVs due to the typical first and subsequent strokes in the IEEE Standard 1410 - 2010 considering high values of <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity.</b> The proposed formula is applied to calculate the indirect lightning performance in terms of an annual number of flashovers per 100 km of the overhead line. The grounding system is essential for effective lightning protection against direct strokes so the effect of <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> and permittivity on the impedance of grounding systems has been studied. Such study is extended to investigate the lightning-electromagnetic fields on the cable sheath in a wind farm due to a lightning stroke striking a grounded WT. The impact of connecting the grounding systems of the WTs on mitigating these electromagnetic fields has been also investigated. For the horizontally stratified ground case, it is found that the reflections at the boundary between the two layers affect these electromagnetic fields significantly. Since overhead lines may exist nearby WTs, the influence of <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> and permittivity on LIVs and electric fields impinging the line is studied due to a return stroke striking a nearby grounded WT. The first and subsequent strokes are adopted for this study besides the consideration of the horizontally stratified ground case...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using time-domain airborne electromagnetic and <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> methods in geological mapping in tropical terrains is investigated. The investigation {{is based upon}} evaluation of the linear inverse theory in the determination of physical parameters of the weathered layer necessary for interpretation of underlying lithology. Inversion of <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> sounding data from the greenstone belt in western Kenya yields conductivities and thicknesses {{that are consistent with}} geology. A similar inversion of modelled time-domain airborne electromagnetic data shows that conductivity, thickness and depth {{to the top of the}} conductive weathered layer can be uniquely determined if its response does not suffer the thin sheet response problem. The results further show that this problem can be quite common in tropical regions since much of the weathered layer has low conductivity and thickness and, consequently, the response is weak. In this situation, conductivity and thickness are correlated and conductivity-thickness product is better determined than these two parameters independently. By virtue of the weak time-domain AEM response of the weathered layer, much of the response remains buried in noise. This situation introduces further complications for an inverse problem that is highly non-linear. A method for reducing some of this noise before carrying out the inversion is presented...|$|E

40|$|The capacitively coupled (CC) {{resistivity}} {{method is}} an emerging geophysical technique for near-surface investigations. However, {{there are two}} major problems associated with using the CC resistivity (line antenna) system in ground investigations. These two problems are (1) the geometrical factor and (2) measurement biases. We first derive the geometric factor for the line-antenna array in a dipole-dipole configuration. The new expression of the geometric factor considers the separation between the two current (and the two potential) line antennas, thereby improving the accuracy of the measured apparent resistivity. Second, from the electroquasistatic point of view, a quadruline model that can describe the characteristics of the CC resistivity (line antenna) system is derived based on the previously published quadrupole model. The validity of the quadruline model is verified experimentally. Based on the quadruline model, it is found that the dielectric properties of the line-to-ground capacitor and the ground permittivity produce measurement bias at low and high current frequencies, respectively. If the operating current frequency is around the kHz range and the <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> is relatively high, such as in permafrost areas, the ground permittivity can also create measurement bias to cause the actual value to be underestimated. The experimental results and the predictions by the quadruline model suggest that the measurement bias induced by the gap between the line antenna and the ground surface becomes significant and cannot be ignored as the gap height is large and the associated <b>ground</b> <b>resistivity</b> is low. In general, the CC resistivity (line antenna) measurements are not biased by the gap effect when the gap height is less than 0. 01 m, which can easily be achieved for tests on flat ground...|$|E
