40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unique flywheel-based regenerative energy recovery, storage and release system {{developed at the}} author's laboratory. It can recover and store regenerative energy produced by braking a motion generator with intermittent rotary velocity such as the rotor of a wind turbogenerator subject to intermittent intake wind and the axels of electric and hybrid <b>gas-electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> during frequent coasting and braking. Releasing of the stored regenerative energy in the flywheel is converted to electricity by the attached alternator.

40|$|Understanding {{consumer}} behaviour {{is essential in}} designing policies that efficiently increase the uptake of clean technologies over the long-run. Expert opinion or qualitative market analyses {{have tended to be}} the sources of this information. However, greater scrutiny on governments increasingly demands the use of reliable and credible evidence to support policy decisions. While discrete choice research and modeling techniques have been applied to estimate consumer preferences for technologies, these methods often assume static preferences. This study builds on the application of discrete choice research and modeling to capture dynamics in consumer preferences. We estimate Canadians' preferences for new vehicle technologies under different market assumptions, using responses from two national surveys focused on hybrid <b>gas-electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The results support the relevance of a range of vehicle attributes beyond the purchase price in shaping consumer preferences towards clean vehicle technologies. They also corroborate our hypothesis that the degree of market penetration of clean vehicle technologies is an influence on people's preferences ('the neighbor effect'). Finally, our results provide behavioural parameters for the energy-economy model CIMS, which we use here to show the importance of including consumer preference dynamics when setting policies to encourage the uptake of clean technologies.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{undertaken to}} establish plausible fuel-speed curves (FSC) for hypothetical advanced power train vehicles. These FSC {{are needed to}} account for the effects of congestion in long-term transportation scenario analysis considering fuel consumption and emissions. We use the PERE fuel consumption model with real-world driving schedules and a range of vehicle characteristics to estimate fuel economy (FE) in varying traffic conditions for light-duty internal combustion engine (ICE) <b>vehicles,</b> hybrid <b>gas-electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (HEV), fully electric vehicles (EV), and fuel cell vehicles (FCV). FSC are fit to model results for each of 145 hypothetical vehicles. Analysis of the FSC shows that advanced powertrain vehicles are expected to perform proportionally better in congestion than ICE vehicles (when compared to their performance in free-flow conditions). HEV are less sensitive to average speed than ICE vehicles, and tend to maintain their free-flow FE down to 20 mph. FE increases for EV and FCV from free-flow conditions down to about 20 - 30 mph. Beyond powertrain type differences, relative FE in congestion is expected to improve for vehicles with less weight, smaller engines, higher hybrid thresholds, and lower accessory loads (such as air conditioning usage). Relative FE in congestion also improves for vehicle characteristics that disproportionately reduce efficiency at higher speeds, such as higher aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. In order to implement these FSC for scenario analysis, we propose a bounded approach based on a qualitative characterization of the future vehicle fleet. The results presented in this paper will assist analysis of the roles that vehicle technology and congestion mitigation can play in reducing fuel consumption and emissions from roadway travel...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} emissions and fuel economy legislation, {{both in the}} United States and globally, the search for alternative propulsion systems is escalating. Electric, hybrid gas-electric, fuel cell, and other possible automotive propulsion technologies are continually being evaluated for their merit in a more "environmental society". Investigating these technologies requires both specific evaluation and broad comparative techniques. Currently, most codes associated with hybrid vehicle technology focus on fuel economy, this being the economic driver in the market. Its brother variable, emissions, has been investigated to a lesser degree. Hence, this study will focus on hybrid gasoline-electric system emissions and will examine what determines the magnitude of hybrid emissions and compare these to the emissions of a conventional vehicle of similar scope. Several varieties of emissions estimation methods exist. Many attempt to forecast such levels using a quasi steady-state approach; looking at each time-step independently with no memory of previous results. However, engine transient behavior has a large impact on emissions production. The highest engine-out emissions result from the severe changes in the engine power the vehicle-driving pattern requires. Additional transients occur by a <b>gas-electric</b> hybrid's <b>vehicle</b> constant state of change; turning the engine on and off when necessary. Thus, it is imperative when modeling hybrid vehicle emissions to use a "transient" investigation method. In addition to modeling transient engine (emissions) behavior (modeled {{as a function of}} the propellant mixture's air-fuel ratio), a transient catalyst model is included. This allows different control methodologies and improvements in current automobile catalytic converters to be assessed. Such technology is only beginning to be studied and modeled. Yet, it is important to do so, as hybrid technologies will seek to use the best new products available. In conclusion, it is shown that hybrid technology is superior to its conventional counterparts in the emissions arena. Doing so will substantiate criticism of current transportation technologies in favor of new hybrid technology. Modeling results, coupled with real data will substantiate the code and methodology used. Finally, this study gives the reader an improved understanding of the issues associated with hybrid vehicle emissions. by Martin Edward Kosto. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this {{dissertation}} examines the incidence of tax credits for hybrid vehicles in the United States. A variety {{of state and federal}} tax incentives have been used to subsidize <b>gas-electric</b> hybrid <b>vehicles.</b> I estimate the incidence of these tax incentives using microdata on sales of the Toyota Prius. In order to account for heterogeneity in strategic timing of sales around tax changes, I develop a partial identification methodology which provides sharp bounds on the effect of tax changes. I find that consumers capture nearly all of the benefits. This finding is difficult to explain in a standard rational choice model. I propose an alternative framework based on the possibility that current prices shift future demand in a particular way, which rationalizes the empirical findings. The second chapter, written with Rebecca Blank and Kerwin Charles, investigates the response of young people in the United States to state laws dictating the minimum age at which individuals could marry. Our analysis focuses on how individuals avoided binding laws, which is revealed by broad discrepancies between marriages reported in survey and administrative data. We provide evidence that individuals both traveled across state boundaries and lied about their age in order to avoid binding laws. Our results have important implications about the quality of administrative data when it is poorly monitored; about the effect of laws when agents can avoid them; and about the validity of estimates using cross-state variation in laws as an instrumental variable. The third chapter, written with Alexandra Resch and Paul Courant, studies how a social planner should allocate students and resources throughout a higher education system. We posit a distribution of student ability and a limited pool of resources and demonstrate the optimal rules for establishing, populating and funding universities. If student ability and school resources are complements, {{and if there is a}} fixed cost to establishing a school, then the optimal allocation will involve a tiered system of higher education that sorts students by ability. In contrast to previous research, we show this tiered system is optimal even in the absence of peer effects...|$|R
40|$|Policy-makers, {{transportation}} researchers, {{and activists}} often assume that traffic congestion mitigation results in reduced vehicle emissions without proper justification or quantification of the benefits. If congestion mitigation {{is going to}} be tied to air quality goals, {{a better understanding of the}} impacts of traffic congestion on motor vehicle emissions is needed. This research addresses that need by investigating under which circumstances the commonly held assumption linking congestion mitigation to emissions reductions is valid. We develop and apply a mathematical framework to study the trade-offs between vehicle efficiency and travel demand that accompany travel speed changes. While the exact relationships among emissions, travel speed, and travel demand vary with location and pollutant, several consistent results arise. The potential for marginal emissions rate reductions through average travel speed adjustments is small for speeds between about 25 and 70 mph. Emissions rate sensitivity to speed increases with the fraction of heavy-duty vehicles and for certain pollutants (gaseous hydrocarbons and particulate matter), and decreases with the fraction of advanced-drivetrain vehicles, such as electric and <b>gas-electric</b> hybrid <b>vehicles.</b> But travel volume is also a key consideration for the total emissions impacts of congestion and congestion mitigation. While travel speed increases are generally expected to increase efficiency, they are also expected to increase vehicle travel volume as a result of induced demand. To explore efficiency and volume trade-offs we look at emissions break-even conditions for average speed and travel demand elasticity. Depending on the pollutant and the vehicle fleet, total emissions are only expected to decrease with increasing travel speed for initial conditions of both low demand elasticity and low average speed. Thus, higher levels of congestion do not necessarily increase emissions, nor will congestion mitigation inevitably reduce emissions. This result includes projects that seek to increase vehicle throughput from existing roadway supply through better traffic management and operations. Congestion mitigation through reduced vehicle volumes, on the other hand, presents the opportunity for additive emissions benefits through efficiency improvements and total Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) reductions. Comparing capacity-based congestion mitigation strategies with alternative emissions reduction strategies we show that where emissions reductions are possible through speed increases, the emissions benefits are likely to be more easily and cost-effectively attained by other strategies. A sketch analysis of vehicle-class segregated facilities shows that truck-only lane strategies consistently out-perform general-purpose/mixed-flow lane strategies in terms of emissions reductions. An analysis of several congestion-related performance measures shows that for reflecting emissions impacts, VMT is an essential component of performance. Thus, alternative congestion metrics such as total/excess travel distance and travel time are preferable emissions performance indicators to speed or distance-normalized delay. The Travel Time Index, in particular, poorly reflects emissions changes on congested roadways. This thesis offers several original contributions to the body of knowledge regarding congestion and emissions. First, it describes a parsimonious conceptual framework for assessing the effect of congestion on emissions. Then from that framework, several simple and original equations are presented which can be used for sketch-level planning to estimate emissions impacts from congestion mitigation. Finally, application of the framework provides quantitative support for the decoupling of congestion and emissions mitigations...|$|R
