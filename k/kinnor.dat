While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the Bible and the Talmud. The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (pipes) and <b>kinnor</b> (lyre).

2500|$|Vasile Pogor's roots were in Romanian Orthodoxy: {{his father}} was ktitor of the Misești Church. Pogor Jr was himself a student of Christian history, but his main focus was on Judaism, the Hebrew Bible, and the Christian Old Testament. He kept {{detailed}} notes on the minutiae of biblical lore, making notes about Gog and Magog, the <b>Kinnor,</b> the Purim etc. Albeit fascinated by Jewish and Buddhist practices, the poet was mainly a Freethinker, seen by Vianu as [...] "of a Voltairian and Positivist extraction." [...] The theories of Auguste Comte and positivist language in general were welcomed by Pogor and the other core Junimists even though, as Zigu Ornea notes, the leading exponents of Positivist discourse were secondary Junimists (Nicolae Xenopol, George Panu).|$|E

The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia also notes that the early church fathers agreed the cithara (<b>kinnor)</b> had its resonator in the lower parts of its body. Like the nevel, the <b>kinnor</b> likely consisted of a soundboard with two arms extending parallel to the body, with the arms crossed by a yoke from which the strings extend down to the body.|$|E

5000|$|Isaac Gorni (or Isaac ben Abraham haGorni) was a late thirteenth-century Hebrew lyric poet from Aire-sur-l'Adour in Gascony, then {{ruled by}} the English Prince Edward. His surname derives from the Hebrew goren, [...] "threshing floor", the Occitan for which is aire, as in his birthplace. He was widely travelled. In Provence he journeyed through Arles, Aix, Manosque, Carpentras, Apt, and Draguignan. He also went into Languedoc and Catalonia sojourning in Narbonne, Perpignan, and Luz. His habit was to enjoy the {{hospitality}} of the local Jewish community in return for entertaining it. He also accompanied himself on the <b>kinnor,</b> which was tied to his shoulder. He was not always successful, and his poems often record the ingratitude he encountered.|$|E
5000|$|Vihuelists {{began playing}} their flat-edged {{instruments}} {{with a bow}} {{in the second half}} of the 15th century. Within two or three decades, this led to the evolution of an entirely new and dedicated bowed string instrument that retained many of the features of the original plucked vihuela: a flat back, sharp waist-cuts, frets, thin ribs (initially), and an identical tuning—hence its original name, vihuela de arco; arco is Spanish for [...] "bow".An influence in the playing posture has been credited to the example of Moorish rabab players.The viol is unrelated to the much older Hebrew stringed instrument called a viol (literally, [...] "skin"). This ancient harp-like instrument was similar to the <b>kinnor</b> or nabla.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} synagogal {{music of}} which we have any account {{was based on the}} system used in the Temple in Jerusalem. The Mishnah gives several accounts of Temple music. According to the Mishnah, the regular Temple orchestra consisted of twelve instruments, and a choir of twelve male singers. The instruments included the <b>kinnor</b> (lyre), nevel (harp), shofar (ram's horn), ḥatzotzᵊrot (trumpet) and three varieties of pipe, the chalil, alamoth and the uggav. The Temple orchestra also included a cymbal (tziltzal) made of copper. The Talmud also mentions use in the Temple of a pipe organ (magrepha), and states that the water organ was not used in the Temple as its sounds were too distracting. No provable examples of the music played at the Temple have survived.|$|E
5000|$|Letteris' chief poetical work in German, Sagen aus dem Orient (Karlsruhe 1847), {{consisting}} of poetic renderings of Talmudic and other legends, secured for him, though {{for a short}} time, the post of librarian in the Oriental department of the Vienna Imperial Library. His reputation as the foremost poet of the Galician school is based on his volume of poems Tofes <b>Kinnor</b> we-'Ugab (Vienna, 1860), and especially on his Hebrew version of [...] "Faust," [...] entitled [...] "Ben Abuya" [...] (ib. 1865). He exerted a considerable influence on Hebrew poetry. One of his best poems is his Zionistic song Yonah Ḥomiyyah, became very popular. His numerous translations are of value, but his original poems are as a rule prolix. His Hebrew prose is correct, though heavy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{region in}} turn {{gave rise to}} the English name for the [...] "Sea of Galilee" [...] {{referred}} to as such in many languages including ancient Arabic.

The scholarly consensus though is that the origin of the name lies with the important Bronze and Iron Age city of Kinneret, excavated at Tell el-'Oreimeh.

40|$|If {{musicology}} is {{a relatively}} young discipline, having originated in the nineteenth century, the archaeology of music could be considered one of its younger offspring. For Israelis, archaeology is a national pastime. The late Professor Yigael Yadin even {{saw it as a}} substitute for religious belief, as Amos Eilon claimed in his book on the Israelis (1971). However, the knowledge of ancient music was traditionally based solely on the biblical text, wrapped in a network of myths, unscientific etymologies, and anachronistic interpretations. Bible translations throughout the generations {{on the one hand and}} the modern revival of Hebrew as a spoken language on the other have only reinforced the terminological confusion. The first biblical mention of music (Gen. 4 : 21) presents Yuval as “the father of all such as handle the harp [Hebrew: kinnôr] and organ [Hebrew:‘ugab; Septuaginta translation: organon]. ” But what instruments do these names actually refer to? Hebrew speakers would have no doubt that <b>kinnôr</b> is the modern violin and ‛ugab the present-day organ, but certainly the biblical author was not alluding to those instruments. Today, archaeologists agree that the <b>kinnôr</b> belong...|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} I interpret musical motifs and {{images in the}} Book of Isaiah. The main musicological part of the text precede {{comments}} on biblical prophecy, symbolic acts (among them acts connected with music) and Isaiah, the prophet living in the VIII century BC. The research material – eleven passages where musical instruments are mentioned (ḥālîl, šōpār, tōp, <b>kinnôr,</b> nēbel), has been divided into three groups. In the first one (2  passages) I discuss the topos of shofar as the signalling tool, in the second (6 passages) I undertake research into ancient music performance practice. In the last group I examine three passages where musical instruments form parts of the simile, a figure of speech. All musical motifs and images are presented in broad biblical, theological and cultural contexts. Although the music in the Book of Isaiah is linked with drunkenness (Isaiah 5,  12, 24,  10), prostitution (Isaiah 23, 16), associated with the hostile powers (Isaiah 14,   1, 30, 32), it „sounds” ad maiorem Dei gloriam (Isaiah 30, 29, 38, 20), it is not unwanted art (non grata). The negative image of the music can not {{be associated with the}} shofar (Isaiah 18 : 3, 27, 13, 58, 1) ...|$|E
