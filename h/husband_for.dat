5|$|Fulk {{returned}} to Antioch when Zengi dispatched Sawar, governor of Aleppo, {{to invade the}} principality in 1132 or 1133. After defeating the invaders, Fulk entered Antioch. Since the principality needed a firm government, the Antiochene noblemen approached Fulk to select a <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> Constance. He chose Raymond of Poitiers, the younger son of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine. He did not announce his decision in public {{because he wanted to}} prevent Alice and RogerII of Sicily from intervening.|$|E

John appointed Odo of Montbéliard as a bailli to administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Brown rarely makes {{official}} appearances {{either with}} or without her husband. She is patron of several charities and has written articles for national newspapers related to this. At the 2008 Labour Party Conference, Sarah caused surprise by taking to the stage to introduce her <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> his keynote address. Since then her public profile has increased.|$|E

Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle {{in the autumn of}} 1891 coincided with a visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse, heir to the grand ducal throne of Hesse.

5|$|A {{year later}} {{she arrived in}} Paris to attend the École Normale de Neuilly. The school {{provided}} its female pupils with classes in chemistry and bookkeeping, in addition to traditionally feminine arts such as embroidery. Her roommate was Noémie, the daughter of Henri Rochefort, who had been imprisoned in New Caledonia for his support of the Paris Commune. The girls shared tales of their parents' political exploits, and remained good friends for years. Pankhurst was so fond of Noémie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour boarder. Noémie had married a Swiss painter and quickly found a suitable French <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> her English friend. When Robert Goulden refused to provide a dowry for his daughter, the man withdrew his offer of marriage and Pankhurst returned, miserable, to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also {{toyed with the idea of}} abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E
5|$|Dylan McAvoy {{grew up in}} Darien, Connecticut, and befriended Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) {{during his}} childhood. He moved to Chicago and as a young adult took over his father's {{construction}} company after he became injured in an accident. He did construction work for Phyllis' sister, defense attorney Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins). Avery's husband, Joe, neglected her and she began an affair with Dylan. Before being deployed overseas with the U.S. Army, Dylan buys Avery a ring and asks her to leave her <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> him, but she refuses, wanting to work on her marriage. Later, Joe finds out about the affair and divorces Avery. While reading a newspaper months later, Avery discovers that Dylan {{had been killed in}} Afghanistan during the war. She moves to Genoa City and begins a relationship with Phyllis' ex-husband, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). After acting mysterious about her past, Avery admits to Nick that she had an affair with Dylan, who had died.|$|E

5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Moore {{worked with}} her <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> {{the third time in}} the comedy Trust the Man, and starred in the true story of a 1950s housewife, The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio. Her first release of 2006 was Freedomland, a mystery co-starring Samuel L. Jackson. The {{response}} was overwhelmingly negative but her follow-up, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men (2006), was highly acclaimed. Moore had a supporting role in the dystopian drama, playing the leader of an activist group. It is listed on Rotten Tomatoes {{as one of the best}} reviewed films of her career, and was named by Peter Travers as the second best film of the decade.|$|E
5|$|In July 1935, Alexander {{married a}} physicist, Norman Alexander, from New Zealand.

5|$|The two {{versions}} of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> their queen Maria. Taking {{advantage of the opportunity}} to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only with the consent of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|Tiga Dara (Indonesian for Three Maidens) is a 1957 Indonesian-language {{musical comedy}} film {{starring}} Chitra Dewi, Mieke Wijaya, and Indriati Iskak. Directed by Usmar Ismail for Perfini, the film follows three sisters {{who live with}} their father and grandmother. When the eldest sister, Nunung, shows no interest in marrying, her family tries unsuccessfully to find a <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> her.

5|$|Various {{candidates}} were put forward {{as a possible}} wife for Ernest. His own father wanted him to look high-up for a wife, such as a Russian grand duchess. One possibility was Princess Clémentine of Orléans, a daughter of Louis Philippe I, whom he met while visiting the court at the Tuileries. Such a marriage would have required his conversion from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism however, and consequently nothing came of it. She later married his cousin Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest was also considered by Dowager Queen Maria Christina as a possible <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> her young daughter Isabella II of Spain, and by Queen Victoria for her cousin Princess Augusta of Cambridge.|$|E

5|$|Vidyadhari is the {{daughter}} of Vijaya Varma, the king of Thejavathi or Tejavati. His minister wants the princess to marry his son but she refuses. Annoyed, the minister sets out to find another potential <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> Vidhyadhari. In the forest, the minister finds an illiterate cowman sitting in a tree and cutting into the branch on which he is sitting.

5|$|Around 1871 Nathalie {{took the}} {{children}} and left her <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> Trophimowsky, who had abandoned his own wife and family. They left Russia, staying in Turkey and then Italy before settling in Geneva. Around 1872 Nathalie gave birth to Augustin; deMoerder, who came to Switzerland in a failed attempt to reconcile with Nathalie, accepted the son as his own and allowed him to have his surname, but the boy's older siblings believed that Trophimowsky was the father. General deMoerder died several months later, and despite their separation had arranged for his estate to pay Nathalie a considerable regular income. The family remained in Switzerland. Four years later Eberhardt was born, and was registered as Nathalie's illegitimate daughter. Biographer Françoise d'Eaubonne speculated that Eberhardt's biological father was the poet Arthur Rimbaud, {{who had been in}} Switzerland at the time. Other historians consider this unlikely and find it more likely that Tromphimowsky was the father, noting that Nathalie and Trophimowsky were rarely apart, that Eberhardt's birth did not impact negatively on their partnership, and that Eberhardt was Trophimowsky's favorite child. Biographer Cecily Mackworth speculated that Eberhardt's illegitimacy was due to Tromphimowsky's nihilist beliefs, which rejected traditional concepts of family.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{began to}} {{formally}} {{look for a}} new <b>husband</b> <b>for</b> Matilda in early 1127 and received various offers from princes within the Empire. His preference was to use Matilda's marriage to secure the southern borders of Normandy by marrying her to Geoffrey of Anjou, the eldest son of Fulk, the Count of Anjou. Henry's control of Normandy had faced numerous challenges since he had conquered it in 1106, and the latest threat came from his nephew William Clito, the new Count of Flanders, who enjoyed {{the support of the}} French King. It was essential to Henry that he did not also face a threat from the south as well as the east of Normandy. William Adelin had married Fulk's daughter Matilda, which would have cemented an alliance between Henry and Anjou, but the White Ship disaster put an end to this. Henry and Fulk argued over the fate of the marriage dowry, and this had encouraged Fulk to turn to support William Clito instead. Henry's solution was now to negotiate the marriage of Matilda to Geoffrey, recreating the former alliance.|$|E
