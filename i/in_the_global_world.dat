2500|$|To the Western powers, Japan's victory {{demonstrated}} {{the emergence of}} a new Asian regional power. With the Russian defeat, some scholars have argued that the war had set in motion a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>world</b> order with the emergence of Japan as not only a regional power, but rather, the main Asian power. Rather more than the possibilities of diplomatic partnership were emerging, however. The Japanese success increased self-confidence among anti-colonial nationalists in colonised Asian countries – Vietnamese, Indonesians, Indians and Filipinos – and to those in declining countries like the Ottoman Empire and Persia in immediate danger of being absorbed by the Western powers. It also encouraged the Chinese who, despite having been at war with the Japanese only a decade before, still considered Westerners the greater threat. [...] "We regarded that Russian defeat by Japan as the defeat of the West by the East. We regarded the Japanese victory as our own victory," [...] declared Sun Yat-sen. And Jawaharlal Nehru, [...] "Japan's victory lessened the feeling of inferiority from which most of us suffered. A great European power had been defeated, thus Asia could still defeat Europe as it had done in the past." [...] In the Ottoman Empire, the Committee of Union and Progress, embraced Japan as a role model for the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
