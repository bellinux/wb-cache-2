5000|$|The Overdrive Special is a two channel amplifier, {{with a clean}} {{channel and}} a second [...] "{{overdrive}}" [...] channel. This overdrive channel is described as [...] "cascading" [...] from the first channel into at least one additional gain stage in the overdrive channel. This means that the clean channel tone stack and gain stages [...] "cascade" [...] into the gain stage of the overdrive channel, causing the clean channel to become [...] "overdriven". In a sense, the overdrive channel sits [...] "on top" [...] of the clean channel. This is easily Dumble's most popular model, and subsequently is the most frequently seen. That said, the ODS (Overdrive Special) varies considerably from decade to decade, and serial number to serial number. For example, although most ODS amplifiers use 6L6 tubes in the power section (commonly associated with Fender amps), some have EL34 tubes (commonly associated with Marshall amps). On the other hand, even among the many 6L6 versions of the ODS, there are considerable variations. For example, some have a clean channel that stays clean [...] "all {{the way up to}} 10" [...] (referencing a <b>gain</b> <b>potentiometer</b> ranging from 1 - 10). Others have a clean channel that will start to [...] "break up" [...] around 3. Some overdrive channels can only reach a minimal amount of breakup, even when dialed up. However, most ODS overdrive channels have a large amount of tube distortion available if so desired. Along these same lines, many later versions of the ODS have [...] "HRM" [...] controls {{on the inside of the}} amplifier, which is a [...] "Hot Rodded Marshall" [...] tone stack that sits [...] "on top" [...] of the overdrive channel, or in other words comes after the Overdrive channel tube gain stage.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} design, {{simulation}} {{and construction of}} low frequency active crossover for subwoofer and two satellites. The gauging fixture contains functions to set crossover frequency, turn the phase of subwoofer channel and to set gain for all five outputs range from - 20 dB to + 20 dB. In this device are used Butterworth filters of third order with slope 18 dB/oct. This device is cascade three way crossover with adjustable first crossover frequency range from 20 Hz to 200 Hz. The setting of frequency is realize with logarithmic potentiometers. The second crossover frequency has constant value equals to 1970 Hz. In this circuit are used low-noise operational amplifiers NE 5532 N. As regulators of <b>gain</b> are used <b>potentiometers.</b> The phase invertor used principle of changing connection of operational amplifier from inverting to non-inverting. The result of this work is laboratory gauging fixture. This device has built-in I/O BNC connectors and cinch connectors gennerally used in audio technique...|$|R
