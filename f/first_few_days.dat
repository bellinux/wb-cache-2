5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of its adult life {{caring for the}} queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence {{is suggested by the}} high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E

Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led {{to the death of}} innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{local media}} outlets, only Apple Daily and Ming Pao ran {{coverage}} on their front pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that TVB {{did not run}} the story during its prime time news programmes for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke. Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.|$|E
5|$|As Punakha Dzong {{is located}} at only 1,200 meters, you will not suffer from oxygen {{shortages}} as you would in higher places such as Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest), {{so it is a}} good place for beginner hiker to start from, as you may struggle with altitude sickness in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> Punakha is also the center of Bhutan’s longest suspension bridge (Punakha Suspension Bridge) and is about 7.5km (4.5 miles) by car to Chimi Lhakhang, the Divine Madman’s fertility temple.|$|E

5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds {{set a new}} personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, {{and that it was}} operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation {{is known as}} dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> {{in addition to}} antibiotics {{to help with the}} burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
30|$|Theoretically, inert {{materials}} that form a barrier and prevent {{contact between the}} damaged serosal surfaces for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> critical <b>days</b> may allow separate healing of injured surfaces and help {{in the prevention of}} adhesion formation (Schnüriger et al. 2011). One example of such material is Seprafilm, which is composed of hyaluronic acid with carboxymethylcellulose. It turns into a hydrophilic gel 24  h after placement and provides a protective coat for traumatized tissues for up to 7  days (Kamel 2010).|$|R
5000|$|Eucharitids are {{candidates}} for biological control because each subfamily targets a specific ant genus. [...] On the other hand, some eucharitids, including the Kapala genus, {{are classified as}} pests for several different reasons. [...] <b>First,</b> a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after oviposition occurs, the leaves dry up where each egg was located. Second, tealeaves with such marks reportedly do not have as strong of a flavor as tea leaves without these marks.

5|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic {{insects and}} small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small {{enough for the}} young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> {{the newborn}} is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs {{the support of}} its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

5|$|The 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was a Royal Yugoslav Army {{infantry}} formation raised {{prior to}} the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941. It formed part of the Yugoslav 7th Army, and was deployed southwest of Ljubljana in the Julian Alps, along the western border with Italy from Bičke north to Mount Blegoš. It was not heavily engaged during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of the invasion, but from 9 April it withdrew steadily due to withdrawals on its flanks and {{in the face of}} the advancing German XLIX Mountain Corps. Encircled by the 14th Panzer Division linking up with Italian thrusts further west, it surrendered on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|The besieging force outnumbered the JNA {{garrison}} in Varaždin, {{which was}} divided among several barracks, storage depots and other facilities, but the JNA possessed substantially greater firepower. The balance shifted {{in favour of}} the Croatian forces after smaller JNA posts were captured in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of the siege, until only one barracks along with {{the headquarters of the}} JNA 32nd Corps remained under JNA control. At that point, the commander of the 32nd Corps, Major General Vladimir Trifunović, and the civilian authorities in Varaždin agreed that the remaining JNA forces in the city would surrender, but all those wishing to leave would be permitted to do so, leaving their weapons behind.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Barack Obama as the 44th President {{took place on}} January 20, 2009.

He ordered {{the closing of the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W.
