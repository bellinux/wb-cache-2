25|$|The {{economic}} crisis within Paris continued to worsen. A {{trade agreement with}} England in 1786 allowed British manufactured goods to enter France with low tariffs; as a result, many Parisian workers, particularly in the new textile industry, lost their jobs. Riots broke out in April, as unemployed workers wrecked one textile factory, attacked the home of Jean-Baptiste Réveillon, the city's most prominent textile factory owner, and attacked police barricades. Twenty-five rioters and twelve members of the Gardes-Françaises were killed'. The ordinary soldiers of the Gardes, discontented with their role, began to disobey their officers. The weather {{also contributed to the}} distress of the city; the winter of 1788–1789 was exceptionally cold, with an unprecedented ninety-six days of freezing temperatures, reaching to between twenty and thirty <b>degrees</b> <b>below</b> <b>zero</b> Celsius. The price of a four-pound loaf of bread, the standard staple of Parisians, which was 9 sous on 17 August 1788, rose to 14 sous 6 deniers on 1 February 1789.|$|E

Mauldin later became famous for his cartoons during World War II, and won two Pulitzer Prizes for his work. [...] In February 1943 the training moved from Pine Camp to Camp Pickett, Virginia for mountain training, and then to the Atlantic Coast for ship-to-shore training between Norfolk, Virginia and Solomons, Maryland. In early April, while the division was at Camp Pickett, Middleton was sent to North Africa with some of his staff to begin planning the ensuing military operation. Here he went to the headquarters of the Seventh Army commander, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, in Morocco and stayed nearly a month. Patton would command the Seventh Army in the Sicily landings during the summer, and the 45th would be the only combat-loaded division coming from the United States. With the division scheduled to sail from Norfolk on 5 June, Middleton left beforehand to complete the planning for the landing on a hostile shore, this time reporting to the II Corps headquarters of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley in Algiers, Algeria. For this operation, Bradley was subordinate to Patton, under British overall direction. By the time the division arrived in Oran, Algeria, the planning was complete, and the unit was able to run one rehearsal in western Algeria before embarking for Sicily.|$|E

Despite the snow and ice that developed across the borderland, the major International Bridges remained open during the blizzard. Additionally, to help ease the electricity crash across Texas due to the freezing weather, Mexican officials arranged for the transfer of 280 megawatts of power to the United States via utility hookups located in Nuevo Laredo (across from Laredo, Texas) and Piedras Negras, Coahuila (near Eagle Pass, Texas). The cold wave behind the storm's cold front left temperatures plunging to -18 °C (0 °F) in Ciudad Juárez metropolitan area, and in the mountains area plunging to -23 (-9 °F), resulting in the deaths of at least six people in the coldest temperatures recorded in the area in at least half a century.

For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff.

And in this field the supremacy of fresh autogenous grafts is gradually being taken over by homogenous grafts. Evidence of the above trend is eloquently told in bone-banks, being established in rapid succession thoughout the world. Following it's natural course, the utilization of homogenous bones {{has led to the}} preservation of grafts among which drug-immersing and refrigeration are the most important methods to date. One of the freeze methods is a wet preservation at 0 - 5 degree centigrade (Inclan, Kenji Kawamura) and the other a dry deep refrigeration at 10 - 35 <b>degree</b> centigrade <b>below</b> <b>zero</b> (Bush, Wilson, Herbert, Converse and Campbell, Bun'ichiro Kawamura, Utsumi). A comparison between the two has been discussed from the view point of antigen-antibody reaction. In any event, due to the shorter length of preservation of the latter, preferance lies with the former. However since the apparatus required is expensive and the processing is difficult, steps must be taken to overcome the said deficiencies. Modelable Bone (Freez-dried tone chips) originally produced by the author himself in 1951 is a new homogenous graft. It's adaptability in clinical operations enabling it to be modelled into any shape required by adding sodium alginate, CaCl, or a gelatine solution, renders it superior to other homogenous grafts.
