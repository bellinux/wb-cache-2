She was like Millie in her childhood, {{and as a}} result knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with any trouble caused by her, much to Millie's annoyance. While Ms. Mudd knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with Millie, she is also the first to lend her support if there is anything amiss.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers {{about what to do}} if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 {{the term}} design {{management}} {{was first published}} {{in a series of articles}} in the Design Journal. This series includes a pre-publication of the first chapter of the book Design Management by Michael Farr, which is considered as the first comprehensive literature on design management. His thoughts on system theory and project management led to a framework on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with design as a business function at the corporate management level by providing the language and methodology to effectively manage it.|$|E

5|$|The three cannot {{decide what}} to do with Hardenberg and take him to a remote, rarely used cabin {{belonging}} to Jule's uncle in the Tyrolean Austrian Alps near Jenbach, overlooking Achensee. As they try to decide <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.|$|E
5|$|These {{reactions}} {{have also}} {{brought about a}} change in policies. The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the Central Board of Secondary Education to provide extra time to special children—including the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic—during exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12classrooms for autistic students. In Chandigarh, the education administration started a course to educate teachers on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with children with learning disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive {{that it would}} be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the revolt. The King had only a few troops at hand, {{in the form of the}} castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
5|$|King {{shows how}} enslaved {{children}} were educated for survival and resistance. This education was usually informal and parental and taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with slaveowners and their abuse. King also named literacy and religion's {{role in their}} education. Kids were taught mutual cooperation as a virtue between slaves. Few slaves had formal education {{and those who did}} were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk rituals, and hunting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Microencapsulated Phase change {{material}} can absorb and release {{large amounts of}} latent heat over a defined temperature range as its physical state changes. The microencapsulated PCM has high energy density and isothermal behavior during charging and discharging and can avoid the contradiction of the energy supply and demand unbalance in time and space. Meanwhile, the shell can separate the phase change material from the outside environment {{in order to protect}} the core material. But the super-cooling problem is a main barrier for microencapsulated PCM application. So this paper talks about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> with super-cooling based on related literatures and gives an overview about the methodology in this area...|$|R
5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created. It disables detected threats and prompts for user input on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E
5|$|One other point, already mentioned, was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with the}} problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E

5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} the Croatian {{leadership}} on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the JNA's role in the Croatian Serb revolt gradually evolved between January and September 1991.

During the Ten-Day War in June and July 1991, Špegelj once again urged Tuđman to act while the JNA fought Slovenia's TO.

When the final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws, the president invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of Pennsylvania, Virginia and several other states.

5|$|When World WarII {{broke out}} in Europe, it was {{expected}} that the Japanese, who had already made aggressive moves against mainland China, would try to invade the Indies. In response, the Dutch colonial government– which had previously limited military training for native Indonesians– began teaching the populace <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with air raids. To co-ordinate the preparations, the Dutch formed Air Raid Preparation teams. Sudirman, respected in the community, was asked to lead the Cilacap chapter. Aside from teaching local citizens the safety procedures for dealing with an air raid, Sudirman established watchposts throughout the area. He and the Dutch would also have passing aircraft drop materials to simulate a bombing run; this was intended to improve response time.|$|E
