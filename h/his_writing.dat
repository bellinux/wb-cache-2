5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced <b>his</b> <b>writing.</b> One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and <b>his</b> <b>writing.</b> He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>writing,</b> Su Song credited, as the {{predecessor}} of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist. Su Song was also {{strongly influenced by}} the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead {{of water in the}} waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time). However, Su Song stated in <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.|$|E
5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> and his refusal to write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with <b>his</b> <b>writing.</b> A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E

5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) allude to the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> paper with a collar of Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|Glob's book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} both Barry Cunliffe in Nature and Ralph M. Rowlett in American Anthropologist. They praised Glob's arguments {{as well as}} <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> style and use of illustrations, alongside Bruce-Mitford's translation. In subsequent decades, it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field, who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject, but rejected many of Glob's conclusions as being based on insufficient evidence.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>writing</b> {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> and broadcasting work, Agnew's commentary {{has been recorded}} for several computer games, including the International Cricket Captain and Brian Lara Cricket series.

5|$|Israeli writer Amos Oz {{writes in}} his {{biography}} A Tale of Love and Darkness that Winesburg, Ohio had a powerful influence on <b>his</b> <b>writing,</b> showing him that literature must not necessarily always be about heroes.

5|$|Kartodikromo {{was soon}} chosen by Goenawan, chief {{editor of the}} daily Pantjaran Warta, {{to go to the}} Netherlands as a correspondent. In his five months there at the end of 1916 and {{beginning}} of 1917, the journalist published Boekoe Sebaran Jang Pertama (The First Publication Book). After his return to Indonesia, he became an editor for Pantjaran Warta and based himself in Batavia (now Jakarta). Within a month he was imprisoned again for <b>his</b> <b>writing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leoš Janáček's {{literary}} legacy {{represents an}} important illustration of his life, public work and art between 1875 and 1928. He contributed {{not only to}} music journals, but wrote essays, reports, reviews, feuilletons, articles and books. His {{work in this area}} comprises around 380 individual items. <b>His</b> <b>writing</b> changed over time, and appeared in many genres. Nevertheless, the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main area of interest.|$|E
5|$|Lorne Michaels said The Land of Gorch {{characters}} {{had been}} created without {{a set of rules}} or boundaries to govern the storylines. He said he felt <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> staff {{would have been able to}} work more effectively if there had been more guidelines on the characters' behavior and function.

5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often became too opinionated in <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> while {{he was trying to}} get across the results of his experiences.|$|E
5|$|Social life in {{the urban}} setting did not {{initially}} {{live up to his}} expectations, but after a time <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> and lecturing upon a variety of subjects filled the void. He also joined The American Institute for the Advancement of Science and successfully urged its members to establish a section on Political Economics and Statistics. He as well engaged in a debate, as antagonist of Malthusian population theory with proponent Alexander Everett.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{embedded}} his {{own personality}} into <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> and addressed his readers personally, specifically in his travel writings, {{so that his}} reputation was built {{in part because of}} his character. Critics, including his sister in her novel Ruth Hall, occasionally described him as being effeminate and Europeanized. Willis also published several poems, tales, and a play. Despite his intense popularity for a time, at his death Willis was nearly forgotten.|$|E
