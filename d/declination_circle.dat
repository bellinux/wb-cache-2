40|$|The article surveys {{present and}} {{proposed}} search techniques for extraterrestrial intelligence {{in terms of}} technological requirements. It is proposed that computer systems used along with existing antennas may be utilized to search for radio signals over a broad frequency range. A general search within the electromagnetic spectrum would explore frequency, received power flux, spatial locations, and modulation. Previous SETI projects (beginning in 1960) are briefly described. An observation project is proposed in which the earth's rotational motion would scan the antenna beam along one <b>declination</b> <b>circle</b> in 24 hours. The 15 degree beam width would yield a mapping of 75 % of the sky in an 8 -day period if the beam were shifted 15 degrees per day. With the proposed instrument parameters, a sensitivity of about 10 to the - 21 watt/sq m is achieved at a 0 degree declination and 1. 5 GHz. In a second phase, a 26 m antenna would yield an HPBW of 0. 8 degrees at 1 GHz and 0. 03 degrees at 25 GHz. It is noted that the described technology would provide secondary benefits for radio astronomy, radio communications, and other fields...|$|E
50|$|The MUL.APIN {{contains}} catalogues {{of stars}} and constellations as well as schemes for predicting heliacal risings and settings of the planets, and lengths of daylight as measured by a water clock, gnomon, shadows, and intercalations. The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along <b>declination</b> <b>circles</b> and thus measure right-ascensions or time intervals, and also employs {{the stars of the}} zenith, which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences. There are dozens of cuneiform Mesopotamian texts with real observations of eclipses, mainly from Babylonia.|$|R
50|$|The {{stereographic}} projection solves this problem while introducing another. Using this projection the distances between the <b>declination</b> <b>circles</b> are enlarged {{in such a}} way that the shapes of the constellations remain correct. Naturally in this projection the constellations on the edge become too large in comparison to constellations near the celestial pole: Orion will be twice as high as it should be. (This is the same effect that makes Greenland so huge in Mercator charts.) Another disadvantage is that, with more space for constellations near the edge of the planisphere, the space for the constellations around the celestial pole in question will be less than they deserve. For observers at moderate latitudes, who can see the sky near the celestial pole of their hemisphere better than that nearer the horizon, this may be a good reason to prefer a planisphere made with the polar azimuthal equidistant projection method.|$|R

Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena are recorded in the series of cuneiform script tablets known as the 'Enūma Anu Enlil'. The oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is Tablet 63 of 'Enūma Anu Enlil', the Venus tablet of Ammi-Saduqa, which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years and is the earliest evidence that the phenomena of a planet were recognized as periodic. The oldest rectangular astrolabe dates back to Babylonia c. 1100 BC. The MUL.APIN, contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting heliacal risings and the settings of the planets, lengths of daylight measured by a water clock, gnomon, shadows, and intercalations.

50|$|Since the planisphere {{shows the}} {{celestial}} sphere in a printed flat, {{there is always}} considerable distortion. Planispheres, like all charts, are made using a certain projection method. For planispheres {{there are two major}} methods in use, leaving the choice with the designer. One such method is the polar azimuthal equidistant projection. Using this projection the sky is charted centered on one of the celestial poles (polar), while <b>circles</b> of equal <b>declination</b> (for instance 60°, 30°, 0° (the celestial equator), -30°, and -60°) lie equidistant from each other and from the poles (equidistant). The shapes of the constellations are proportionally correct in a straight line from the centre outwards, but at right angles to this direction (parallel to the <b>declination</b> <b>circles)</b> there is considerable distortion. That distortion will be worse as the distance to the pole gets greater. If we study the famous constellation of Orion in this projection and compare this to the real Orion, we can clearly see this distortion. One notable planisphere using azimuthal equidistant projection addresses this issue by printing a northern view {{on one side and the}} southern view on the other, thus reducing the distance charted from the center outward.|$|R
50|$|The Atlas Coeli covers both hemispheres with 16 charts. The {{coordinate}} system {{is referred to}} equinox 1950.0 and the scale is 1° = 0.75 cm. There are six charts of the equatorial regions on a rectangular graticule, covering declinations from +25° to -25°; four charts for each hemisphere with straight, converging hour circles and concentric, equally-spaced <b>declination</b> <b>circles</b> covering <b>declinations</b> 20° - 65°; and, for each hemisphere, a circumpolar chart covering declination 65° to the pole. All stars brighter than 7.75 magnitude are included, {{for a total of}} 32,571. The stellar magnitudes are indicated by circles with graded sizes. Double and multiple stars are identified and visual binaries are differentiated from spectroscopic binaries. All known variable stars are identified, including novae that had maxima brighter than magnitude 7.75 (totalling 443). 249 star clusters are shown and their relative size indicated. All known globular clusters are shown. 1,130 extragalactic systems are included as are many Galactic objects including planetary nebulae. Bright and dark diffuse nebulae are shown, and the actual outlines of those larger than 10' in diameter are painstakingly drawn. The Milky Way and prominent obscuring clouds within it are indicated by isophotic lines. Constellation boundaries are clearly but unobtrusively drawn. The celestial equator and ecliptic are indicated. The brightest radio sources are also shown.|$|R
