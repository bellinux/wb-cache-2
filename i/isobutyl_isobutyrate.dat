40|$|The {{contents}} {{and composition of}} essential oils obtained from Heracleum sosnowskyi and Heracleum mantegazzianum (Apiaceae) were examined. essential oils were investigated by the GC/MS method. The composition of hogweeds’ essential oils was examined {{in order to determine}} toxic compounds that could have a direct influence on the health of people and animals living in close proximity to both species. It was found that the essential oils, except for derivatives of coumarins, contain numerous toxic compounds, e. g. <b>isobutyl</b> <b>isobutyrate,</b> isoamyl butyrate, hexyl hexanoate, 1 -hexadecanol etc. No significant differences were found in the chemical composition of the examined seed samples of Heracleum, which confirms the suggestions that the species can be closely related...|$|E
40|$|Inside a live {{butterfly}} exhibit, {{we conducted}} bioassays {{to determine whether}} the presence of color would facilitate the location of attractants by the butterflies. It was found that color facilitated odor attraction in some species that feed on flowers (Parthenos silvia, Heraclides thoas, Dryas julia, and Idea leuconoe), but not in the exclusively fruit-feeding species, such as Morpho helenor, hence demonstrating that species with different natural diets use different foraging cues. Green, ripe, and fermented bananas were evaluated for their attractiveness to butterflies together with honey and mangoes. The fermented bananas were determined to be the most attractive bait, and the electrophysiological responses to their volatiles were studied in Morpho helenor and Caligo telamonius. During GC-EAD evaluation, fifteen different aliphatic esters, such as <b>isobutyl</b> <b>isobutyrate,</b> butyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, and butyl butanoate (both fermentation products and fruit semiochemicals) were shown to be detected by the butterflies’ sensory apparatus located in the forelegs, midlegs, proboscis, labial palpi, and antennae. Legs, proboscis, and antennae of Morpho helenor and Caligo telamonius showed similar sensitivity, reacting to 11 chemicals, while labial palpi had a lower signal-to-noise ratio and responded to seven chemicals, only three of which produced responses in other organs...|$|E

The relative rate method has been also {{used to measure the}} room temperature rate coefficient for the reaction of Cl with the same esters. In addition, a series of runs conducted on the OH-initiated oxidation of isopropyl formate, isobutyl formate and n-propyl isobutyrate showed the formation of acetone from the three reactions. The formation of propanal was also observed for n-propyl isobutyrate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} foliar {{application}} of different concentrations of amino acids (tyrosine and phenylalanine) and phenolic acids (trans-cinnamic acid, benzoic acid and salicylic acid) on growth, pigment content, hormones levels and essential oil content of Ammi visnaga L {{were carried out}} during two successive seasons. It is clear that foliar application of either amino acids or phenolics significantly promoted the growth parameters in terms of shoot height, fresh and dry biomass, number of branches and number of umbels per plant. The increment of growth parameter was associated with elevated levels of growth promoters (IAA, GA 3, total cytokinins) and low level of ABA. The greatest increase in the previously mentioned parameters was measured in plants exposed to different concentrations of phenols particularly in benzoic acid-treated plants. Such effect was concentration dependent. All treatments led to significant increments in yield seeds and oil content. Moreover, gas liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that the main identified components of essential oil were 2, 2 -dimethyl butanoic acid, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>isobutyrate,</b> α-isophorone, thymol, fenchyl acetate and linalool. Phenolics and amino acid treatments resulted in qualitative differences in these components of essential oil...|$|E
