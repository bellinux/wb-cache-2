2500|$|Gabbard, a {{vice-chair}} of the Democratic National Committee, {{was critical}} of the decision by DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to hold only six debates during the 2016 Democratic Party primary season, compared with 26 in 2008 and 15 in 2004. Some {{have argued that the}} number of debates was intentionally limited in order to bolster Secretary Hillary Clinton's position as the Democratic front-runner, citing Wasserman Schultz's previous position as co-chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as a conflict of interest and a newly created penalty barring further participation in sanctioned debates for any candidate who participates in an unsanctioned debate as an effort to limit public exposure to other candidates. Gabbard appeared on multiple news outlets to express her dissatisfaction with the number of debates. Following her public criticisms, she claimed she was uninvited from attending the Democratic debate in Las Vegas as a result. In a telephone interview with The New York Times, Gabbard stated, [...] "It's very dangerous when we have people in positions of leadership who use their power to try to quiet those who disagree with them. When <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> to be vice-chair of the DNC, no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{appearance}} in the second season, Dane returned to the series in this episode. According to Dane, he was originally hired by the series producers in order to film one episode, but was ultimately asked to return. [...] "As far as I know, I was doing one episode. That's what <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> for. But because of who the character was, {{there was a lot}} of room for him to come back. I got real lucky, they invited me back." [...] When offered the series regular position, Dane was not aware of the character's future on the show, noting the boldness of the character's introduction in the previous season, by contrast to his first {{appearance in the}} third season. Fellow cast member Pompeo offered her insight on Sloan's reintroduction, noting that the inevitability of the character's return was due to his overwhelming popularity, mainly among the female audience, who immediately responded to the concept of the character. Dane only makes a short, uncredited appearance in the episode, seeing his naked character exiting a steamy bathroom. The scene has become one of the most iconic of the series. Dane offered his outlook on the scene, [...] "It was a spectacular entrance. It was all about this brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. Every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E

Marash explained, [...] "To put it bluntly, the channel that's on now - while excellent, and I plan to be a lifetime viewer - is not the channel that <b>I</b> <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> to do." [...] Specifically, he cited the loss of editorial control and his inability to vouch for content that the network was broadcasting, as reasons for his departure.|$|E
