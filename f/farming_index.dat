40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Alley <b>Farming</b> <b>Index</b> (AFI), {{a modification of}} the replacement value of the intercrop (RVI) index. The RVI index is used to assist in determining the ecological and economic benefits of a polyculture system and is potentially useful in intercropping situations where only annual crops are utilized. Alley farming is a modification of the alley cropping system where food crops are planted in between, regularly pruned, widely spaced trees. Unlike the RVI index the modified equation, presented here, accommodates alley farming where perennials {{and the amount of}} tree prunings used as green manure are important parameters. The AFI is presented in two forms, one that assumes a linear relationship between the quantity of tree prunings applied as green manure and annual crop yield, and a second more generalized form which accommodates other relationships between green manure application and crop yield (e. g., logarithmic or parabolic). Although designed specifically for alley farming the modified index can also accommodate alley cropping systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the {{development}} of subsistence agriculture {{is the best way}} to assure food security in developing countries. The objective of this study fits into this logic in that it analyzes the impact of subsistence farming to food security in Cameroon. Data from the FAO and the World Bank over the period 1961 - 2007 were used to formulate a cointegration model between food availability and subsistence framing index based on the ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) procedure. Firstly, the analysis shows that the long-run elasticity of subsistence <b>farming</b> <b>index</b> is 0. 38, higher than in short-run (0. 27). This result confirms the positive impact of subsistence farming on food security in short-run and long-run. Secondly, the trend is significant and positive, meaning that structural variables such as market functioning, {{the development}} of road and market infrastructures etc., positively impact on food security in Cameroon. However, population growth reduces food availability, a factor that could obscure the positive impact of subsistence farming. Therefore it would be necessary to consider a scenario in which the subsistence farming growth rate is higher than the population growth rate...|$|E

40|$|Continued {{biodiversity}} loss necessitates a {{new vision}} for the future of biodiversity conservation, one that includes agriculture. Our current failure to find a shared vision and a common language compounds the challenges facing farmers and conservationists alike. While ecological and cultural barriers to multiple use of arable land exist, quantifying, assessing, and communicating multiple outputs from farm systems has the potential to mediate the conflict between conservation and agrarian communities. Movement towards reconciliation will require practitioners of both fields to progress beyond production and exclusion towards ecosystem management that measures and balances multiple ecological services. Assessing and communicating the value of biodiversity will be {{an essential part of the}} future of farming and conservation. ^ However, incorporation of biodiversity into farm level decision-making has been slow. To engage farmers in consideration of biodiversity, the Healthy <b>Farm</b> <b>Index</b> is presented as an assessment tool for individual landowners. Balancing multiple outputs requires new assessment tools that recognize positive consequences of management decisions and address the multiple choices and constraints that farmers face. Building on past and current research efforts and in cooperation with organic producers in Nebraska and Kansas, the Healthy <b>Farm</b> <b>Index</b> is designed to encompass the multi-functional nature of biodiversity in farm systems. Informed by broad research efforts, this project provides a practical assessment tool to farmers, policy makers, and others interested in assessing ecosystem services on farms. ^ Lastly, building on work comparing species conservation in organic and non-organic systems, we focus within organic systems to better understand how avian species can best be maintained with regards to the spectrum of farming practices that fall under organic certification. Organic management that limits itself to following the most basic USDA regulations cannot make up for an absence of habitat, but organic farms that retain appropriate non-crop habitats contribute to both biodiversity maintenance and food production.

A migrated particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving the two scheduling models. The solution computed by this algorithm determines the operational status and control settings of a wind turbine.

40|$|Statistical {{model of}} wind farms for power flow Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a simplified model {{to represent a}} wind farm in a power flow study. This model has been developed {{taking into account the}} variability in the generated power from windmills and its normal operation. Its main advantages are its simplicity and the possibility of calculating the voltage in the park’s network without having to run a power flow program. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it is based in the fourth-pole theory, widely used in electrical engineering. Finally, the uncertainty of the model is assessed. Up to now, distributed generation in Spain must inject power with unity power factor. But directive is going to change and some feasible regulations for reactive power are studied, attending specially to voltages across the grid.

Although some a priori considerations have been suggested recently, very few real condition studies have been carried out concerning this issue. We therefore ran trials on 1 / 30 th scale models of three-bladed marine current turbine prototypes in a flume tank. Our work focuses on the case where a turbine is placed at different locations in the wake of a first device. The interaction effects in terms of performance and wake of the second turbine are examined and compared to the results obtained on single-device configurations. Besides, we are currently developing a three-dimensional code based on a vortex method, which will be used in the near future to model more complex layouts. The experimental study shows that the second turbine is deeply affected by the presence of an upstream device and that a compromise between individual device performance and inter-device spacing is necessary.

40|$|Abstract—In several countries, {{the wind}} power {{penetration}} increased tremendously {{in the last}} years. As the current wind turbines {{do not participate in}} frequency control nor reserve provision, this may compromise the proper functioning of the primary control and the provision of power reserves. If no actions are taken, increasing levels of wind penetration may result in serious problems concerning the stable operation of the power system. This paper focuses on the provision of power reserves by wind turbines. For this service, the constant power control strategy is chosen as control strategy, as it gives a constant power output and has the ability to provide power reserves. In this way, the wind turbine behaves more like a conventional power plant. The choice of the power reference value is crucial as it determines whether or not a stable operation of the wind turbine is possible and power reserves can be provided. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to obtain the range of possible reference values. By means of simulations, the optimal reference value to provide power reserves with a single wind turbine is obtained. Also, reserve provision in a wind farm is investigated. It is shown that the provision of power reserves with wind turbines using the constant power strategy is possible, especially in wind <b>farms.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Wind energy, Ancillary services, Power control, Power reserves, Wind farm...|$|R

We aimed to develop indices to enable cashmere producers to identify productive goats within their own farms once adjustments had been made for the primary determinants of cashmere production. That is we aimed to develop indices that identify goats and herds that biologically have a high fleece weight in relation to MFD and SL. We used a sample of 1244 commercial cashmere fleeces from goats originating from many Australian farms based in different environmental zones and a previously developed general linear model that related the logarithm of clean cashmere production (CCMwt) and any other potential determinant. In the present study, sub-models were investigated {{in order to develop}} new indices for comparing goats in the same farm, based on fleece characteristics and biological efficiency. New Index (MFD), equal to 6. 02 ×CCMwt/ 1. 1531 MFD, was developed to identify animals of biologically high CCMwt in relation to their MFD. Unlike previously reported results that MFD is not a useful measurement for comparing the biological efficiency of cashmere goats across <b>farms,</b> the New <b>Index</b> (MFD) allows comparison of the biological efficiency of cashmere goats within <b>farms.</b> New <b>Index</b> (SL), equal to 2. 70 × CCMwt/ 1. 1414 SL, was developed to identify animals of biologically high CCMwt in relation to their SL.

In this design, the rotor-side converter (RSC) and grid-side converter (GSC) were utilized to provide the reactive power support to the grid during the fault occurrence. Here, a Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) was utilized to validate the suggested approach under small and large disturbances. Mehta et al. (2015) designed a controller using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for developing the DFIG-based wind power system. The intention {{of this paper was}} to reduce the oscillations in both electromagnetic torque and rotor currents. Here, the oscillation modes of DFIG were analyzed under varying operating conditions such as grid strength and wind speed. In this design, the reason of using MPPT was to extract the maximum power from the wind. Moreover, the torque control scheme was utilized to modify the electromagnetic torque of the generator based on the speed of wind. Also, the voltage control scheme satisfied the requirements of reactive power compensation and too high or too low terminal voltage. Sreedharan et al. (2015) utilized a PSO algorithm for adjusting the grid control settings by maximizing the renewable penetration of all layers in grid. The main focus of this paper was to maintain both line and voltage stability by stabilizing the grid. Here, the optimal loading pattern was identified to determine the instantaneous penetration based on the fitness function. Also, the bus used for connecting the wind <b>farm</b> <b>index</b> was identified by calculating the placement index. Chatterjee et al.
