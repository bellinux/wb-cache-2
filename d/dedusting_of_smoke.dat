Analytical procedure A provided possibilities for determination of fraction of Pb 2 +, metallic lead and fraction containing mainly lead sulfides. The second procedure (procedure B) was sequential extraction in accordance with Tessier. The results obtained in accordance with procedure A indicate that, regardless of the dust origin, the dominant group of Pb compounds is composed of lead salts which are soluble under alkaline conditions or lead compounds that form plumbites in the reaction with NaOH...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we build}} the {{relational}} models between the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier {{and the flow}} of gas, the depth and mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value, respectively. These models {{are based on the}} analysis of gas flow in narrow space <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier which is combined with the classic Hydraulic Jump model in the field of mechanics. For different initial conditions of gas, we simulate the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier height on flue gas flow via the fire dynamics simulation software FDS. The results show that: the air entrainment and the depth <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value are decreasing constantly while the critical mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer is raising during the increasing of the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier. Thus, when it gets the zero value, the air entrainment and the depth <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value will get the maximum and the critical mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer will get the minimum. And when the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier greater than or equal the value of z_ 0, the value of air entrainment will be zero...|$|R
40|$|Smoke derived taint in {{grapes and}} wine {{is an issue}} of {{increasing}} significance and severity for the wine industry internationally. On commencement of this research, insufficient knowledge existed as to the effects <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> on grapevines and the development <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine, with no substantial published information. This research was undertaken to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure to grapevines on the development <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> aromas, flavours and compounds in final wines. As such, this study pioneers the purposeful application <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> to grape bunches and field-grown grapevines to establish the direct link between smoke exposure and the development <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine. This research identified key periods of grapevine sensitivity to smoke uptake as: (1) from shoots 10 cm in length to full-bloom (low levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); (2) from berries pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); and (3) from 7 days post veraison to harvest (high levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint). A novel smoke application methodology consisting <b>of</b> a <b>smoke</b> generator and greenhouse-grade tent was developed to facilitate the accurate application <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> treatments to field-grown grapevines. Smoke treatments were applied to grapevines at key stages during the seasonal growth cycle, on repeated occasions and at a range of densities and durations. Elevated concentrations of guaiacol, 4 -methylguaiacol, 4 -ethylguaiacol, 4 -ethylphenol, eugenol and furfural were detected, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, in wines made from fruit exposed to smoke; whereas these compounds were either not detected or detected in trace concentrations in wines produced from unsmoked (control) fruit. Wine sensory analysis established a difference between smoked and unsmoked wines, with smoked wines exhibiting ‘smoky’, ‘dirty’, ‘earthy’, ‘burnt’ and ‘smoked meat’ aromas. The density and duration <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure to grapevines was found to affect the chemical composition and sensory properties of wine and repeated smoke applications demonstrated a cumulative effect...|$|R

40|$|The acute airway {{response}} to smoking varying numbers (one to four) of identical cigarettes {{in rapid succession}} and smoking single cigarettes of differing tar/nicotine yields was assessed repeatedly in 13 healthy smokers. The airway response was variable, indicating airway narrowing consistently in only three subjects. There appeared no difference between forced spirometry and measurement of airway resistance in detecting the airway response. No relationship was observed between the airway response and amount <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> inhaled into the lungs as measured either by changes in venous blood nicotine or percentage carboxyhaemoglobin. When five smokers inhaled smoke directly from a cigarette acute airway narrowing was consistently observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <b>Smoke</b> {{exposure}} <b>of</b> grapevines {{and development}} <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine are issues of increasing incidence and severity. There is limited {{understanding of the}} effect of phenological stage at the time <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure on taint development. The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the variation in smoke uptake and taint development between and within seasons. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smoke was applied to field-grown Merlot grapevines at 12 stages of vine development over three growing seasons. Key periods of vine sensitivity to smoke taint in wine were (i) from shoots at 10 cm to full bloom (low levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); (ii) from berries at pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); and (iii) between 7 days post-veraison and harvest (high levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of taint in wine varied depending on the phenological timing <b>of</b> grapevine <b>smoke</b> exposure. Taint was elevated when exposure occurred between 7 days post-veraison and harvest. The carry-over <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> constituents the following season was not detectable in wine but yields were reduced. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This is the first study to demonstrate the timing <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure to critically affect wine chemical and sensory characters. These effects were consistent and reproducible over three seasons. K. R. Kennison, K. L. Wilkinson, A. P. Pollnitz, H. G. Williams and M. R. Gibber...|$|R
