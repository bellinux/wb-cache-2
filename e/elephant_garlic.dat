50|$|When {{crushed and}} then {{analyzed}} using a DART ion source, <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> {{has been shown}} to produce both allicin, found in garlic, and syn-propanethial-S-oxide (onion lachrymatory factor), found in onion and leek, but absent in garlic, consistent with the classification of <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> as a closer relative of leek than of garlic.|$|E

50|$|Like regular garlic, <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> can be roasted whole on {{the grill}} or baked in the oven, and then used as a spread with butter on toast. Fresh <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> {{contains}} mostly moisture and foams up like boiling potatoes, whether on the stove or in a glass dish in the oven. Drying in the basement {{for a few months}} reduces the moisture content, and also bring out a fuller flavor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> can {{be planted}} at two {{different}} times of the year: spring and autumn. In warmer areas, it can be grown over winter for a late-spring harvest.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety is}} {{achieved}} by substituting the vegetables. Other popular 'a-chin' are made with baby <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic,</b> white radish stems, garlic chives, cabbage, cauliflower, chili pepper, bean sprouts, unripe mangoes and bamboo shoots.|$|E
50|$|Historically, many {{scientific}} names {{were used for}} leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name 'leek' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word leac. Two closely related vegetables, <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food.|$|E
50|$|The {{immature}} plant tops can be {{topped off}} (cut) when {{the plant is}} young {{and they are still}} tender, as can be done with onions, and chives, along with the very immature flower bud, and are called scapes. They can be pickled, lactofermented, stir fried, added to soups, etc. The scapes (whether <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic,</b> garlic, onion, chive, or garlic chive) can also be frozen without any cooking, and generally remain fresh for a year or so without freezer burn, to be added to any soup, stew, stir-fry, etc. Topping the plants off also helps more of the plant's energy to be directed toward the bulb. Since seed is not generally gathered from <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic,</b> this is the best use of resources and helps the bulb, though it does detract from the aesthetic value. A few scapes can be left to mature to into stalks to flower.|$|E

50|$|Unlike many garlics, <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> {{does not}} have to be {{harvested}} or divided each year, but can be ignored and left in the ground without much risk of rotting. The plant, if left alone, will spread into a clump with many flowering heads (one stalk and flower from each clove, once the bulb divides). These are often left in flower gardens as an ornamental and to discourage pests. Of course, once they get overcrowded, the plant may not do as well, and growth is stunted, with some rotting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> (Allium ampeloprasum var. ampeloprasum) is a {{perennial}} plant {{belonging to the}} onion genus. It is not a true garlic, but actually {{a variant of the}} garden leek. It has a tall, solid, flowering stalk and broad, flat leaves much like those of the leek, but forms a bulb consisting of very large, garlic-like cloves. The flavor of these, while not exactly like garlic, is much more similar to garlic than to leeks. The flavor is milder than garlic, and much more palatable to some people than garlic when used raw as in salads. It is sometimes confused with solo garlic.|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) : The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the antibacterial function and pharmacological effect of <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> (Allium ampeloprasum var. ampeloprasum) on U 2 OS human osteosarcoma cells.   Materials and Methods: Seven kinds of bacteria were reconstituted, inoculated and tested in this research to evaluate <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> antibacterial activity. By the means of FACS analysis, cell proliferation assay, confocal laser scanning microscopy and Transwell migration assays, the effect of <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> against U 2 OS human osteosarcoma cells was unveiled. Rerults: The antimicrobial activity of <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> was stronger than ampicillin when used against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus actinomycetes, and gray actinomycetes. Even at a very low concentration (12. 5 %), <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> still had an antibacterial effect on common bacteria E. coli and S. aureus. The G 0 /G 1 ratio of <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> treated group cells increased while S phase decreased. <b>Elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> extract inhibited the growth of human osteosarcoma cells, U 2 OS, through preventing the transition from G 1 phase to S phase. It reduced osteosarcoma cell, U 2 OS, invasion ability and significantly increased the proportion of apoptosis. It significantly affected the cytoskeleton generation. Conclusion: <b>Elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> exhibits antibacterial property and has an inhibitory effect on osteosarcoma cells (U 2 OS) proliferation and cell activity, suggesting the mechanism of its anticancer effects on U 2 OS human osteosarcoma cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract As a close {{relative}} of garlic, <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> contains abundant allicin, which means the extract of <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> might induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> was extracted in alcohol with Solvent- Microwave Extraction. The main component was analyzed by liquid chromatography. The MCF- 7 (michigan cancer foundation- 7) {{cells were cultured in}} vitro. The apoptosis rate was determined with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining based flow cytometry (FCM). Mitochondrial transmembrane potential variation in the cells was observed with JC- 1 probe and fluorescence confocal microscopy. Caspase- 3 was determined with fluorescence Western Blot. The main component of alcohol extract of <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> was Diallyl Disulfide (DADS), and its relative content was 17. 04 %. The early apoptosis of MCF- 7 cells could be induced by the alcohol extract solutions and it involved the activation of mitochondrial pathway. The results indicated that the extract and DADS standards exerted pro-apoptotic effects on breast cancer cells in a dose-response manner. From the results of fluorescence confocal microscopy, it showed that the Red/Green fluorescence ratio of mitochondrial membrane potential in MCF- 7 cells could be significantly decreased after inducing with DADS reference substances for 24 h. In addition, mitochondrial depolarization could be observed as adding the extract. The activated Caspase- 3 was detected with Western Blot. It was demonstrated that the expression level of procaspase- 3 had gone up with increased concentration of alcohol extract. The expression level was also increased with the treatment of DADS and th...|$|E

40|$|In 1998, {{following}} the very wet EI Niño weather event, a devastating outbreak of rust disease severely damaged the garlic crop in California. The disease also occurred in 1999 and 2000, indicating that rust may have developed into an annual problem. We identified the pathogen as Puccinia allii. In our study, it infected allium {{crops such as}} garlic, onion and chives, but not leek, <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> or shallot. Currently registered materials did not control the disease, but tebuconazole (Folicur) and azoxystrobin (Quadris) provided good protection against garlic rust. Based on our work, a Section 18 emergency exomption for tebuconazole was approved by state pesticide regulators. We tested 34 UC and industry garlic varieties and found that none were completely resistant to garlic rust...|$|E
40|$|However, {{there are}} {{numerous}} cultivated vegetable alliums of more regional importance, including kurrat (A. ampeloprasum var. kurrat) which is eaten as a pickled leaf primarily in Egypt, <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> (A. ampeloprasum var. holmense), rakkyo (A. chinense), and Chinese chives (A. tuberosum) (Jones and Mann 1963). Other minor use Allium species were thoroughly listed by Fenwick and Hanley (1985). Alliums are also cultivated as ornamentals. Well known to gardeners are A. gigantheum, A. aflatunense, and A. caesium, which are prized for their large umbels and many brilliantly colored flowers. Wild and less well-known alliums offer potential as perennial ornamentals, including A. unifolium, A. moly, or A. schubertii. Japanese researchers at the Hokkaido Agricultural Experiment Station have collected these and other unique alliums towards the goal of developing new and beautiful ornamentals. FERTILITY IN GARLIC Garlic is an obligate apomictic plant and is primarily propagated asexually by cloves (Jones and Mann 1963). Flowering garlics can also be propagated by small bulbils that form in the umbel. One {{of the most exciting}} Allium research developments over the last 10 years is the identification and selection of fertile garlic plants. Etoh (1986) described male-fertile garlic plants from Soviet Central Asia. This stimulated research on the environmental conditions conducive to flower induction and the production of true seed in garlic (Poole...|$|E
40|$|The rise in multi-drug {{resistant}} Vibrio cholerae strains is a {{big problem}} in treatment of patients suffering from severe cholera. Only a few studies have evaluated the potential of natural compounds against V. cholerae. Extracts from plants like ‘neem’, ‘guazuma’, ‘daio’, apple, hop, green tea and <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic</b> have been shown to inhibit bacterial growth or the secreted cholera toxin (CT). However, inhibiting bacterial growth like common antimicrobial agents may also impose selective pressure facilitating development of resistant strains. A natural compound that can inhibit virulence in V. cholerae is an alternative choice for remedy. Recently, some common spices were examined to check their inhibitory capacity against virulence expression of V. cholerae. Among them methanol extracts of red chili, sweet fennel and white pepper could substantially inhibit CT production. Fractionation of red chili methanol extracts indicated a hydrophobic nature of the inhibitory compound(s), and the n-hexane and 90 per cent methanol fractions could inhibit > 90 per cent of CT production. Purification and further fractionation revealed that capsaicin {{is one of the major}} components among these red chili fractions. Indeed, capsaicin inhibited the production of CT in various V. cholerae strains regardless of serogroups and biotypes. The quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR assay revealed that capsaicin dramatically reduced the expression of major virulence-related genes such as ctxA, tcpA and toxT but enhanced the expression of hns gene that transcribes a global prokaryotic gene regulator (H-NS). This indicates that the repression of CT production by capsaicin or red chili might be due to the repression of virulence genes transcription by H-NS. Regular intake of spices like red chili might be a good approach to fight against devastating cholera...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityAnalysis of {{bioactive}} and antimicrobial {{components in}} {{vegetables and fruits}} is an important area of food analysis. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy are useful tools for analysis of biological materials, and in this study, the type and activity of selected bioactive compounds in onions and garlics were predicted using FT-IR and SERS spectroscopies. Having a new tool for assessing the composition of antioxidant components and total antioxidant activity is an important development to predict the bioactive properties in fruits, vegetables and commercial food products. Research focused on the properties of Allium sp. (red, white and yellow onions, shallot, garlic and <b>elephant</b> <b>garlic)</b> since these have distinct properties of possessing antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Quercetin concentrations ranged from approximately 400 mg/kg fresh weight to 650 mg/kg fresh weight with red onion having the highest content. Diallyl sulfides provide the greatest contribution to the antimicrobial activity of garlic, contributing roughly 80 % of the overall antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Campylobacter jejuni. For this current project, FT-IR and SERS spectroscopies were used to: (1) determine quercetin, certain quercetin derivatives and total flavonol contents in onion; (2) develop prediction models for the total antioxidant activity in onion and garlic from spectral features and conventional chemical and chromatographic methods; (3) examine the antimicrobial effect of garlic extracts and garlic-derived organosulfur compounds on specific foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Campylobacter jejuni) and compare vibrational spectroscopic results with those from traditional food microbiological methods, morphological assessment, biochemical and immunochemical tests.
