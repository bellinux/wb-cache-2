40|$|A {{framework}} is described for developing and deploying procedural knowledge via a wiki in emergency situations where collaboration is needed. This approach helps reduce uncertainty during <b>emergencies.</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> (SOPs), with manu-als containing procedural knowledge de-scribing {{courses of action}} that should be followed in a given situation. These SOP manuals represent best-practice knowl-edge and are usually written {{by one or more}} experts with extensive experience in the field. Such procedural knowledge can be used to train emergency managers and others. There’s a significant amount of proce-dural knowledge for emergency response available today, mostly in physical form, and ranging in size from a few pages to sev-eral volumes. Although these manuals are considered valuable, there are several practi-cal problems with such documents: •	 Access time. Although these manuals are useful for teaching the procedures they contain, they’re often not utilized dur-ing an actual emergency. This is simply because, during a real emergency, there’s no time to search for information in large manuals. Emergency managers might have read through the SOPs, but under stressful conditions, they might forget op-tions or omit steps. •	 Standard structure. The manuals are of-ten well structured in and of themselves, but there’s no structuring standard in place. Thus, an emergency manager who must be familiar with different SOPs from different sources might find them confusing. Emergency situations usually call for quick and appropriate action to min-imize loss of life and property. However, knowing what these actions should be isn’t always obvious, even if a current, post-disaster situation were known.

40|$|Although station {{black out}} {{conditions}} (i. e. loss of off-site power with simultaneous failure of all diesel generators) {{over a period}} of several hours are very unlikely, analysis of station black out transients and possible countermeasures are important. A well planned <b>emergency</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure,</b> utilizing just equipment powered by batteries, can extend the grace period considerably, and mitigate severe accident progression. Until the occurrence of core damage best estimate thermal hydraulic system codes like Relap 5 or Cathare 2 can give a good picture of the development of the transient. Heat transfer from the primary to the secondary side is one of the dominant phenomena during the first hours of a station black out transient. Primary side pressure stays high, and the decay heat is transferred by natural circulation to the secondary side. The steam generator inventory boils off, and the steam generator level decreases. Modelling of the steam generator therefore is of special importance. The current paper presents an analysis for VVER- 1000 type steam generators (horizontal) with different nodalisation detail and different codes (Cathare 2 and Relap 5). The nodalisation approach has been verified by comparing calculated results to PSB-VVER steam generator experiments. The results show that codes like Relap 5 and Cathare 2, by assuming uniform bulk flow properties over the flow cross section and within volume units, introduce a distortion compared to the real physics in case station black out conditions. The reason lies in the specifics of the horizontal steam generator. While the heat transfer surface decreases continuously in the actual steam generator, the necessity of modelling the steam generator with nodes of finite volume creates a step-wise reduction of the heat transfer surface. The effects on the primary side temperature and pressure trends are not negligible, and decrease with increasing detail of modelling...|$|R

Previous analysis has shown that a well planned <b>emergency</b> <b>operating</b> <b>procedure,</b> utilizing just equipment powered by batteries, can considerably extend the grace period, and mitigate severe accident progression. The current paper presents an analysis with Relap 5 and Cathare 2 system codes of the heat transfer capabilities of horizontal and vertical steam generators during the progression of a station black out transient. A long term station black out transient is characterized by high pressure in the primary side, and removal of the decay heat via natural circulation by the inventory present in the steam generators at the time of the initiating event. Secondary side mass inventory boils down in a certain period of time, depending on the reactor type. Subject of the presented analysis are the dependence of the heat transfer on the level of the steam generator, the different behaviour of horizontal and vertical steam generators in this respect, and the consequences for main primary side parameters such as average coolant temperature and primary pressure. The analysis shows that in natural circulation regime only few centimetres of the U-tubes are needed to cool the primary fluid to the temperature of the secondary side. Vertical steam generators are cooling the primary fluid down to the temperature of the secondary side until the level of the steam generator stays above the U-tubes cooling length. Horizontal steam generators on the other hand show an increasing number of U-tubes completely uncovered with decreasing level. As a result the primary side coolant temperature at the SG outlet is continuously increasing with decreasing SG level. The consequence is a different primary side pressure and temperature trend during a SBO transient in NPP with horizontal and vertical steam generators...|$|R
40|$|Many {{accidents}} {{are attributed to}} human errors. Abundant evidences {{could be found in}} major accidents in petro-chemical, nuclear, aviation, and other industries. In the nuclear power industry, safe operation heavily relies on the operators' interaction with plant systems. For example, Three Mile Island accident was exacerbated by the operators' misdiagnosis of the situation, which led to the termination of the plant's automatic protection system that could have prevented meltdown of the reactor core. Hence, human Reliability Analysis (HRA) is an important ingredient of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), particularly in the nuclear industry. HRA aims to predict possible human errors, identify "error forcing contexts", and assess error probabilities. Despite advances in HRA discipline over the past two decades, virtually all existing methods lack a causal model and few leverage the theoretical and empirical insights for error prediction in a systematic and formal way. One approach that has attempted to address this major shortcoming is IDAC crew simulation model of ADS-IDAC dynamic PRA platform. Through the interactions between an IDAC crew model and a pressurizer water reactor plant model, ADS-IDAC dynamically simulates the operators' cognitive activities and actions in an accident condition. The goal of proposed research is to introduce an advanced reasoning capability and structured knowledge representation to enhance the realism and predictive power of in the IDAC model for situations where crew behaviors are governed by both the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Procedure</b> (EOP) and their knowledge of the plant. This is achieved by: 1) Developing and implementing a cognitive architecture to simulate operators' understanding of accident conditions and plant response, their reasoning processes and knowledge utilization to make a diagnosis. A reasoning module has been added to the individual operator model within IDAC model to mimic operators knowledge-based reasoning processes; 2) Developing and applying a comprehensive set of Performance Shaping Factors (PSF) to model the impacts of situational and cognitive factors on operators' behaviors.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} need to respond and recover from various types of {{emergencies}} including mass casualty events (MCEs), mass toxicological/chemical events (MTEs), and biological events (pandemics and bio-terror agents). Effective emergency preparedness {{is more likely to be}} achieved if an all-hazards response plan is adopted. Objectives To investigate if there is a relationship among hospitals' preparedness for various emergency scenarios, and whether components of one emergency scenario correlate with preparedness for other emergency scenarios. Methods Emergency preparedness levels of all acute-care hospitals for MCEs, MTEs, and biological events were evaluated, utilizing a structured evaluation tool based on measurable parameters. Evaluations were made by professional experts in two phases: evaluation of standard <b>operating</b> <b>procedures</b> (SOPs) followed by a site visit. Relationships among total preparedness and different components' scores for various types of emergencies were analyzed. Results Significant relationships were found among preparedness for different <b>emergencies.</b> Standard <b>Operating</b> <b>Procedures</b> (SOPs) for biological events correlated with preparedness for all investigated emergency scenarios. Strong correlations were found between training and drills with preparedness for all investigated emergency scenarios. Conclusions Fundamental critical building blocks such as SOPs, training, and drill programs improve preparedness for different emergencies including MCEs, MTEs, and biological events, more than other building blocks, such as equipment or knowledge of personnel.
