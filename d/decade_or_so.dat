5|$|The Sejm, until 1573 {{summoned by}} the king at his {{discretion}} (for example when he needed funds to wage a war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became {{in the course of}} the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more sessions of parliament, within the next <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. Some of the changes were too modest, other had never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped Crown land), but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} over the past <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> shows that they teem {{with a wide variety}} of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E

25|$|Until a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> ago, PV {{was used}} {{frequently}} to power calculators and novelty devices.

In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive. Such applications include solar lamps, water pumps, parking meters, emergency telephones, trash compactors, temporary traffic signs, charging stations, and remote guard posts and signals.|$|E
25|$|Forest tent {{caterpillar}} outbreaks tend to recur at reasonably regular intervals every <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> with the precise interval varying somewhat {{in time and}} space. Outbreaks usually last two to four years. Although the insect's distributional range is quite large, the area over which decadal outbreak cycles are synchronized (i.e. oscillating with the same phase) varies substantially. Outbreak cycles are more strongly synchronized in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Where spatially separated populations are phase-synchronized, the synchronization {{is thought to be}} due to the process of entrainment, that is, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomics {{has been}} characterised by the {{development}} of new techniques which have redefined what is possible every <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and render previous technologies obsolete. The first attempt at capturing a partial human transcriptome was published in 1991 and reported 609 mRNA sequences from the human brain. In 2008, two human transcriptomes, composed of millions of transcript-derived sequences covering 16,000 genes, were published and, by 2015, transcriptomes had been published for hundreds of individuals. Transcriptomes of different disease states, tissues or even single cells are now routinely generated. This explosion in transcriptomics has been driven by the rapid development of new technologies with improved sensitivity and economy.|$|E

25|$|Skeptics {{debated whether}} {{breaking}} down formate {{is enough to}} consider the bacteria living. Art Yayanos, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, believes an organism should only be considered living if it can reproduce. Subsequent results from independent research groups have shown {{the validity of the}} 2002 work. This is a significant step that reiterates the need for a new approach to the old problem of studying environmental extremes through experiments. There is practically no debate whether microbial life can survive pressures up to 600 MPa, which has been shown over the last <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to be valid through a number of scattered publications.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> mezcal, {{especially}} from Oaxaca, has been exported. Exportation {{has been on}} the increase and government agencies have been helping smaller-scale producers obtain the equipment and techniques needed to produce higher quantities and qualities for export. The National Program of Certification of the Quality of Mezcal certifies places of origin for export products. Mezcal is sold in 27 countries on three continents. The two countries that import the most are the United States and Japan. In the United States, a number of entrepreneurs have teamed up with Mexican producers to sell their products in the country, by promoting its handcrafted quality, as well as the Oaxacan culture strongly associated with it.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} long-run time series for price {{aggregates}} is, {{that they often}} disregard many qualitative changes in the components of those aggregates, or, {{it is assumed that}} these qualitative changes have no real quantitative significance for comparative purposes. A variable is thought to stay qualitatively the same across time, when in reality it does not remain the same. Michael Perelman, for example, shows that the content and economic meaning of capital aggregates can change considerably even within one <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> For example, the changing stratification of physical capital assets in the total capital stock, in terms of their age, exerts an independent influence on the productivity and profitability of enterprises.|$|E
