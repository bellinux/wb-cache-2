5|$|Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> the war. Growing industrialism, partly spurred on by the war, created a new culture of competition and materialism.|$|E
5|$|South Park {{became one}} of the first {{television}} series to be bootlegged via the Internet, just as The Spirit of Christmas <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> it.

5|$|The Duke of Argyll's health {{continued}} to deteriorate. He became increasingly senile, and Louise nursed him devotedly from 1911.

5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, a coin intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse than it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the late}} 1880s were {{a period of}} growth in the Orange Free State. Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became an important source of income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> him.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act itself did {{not affect}} {{constituencies}} in Scotland or Ireland. However, reforms there were {{carried out by the}} Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of seats in the House of Commons the same as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised {{and the size of the}} electorate was expanded in both.|$|E

5|$|His {{military}} career {{can be traced}} back as far as 1304 when he took part in a campaign in the Scottish Wars. In 1309, he received a royal order to assist Robert de Clifford in the defence of the Marches against Scotland. His standing in local affairs was further advanced in 1311, when he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland, like his father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> him. This was followed by his election as Knight of the Shire in 1312, and in December 1313, he distinguished himself {{as the leader of the}} defence against a Scottish invasion. He received further acclaim in the summer of 1315, when he successfully defended Carlisle Castle against a siege by Robert the Bruce. For this he was awarded a gift of 1000 marks from the king.|$|E
5|$|The partly built nave was {{demolished}} and {{the remaining}} {{eastern part of the}} church closed until it reopened as a cathedral under the secular clergy. In an edict dated June 1542, Henry VIII and Thomas Cranmer raised the building to rank of Cathedral of a new Diocese of Bristol. The new diocese was created from parts of the Diocese of Gloucester and the Diocese of Bath and Wells; Bristol <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> <b>before</b> the Reformation, and the erection of Gloucester diocese, part of the Diocese of Worcester. Paul Bush, (died 1558) a former royal household chaplain, was created the first Bishop of Bristol. The new cathedral was dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity.|$|E
5|$|The whaling {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1857, when New Bedford accounted {{for half the}} U.S. fleet. Growing competition from the new petroleum industry, {{and the impact of}} the Civil War, ensured that it would not recover as it had in the past. The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire, with a new exterior and an added tower. The NBIS building became a local courthouse, and the center of commercial activity in New Bedford moved west, where it has remained, as textiles became the city's dominant industry. The whaling museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907. But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before,</b> and in 1927, the John R. Mantra made the last whaling voyage from the city and the last in American history.|$|E

5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before,</b> or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E
5|$|Ashley Smith (born 29 January 1988, New Brunswick, Canada) {{was adopted}} {{when she was}} 5 days old, and {{according}} to her adoptive parents, Coralee Smith and Herbert Gober, had a normal childhood in Moncton, New Brunswick. Between the ages of 13-14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child; by age 15 she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith was assessed by a psychologist who {{found no evidence of}} mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC). Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5|$|The {{constellation}} {{was known}} by other names. It was called Tubus Astronomicus {{in the eighteenth}} century, during which time three constellations depicting telescopes were recognised—Tubus Herschelii Major between Gemini and Auriga and Tubus Herschelii Minor between Taurus and Orion, both of which {{had fallen out of}} use by the nineteenth century. Johann Bode called it the Astronomische Fernrohr in his 1805 Gestirne and kept its size, but later astronomers Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould subsequently shrank its boundaries. The much-reduced constellation lost several brighter stars to neighbouring constellations: Beta Telescopii became Eta Sagittarii, which it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> Lacaille placed it in Telescopium, Gamma was placed in Scorpius and renamed G Scorpii by Gould, Theta Telescopii reverted to its old appellation of d Ophiuchi, and Sigma Telescopii was placed in Corona Australis. Initially uncatalogued, the latter is now known as HR 6875. The original object Lacaille had named Eta Telescopii—the open cluster Messier 7—was in what is now Scorpius, and Gould used the Bayer designation for a magnitude 5 star, which he felt warranted a letter.|$|E
