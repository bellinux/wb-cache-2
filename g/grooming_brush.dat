50|$|The typical {{cleaning}} method {{involves a}} preconditioning of the soiled surface with an alkaline (7 or above on the pH Scale) agent, followed by light agitation with a <b>grooming</b> <b>brush</b> and appropriate dwell time. Next, {{the surface is}} passed over several times with a cleaning tool (either manual or automatic) to thoroughly rinse out the preconditioner and, using an acetic acid solution, lower the pH of the fibres to a neutral state. Finally, the surface is dried sufficiently to avoid any possibility of saturation.|$|E
50|$|A common {{process of}} hot water {{extraction}} begins with preconditioning. Alkaline agents such as ammonia solution for synthetic carpets, or acidic solution (such as vinegar solution) for woollen carpets, are sprayed into the carpet, then agitated with a <b>grooming</b> <b>brush</b> or an automatic scrubbing machine. Next, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (known as a wand) passes over the surface to rinse out all pre-conditioner, residue, and particulates. If an alkaline detergent is used on a woollen carpet, use of a mild acetic acid solution will restore neutral fiber pH. The acidic rinse thus neutralizes the alkaline residues, and can contribute to softening cleaned fabrics.|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of Palaemon, P. vicinus spec. nov., is {{described}} from the tropical eastern Atlantic. The new species {{is very close to}} P. elegans Rathke, 1837, under which name it was previously recorded from West Africa. Palaemon vicinus spec. nov. is easily separated from P. elegans by possessing a small tooth on the fifth abdominal pleuron (quadrate in P. elegans) and by having 2 - 3 rows of setae in the <b>grooming</b> <b>brush</b> of the fifth pereiopod (4 - 5 in P. elegans). The discovery of the new species amongst material identified as P. elegans further highlights the need to reassess species level characters in the genus Palaemon...|$|E
50|$|Fibermesh is {{a feature}} that allows users to grow polygon fibers out of their models or to make various botanical items. It is also a way to edit and {{manipulate}} large amounts of polygons at once with <b>Groom</b> <b>brushes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Metal curry comb or Fitch curry comb: It is a curry comb made {{of several}} rows of short metal teeth, with a handle. While useful for caked-on mud, {{particularly}} on horses {{with a heavy}} winter coat, they are primarily designed for use on show cattle, and are frequently used to clean horse <b>grooming</b> <b>brushes</b> by moving the brush across the metal curry comb teeth every few strokes. The metal curry comb is not designed for use directly on the summer coat of a horse as the metal teeth can damage the skin and hair. Not {{to be confused with}} the shedding blade, below.|$|R
50|$|GSPs are a {{very clean}} breed. The short GSP coat needs very little <b>grooming,</b> just {{occasional}} <b>brushing.</b> They typically shed constantly. GSPs should be bathed only when needed.|$|R
40|$|Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) and velvet bentgrass (Agrostis canina L.) are the {{principal}} grass species for golf course putting greens in northern latitudes. Wear injury is a major physical stress that limits the function and quality of turfgrass. Wear evaluations in Agrostis species are limited and no {{studies have been conducted}} to evaluate recovery from wear and associated wear mechanisms. To that end, Agrostis species and genotypes were evaluated for wear tolerance and recovery on a golf green built according to USGA specifications. Equal numbers of creeping bentgrass and velvet bentgrass genotypes were tested. Wear was applied using a <b>grooming</b> <b>brush</b> over a 3 -year period and plots were visually rated for wear and recovery. As much as 90 % of the total variation in Agrostis wear tolerance was due to interspecific variation. Velvet entries provided significantly better wear tolerance than creeping bentgrass. Velvet bentgrass genotypes provided acceptable wear tolerance and full recovery in most years with the exception of SR- 7200. None of the creeping bentgrass entries evaluated exhibited acceptable wear tolerance or achieved full recovery. Fourteen Agrostis genotypes, which included equal numbers of creeping and velvet species were selected for further evaluation of anatomical, morphological and physiological characterstics associated with wear tolerance. Eleven characteristics were measured comparing greenhouse grown spaced-plants established from field plots and seed. Characteristics included tiller density, shoot dry weight, shoot water content, relative water content (RWC), leaf width, leaf strength, leaf angle, crown type and leaf cell wall constituents. Siginificant interspecific difference in charactersitics were found. Little difference at the intraspecific level was obserevd especially within creeping bentgrass. Wear tolerant velvet genotypes were associated with a more vertical tiller and leaf angle, greater cell wall content and greater shoot density. Lignocellulose content accounted for as much as 62. 8 to 72. 3 % of the variation in Agrostis wear tolerance while tiller density accounted for as much as 65. 9 to 75. 8 %. Wear tolerance in Agrostis can be improved by giving priority to breeding for greater density and cell wall content with secondary emphasis to breeding for a more upright growth habit (tiller and leaf) ...|$|E
50|$|After the wedding, the guests, the families, and the newlywed couple {{return to}} the Bride's house. The party progresses, with music and dancing, but the Bride retires to her room, {{claiming}} that she feels tired. Leonardo's Wife tells the Groom that her husband left on horseback, but the <b>Groom</b> <b>brushes</b> her off, saying that Leonardo simply went for a quick ride. The Groom returns to the main room and speaks with his Mother. The guests then begin searching for the Bride and Groom, hoping to begin a traditional wedding dance. But the Bride {{is nowhere to be}} found. The Father orders the house searched, but Leonardo's Wife bursts into the room and announces that her husband and the Bride have run off together. The Father refuses to believe it, but the Groom flies into a rage and rides off with a friend to kill Leonardo. The Mother, frenzied and furious, orders the entire wedding party out into the night to search for the runaways, as the Father collapses in grief.|$|R
50|$|The Boerboel is {{an average}} shedder {{and easy to}} <b>groom.</b> The {{occasional}} <b>brushing</b> and a monthly bath and nail trim {{is all that is}} needed. The breed has an outer coat that is normally coarse and straight, and an undercoat that is soft and dense.|$|R
50|$|Miniature Bull Terriers require little <b>grooming.</b> A quick <b>brushing</b> {{once a day}} or a {{few times}} a week is sufficient. Sunscreen must be used on any sparse white {{sections}} of fur around the face, ears, hindquarters or stomach when outdoors (especially in the summer between the hours of 10am and 2pm) to avoid sunburn and cancer.|$|R
40|$|Grooming {{behavior}} is well developed in many decapod crustaceans. Antennular grooming {{by the third}} maxillipedes is found throughout the Decapoda. Gill cleaning mechanisms are qaite variable: chelipede brushes, setiferous epipods, epipod-setobranch systems. However, microstructure of gill cleaning setae, which are equipped with digitate scale setules, is quite conservative. General body grooming, performed by serrate setal brushes on chelipedes and/or posterior pereiopods, is best developed in decapods at a natant grade of body morphology. Brachyuran crabs exhibit less body grooming and virtually no specialized body grooming structures. It is hypothesized that the fouling pressures for body grooming are more severe in natant than in replant decapods. Epizoic fouling, particularly microbial fouling, and sediment fouling have been shown r I m ans of amputation experiments to produce severe effects on olfactory hairs, gills, and i. icubated embryos within short lime periods. Grooming has been strongly suggested as {{an important factor in}} the coevolution of a rhizocephalan parasite and its anomuran host. The behavioral organization of grooming is poorly studied; the nature of stimuli promoting grooming is not understood. Grooming characters may contribute to an understanding of certain aspects of decapod phylogeny. The occurrence of specialized antennal <b>grooming</b> <b>brushes</b> in the Stenopodidea, Caridea, and Dendrobranchiata is probably not due to convergence; alternative hypotheses are proposed to explain the distribution of this grooming character. Gill cleaning and general body grooming characters support a thalassinidean origin of the Anomura; the hypothesis of brachyuran monophyly is supported by the conservative and unique gill-cleaning method of the group. ...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{emotional}} {{states can}} be investigated by evaluating {{their impact on}} cognitive processes. In this study, we used a judgement bias paradigm to determine if short-term positive human-animal interaction (grooming) induced a positive affective state in goats. We tested two groups of goats and trained them to discriminate between a rewarded and a non-rewarded location over nine training days. During training, the experimental group (n = 9) was gently <b>groomed</b> by <b>brushing</b> their heads and backs for five min over 11 days (nine training days, plus two testing days, total time 55 min). During training, the control group (n = 10) did not experience any direct interaction with the experimenter, but was kept unconstrained next to him {{for the same period}} of time. After successful completion of the training, the responses (latency time) of the two groups to reach ambiguous locations situated between the two reference locations (i. e., rewarded/non-rewarded) were compared over two days of testing. There was not a positive bias effect after the animals had been groomed. In a second experiment, 10 goats were tested to investigate whether grooming induced changes in physiological activation (i. e., heart rate and heart rate variability). Heart rate increased when goats were groomed compared to the baseline condition, when the same goats did not receive any contact with the experimenter. Also, subjects did not move away from the experimenter, suggesting that the grooming was positively accepted. The very good care and the regular positive contacts that goats received from humans at the study site could potentially account for the results obtained. Good husbandry outcomes are influenced by animals’ perception of the events and this is based on current circumstances, past experiences and individual variables. Taking into account animals’ individual characteristics and identifying effective strategies to induce positive emotions could increase the understanding and reliability of using cognitive biases paradigms to investigate and promote animal welfare...|$|R
