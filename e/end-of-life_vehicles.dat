40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{depletion}} {{of natural resources}} and undesired environmental changes globally, more interest has been shown in the research of green supply chain practices, including <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> (ELV) recycling. The ELV recycling is mandatory for auto-manufacturers by legislation for the purpose of minimizing potential environmental damages. The purpose of the present research is to determine the best choice of ELV recycling service provider by employing an integrating hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. In this research, economic, environmental and social factors are taken into consideration. The linguistic variables and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TFNs) are applied into this evaluation to deal with the vague and qualitative information. With the combined weight calculation of criteria based on fuzzy aggregation and Shannon Entropy techniques, the normative multi-criteria optimization technique (FVIKOR method) is applied to explore the best solution. An application was performed based on the proposed hybrid MCDM method, and sensitivity analysis was conducted on different decision making scenarios.

This thesis reports on the research undertaken to analyse the factors affecting end-oflife vehicle value, and to investigate a costing framework to assist the vehicle recovery industry in promoting sustainable vehicle recycling. The principal objective {{of this research is}} to develop decision support tools for the vehicle recovery sector to adopt more sustainable processing strategies, whilst meeting the requirements of impending and future legislative targets. The research contributions are divided into three parts. The first part reviews the most relative research in the areas of environmental concerns relating to the automotive sector, <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> recovery and associated costing techniques, to identify the most relevant research directions. The second part consists of a substantial program of data collection, which included; formal interviews, survey of treatment facilities, time-studies and vehicle teardowns, to generate a costing framework for the modelling of indirect and direct costs of both pre and post-fragmentation activities in vehicle recycling. The third part includes the design and implementation of a decision support costing system that enables end-of-life stakeholders to understand the main economics that underpin their operations, and to support future investment in more sustainable vehicle recovery activities. The applicability of the research concept has been demonstrated via three case studies. The results from the case studies have shown that although most <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> recoverers are currently profitable due to the strong demand for scrap metal, significant improvement in their processes and value recovery is possible through strategic investment. Such strategic investment in process improvement and expansion of recycling activities should be considered in light of future fluctuations in material markets and increasing costs of attaining higher recycling targets.

40|$|Nowadays, {{automotive}} {{manufacturers are}} facing with {{impact of the}} vehicle to the environment. In some European countries, Japan, USA, and Australia, laws require automotive manufacturers to take back their products {{at the end of}} their useful life and recycle them. Most of the developed countries also have set new legislation, which is planned to force automotive manufacturers to recover and recycle their products {{at the end of their}} life. Disassembly is the first step to recycle automotive components. In general, the designers do not have experience in disassembly and recycling to determine the impact of various design aspects on the disassemblability at the disassembly stage. Based on that, many researchers have proposed several methods in evaluating disassemblability. This paper reviews the evaluation methods of disassemblability which were proposed by the previous researchers and then outlines the functional requirements for a system for evaluating the disassemblabilty of automotive components based on automotive manufacturer and legislation requirements. In particular, the implication of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> on current product design practice is also explored. The result of the literature review shows that, in order to unsuccessfully implement the concept of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> especially in terms of disassemblability evaluation, the aspects of recycling and disassembly must be considered more rigorously in the product design process. ...|$|R
50|$|Recycling steel {{saves energy}} and natural resources. The steel {{industry}} saves {{enough energy to}} power about 18 million households for a year, on a yearly basis. Recycling metal also uses about 74 percent less energy than making metal. Thus, recyclers of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> save an estimated 85 {{million barrels of oil}} annually that would have been used in the manufacturing of other parts. Likewise, car recycling keeps 11 million tons of steel and 800,000 non-ferrous metals out of landfills and back in consumer use.Before the 2003 model year, some vehicles that were manufactured were found to contain mercury auto switches, historically used in convenience lighting and antilock braking systems. Recyclers remove and recycle this mercury before the vehicles are shredded to prevent it from escaping into the environment. In 2007, over 2100 pounds of mercury were collected by 6265 recyclers.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 12-15 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the}} end of their use each year in just the United States alone. These automobiles, although out of commission, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them.

The remainder, known as automotive shredder residue, is put into a landfill.The shredder residue of the vehicles that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials including 30% of it as polymers, and 5-10% of it as residual metals. Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those residual materials. Currently, 75% of the materials are able to be recycled.

40|$|Purpose of {{the article}}: In the article we {{have focused on}} the trends {{determining}} the development of reverse logistics of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> in selected European countries. The analysis concentrates on quantity of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> which are especially interesting for reverse logistics because of their fitness for recovery or reuse. End-of-life products contain fully valuable elements which, according to the idea of sustainable use of resources, should be recovered. Accordingly, reverse logistics aims at protecting natural resources and the environment through reintroduction of processed waste materials into the economic cycle as valuable products and materials. Methodology/methods: The aim of the article was achieved {{on the basis of a}} critical analysis of subject literature and the analysis of statistical data. In the article the method of descriptive and mathematical statistics and dynamic analysis were used. The 2006 - 2014 years were analyzed. The data come from the data base of the Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The following variables were taken into account: the amount of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> (in tonnes and in number of cars), reuse level (in tonnes), recovery level (in tonnes), and recycling level (in tonnes). The analysis was based on a t-Student test for two average values of dependent samples, sign test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In order to see if the reverse logistics actions implemented in European countries were effective, the analysis compares the average values of individual variables from the year 2014 and 2006. Measurements were done for the same countries on the same element of population. The chain indexes and the average change tempo for specified variables were calculated. The similarity of the formation of specified variables in each year was compared on the basis of the index of similarity structures. Scientific aim: The scientific aim of the article is to identify the basic trends determining the development of reverse logistics of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> in selected European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, The Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, United Kingdom, Norway). These trends are reflected in the amount of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> designed for reuse, recovery and recycling. Findings: With respect to their total or partial processing, <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> are handled according to the 3 R principle (reduce, reuse, and recycle) in order to promote the concept of sustainable development. Unfortunately, the number of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Europe is increasing which is a result of the growing economy and society's wealth. Also the ecological awareness of the producers and consumers is rising which is reflected in the increased number of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> put through reuse, recovery and recycling processes. The analyzed period shows an average annual increase in the reuse, recovery and recycling indexes in most of the discussed countries. Therefore, we can speak of an increasing ecological efficiency of sustainable logistics of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Conclusions: Sustainable logistics allows to recover value from used products. End-of-life products contain materials of full value that should be recovered, which undoubtedly fosters sustainable use of resources. European countries vary according to both the effort and the result of the <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> recovery which is due to economic, legal and cultural circumstances. But research shows the existence of positive trends in the realization of reuse, recovery and recycling processes of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These tendencies should delineate further activities in this area...|$|E
