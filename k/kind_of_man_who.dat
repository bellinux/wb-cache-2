[...] The Post opined that Snow was an end quite worthy to rank with the great ends of the East and that he [...] "was just the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would have been suited to the advanced requirements of the new game and its additional demand for alertness, in an end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roman consul Scipio Aemilianus {{questioned}} {{one of his}} opponents, P. Sulpicius Galus: [...] "For the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> adorns himself {{daily in}} front of a mirror, wearing perfume; whose eyebrows are shaved off; who walks around with plucked beard and thighs; who {{when he was a young}} man reclined at banquets next to his lover, wearing a long-sleeved tunic; who is fond of men as he is of wine: can anyone doubt that he has done what cinaedi are in the habit of doing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{describe}} Mark as [...] "a carefree rogue, a {{wild child}} of the 60's. He's a rolling stone, always looking for an excuse {{to go on the}} run." [...] Deemed by The Times to be [...] "flaky, irresponsible, and untrustworthy", Powell has assessed of his character [...] "he's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is constantly in trouble. Mark's not malicious - he's worked as a nurse all his life - but he's certainly unreliable", imparting that he feels Mark as a phobia of authority. Although Powell stated in 2005 that Mark loved his wife and daughter dearly, he elaborated that: [...] "He's a man to whom everything seems like a good idea at the time! Tends to avoid confrontation but this is probably because he is beset by women!" [...] In 2008, a year after Tricia's death, the character referred to himself on-screen as [...] "By day, fearless Consultant Nurse. By night, lonely old fart." ...|$|E

60|$|With much {{affectation}} of confidence, {{the wizard}} replied {{that there were}} two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were fit to be angekoks--men with weak minds and warm hearts, or men with strong minds and cold hearts.|$|R
60|$|MRS. BRADMERE. Yes, that's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> gets treated badly. I'm afraid she's {{not worthy}} of him, Mrs. Burlacombe.|$|E

6000|$|... "There are uncommonly few general applicants, and {{my friends}} are not the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have money to invest.

5000|$|The Assassination of John F. Kennedy: Oswald was not {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "fall guy" [...] until 1964 when Joachim Joesten used the term in his book title Oswald, Assassin or Fall Guy?. Oswald “was ‘a fall guy’" [...] to use the parlance <b>of</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> must have planned the details of the assassination”.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you aren't the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{would care}} about the politicians, surely. If Humphrey Crewe can get elected by the people, I should think you might." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look very}} nice," [...] she acknowledged, [...] "but you don't {{look at all}} the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> admires girls who do the sort of rubbish I do on the stage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How crude you are, Anna!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{with a little}} sigh. [...] "Sir John {{is not at all}} that sort. He is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would much prefer a little dust in his eyes. But heavens, I must pack!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Not any,' says I. 'A <b>man</b> <b>who's</b> got {{the nerve}} to hold up a train single-handed wouldn't do a trick like that. I've knocked about {{enough to know that}} them are the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> put a value on a friend.

5000|$|In 1529 Tory {{published}} his own book, Champfleury, {{one of the}} most important and influential works of the time. It set a standard for French publishing that in many ways is still followed today. In the introduction to Champfleury, Tory is quoted as saying that there are three different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> corrupt the French language; the [...] "skimmers of Latin", the [...] "jokers", and the [...] "slangers".|$|R
60|$|Further I {{had made}} up my mind some time ago to have no more friendships with women who are so full of surprises, but to live out {{the rest of my life}} in a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> monastery <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have few surprises, being creatures whose {{thoughts}} are nearly always open and whose actions can always be foretold.|$|R
6000|$|She noticed {{now that}} he was greatly agitated. There were beads of {{perspiration}} on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would be afraid to meet death! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A respectable, {{hard-working}} burgher, son of well-to-do parents, brass-workers {{who live}} at Alkmaar.

6000|$|... "That {{governor}} man was {{suitable for}} uprisings and policies. I judge {{he was a}} ready <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> took his own time.

25|$|Much of {{the first}} two years of Timesitheus's {{prefecture}} seems to have been spent producing a stable environment in which government of any sort could be carried on. His main weapon to this end seems to have been to strengthen the authority of the Praetorian Prefecture, his own office, and to move equestrians with a fiscal background - such as himself - into positions of power. The main effect of his manoeuvring seems to have been to ensure that the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had carried on the government under Alexander Severus were restored to effective office.|$|R
5000|$|The TV {{critic for}} the Sydney Morning Herald said [...] "a well-built set {{and two or three}} good performances... did much to enliven" [...] the {{production}} and that it was [...] "a good idea" [...] but [...] "unfortunately, Mr White seems to have been in some doubt whether to make his play a simple whodunit or a study <b>of</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> for reasons not purely scientific, might seek refuge from life in a world of isolation. The compromise required in attempting both was damaging to the play... If local TV drama is to be taken seriously, it will need better productions than this one... and better plays" [...] " ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Something of the sort." [...] In Theodore Watling's vigorous, sanity-exhaling {{presence}} Krebs's act appeared fantastic, ridiculous. [...] "He has queer {{notions about}} {{a new kind of}} democracy which he says is coming. I think he is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would be willing to die for it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So it seems," [...] {{answered}} Bes quietly. [...] "At least none of {{you even}} tried to do it. Yet {{he is not a}} god but only that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is called a hero.

60|$|Then {{there were}} {{the rest of the}} old-timers, the <b>men</b> <b>of</b> Forty Mile and Circle City. At the time of the discovery, nearly all of them were over to the west at work in the old {{diggings}} or prospecting for new ones. As they said of themselves, they were the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> are always caught out with forks when it rains soup. In the stampede that followed the news of Carmack's strike very few old miners took part. They were not there to take part. But the <b>men</b> <b>who</b> did go on the stampede were mainly the worthless ones, the new-comers, and the camp hangers on. And while Bob Henderson plugged away to the east, and the heroes plugged away to the west, the greenhorns and rounders went up and staked Bonanza.|$|R
5000|$|Diamond was {{an outspoken}} and {{controversial}} figure, described {{by one of}} his successors as [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> made a good many enemies".

6000|$|... "As you know, I {{am not the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> puts {{himself out}} for every little thing he hears. I believe in letting the house work out their own salvation--with a light guiding hand on the reins, of course. But there is a {{perceptible}} lack of reverence---a lower tone in matters that touch {{the honor of the}} house, a sort of hardness." ...|$|E
60|$|Wade {{passed on}} without being seen. This {{recognition}} meant less {{to him than}} it would have ten years ago, as he was not now the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> hunted old enemies for revenge or who {{went to great lengths to}} keep out of their way. Men there were in Colorado who would shoot at him on sight. There had been more than one that had shot to his cost.|$|E
6000|$|MacIan had {{understood}} his man pretty well {{up to that}} point; an instinct common to all men with the aristocratic tradition of Europe had guided him. He knew that the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> in his own back garden wears good clothes and spoils them with a bad hat is not the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has an abstract horror of illegal actions of violence or the evasion of the police. But a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging. This seeming host of theirs might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulty at cards or even escape from a pursuing tailor; but it still remained doubtful whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquake instant when the Virgin is compared to a goddess of Mesopotamia. Even MacIan, therefore (whose tact was far from being his strong point), felt the necessity for some compromise {{in the mode of}} approach. At last he said, and even then with hesitation: ...|$|E
60|$|Several tricolours {{were hung}} quite {{near to the}} altar, and the young men, when they came in, filed up the church and sat right at the front. They were, of course, of every imaginable social grade; for the French {{conscription}} is really strict and universal. Some looked like young criminals, some like young priests, some like both. Some were so obviously prosperous and polished that a barrack-room must seem to them like hell; others (by the look of them) had hardly ever been in so decent a place. But {{it was not so}} much the mere class variety that most sharply caught an Englishman's eye. It was the presence of just those one or two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> would never have become soldiers in any other way.|$|R
