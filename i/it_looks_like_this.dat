[...] Following publication and in reaction to areas where it said improvements were warranted, the Clinton Foundation said it would put into place some new procedures for better financial reporting and that it would limit some kinds of foreign donations. Pilkington assessed those claims made by the Clinton Foundation as unlikely to put the matter to rest: [...] "But with Bill refusing doggedly to give up his speaker engagements – “I gotta pay our bills” – and foreign corporations and super-rich individuals still able to donate to the family charity, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> controversy may run and run." ...|$|E

In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.|$|R

5000|$|The episode {{received}} unfavorable reviews. The A.V. Clubs Alasdair Wilkins {{gave the}} episode a C+ grade, stating: [...] "Hell On Wheels doesn't {{need to be}} thematically rich or have complex, multifaceted characters to be a decent show. [...] "Durant, Nebraska" [...] already provided a blueprint for the show's success as shameless, over-the-top pulp, and the shootout taps into some of that goofily lurid sense of fun. There's been stuff to like in the subsequent episodes, such as the gleeful nihilism of [...] "Slaughterhouse", Cullen's low-rent Machiavellianism in [...] "Scabs", and the heist in tonight's episode, but the long-form storytelling remains ponderous and, worse, seemingly pointless." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste gave it a 6.0 rating, stating [...] "'The Railroad Job' points out the largest flaws in Hell on Wheels.

5000|$|At the hospital, Betty learns from Daniel that Alexis has partial {{retrograde}} amnesia, and has {{blanked out}} on {{the past two years}} - the last thing she remembers is their Mom's birthday party two years ago. Alexis doesn't remember becoming a woman, but seems to be enjoying squeezing her new breasts after she looks at them, which prompts Betty to start squeezing her own breasts as well, earning herself a questioning look from Daniel. Alexis also doesn't know that Bradford rejected her, that Bradford and Claire are divorcing, that Claire is a wanted criminal (which Alexis later sees on [...] "Fashion TV"), or that Bradford and Wilhelmina are getting married. Betty also tells Daniel of Wilhelmina's scheme to control the magazine, and talks him into looking at the book for the newest issue, which she has yet to acquire. After Betty leaves, Alexis calls Daniel in, asking if there's something he wants to tell her. Later on, Bradford says he has no problem telling Alexis the truth about what's going on, so Daniel tells him to have a go at it. As Bradford visits Alexis, she yells at a baseball game on TV, and the two start to bond, even though Daniel doesn't buy Bradford's sympathy. Daniel later blast Bradford for not being honest with Alexis, but Bradford tells him about getting a second chance and wanting to fix the mistakes he made. Still, Daniel doesn't seem to be buying it. Back at the hospital, Daniel wants to tell Alexis the truth, until he sees how happy it makes her to think that he and Bradford are there for her. When she asks how they got into their accident, Daniel lies that a deer ran out in front of them. Bradford then comes in, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> family reunion may be an act as Bradford and Daniel look at each other.|$|E
