40|$|Purpose. This study {{investigated}} the anthropometric indices associated with variations in cardiovascular parameters among primary school pupils in Ile-Ife. Method. One thousand and twenty-six pupils (age range 6 – 14 years, mean age 10. 12 years) from ten schools were recruited with parents' informed consent. Anthropometric (Height (<b>Ht),</b> Weight (<b>Wt),</b> Abdominal Circumference (AC)) and cardiovascular (Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Heart Rate (HR)) parameters were measured using standard instruments and procedures. Blood pressure (BP) was measured after ten minutes of quiet sitting. Body Mass Index (BMI), Rate Pressure Product (RPP) and Pulse Pressure (PP) were estimated. Results. <b>Age,</b> <b>Ht,</b> <b>Wt,</b> BMI, and AC correlated significantly (<. 01) with BP and PP. AC and BMI were predictors of BP, HR, RPP, and PP. Conclusion. Significant correlations exist between <b>age,</b> <b>Ht,</b> <b>Wt,</b> BMI, AC, and BP with weight being a more viable predictor of SBP and age a more viable predictor of DBP...|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{young male}} volunteers, 9 - 14. yrs, were studied to {{determine}} if a relationship existed between peak VO 2 and the 9 -min run distance. Physical characteristics for a 1 l Ss included <b>ht,</b> <b>wt,</b> and % fat. Ss were tested for volitional peak VO 2 on the treadmill using the Skinner et al. (1971) protocol. Variables measured were VE max, RER, HR max, and peak VO 2 (l-min - 1 ml/kg/min-l). A 9 -min run for distance was also performed by the Ss. A multiple regression technique was used to predict peak 90 from the 9 -min run distance. The resulting r value when predicting peak VO 2 in ml/kg/min from the 9 -min distance was 0. 693. The r value for prediction of peak VO 2 in l'min from the 9 -min run distance was 0. 583. Other variables measured were entered into the regression technique to improve the R such as <b>age,</b> <b>ht,</b> <b>wt,</b> HR, F 3 R, % fat, and body density. It was concluded that 2 equations which utilized. <b>wt</b> (kg) and <b>ht</b> (an) with the 9 -min run distance (yds) predicted peak V 02 values with the mst accuracy and practicality in ml/kg/min- (R=O. 7 89) and 1 'min- (R- 0. 966) : Peak k (ml/kg/min-l) = - 12. 13 t 0. 29608 (X 3) - 2 Peak yo 2 (1 -min-l) = - 3. 391 + 0. 017377 (X 3) + 0. 00072169 (XI) + 0. 033712 (X 2) Key: X 1 = 9 -min run distance (yds) X 2 = wt (kg) X 3 = Ht (cm) The multiple R value (0. 812) which combined % fat with the 9 -min was also concluded to be a goad predictor of peak V 02 (ml/kg/min- 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{the absence}} of stochasticity, {{allometric}} growth throughout ontogeny is axiomatically described by the logarithm-transformed power-law model, ht~log a bzk w t, where ht:h(t) and w t:w(t) are the logarithmic sizes of two traits {{at any given time}} t. Realistically, however, stochasticity is an inherent property of ontogenetic allometry. Due to the inherent stochasticity in both ht and w t, the ontogenetic allometry coefficients, log a b and k, can vary with t and have intricate temporal distributions that are governed by the central and mixed moments of the random ontogenetic growth functions, ht and w t. Unfortunately, there is no probabilistic model for analyzing these informative ontogenetic statistical moments. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study treats <b>ht</b> and <b>wt</b> as correlated stochastic processes to formulate the exact probabilistic version of each of the ontogenetic allometry coefficients. In particular, the statistical dynamics of relative growth is addressed by analyzing the allometric growth factors that affect the temporal distribution of the probabilistic version of the relative growth rate, k:DtðuSVtTÞ=DtðvSVtTÞ, where SVtT is the expected value of the ratio of stochastic <b>ht</b> to stochastic <b>wt,</b> and uSVtT and vSVtT are the numerator and the denominator of SVtT, respectively. These allometric growth factors, which provide important insight into ontogenetic allometry but appear only when stochasticity is introduced, describe the central and mixed moments of <b>ht</b> and <b>wt</b> as differentiable real-valued functions of t...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} postnatal {{growth of}} extremely {{low birth weight}} infants (ELBW, < 1, 000 g) until 36 months of corrected age (CA), and to relate growth outcome to anthropometric parameters at birth, sex, fetal growth status (small or appropriate for gestational age [...] SGA/AGA), period of admission and major perinatal events. STUDY DESIGN/METHOD: Weight (<b>Wt),</b> height (<b>Ht)</b> and head circumference (HC) were assessed in 159 ELBW infants. Data were standardized with Z-scores following Usher and McLean and Sempe growth curves. Uni- and multivariate statistical analysis were performed. RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 851. 2 +/- 116. 5 g. Z-scores decreased from birth to term, at a deeper rate for AGA than for SGA infants (p< 0. 005 for <b>Ht,</b> <b>Wt,</b> and HC). Between term and 36 months, growth was better in SGA compared with AGA infants (p= 0. 003 for Ht). Multivariate analysis showed that anthropometric parameters at birth were positive determinants for <b>Wt,</b> <b>Ht</b> and HC at term, and also for <b>Wt</b> and <b>Ht</b> at 36 months CA (Z-scores). Oxygen therapy after 36 weeks of post-conceptional age was a negative determinant influencing growth at 36 months CA (Z-scores). CONCLUSIONS: Significant catch-up growth took place between birth and 36 months, which was greater for SGA than for AGA infants. Anthropometric parameters at birth and oxygen therapy at 36 weeks post-conceptional age are the main predictive factors for growth at 36 months CA...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{stress and}} {{oxidative}} damage of cerebral vasculature and neuronal cells {{have been found}} {{to play an important role}} in ageing-related neurodegenerative behaviour disorders. Although several enzymatic sources are involved in brain ROS generation, recently NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox 2) has been suggested as a major source of ROS generation in ageing-related vascular dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used age-matched littermates of wild-type (WT) and Nox 2 knockout (Nox 2 (-/-)) mice on a C 57 BL/ 6 background at young (3 - 4 month old) and old age (18 - 21 month old) to investigate the relationship between Nox 2 -derived ROS production, cerebral vascular damage and the loss of locomotor activity in ageing. There was no significant difference in locomotor activity between WT and Nox 2 (-/-) young mice as measured digitally using laser-beam motility chambers over a 42 h period. Compared to young mice, <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> mice (but not Nox 2 (-/-) ageing mice) had a significant decrease in horizontal activity (p < 0. 05) and total activity in the dark period. We then examined the levels of ROS production in brain homogenates by lucigenin (5 µM) -chemiluminescence and in brain sections by DHE fluorescence. Compared to WT young mouse brains, there were significant increases in the levels of ROS production in <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> brains and this was accompanied with an average 2 -fold reduction in the numbers of CD 31 -positive vessels (all p < 0. 05) as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy and vessel number counting. Compared to <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> mice, knockout of Nox 2 completely inhibited the age-related increase in brain ROS production and preserved the cerebral microvasculature density and the locomotor activity. In conclusion, Nox 2 -derived ROS plays an important role in oxidative damage of cerebral vasculature and the loss of locomotor activity at old age...|$|R

Impaired postnatal growth has been reported to be associated with delayed cognitive and motor development. Aims: To describe postnatal growth patterns of appropriate and small for gestational age (AGA and SGA) ELBW children in relation to their cognitive and motor outcome at age 5. 5. Study design: Retrospective cohort study. Subjects: One hundred one children with a BW Outcome measures: Height (<b>Ht),</b> weight (<b>Wt),</b> occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) at birth, 15 months and 2 years corrected age and 3. 5 and 5. 5 years. Cognitive and motor outcome at 5. 5 years of age, classified as normal (Z-score >=- 1). mildly delayed (- 2 =- 2 SDS) infants were compared with SGA (<b>Ht.</b> <b>Wt</b> or OFC at birth Results: Between birth and 5. 5 years catch-up growth in lit, weight for height (Wt/Ht), Wt and OFC was seen in 72. 2 %, 55. 2 %, 28. 6 % and 68. 9 % respectively of the SGA infants. For AGA infants we found substantial catch-down growth in lit (15. 4 %) and Wt (33. 8 %). Cognitive and motor outcome was normal in 76. 2 % and 41. 6 % of the 101 children. A significantly higher percentage of normal cognitive outcome was found in AGA infants with Wt growth remaining at >=- 2 SDS compared to AGA infants with catch-down growth (83 % vs 63 %). Next, SGA infants who caught-up in OFC had a higher prevalence of normal cognitive outcome compared to SGA infants who did not catch-up in OFC. Furthermore, a higher percentage of severely delayed motor outcome was found in SGA infants without catch-up growth in Wt compared to SGA infants who caught-up in Wt (61. 5 % vs 32. 2 %). Conclusions: Catch-up growth in Ht. Wt/Ht and OFC occurred in the majority of the SGA infants with a BW =- 2 SDS have a better cognitive and motor developmental outcome at 5. 5 years of age. Catch-up growth in OFC was associated with a better cognitive outcome at 5. 5 years of age. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} study was to assess the tolerance and compliance of an intended population of infants to a new formulation of a hypoallergenic eHF. Methods: A non-random, single-group, multicenter study was conducted. Infants with suspected food protein allergy, persistent feeding intolerance, or presenting conditions where an eHF was deemed appropriate were enrolled in a 15 -day feeding trial. Intake, stool patterns, weight (wt), length, and questionnaires were collected. The primary outcome was maintenance of <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score during the study. Results: 25 infants (85 + 8. 9 d of age) were enrolled; 7 were> 4 months; 4 were preterm. At entry, 12 had symptoms of allergic colitis or food protein allergy/intolerance, 12 had persistent formula intolerance, 11 had hematochezia/heme positive stools, and 1 was recovering from necrotizing enterocolitis. Mean <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score was- 0. 62 + 0. 19 at entry and- 0. 41 + 0. 16 at exit. Mean change in <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score was 0. 21 + 0. 10.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} that human mutations in Nav 1. 5 predispose to early age onset atrial arrhythmia. The present experiments accordingly assess atrial arrhythmogenicity in aging Scn 5 a+/∆KPQ mice modeling long QT 3 syndrome in relationship to cardiac Na+ channel, Nav 1. 5, expression. Atrial electrophysiological properties in isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts from 3 - and 12 -month-old wild type (WT), and Scn 5 a+/∆KPQ mice were assessed using programmed electrical stimulation and their Nav 1. 5 expression assessed by Western blot. Cardiac conduction properties were assessed electrocardiographically in intact anesthetized animals. Monophasic action potential recordings demonstrated increased atrial arrhythmogenicity specifically in aged Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ hearts. These showed greater action potential duration/refractory period ratios but lower atrial Nav 1. 5 expression levels than <b>aged</b> <b>WT</b> mice. Atrial Nav 1. 5 levels were higher in young Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ than young WT. These levels increased with <b>age</b> in <b>WT</b> but not Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ. Both young and aged Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ mice showed lower heart rates and longer PR intervals than their WT counterparts. Young Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ mice showed longer QT and QTc intervals than young <b>WT.</b> <b>Aged</b> Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ showed longer QRS durations than <b>aged</b> <b>WT.</b> PR intervals were prolonged and QT intervals were shortened in young relative to <b>aged</b> <b>WT.</b> In contrast, ECG parameters were similar between young and aged Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ.

40|$|Background: Rapid {{development}} in neonatal care {{during the past}} years has significantly improved long-term survival of extreme preterm born (EPB) infants creating a population of children with a high frequency of disabilities. Being lighter and shorter, as compared to full-term (FT) born child, predisposes the EPB infants to intensive nutritional interventions aiming for growth-promoting effect. The existing cross-sectional preterm growth charts reflect an intrauterine growth but are used for monitoring of extra uterine growth. Long-term data on postnatal growth are sparse. The aim of this thesis was to describe the growth pattern and morbidity from birth to 10 years in hospital-based cohort of EPB infants born 1990 - 2002 in Sweden and treated at Karolinska University Hospital (KS), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and/or Sahlgrenska hospital (SH). Paper I covers retrospective longitudinal cohort of 162 infants born before 26 + 0 weeks of gestation. We studied body weight (<b>Wt),</b> height (<b>Ht)</b> and head circumference (HC) from birth to FT age and compared it to the new Swedish birth size reference. We showed {{that the majority of}} the infants showed a pronounced postnatal growth restriction (PGR) and at discharge from NICU, 75 % of initially appropriate for gestational age infants were below – 2 SDS for at least one of the body size variables. Paper II is a retrospective review of 114 children born before 25 + 0 weeks of gestation; we studied the frequency of ROP and visual acuity (VA). We found that 75 % of the children developed severe ROP (stage ≥ 3), often in combination with additional functional deficits as a consequence of brain dysfunction. Normal VA (> 0. 8) in at least one eye was found in 50 % of all infants, more common in girls, while visual impairment (VA < 0. 33) was more common in boys. Paper III is a retrospective longitudinal study of 123 children born before 26 + 0 weeks of gestation; morbidity and body <b>Wt,</b> <b>Ht,</b> HC from FT to 10 years were studied comparing with the Swedish growth reference. We showed that a significant catch up (CU) in <b>Ht</b> and <b>Wt</b> occured; by <b>age</b> 10 years the attained mean Ht was in accordance with the genetic potential. Significant cognitive, motor disorder and/ or developmental comorbidity were found in 48 % boys and 34 % girls and severe ROP in 79 % and 66 % respectively. In Paper IV, we studied the magnitude of catch-up (CU) growth 10 years after FT age and its impact for attained <b>Ht</b> and <b>Wt</b> during childhood in the cohort from Paper III. We showed that the most pronounced CU growth in both <b>Wt</b> and <b>Ht</b> occurred during the first year after FT age; followed by a plateau between 1 and 2 years but with more pronounced <b>Wt</b> than <b>Ht</b> development, a trend that continued until 10 years. Children with rapid CU in Wt three months after FT age were significantly heavier and taller at 1 and 2 years but not taller at 10 years compared to children with slower growth tempo. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that EPB infants show a continuous PGR in <b>Wt,</b> <b>Ht</b> and HC as compared to birth size references. Neither the birth-size derived growth curves nor the presented charts are supposed to be used as a single prescriptive standard for extra uterine growth of this population. By 10 years of age the majority of children had reached normal or near-normal Ht close to their genetic potential but Wt development was higher than Ht development, possibly leading to a disadvantageous metabolic situation. EPB infants, especially boys are at high risk for visual impairment and therefore rehabilitation of these children with a combination of disabilities is a challenge. The most challenging period is between birth and FT, which may be a critical window for development of the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between bone mineral content (BMC), lean tissue mass (LTM) and fat mass (FM) in a large sample of young and elderly women. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: BMC, LTM and FM were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 2009 free-dwelling Caucasian women aged 63 +/- 7 years (mean +/- SD; range: 37 - 88 years). The majority of women were postmenopausal (96 %). RESULTS: LTM explained 13 % more variance of BMC than FM (R(2) (adj) = 0. 39 vs 0. 26, p < 0. 0001) but weight (Wt) explained 5 % more variance of BMC than LTM (R(2) (adj) = 0. 44, p < 0. 0001). The prediction of BMC obtained from LTM and FM (R(2) (adj) = 0. 46, p < 0. 0001) was only slightly better than that obtained from Wt. After the effects of <b>age,</b> <b>Wt</b> and height (<b>Ht)</b> on BMC were taken into account by multiple regression, the contribution of LTM and FM to BMC was just one-fifth of that of Wt (R(2) (adj) for full models < or = 0. 56, p < 0. 0001). After a further correction for bone area (BA), the contribution of LTM and FM to BMC was just one-tenth of that of BA and not {{different from that of}} <b>Wt</b> and <b>Ht</b> on practical grounds (R(2) (adj) for full models = 0. 84, p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Pituitary {{adenylate cyclase}} {{activating}} polypetide (PACAP) constitutes a neuropeptide that is widely {{distributed in the}} host exerting essential cytoprotective properties, whereas PACAP−/− mice display increased susceptibility to distinct immunopathological conditions. The orchestrated interplay between the gut microbiota and the host is pivotal in immune homeostasis and resistance to disease. Potential pertubations of the intestinal microbiota in PACAP−/− mice, however, have not been addressed so far. For the first time, we performed a comprehensive survey of the intestinal microbiota composition in PACAP−/− and wildtype (WT) mice starting 2 weeks postpartum until 18 months of age applying quantitative culture-independent techniques. Fecal enterobacteria and enterococci were lower in PACAP−/− than <b>WT</b> mice <b>aged</b> 1 month and ≥ 6 months, respectively. Whereas mouse intestinal Bacteroides were slightly higher in PACAP−/− versus <b>WT</b> mice <b>aged</b> 1 and 6 months, this later in life held true for Bacteroides/Prevotella spp. (≥ 12 months) and lactobacilli (> 15 months of age). Strikingly, health-beneficial bifidobacteria were virtually absent in the intestines of PACAP−/− mice, even when still breastfed. In conclusion, PACAP deficiency is accompanied by distinct changes in fecal microbiota composition with virtually absent bifidobacteria as a major hallmark that might be linked to increased susceptibility to disease...|$|R

In this study, we used age-matched wild-type (WT) and Nox 2 knockout (KO) mice at 3 – 4 months (young); 11 – 12 months (middle-aged) and 21 – 22 months (aging) to investigate age-related metabolic disorders, Nox 2 activation and endothelial dysfunction. Compared to young mice, middle-aged and <b>aging</b> <b>WT</b> mice had significant hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, increased systemic oxidative stress and higher blood pressure. Endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired in <b>WT</b> <b>aging</b> aortas, and this was accompanied by increased Nox 2 and ICAM- 1 expressions, MAPK activation and decreased insulin receptor expression and signaling. However, these aging-associated disorders were significantly reduced or absent in Nox 2 KO aging mice. The effect of metabolic disorder on Nox 2 activation and endothelial dysfunction was further confirmed using high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in middle-aged WT mice treated with apocynin (a Nox 2 inhibitor). In vitro experiments showed that in response to high glucose plus high insulin challenge, WT coronary microvascular endothelial cells increased significantly the levels of Nox 2 expression, activation of stress signaling pathways and the cells were senescent, e. g. increased p 53 and β–galactosidase activity. However,these changes were absent in Nox 2 KO cells. In conclusion, Nox 2 activation in response to aging-associated hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia {{plays a key role in}} the oxidative damage of vascular function. Inhibition or knockout of Nox 2 preserves endothelial function and improves global metabolism in old age...|$|R

The {{function}} h(·) minmizing energy ∫_ 0 ^T h'(t) ^ 2 dt {{among all}} functions satisfying <b>W(t)</b> -r < <b>h(t)</b> < <b>W(t)</b> + r on an interval [0,T] is called taut string. This is a classical object {{well known in}} Variational Calculus, Mathematical Statistics, etc. We show that the energy of this taut string on large intervals is equivalent to C^ 2 T / r^ 2 where C is some finite positive constant. While the precise value of C remains unknown, we give various theoretical bounds for {{it as well as}} rather precise results of computer simulation. While the taut string clearly depends on entire trajectory of W, we also consider an adaptive version of the problem by giving a construction (Markovian pursuit) of a random function based only on the past values of W and having minimal asymptotic energy. The solution, an optimal pursuit strategy, quite surprisingly turns out to be related with a classical minimization problem for Fisher information on the bounded interval...|$|R
40|$|Many studies {{reported}} a high prevalence of undernutrition in the under- 5 children in Bangladesh. But very few information are available about undernutrition and adiposity among school {{children and adolescents}} in Bangladesh. This study addressed the prevalence of undernutrition and obesity among school going children and adolescents. A total of 15 secondary schools were purposively selected from rural, suburban and urban areas. The teachers were detailed about the study protocol. Then the teachers volunteered to register the eligible (age 10 – 18 y) students for the study. Each student’s parent was interviewed for family income. Height (<b>ht),</b> weight (<b>wt),</b> mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and blood pressure were taken. Fasting blood samples were collected for fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol (Chol), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated (ht/wt in met. sq) for diagnosis of undernutrition (BMI 25. 0). A total of 2151 (m- 1063, f- 1088) students volunteered the study. Of them, the poor, middle and rich social classes were 25. 4, 53. 1 and 21. 5 %, respectively. Overall, the prevalence of underweight, normal, overweight and obesity were 57. 4 %, 35. 0 %, 4. 9 % and 2. 7 %, respectively. For gende...|$|R
40|$|Since ethnic {{differences}} exist in body composition, assessment methods {{need to be}} validated prior to use in different populations. This study attempts to validate the use of Sri Lankan based body composition assessment tools {{on a group of}} 5 - 15 year old Australian children of Sri Lankan origin. The study was conducted at the Body Composition Laboratory of the Children’s Nutrition Research Centre at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Height (<b>Ht),</b> weight (<b>Wt),</b> segmental length (Lsegment name) and skinfold thickness (SFT) were measured. The whole body and segmental bio impedance analysis (BIA) were also measured. The body composition determined by the deuterium dilution technique (criterion method) was compared with the assessments done using prediction equations developed on Sri Lankan children. 27 boys and 15 girls were studied. All predictions of body composition parameters, except percentage fat mass (FM) assessed by the SFT-FM equation in girls gave statistically significant correlations with the criterion method. They had a low mean bias and most were not influenced by the measured parameter. Although living in a different socioeconomic state, the equations developed on children of the same ethnic background gives a better predictive value of body composition. This highlights the ethnic influence on body composition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{is a brief}} {{review of}} data {{obtained}} by analyzing the morphology and the physiology of the retinas in rd/rd and normal, <b>wt</b> mice, <b>aged</b> 10 – 90 days. Second-order neurons of the rd/rd show abnormalities that start with the anomalous development of rod bipolar cells around P 10 and culminate with the atrophy of dendrites in cone bipolar cells, mostly evident at P 90. Horizontal cells remodel considerably. Cone-mediated ERGs, (recorded between 13 and 16 days of age) have reduced a-wave and b-wave amplitudes and longer b-wave latency and duration. B-wave abnormalities indicate specific postreceptoral dysfunction. Morphological and ERG changes in rd/rd retinas are consistent with substantial inner retinal remodeling associated to photoreceptor degeneration...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Nitric oxide mediates {{urethral}} {{smooth muscle}} relaxation {{and may also}} be involved in detrusor activity control. Mice with mutation in the Immp 2 l gene have high superoxide ion levels and a consequent decrease in the bioavailable amount of nitric oxide. We studied bladder function in this mouse model. Material and Methods: Young male mutants at ages 4 to 6 months, old female mutants at age 18 months and healthy <b>WT</b> <b>age</b> matched controls were used. the detrusor contractile response to carbachol and electrical field stimulation was tested in isolated detrusor strips in organ baths. in vivo bladder function was evaluated by cystometry in conscious animals. Results: Young male mutants had significantly lower micturition and higher post-void residual volume than WT controls. They had pronounced voiding difficulty and strained when initiating micturition. Detrusor contractile responses to carbachol and electrical field stimulation were similar in mutant and WT mice. Old female mutant mice had lower bladder capacity and micturition volume, and higher micturition frequency and bladder-to-body weight ratio than WT controls. in the in vitro study detrusor strips from mutants showed a lower maximum response to carbachol. Conclusions: Mice with mutation in the Immp 2 l gene have bladder dysfunction, mainly characterized by emptying abnormalities in young males and increased detrusor activity in old females. Detrusor function was preserved in young males and impaired in old females. These animals are a natural model of oxidative stress with low bioavailable nitric oxide. Thus, they are interesting tools in which to evaluate the role of these conditions on bladder dysfunction.

40|$|As mean fibre {{diameter}} (MFD) is {{the primary}} determinant of mohair price we aimed to quantify the lifetime changes in mohair MFDas Angora goats aged and grew. Measurements were made over 12 shearing periods on a population of Angora goats representing the current range and diversity of genetic origins including South African, Texan and interbred admixtures of these and Australian sources. Records of sire, dam, birthweight, birth parity, liveweight, fleece growth and fleece quality were taken for does and castrated males (wethers) (n = 267 animals). Fleece-free liveweights (FFL wt) were determined for each goat at shearing time by subtracting the greasy fleece weight from the liveweight recorded immediately before shearing. A restricted maximum likelihood growth curve model was developed for relating MFD to FFL <b>wt,</b> <b>age</b> and other measurements. Asimple way of describing the results is:MFD= k (FFL wt) b E; where k is a parameter that can vary in a systematic way with shearing(age), breed, weaning weight, sire, dam and individual; b is a parameter {{that is the same}} for nearly the whole study; and E are independent errors from a log-normal distribution. The analysis shows that ^b = 0. 34, with s. e. (^b) = 0. 021. Thus, mohair MFD was allometrically related to the cube root of FFLwt over the lifetime of Angora goats. However, the allometric proportionality constant differed in a systematic way with age at shearing, genetic strain, weaning weight, sire, dam and individual. For Texan-breed goats, MFD decreased as weaning weight increased (P = 0. 00016). The findings indicate that management factors that affect liveweight and weaning weight have lifetime effects on mohair fibre diameter and therefore the value of mohair and the profitability of the mohair enterprise. <br /...|$|R
