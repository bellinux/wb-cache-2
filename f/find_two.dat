5|$|The {{festivals and}} daily rituals do not adhere to {{standard}} Hindu Agamic or Buddhist rituals. It follows what Paul Younger calls as ancient Vedda traditions of worship. Although since the medieval period Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims {{have tried to}} co-opt the temple, deity and its worship as their own, the rituals maintained by the native priests are still intact. The main festival known in Sinhalese as Esela Perehera. It is celebrated during the months of July and August. About 45 days before the festival begins, the priests go into the forest and <b>find</b> <b>two</b> forked branches of a sacred tree. The branches are then immersed in the local river and kept at the shrines dedicated to Kataragama deviyo and Vali. When the main festival begins, the Yantra representing the deity is retrieved from its storage location, paraded through a street {{on top of an}} elephant, and carried to the Valli shrine. After two hours it is returned. On {{the last day of the}} festival the Yantra is left overnight at the Valli shrine and brought back to the main shrine. The priests conduct the rituals in silence, covering their mouths with white cloth. Associated with the main festival is fire walking arranged by a master of the ritual. Hundreds of devotees participate in fire walking, yet others participate in ecstatic dance forms called Kavadi and body piercing. Many of the pilgrims exhibit signs of being possessed.|$|E

25|$|In {{cryptographic}} applications, {{the ability}} to <b>find</b> <b>two</b> distinct values xμ-1 and xλ+μ-1 mapped by some cryptographic function ƒ to the same value xμ may indicate a weakness in ƒ.

The technique may also be used to find a collision in a cryptographic hash function.|$|E

As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to <b>find</b> <b>two</b> or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.|$|E

25|$|This {{iteration}} method produces two {{roots of the}} quintic.

It is to be noted that due to the way the iteration is formulated, this method seems to always <b>find</b> <b>two</b> complex conjugate roots of the quintic even when all the quintic coefficients are real and the starting guess is real. This {{iteration method}} is derived by from the symmetries of the icosahedron and is closely related to the method Felix Klein describes in his book.|$|E
