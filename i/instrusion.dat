This research was used GIS method to determine vulnerable riskon land use typesin the coastal areas based on inundation and saltwater intrusion scenariosto create for whole Mekong Delta region in current conditions of 2004 and sea level rise scenarios in 2030 and 2050. The result shows that the vulnerable areas affecting on one factor of flooding are focused on Long An and TienGiang provinces; while the effect of saltwater intrusion, the vulnerable areas are mostly distributed in the coastal provinces including KienGiang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, SocTrang, TraVinh and Ben Tre. Using both inundation and salinity factors, the most vulnerable areas is located in SocTrang province and next distribution in two provinces of Ca Mau and Bac Lieu, a small distribution on the province of Ben Tre, TienGiang and TraVinh with total area at 12, 257 ha in 2015.

40|$|The Greater Confinement Disposal Test (GCDT) was {{conducted}} at the Nevada Test Site to demonstrate an alternative method for management of high-specific-activity (HSA) low-level waste (LLW). The GCDT was initially conceived as a method for managing small volumes of highly concentrated tritium wastes, which, due to their environmental mobiilty, are considered unsuitable for routine shallow land disposal. Later, {{the scope of the}} GCDT was increased to address a variety of other "problem" HSA wastes including isotope sources and thermal generating wastes. The basic design for the GCDT evolved from a series of studies and assessments. Operational design objectives were to (1) emplace the wastes at a depth sufficient to minimize or eliminate routine environmental transport mechanisms and <b>instrusion</b> scenarios and (2) provide sufficient protection for operations personnel in the handling of HSA sources. To achieve both objectives, a large diameter borehole was selected. The GCDT consisted of a borehole 3 meters (10 feet) in diameter and 36 meters (120 feet) deep, surrounded by nine monitoring holes at varying radii. The GCDT was instrumented for the measurement of temperature, moisture, and soil-gas content. Over one million curies of HSA LLW were emplaced in GCDT.

40|$|The Sierra de Catorce is a N-S-trending {{mountain}} range {{located in the}} northeastern portion of the Mesa Central physiographic province, Mexico. The Sierra lies at {{the northern end of}} the Taxco-San Miguel de Allende fault system, which is interpreted as the surface expression of a major crustal discontinuity. A Triassic to upper Cretaceous sedimentary succession, deformed during the Laramide orogeny, crops out in the range. From the structural point of view, the Sierra de Catorce is a double plunging anticlinorium bounded in its western side by a post-Laramide N-S-trending and west dipping normal fault. We report geochronologic and geochemical data for several post-tectonic granitoids cropping out in the range. The intrusive bodies are I-type continental arc granitoids with Eocene <b>instrusion</b> ages (ca. 38 to 45 Ma, U-Pb determined by LA-ICPMS on individual zircon crystals). Epithermal argentiferous ore deposits are spatially associated with the granitoids. The geochemical signature of the granitoids indicates that magmas derived from a metasomatized mantle, and were highly contaminated with crustal materials. Despite the inferred position of the subduction zone during the Eocene (over 600 km westward), an influence of the subducted slab is needed to explain the metasomatization of the mantle wedge and the high-Ba content observed in all the Sierra de Catorce granitoids. Geochemical features of the granitic rocks are consistent with the regional and local geological framework that allowed rapid emplacement of magma pulses in a post-orogenic extensional geodynamic setting...|$|E

The lopolith is traversed by swarms of younger Proterozoic dykes, three major faults which have provoked periods of movement, and a myriad of cooling joints, cracks, and hydraulic fractures now occupied by comb textured calcite, prehnite, chlorite, quartz and feldspars, an average 6. 7 mm wide and on average 8. 3 cm apart. The relative abundance of isotopes of oxygen and carbon in calcite filling fractures indicates repeated deposition from mixed hydrous magmatic fluid and salt fluids at temperatures at or above 200 dollar∘dollarC. Major and minor element abundances indicate a low K high Al tholeiitic character of the intrusion. A bimodal chemical trend, REE data and a rubble zone across the entire intrusion, suggest that multiple intrusion may have taken place in the layered complex.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{frequent}} itemset mining {{has become a}} major area of research, with applications including indexing and similarity search, as well as mining of data streams, web, and software bugs. Although several efficient techniques for generating frequent itemsets with a minimum support (frequency) have been proposed, the number of itemsets produced is in many cases too large for effective usage in real-life applications. Indeed, the problem of deriving frequent itemsets that are both compact and of high quality, remains to a large degree open. In this paper we address the above problem by posing frequent itemset mining as a collection of interrelated two-armed bandit problems. In brief, we seek to find itemsets that frequently appear as subsets in a stream of itemsets, with the frequency being constrained to support granularity requirements. Starting from a randomly or manually selected examplar itemset, a collective of Tsetlin automata based two-armed bandit players aims to learn which items {{should be included in the}} frequent itemset. A novel reinforcement scheme allows the bandit players to learn this in a decentralized and on-line manner by observing one itemset at a time.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{mathematical}} model developed to simulate salinity intrusion in coastal waterways {{in the south}} eastern coastlands of the Gold Coast (Australia) to neutralize acidity caused by pyrite oxidation. The model was used to predict the effect of salinity intrusion upstream of existing floodgates. Predictions of the model compared favourably with the field results. <b>Instrusion</b> of saline water can increase the pH of the upland water from 2. 4 to 6. 5, while the salt levels remain low enough {{so that it is}} not of concern to the landholders. Based on the computer predictions and experimental observations, it was concluded that the Nerang river flood mitigation system ought to be redesigned to allow for controlled tidal water intrusion upland of the floodgates to neutralize acid leached from groundwater. Such a structure would have to be constructed and installed in the creeks replacing existing one way floodgates thereby allowing the flow of saline water upland during inland tidal periods. In this manner, the saline creek water can neutralize much of the acidic water stored upland of the floodgates thereby reducing the ill-effect on fish and other estuarine communities and their habitats downstream following heavy rainfalls.

40|$|Soil-water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{is a key}} property for unsaturated soils. It descibes the water retention capacity of unsaturated soils. SWCC {{can be used to}} predict other useful soil properties such as water permeability and is an essential property for both numerical and analytical transient seepage and slope stability analyses. In the thesis, a newly modified triaxial apparatus has been used to investigate the influence of isotropic (ISO) stress conditions on measured SWCCs of some unsaturated expansive soils from China. A one-dimensional (1 D) stress controllable volumetric pressure plate extractor and pressure plate/membrane extractors without applying any external stress are also used in the study. The SWCCs of the expansive soils are found to be stress dependent. The difference between SWCCs tested under zero stress and non-zero stresses is significant. Generally, the expansive soil has a lower water retention ability under stress compared with the results from conventional SWCC tests without external stress. However, the difference between 1 D and ISO stresses is small except for the part in the matric suction range of l- 10 kPa. There is no difference in soil-water characteristics under stress of 50 - and lOO-kPa when the suction is higher than 10 kPa. The test results of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Mercury <b>Instrusion</b> Porosimetry (MIP) show that the recompacted ZY expansive soil has a bi-modal distribution of pore sizes. The pore spaces are mostly composed by inter-aggregate and intra-aggregate pores. Because inter-aggregate pores can be compressed by external stresses, the SWCCs exhibit clear difference under the low suction range from 1 to 10 kPa. Intra-aggregate pores are left unchanged, therefore, the soil-water characteristics are {{more or less the same}} in high suction range of l 0 - 500 kPa, regardless of different stress conditions. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the influence of rainfall patterns, amount and duration on groundwater responses in an unsaturated slope of residual soils. As for 24 -hr short rainfalls, the advanced rainfall pattern seems to be the most critical rainfall type for the slope stability because it can always induce the highest pore-water pressure distributions along the slope. The higher the rainfall depth is, the higher the pore-water pressure buildup will be. However, in this study, it is found that a further increase in the return period of a rainfall of l 00 -yr, the pore-water pressure does not necessarily increase. Rainfall patterns are more relevant for short rainfalls, since the rainwater distributes more uniformly for storms with long duration...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{results on}} the media’s coverage of privacy and security issues within {{the second stage of}} the PRISMS project. The PRISMS project examines how technologies aimed at enhancing security are subjecting citizens to an increasing amount of surveillance and, in many cases, causing infringements of privacy and fundamental rights. In line with the overall project’s research objectives – to explore the relationship between privacy and security and to learn if people actually evaluate the introduction of new security and security-oriented surveillance technologies in terms of a trade-off – the media analysis as conducted in this work package focuses on analyzing the notions of both privacy and security within the European media. As the influence of events on the media’s reporting is crucial, the revelations by Edward Snowden about the mass interception programs from June 2013 are of high relevance for our research. In fact, they mark a disruptive event that was not foreseeable {{in the beginning of the}} project and that has the power to change the whole privacy and security related discourse. To take that into account, an additional sample that represents discourse right after the revelations was analyzed additionally. Together with a small sample that was analyzed during the period of media reporting, the results in this report are based on three samples: The initial (2008 - 2011) and the monitoring sample (2014) for Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy and Hungary; and an additional sample for Germany and Great Britain (2013). In the previous report, we had already stated that privacy and security related discourse in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands from 2008 to 2011 is to a vast extent concerned with issues revolving around data and personal information. While the further analyses now show that this proves also true for Italy, in both Denmark and Hungary this dominating cluster of issues was not found. In the same regard, whereas in the other countries discourse from 2008 to 2011 at least partly encompasses a narrative that we chose to call “warning-narrative”, this narrative is absent in Denmark and Hungary. Regarding the notions of privacy and security, although there are variations, there is a tendency of privacy being used most frequently in the sense of privacy of personal data, while security is used more ambigously. What is different between the different countries is the amount of foregrounding the one or the other – we call it privacy or security-centred. In fact, from the six countries analyzed Germany shows to be the only one where discourse from 2008 to 2011 is clearly privacy-centred, with an emphasis on the risks that the concept is subject to and a strong focus on the need for protection. In the UK, on the other hand, discourse is security-centred. The additional sample that represents discourse directly after Snowden’s revelations reveals that these tendencies stay stable in both of the countries: While in Germany, the focus is still on the amount of privacy <b>instrusion</b> that became known with the revelations, in the UK the focus on security – and to be precise, on national security – is even reinforced; although there are variations between the different sources. Issue-wise, in both countries privacy and security related discourse is completely reflected in the sense of interception and spying; the affair and its consequences are clearly dominating. While in Germany, the different sources are quite homogenous in their evaluation of the affair, the British sources differ; especially The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph. The sample gained during the monitoring period indicates that the situation is slowly shifting at least partly back to the narratives that were dominant in the respective countries in the time span before the revelations, but that they are still reflected in the aftermath of the affair.
