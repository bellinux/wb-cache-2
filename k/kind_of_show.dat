500|$|Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly wrote that, {{although}} the {{dancing in the}} episode was fun, [...] "Preggers" [...] was lacking in [...] "big singing moments" [...] apart from Rachel's performance of [...] "Taking Chances". He deemed Quinn's pregnancy [...] "a good dramatic twist", but hoped {{that it would not}} be a long-lasting storyline. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8.8 out of 10. He called the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] performance [...] "a memorable TV moment", and wrote that Quinn's pregnancy was a [...] "very soap opera plotline" [...] however commented: [...] "luckily Glee is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> to handle it with humor." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Variety, on {{the other}} hand, called the show [...] "loony" [...] and [...] "without a story, form, music, dancing, beauty or artistry.... It's impossible to tell whether [...] talent. [...] Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> business." [...] Reviews in the news weeklies were mixed; Jack Kroll in Newsweek wrote, [...] "There is no denying the sheer kinetic drive of this new Hair... there is something hard, grabby, slightly corrupt about O'Horgan's virtuosity, like Busby Berkeley gone bitchy." [...] But a reviewer from Time wrote that although the show [...] "thrums with vitality [...] crippled by being a bookless musical and, like a boneless fish, it drifts when it should swim." ...|$|E

[...] Aubrey's treachery led the producer John Houseman in 1959 to dub him [...] "The Smiling Cobra." [...] Houseman in public was less direct. In December 1962, CBS announced it was spending $250,000 an episode on Houseman's hour-long drama on American history for the next season, The Great Adventure, but on July 25, 1963, CBS announced Houseman had resigned. The producer told The New York Times [...] "The <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> they want is not what I wanted to produce" [...] but attributed his departure to a simple difference of opinion, the Times reporter stating Houseman [...] "expressed no criticism of CBS."

500|$|Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> you were watching. The finale sticks us into {{what seems to be a}} pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker." [...] Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He stated, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] was a very odd finale and I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like most of us thought it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.|$|E
500|$|Teri VanHorn of MTV {{said that}} with [...] "Her body newly toned and her smile beaming, she looked every bit like {{a woman who had}} emerged from her quarter-life crisis {{stronger}} than yesterday." [...] She also said Spears performed with [...] "a naughty, free-spirited attitude", as though she [...] "had invited 900 friends to her dirty little dance party, and too bad for you if you couldn't roll with the fun." [...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It was not the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– {{if you want to call}} it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} favorable. Columnist Joan Crosby noted that [...] "This is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> you don't think you'll laugh at, but you do, mostly because the cast is so good." [...] She noted that Cleavon Little, Joan Van Ark, and Reva Rose were, respectively, [...] "marvelous", [...] "pretty", and [...] "funny", and that Nancy Fox [...] "wins this year's cute-as-a-kitten award". Barbara Holsopple, TV and radio {{editor for the}} Pittsburgh Press, noted that [...] "ABC did a gutsy turnabout in taking the heavy drama out of a {{hospital}} {{and replacing it with}} comedy. The venture worked well, thanks to excellent performances from the Temperatures Rising cast". She [...] praised Albertson, noted that Whitmore [...] "was little seen", and that the series: [...] "is the kind of tidy little show that brings chuckles". Win Fanning, a syndicated columnist, stated that: [...] "the comedy writing and performances by a beautifully integrated cast give Temperatures a bright, light quality so seldom achieved in a situation comedy", and that it was: [...] "loaded with one-liners and sight gags, which, if kept on the level of the opener, promise many hours of hilarity". Fanning praised Little as [...] "one of the comedy finds of any TV season", and Fox as [...] "a fresh new face and talent giving promise of a long, successful career ahead". More praise for the series came after the broadcast of its fourth episode. An unidentified reviewer, writing for the Armored Sentinel (of Temple, Texas), stated [...] "If you're suffering from the case of the 'downs,' this series is a sure pick up!" [...] The reviewer went on to note that [...] "the brightest spot of the series is wacky Nancy Fox. Her role applies the wackiness of Goldie Hawn, but in situation comedy form. I'd watch the show just for her! The whole series is wacky and funny; it's downright good. I highly recommend it." ...|$|E
500|$|The revamped concerts {{were also}} met with {{critical}} acclaim. Mark Savage from BBC Online reviewed {{the first of the}} revised performances in the United Kingdom. Savage described the concert as a hugely ambitious, terrifyingly loud show, [...] "spread over four acts and held together by a flimsy 'narrative' about Gaga and her dancer friends trying to get to a party." [...] He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks. MTV's James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He said that the tour was [...] "packed with more wattage than an overheated power plant and more costume changes than a thousand Vegas reviews, it's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>show</b> that leaves you with wide eyes, ringing ears, aching limbs and absolutely zero chance of making it to work in the morning." [...] New York Daily News writer Jim Farber expected that the theatricality of the show might have obscured the songs, but instead felt that Gaga's voice was perfect and the concert actually [...] "pushed Gaga a long way towards her obvious goal – to be the queen of this pop moment." [...] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday said that Gaga [...] "built her monster-sized fame on knowing how to create a spectacle and then having the substance to back it up. For every coat made of Kermit the Frog dolls or headdresses that covered her face in red lace, there was a stomping disco anthem or tender piano ballad to match. That back and forth is the centerpiece of her Monster Ball Tour." [...] Dan Aquilante from the New York Post was critical of the show, calling it [...] "scripted, silly, and tired, right down to Gaga's patter." [...] He added that the 15 costumes Gaga wore during the two-hour plus gig were [...] "more successful helping her cement the notion of an erotic and exotic otherworld." [...] Writing in the Telegram & Gazette, Craig S. Semon was appreciative of the show, calling it [...] "an out-of-this-world blast and end-of-the-world blow-out that must be seen to be believed." ...|$|E
