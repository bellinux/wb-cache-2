5|$|The Somerset Levels—specifically dry {{points at}} Glastonbury and Brent Knoll— {{also have a}} long history of settlement, and are known to have been settled by Mesolithic hunters.

5|$|All of {{the native}} tribes {{experienced}} gradual disillusionment with the U.S. government because of its inability or unwillingness to honor its treaty commitments. The major leaders among the tribes were Wabasha and Little Crow among the Dakota Sioux, Flat Mouth and Hole-in-the-Day among the Ojibwe, and Winneshiek among the Winnebago. The success of treaty negotiations between the U.S. and the tribes was in great part <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mixed race families such as the Faribaults and the Renvilles.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The ascent of republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E

This international NGO supports Madagascar's Parc Ivoloina, helps protect Betampona Reserve and other protected areas, and promotes field research, breeding programs, conservation planning, and education in zoos. One of their major projects involved the release of captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs, designed to help restock the dwindling population within Betampona Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological foe, the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> internal stability {{that the end of the}} Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{large-scale}} immigration was <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{introduction of}} steamships (from 1823). By 1840, up to 5,000 English people, mostly half-pay officers and their families, {{had settled in}} Jersey. In the aftermath of 1848, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey. Following Louis Napoléon's coup of 1851, more French proscrits arrived. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.|$|E

The western part of the city houses educational institutions, modern buildings, residential areas, shopping malls, multiplexes and new business districts centred around roads such as Ashram Road, C. G. Road and Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{galvanization}} of Mogadishu's {{real estate}} sector {{was in part}} <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a local construction yard in November 2012 by the Municipality of Istanbul and the Turkish Red Crescent. With 50 construction trucks and machines imported from Turkey, the yard produces concrete, asphalt and paving stones for building projects. The Istanbul Municipality was also scheduled to bring in 100 specialists to accelerate the construction initiative, which ultimately aims to modernize the capital's infrastructure and serve it over the long-term.|$|E

Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> absence of a white knight on the f3-square (that would {{otherwise}} cover the h4-square) and of a black knight on the f6-square (that would block {{the way for the}} black queen). If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.|$|E

5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} research {{that began in}} the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market the first full flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars and light trucks. The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 thousand in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fuel distribution infrastructure already in place, as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were available by 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program.|$|E
5|$|After playing 48 {{games in}} the 2006–07 NHL season, Kesler {{suffered}} a torn acetabular labrum and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season, finishing the season with sixteen points. Kesler returned to the Canucks lineup for the first game of their quarterfinal playoff series versus the Dallas Stars. While blocking a shot in the fourth overtime of the game, Kesler was re-injured, suffering a displaced index finger. Despite finishing the game, Kesler was forced to undergo surgery to repair the damage and missed the remainder of the playoffs. In the off-season, the Canucks re-signed Kesler to a three-year, $5.25-million contract extension on May 24, 2007. In comparison to his previous contract, <b>facilitated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Flyers' offer sheet, the deal represented a $150,000 paycut in terms of average annual salary.|$|E
