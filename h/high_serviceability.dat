No. 81 Wing's involvement in Operation Okra concluded in May 2017, with No. 1 Squadron resuming responsibility for this task. By this time all of the wing's three squadrons had completed at least one rotation to the Middle East: No. 3 Squadron was deployed once, {{and the other two}} squadrons conducted two deployments. The squadrons used a common 'pool' of aircraft during these deployments, with either six or seven Hornets being stationed in the Middle East at any time. The aircraft were typically deployed for eight months before rotating back to Australia when becoming due for major servicing. Members of the three Hornet-equipped squadrons served five or six month rotations, and ground crew from 2OCU and No. 81 Wing's workshops were also deployed to fill specialist roles. The Hornets attacked ISIL personnel and facilities in both Iraq and Syria, including in support of Iraqi forces engaged in the Battle of Mosul. Overall, No. 81 Wing conducted 1,973 sorties over Iraq and Syria during which 1,961 munitions were released.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation aimed at developing reinforced concrete beams consisting of precast permanent U-shaped reinforced mortar forms filled with different types of core materials {{to be used as a}} viable alternative to the conventional reinforced concrete beam. To accomplish this objective, an experimental program was conducted and theoretical model was adopted. The experimental program comprised casting and testing of thirty beams of total dimensions 300  ×  150  ×  2, 000  mm consisting of permanent precast U-shaped reinforced mortar forms of thickness 25  mm filled with the core material. Three additional typical reinforced concrete beams of the same total dimensions were also cast to serve as control specimens. Two types of single-layer and double-layers steel meshes were used to reinforce the permanent U-shaped forms; namely welded wire mesh and X 8 expanded steel mesh. Three types of core materials were investigated: conventional concrete, autoclaved aerated lightweight concrete brick, and recycled concrete. Two types of shear connections between the precast permanent reinforced mortar form and the core material were investigated namely; adhesive bonding layer between the two surfaces, and mechanical shear connectors. The test specimens were tested as simple beams under three-point loadings on a span of 1, 800  mm. The behavior of the beams incorporating the permanent forms was compared to that of the control beams. The experimental results showed that better crack resistance, <b>high</b> <b>serviceability</b> and ultimate loads, and good energy absorption could be achieved by using the proposed beams which verifies the validity of using the proposed system.

PMS comprises of section classification; performance prediction; and optimisation for decision-making. For section classification, this research presents a fuzzy inference system (FIS), with appropriate membership functions for section classifications and for calculating the pavement condition index (PCI). The severity and extent of seven distress types (alligator cracking, block cracking, longitudinal and transverse cracking, patching, potholes, bleeding and ravelling) were used as fuzzy inputs. The result showed a good correlation for fuzzy model. A sensitivity analysis showed a pavement crack has the greatest influence on section classification compared to the other distress types. A novel network level deterministic deterioration model was developed for flexible pavement on arterial and collector roads in four climatic zones considering the impact of maintenance, age, area and length of cracks, and traffic loading. The prediction models showed good accuracy with high determination coefficient (R 2). The cross-validation study showed that the models for arterial roads yield better accuracy than the models for collector roads. A sensitivity analysis showed that the area and length of cracks have the most significant impact on the model performance. A novel discrete barebones multi-objective particle swarm algorithm was applied for a discrete multi-objective problem. Conventional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques require a manual selection of various control parameters for the velocity term. In contrast, the bare-bones PSO has the advantage of being velocity-free, hence, does not involve any parameter selection. The discrete barebones multi-objective PSO algorithm was applied to find optimal rehabilitation scheduling considering the two objectives of the minimisation of the total pavement rehabilitation cost and the minimisation of the sum of all residual PCI values. The results showed that the optimal maintenance plan found by the novel algorithm is the better than found by conventional algorithm. Although the results of performance metrics showed that the both algorithms perform on a par, the novel algorithm is clearly advantageous as it does not need parameter selection...|$|E

The main objective of this research paper is to numerically analyze the best stiffener combination and distribution along the length of bridge, both longitudinally and transversally, {{in order to avoid the}} patch-loading phenomenon in the slender webs. An optimum design of a triangular cell along the lower plate is also presented. Thus the best stiffener distribution along the deck can be achieved to solve the two most important factors during the launching of a steel bridge: the huge forces on the support section – <b>higher</b> than the <b>serviceability</b> limit state – and buckling instability due to the point loads on the bearings. In this way, a three dimensional finite element model (FEM) is built and the design of experiments technique (DOE) is applied to obtain the best stiffener configuration.

The kilns are constructed from carbon manganese structural and pressure vessel plates and welded {{in the same manner}} a s large pressure vessels, however structural welding standards are applied. The mineral sands are purified using a pyrometallurgical process where the internal operating temperature reaches approximately 1200 °C. These temperatures are outside the operational limits of carbon manganese steel, so a protective internal layer of refractory approximately 250 mm thick is required to reduce the shell temperature to between 100 °C and 200 °C. The refractory is poured in strips along the bottom of the kiln incorporating refractory anchors to stabilise the refractory upon drying. The refractory anchors are 253 MA stainless steel, secured to the kiln shell via a welded lug incorporating a slot. This design is referred to as a “rotor lok” assembly. Failure of the welded lug is relatively common during service, requiring costly kiln shutdown for remedial work and casting new refractory. The failures are mainly contributable to stress concentrations present at the fillet weld toes, with fatigue the failure mechanism in all cases. When failures arise, movement of the refractory lining over time causes a loss of lining where irreversible damage to the kiln shell occurs. This dissertation researches and discusses alternative methods for securing the 253 MA stainless steel refractory anchor to the kiln shell to provide a <b>higher</b> level of <b>serviceability</b> and reliability to prevent costly unexpected refinery shutdown.

40|$|When {{designing}} Low-Level RF (LLRF) {{system for}} {{the new generation of}} Free-Electron Laser (FEL) machines there are many considerations. First is superior performance of the front-end electronics focused on ultra-low phase noise which contributes {{to the quality of the}} electromagnetic field of superconducting RF cavities in accelerating modules, stability of accelerated electron bunches arrival time and finally to the output laser light of FEL. Other important goals for LLRF system are drift minimization, remote control and diagnostics, <b>high</b> reliability and <b>serviceability.</b> This can be achieved introducing to all subsystems highly integrated PCB modules that can accommodate all the system requirements. One of the crucial subsystems of the LLRF front-end is Local Oscillator (LO) generation and Clock (CLK) generation which are a subject of this article. The cavity probe signal of frequency 1300 MHz is mixed with ultra-low phase noise LO signal 1354 MHz and downconverted to an intermediate frequency (IF) of 54 MHz. This lower frequency IF signal holds the original amplitude and phase information of the field inside the cavity. The IF signal is sampled by analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with 81 MHz low jitter CLK and processed by digital part of the LLRF. The cavity ﬁeld detection critically inﬂuences the regulation of the acceleration ﬁeld. That is why phase noise performance of the LO and CLK signals is of our interest here. This is even more critical when vector sum of probe signals from multiple cavities is calculated and used for field regulation. In this paper different LO and CLK generation schemes have been presented and discussed. Performance and small form factor for PCB integration were of our interest. Phase-lock loop (PLL) based technique and mixing technique were considered the most promising for LO generation. Technologies limits where performance and the size of VCO’s and LO filters are in tradeoff have been met. Low jitter CLK generation circuit optimization has been described. 2 DUT phase detector test methodology has been used to measure residual phase noise of different LO and CLK generation circuits. Circuit of the best performance has been chosen for the final realization. Results at the level of single femtoseconds of the residual integrated RMS time jitter have been achieved. Based on that a family of LO and CLK generation modules has been developed...|$|R
40|$|National {{accounting}} and national accounts concepts {{have very strong}} links to business {{accounting and}} business accounts concepts, and economic theory. The current trend in national accounting work is {{to carry out the}} task based on a framework which functions as an integrated general purpose statistical information system. The principal constraints to this approach are data availability which {{is a function of the}} standard and serviceability of the country's national statistical system, and general conventional accounting principles. It is submitted that one of the important properties that a system of national accounts should possess is inherent flexibility in order to allow such a system to respond sensitively to developments in economic theory and specialized needs/demands. Even though the development of certain national accounting principles can be traced back to the seventeenth century, national accounting generally is a twentieth century invention, with the development of the SNA as a very major breakthrough. One of the SNA's most valuable contributions is its provision of a consistent and comprehensive framework in terms of national accounting concepts, definitions and principles. The application of the conventional national accounting principles to Tonga and other developing countries has been confronted with many conceptual and statistical problems. The existence of imperfect national price systems in developing countries has led many critics to question the validity of national income estimates for such countries. It has been submitted that such imperfection of national price systems has been essentially a function of constraints on commodity and factor movements. It is argued however that many such restrictions cannot be applied with significant force to the case of Tonga and that there exists great validity and usefulness in making national income estimation. Non-market portion of total production in the economy of Tonga is significant. Its estimation for national accounting purposes is faced with the conceptual problems of setting appropriate boundary of production and imputation. The recommendations of the SNA with regard to the former are endorsed for national accounting practice in Tonga with special attention to transactions such as the unilateral provisions of free and/or partially paid services by Tongans to government and church authorities. Due to the predominantly agricultural character of the Tongan economy and the existence of a partial subsistence sector, certain conceptual problems arising from the need to make clear distinctions between production and consumption, and saving and investment in accordance with the Keynesian framework are bound to prevail with regard to national accounting in the Kingdom. There are also the problems associated with any attempt to distinguish the various factor shares of national income. Recommendations and comments concerning possible means of minimizing these problems or perhaps putting such, problems into some balanced perspective, are presented. Statistical problems faced with national accounting work in Tonga are generally associated with the inadequacy and unreliability of basic national accounting statistics, and the shortage of appropriate material and human resources. While most of the statistical problems can be substantially alleviated by more liberal direction of resources to the process of data collection and national income estimation, some of the statistical problems like the conceptual problems would persist in Tonga as long as the general standard of the Kingdom's national statistical system is low and the general state of under-development prevails. A close scrutiny of the general performance and structure of the Tongan economy, current and anticipated future needs/demands for various national accounting statistical series, and current and anticipated future status of data availability, suggests that a system of national accounts for Tonga which could bring out the important economic characteristics and inter-relationships of important sectors in the economy would be considered as very desirable. With the increasing complexity of the Kingdom's economy and associated increasing diversity of needs/demands for appropriate statistical series, it is felt that a system of national accounts which offers greater disaggregation of important aggregates and which views the production sector at some component levels such as "Agricultural", "Non-Agricultural, Non-Financial" and "Financial" production sub-sectors even though it is a diversion from the general recommendations of the SNA, would merit a <b>high</b> level of <b>serviceability.</b> A system of national accounts which is essentially based on a system of sector accounts with the incorporation of the above stated partitioning of the production sector is therefore proposed for Tonga. The proposed system also consists of sets of supplementary tables and aggregative accounts which aim at providing essential supplementary information via the adoption of different classification systems or appropriate aggregations of information exhibited in the sector accounts. Issues concerning suggested future expansion of the proposed system to include appropriate input-output matrices and flow of funds tables and the need for a proper development and application of an appropriate social accounting matrix (SAM) for Tonga are also discussed. The proposed system of national accounts for Tonga is relatively comprehensive and possesses inherent flexibility which is a reflection of its primary inheritance from the SNA. Even though it might take some time before the proposed design can be implemented in full, its relative comprehensiveness would automatically serve a lot of useful purposes e. g. its explicit facilitation of attention to gaps in the existing data series. The implementation of the proposed system is regarded as a feasible long term project for the Tonga national statistical agency. The extent to which it can be implemented in the very near future given Government's acceptance, would depend heavily on the priority level the Tonga Government attaches or would attach to the task of developing and improving the Kingdom's national accounting system...|$|R
