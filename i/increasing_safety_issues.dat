In 1971, the newly-built and much safer Circuit Paul Ricard held the French Grand Prix for the first time, before becoming the events permanent home from 1973 onwards. It continued to host smaller motorsports competitions such as Formula 3, sports car racing, touring car racing, rallying and hillclimbing {{as well as the}} Trophées d'Auverne. In 1980, three track marshals were killed at a touring car race, and in 1984 there was a drivers protest over track safety.

40|$|Safe {{residential}} neighbourhood areas {{are the most}} important elements of safe cities. As crime rates keep on <b>increasing,</b> <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> has been taken into consideration in housing planning all over the world. Design elements can {{play a significant role in}} reducing crime and these elements can be implemented as a variety of design functions for crime prevention in {{residential neighbourhood}}. Design elements are the combination of nature and construction components of living elements, natural elements, human elements and abstract elements. They include vegetation, fences and barriers, lightings, pathways, signage, guard houses, access, playground facilities, parking, bus stop and good maintenance. Hence, this study is to determine the design elements based on three (3) objectives: to identify the design elements that can reduce crime in the residential neighbourhood; to identify the characteristics of the design elements in reducing crime; and finally to recommend selected elements for crime reduction in residential neighbourhood. The concept of defensible space was developed for the public housing environment. It is similar to CPTED (Crime Prevention through Environmental Design) in that it shares the basic characteristics of natural surveillance, natural access control and territorial concern. The study area is located at USJ 6, Subang Jaya. Finally, the results obtained were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings of this research concluded that design elements (i. e., vegetation; fences and barriers; lightings; pathways; signage; guard houses; and good access), are important components in reducing crime. Environmental designs help the community in residential areas to be free from crime. Residents believed that gated housing, target hardening, functioning lightings, and regular maintenance schedule improved security in neighbourhood. Social activities such as neighbourhood watch program and attending meetings about safety issues will increase the awareness to create a safer community. Furthermore, social interaction becomes the most essential part especially to develop an effective surveillance by residents. The proper placement of design elements within the residential neighbourhood can provide opportunities for improvement in the quality of life and safety...|$|E

During the competition, the structure {{of this kind of}} ships is subjected to repeated impacts. It is then fundamental to understand the damage evolution in order to select the most appropriate materials and <b>increase</b> <b>safety</b> <b>issues.</b> The present study is aimed at analysing the behaviour of sandwich-structured composites undergoing repeated low-energy impacts. Three different materials have been analysed. Two are sandwich-structured composites used for the cockpit of offshore powerboats and differing only by the core cell thickness. The third material is composed only by the skin of the same sandwich structures, without the core. Impacts were made at three different energy levels: 15, 17. 5 and 20 J. In addition to the parameters typically used for the assessment of the impact damage, a new damage assessment has been carried out by means of three-dimensional optical measurements of the imprinted volumes resulting from the impact events. This approach has allowed the definition of a correlation between the imprinted volumes and the number of impacts, until the complete perforation, for each single specimen. Finally, thanks to usual indexes and the imprinted volumes, some considerations are developed about the influence of the core cell thickness in powerboats design...|$|R

40|$|Coincident {{with rising}} vulture populations {{have been reports}} of <b>increased</b> {{aircraft}} <b>safety</b> <b>issues.</b> There have been over 700 vulture strikes with US Air Force aircraft at costs in excess of $ 150 million. The Avon Park Air Force Range (APAFR) harbors a thriving vulture population which often creates dangerous situations for pilots on low-level training missions. In 2005 - 2006, we conducted research to 1) disperse vultures from roosts on and near the APAFR; 2) assess vulture use of the ranges before and after roost dispersal; and 3) evaluate vulture use of the surrounding area. Baseline counts of vultures leaving a large nearby roost ranged from 144 to 624 (mean = 404). After roost dispersal using vulture effigies, counts were 2 - 91 (mean = 41). Prior to roost dispersal, vultures counted over the training ranges varied between 0 and 50, whereas post-treatment counts ranged from 1 to 20. Mean counts did not change appreciably following roost dispersal. We tagged and released 373 birds (332 black vultures and 41 turkey vultures), of which 47 (12. 6 %) have been resighted. We conclude that the county landfill adjacent to the southern boundary of APAFR is a key resource for area vultures. Unfortunately, the lack of data confirming interactions among vultures and aircraft on the APAFR, permits no risk profile. Records of when, where, and how missions are altered or impacted by vultures would allow for a risk profile to be developed. This in turn {{could be used to}} schedule missions during periods of lower hazard conditions and to allocate resources optimally to counter potential bird strike threats. Finally, removing or limiting certain land use activities (calving livestock, mowing, burning, timber harvesting) would greatly reduce the attractiveness of the APAFR for vultures and in turn, <b>increase</b> <b>safety...</b>|$|R

It {{was necessary to}} rapidly switch from the computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system towards a paper-based order entry (PBOE) system. This {{was an opportunity to}} evaluate prescriber opinion on the two provider order entry (POE) systems. MethodsAll residents were asked to fill an augmented version of the POE satisfaction and usage survey for both POE systems. The results were compared to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each system. ResultsFifty-one respondents had used the CPOE system and the PBOE system. Overall, satisfaction was higher with PBOE than CPOE (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 74; p < 0. 001). Usability (OR = 4. 00; p < 0. 001), reliability (OR = 8. 54; p < 0. 001), time consumption (OR = 0. 50; p < 0. 05 – survey statement was formulated negatively), and communication with nurses (OR = 14. 27; p < 0. 0001) reached statistically better agreement. The more experience with CPOE the more residents were disillusioned with the reliability (OR = 6. 55; p < 0. 01), the usability (OR = 5. 68; p < 0. 01) and the patient safety (OR = 0. 27; p < 0. 05 – survey statement was formulated negatively) of CPOE. Although <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> were reported for both systems, the causes were different; PBOE imposed frequent rewriting of the order while CPOE lack of usability might be unsafe. Another important issue with both POE systems was time consumption. ConclusionResidents did not report any <b>increase</b> in <b>safety</b> <b>issues</b> with the rapid switch from CPOE to PBOE.

40|$|Many of today’s health {{problems}} {{are related to}} a lack of movement or can be treated by increased movement. The ability to move was once considered a standard part of any Child’s daily life and all children had a sound physical literacy that progressed into adulthood. However with <b>increasing</b> technology, <b>safety</b> <b>issues,</b> and environmental restrictions many children no longer grow up with a movement based approach to fun and daily activity. The human body was designed to move and science has shown the benefits of movement and exercise for a range of health related conditions. In order to provide our children with these basic foundations of movement we must first understand the movement competencies required to develop this physical literacy. The aim of this research was firstly to identify the current physical literacy of these movement competencies in primary school children and determine inter-rater and intra-rater reliability in the screening tools. Screening of nearly 1000 local children was conducted in conjunction with the schools according to an approved human ethics research program.

40|$|The historically-reactive {{approach}} to identifying safety problems and mitigating them involves selecting black spots or hot spots by ranking locations based on crash frequency and severity. The approach focuses {{mainly on the}} corridor level without taking the exposure rate (vehicle miles traveled) and socio-demographics information of the study area, which are very important in the transportation planning process, into consideration. A larger study analysis unit at the Transportation Analysis Zone (TAZ) level or the network planning level {{should be used to}} address the needs of development of the community in the future and incorporate safety into the long-range transportation planning process. In this study, existing planning tools (such as the PLANSAFE models presented in NCHRP Report 546) were evaluated for forecasting safety in small and medium-sized communities, particularly as related to changes in socio-demographics characteristics, traffic demand, road network, and countermeasures. The research also evaluated the applicability of the Empirical Bayes (EB) method to network-level analysis.
