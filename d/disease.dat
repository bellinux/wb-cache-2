5|$|Alzheimer's <b>disease</b> is {{an incurable}} {{neurodegenerative}} <b>disease</b> which most often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts for more than}} half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the <b>disease</b> is identified as a protein misfolding <b>disease.</b> Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's <b>disease.</b> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E
