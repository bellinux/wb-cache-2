40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to point up the {{problems}} of Humanist foundations and continuing influence on Rhetorical Theory, especially as regards rhetorical approaches to <b>ecological</b> <b>discourse</b> evaluation. The primary reason for this investigation derives from the fact that most contemporary coverage of <b>ecological</b> <b>discourse</b> comes from rhetorical approaches thoroughly burdened with human-focus, rather than discursive approaches sensitive to ecological connection. Assessing the literature of ecological rhetorical studies and a case study of adolescent environmental literature, I propose that a rhizomatic approach to assessing ecological rhetoric is an appropriate and necessary departure from traditional modes of discourse assessment—particularly due to our need to emphasize connection with the world, both symbolically and physically. ...|$|E

Ecology is the study of ecosystems. Only marginally was the traditional ecology concerned about sustainability.

We also note a general lack of theoretical engagement between the discourses of ecologism and sustainability and contrast this gap with the sustainability-related practices in universities. In order to create a practical understanding, we go on to define the specifics of ecologism and sustainability in higher education through illustrating the sustainable practices found at the Duke University (Duke) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU).

40|$|After {{withdrawing}} from the Kyoto Protocol, the US Bush Administration and the Australian Howard Government pursued an international climate change policy focussed on voluntary international agreements outside the UN climate negotiations. This strategy included the formation of several climate agreements directed at technology development, including the 2005 Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP). The APP provides a model for international climate change policy directed at voluntary national greenhouse gas intensity targets, technology development through sectoral public–private partnerships and technology diffusion through trade. This article situates the APP within these US and Australian inspired climate agreements formed outside the UN negotiations. Bӓckstrand and Lӧvbrand’s (in M. Pettenger (ed.) The social construction of climate change: power knowledge norms discourses, 2007) discourse analysis {{in relation to the}} international climate negotiations is used to explore differences between the APP and UN climate treaties. We find the APP embodies a discourse of what we call ‘deregulatory ecological modernisation’ that promotes limited public funding to ease informational failures in markets for cleaner technologies and management practices. The deregulatory <b>ecological</b> modernisation <b>discourse</b> is a deeply intensive market liberal approach to international climate change policy, which contests binding emission reduction targets {{and the development of a}} global carbon market. The USA, Australia, Japan and Canada represented a core group of countries that used the APP to promote the deregulatory <b>ecological</b> modernisation <b>discourse</b> and thereby contest any deepening of developed nations’ emission reduction targets for the post- 2012 period.

These tensions are examined through the example of the Burnley millennium arboretum, where three thousand non-native trees form part of the urban arboretum. The Burnley arboretum is examined in the context of local authority initiatives set up by central government to address and enable racial cohesion in this region since the race riots of 2001. The organic cosmopolitanism represented {{at the site of the}} arboretum challenges the orthodoxy of contemporary ecological categorisations of ‘native’ and ‘non-native’. The arboretum also represents a site where, through materialised memory and cultural dialogue, a new civic pride and citizenship is being forged for this multicultural community. Visual methods have been used to chart the memories of past landscapes and the contemporary experiences of place that British Muslims have had in Pakistan and do have with the Burnley landscape. The community’s sense of feelings of isolation, exclusion and fear are recorded on canvas.

40|$|Nature never speaks by itself,” {{least of}} all in <b>ecological</b> <b>discourses,</b> where the line between brand-marketing {{strategies}} {{and the protection of}} nature is continually blurred. Strategies employed by activists testify that the crisis of nature is being constantly represented and renegotiated by different social actors. The ever-growing number of unconventional advertising campaigns executed by environmental organizations is a clear sign of the changeable nature of discourses about the crisis of the environment. One of the most interesting and yet unexplored aspects of the mediatization of nature is the continuous evolution of visual communication strategies used by environmental movements to denounce the ecosystem crisis and to influence public opinion. In recent years, we have noted an increase in greenwashing practices: the intentional dissemination of misleading or unsubstantiated information by organizations in order to conceal their abuse of the environment, or to promote vaguely formulated “sustainable practices” and products to present a positive public image. If we focus on the “responsibility” of images in the context of green/greenwashed strategies, two elements become obvious. On the one hand, we can detect the communication strategies adopted by corporations to reassert their environmental commitment. On the other hand, we see the political use of images by ecological movements and organizations, in particular their creative re-appropriation of the visual imagery of sustainability. The imagery used here can be categorized as eco-imagery. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of assigning monetary values to ecological goods and services, {{in order to}} resolve what David Pearce calls the “zero price problem ” has been a subject of debate practically since it was first proposed.

40|$|This thesis {{engages in}} {{analysis}} and interpretation of certain ideas within the critical theory of Theodor W. Adorno (1903 - 1969). These analyses are placed into a constellational relationship with some filmic works of Andrei Tarkovsky and Michael Haneke. In doing so, I aim to highlight the ongoing relevance and validity of at least some core elements of Adornian theory in a contemporary context. The thesis consists of four substantive chapters. The first chapter functions as an extended introduction to and justification for the thesis as a whole, and it provides the theoretical background to the project before explicating {{the idea of a}} constellational method. The second chapter explores the notion of mimesis in Adorno’s thought and Tarkovsky’s films as a crucial rejoinder to the prevailing ‘communicative’ paradigm instituted in large part by Jürgen Habermas’ work. The third chapter considers the importance of marginality to the task of social critique by analyzing Adorno’s theoretical reflections on the matter and how these can be related to and supported by Haneke’s filmic work. The fourth and final chapter examines the relationship between humanity and nature within two preeminent <b>ecological</b> <b>discourses,</b> in contrast to Adorno’s critical theory and some of Tarkovsky’s films, with the intention of showing how the latter offer a more nuanced and dialectical understanding of this relation. Throughout the analyses herein, I defend and demonstrate the fertility and pertinence of Adornian theory, for both the interpretation of film and robust criticism of extant social and political conditions. The thesis shows that by constellating Adorno’s critical theory with film one may bring out important insights that enhance and enable people’s capacity to critically respond to the woefully inadequate status quo...|$|R

Runtime: 56 : 13 minutesSustainable and <b>ecological</b> <b>discourses</b> of urban design and planning are overwhelming in recent literatures, however, focusing mostly on normative criteria or policy oriented tools. Operational approaches to connecting ecological analysis and urban design are largely unexplored. The book argues {{for the third}} ecology proposition, a perspective that cities as a system contains ecological flows. Its approach to urban design articulates urban form and ecological flows to create symbiotic relationship of urban, industrial and natural systems. The distinction between traditional urban design and ecological systems design has been made. Traditional designs tend to be deterministic in form making, while ecosystem approaches to urban design deal with ecological processes that are stochastic. Traditional urban design treats “ecology in cities” as ways of preserving or adding ecological elements such as green spaces to urban environment. Ecological systems design advocates “ecology by design”, an inherently ecology-structured urban system, and sees ecology as a driving force of urban transformation to reconstruct ecosystems compatibility by linking the urban forms and flows of material, energy, water and organism across the system boundaries. The design methodology of ecological urbanism provides a set of organizational principles of ecological urban spaces that are operated based on the measures of ecological performances of urban geometric form, perceptual quality and material surface. They are situated in cross-scale contexts of hierarchical complex systems of cities, and {{should be considered in}} temporal dimension, system threshold and stochastic process to manage urban change and make sustainable progress...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the politics of}} sustainability in New Zealand through {{a case study of}} the dairy industry. New Zealand’s ‘clean and green’ image was bolstered by the passing of the Resource Management Act (RMA) (1991) to much international acclaim. Yet, since its adoption, the country has seen a dramatic expansion and intensification of dairy farming which has resulted in significant environmental decline. The thesis seeks to answer why this has occurred despite the provisions of New Zealand’s apparent world-leading environmental sustainability legislation. The thesis {{examines the}} history of agricultural practice and environmental legislation in New Zealand, contemporary environmental policy and its implementation, dairy industry responses to the challenge of sustainability, and a lakes restoration initiative. Informed by a critical discourse analysis approach, the thesis developed a discourse analytic framework to identify technological, ecological modernisation and sustainable development discourses within environmental policies and processes and dairy industry practice and explore the implications of these discourses. The framework is also applied to the analysis of stakeholder interviews, a Q-sort survey, and texts from a variety of governmental and nongovernmental organisations. The analysis offers insights into the disjuncture between the intentions of the RMA and actual environmental outcomes. The thesis found that policy practice was dominated by the <b>ecological</b> modernisation <b>discourse.</b> Despite the RMA being underpinned by a sustainable development normative framework, in practice the <b>ecological</b> modernisation <b>discourse</b> has informed the implementation mechanisms and social processes required by government and the dairy industry to realise primarily economic goals. The <b>ecological</b> modernisation <b>discourse</b> has enabled continued support for a productivist and utilitarian approach to the environment. The research also found there were small-scale instances of a different institutional approach, involving bottom-up initiatives and widespread community participation in decision processes, which offered an example of more environmentally sustainable policy and practice. Specifically, in the Central North Island lakes catchments, where dairying has led to a sharp decline of lake water quality, the policy response has been normatively and institutionally shaped by the sustainable development discourse. A critical outcome is that pastoral farmers within the lakes catchments are now required to farm within the limits of the carrying capacity of these regions. These comparative cases offer a powerful alternative, and a possible blueprint for the institutionalisation of sustainable agriculture into the rest of the country. A comparison of the findings of the larger dairy industry study and the small-scale study of the lakes reveals that despite the Resource Management Act offering the same legislative context in both instances, the <b>ecological</b> modernisation <b>discourse</b> predominates in the first instance and the sustainable development discourse in the latter case. The contrasting outcomes may be explained by a range of factors such as the political will to act on environmental degradation, the importance of the lakes to the tourism industry and hence presenting an economic imperative, and the desire of the local community including Maori, most significantly, to ensure the survival of the lakes. Such factors are not evident in the more diffused national context of the dairy industry. The lakes study and the Q-survey results also reveal that a sustainable development approach has the potential to lead to better long-term environmental sustainability results. Ultimately, the thesis demonstrates that different sustainability discourses shape different sustainability outcomes. It illuminates how nature-society relationships in New Zealand continue to be marked by power relations and power struggles that are shaped by political ideologies. The study concludes that an overwhelming emphasis by the government and the dairy industry on economic productivism has trumped any concern about environmental sustainability enshrined in the Resource Management Act, although interventions driven by a sustainable development discourse remain possible on a local scale...|$|R

Correspondingly, examples for products based upon forms of carbon accounting {{can be found in}} national inventories, corporate environmental reports or carbon footprint calculators. Likening sustainability measurement, as an instance of <b>ecological</b> modernisation <b>discourses</b> and policy, carbon accounting is hoped to provide a factual ground for carbon-related decision-making. However, social scientific studies of accounting challenge this hope, pointing to the socially constructed character of carbon conversion factors or of the accountants' work practice which cannot implement abstract accounting schemes into reality.|$|R

To this end, this paper critically discusses the roles of parents towards ecological crisis from the Christian or biblical perspective of their responsibilities towards their children. Using a hermeneutic phenomenological method of analysis, the article argues that ecological disasters of tomorrow could be prevented today through effective ecologically centred Christian parenting. </span...|$|R

However, these more strongly pro-market traditions raise important questions and provide useful insights concerning the challenges of translating the political ideology of ‘ecologism’ into practical proposals for democratic governance. Hayekian thought raises vital questions concerning the capacity of political processes to address complex challenges of coordinating the formulation and delivery of the sustainability objectives of ecologism. Scholarship on ecological modernisation and the ‘new regulation’ offer important insights into how shifting interrelationships {{between the state and}} private sector in the policy process might enable this challenge to be more effectively addressed. These areas for further developing proposals for a Green state are illustrated here through a case study of the zero carbon homes policy agenda in England...|$|R
