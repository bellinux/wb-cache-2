In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army.

40|$|Aside {{from the}} {{principle}} of irretrievable breakdown, {{the principle of}} fault-based liability {{is one of the}} two primary principles of Austrian divorce law. Based on the applicable principle of fault-based liability, a spouse can impose an immediate divorce against the will of the other spouse only if the marriage has irretrievably broken down due to a severe violation of the marriage contract. Otherwise the spouse intending to divorce has to wait until the require- ments for a divorce due to an irretrievable breakdown are in place, in particular a severing of the marriage bond for three years (in special <b>hardship</b> <b>cases</b> up to six years). The question as to which of the two spouses is at fault for the failure of the marriage also impacts the consequences of divorce, in particular the claims of the divorced spouses with regard to maintenance and social insurance. Since, according to available statistics, male spouses far more frequently commit severe violations of the marriage contract than female spouses, and women, due to the housekeeping and child-rearing that they undertake with far greater frequency, are significantly more often dependent on maintenance than men, an elimination of the principle of fault-based liability from Austrian divorce law would have a generally disadvantageous effect for women with regard to gender relations...|$|R

The law allow civil service of federation, and of provinces, to be regulated as per rules notified under these enactments. Consequently, both sets of governments have notified Civil Servants (Appointment, Transfer and Promotion) Rules, 1974. The qualification and method (the way) of filling of all posts is regulated by these rules. The posts at initial officer level i.e. BS-17, are classified to be filled by way of promotion or transfer and by direct recruitment under share fixed for each category. The recommendation for appointment in BS-17, under direct recruitment share, is done by FPSC, which is established under its own law as a requirement of the Constitution. The rest of posts reserved for departmental officers under promotion quota and posts under appointment by transfer is confined for officers inducted through lateral entry or for <b>hardship</b> <b>cases</b> coming from surplus pool.In practical terms, those appointed on posts in direct appointment quota in each occupational groups through CCS Exam have natural advantage. They join service at young age as compared to departmental officers, and therefore reach to the highest slots. Since the number of direct officers at entry level is less but their quota in posts in BS-18 to BS-22 is fixed on higher side so their promotion are on fast phase. This arrangements makes the civil attractive for talented individuals and instill sense of superiority and pride.Currently, CSS Exam is conducted by FPSC includes the following Occupational Groups.|$|R
