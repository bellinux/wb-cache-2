5|$|The French were {{initially}} {{unable to take}} possession of the fourth rate as <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> of the boats on board had been smashed by British shot. In the end, a French midshipman and a boatswain dived into the sea and swam to the British ship to take the formal surrender. Leander had lost {{a third of the}} crew: 35 men killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Thompson three times and Berry, who had a piece of human skull lodged in his arm. The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the bowsprit, and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the mizzen topmast and almost losing the foremast as well. Losses on the crowded decks had been far more severe than on Leander, with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded, again approximately a third of the total.|$|E

50|$|Most CD-ROMs use the ISO9660 {{file system}} to {{organize}} the available storage space for use by a computer or player. This {{has the effect of}} establishing directories (i.e., folders) and files within those directories. Usually, the filesystem is modified to use extensions intended to overcome limitations in the ISO9660 filesystem design. These include Joliet, RockRidge and El Torito extensions. These are, however, compatible additions to the underlying ISO9660 structure, not complete replacements or modifications. The most basic approach for a distinctive feature is to purposely fake some information within the filesystem. Early generations of software copied <b>every</b> <b>single</b> file <b>one</b> by one from the original medium and re-created a new filesystem on the target medium.|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{previous}} factors, {{one of the biggest}} difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> of these factors. Load transfer in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and elastomeric bearings are used in several British sea turbines.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong was a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and {{an irregular}} right-arm medium-pace bowler.

In over 16 years of existence, the theatre staged some 2,662 performances. Prithviraj starred as the lead actor in <b>every</b> <b>single</b> show. <b>One</b> of his popular plays was called Pathan (1947), which was performed on stage nearly 600 times in Mumbai.

Bradshaw's bowling average of 85.50 was the highest by any West Indian in the series, but his economy rate of 3.71 was the best by a West Indian, and only beaten by Chris Cairns among bowlers with more than 10 overs in the tournament.|$|E

In order to bring his artillery, cavalry, and wagon trains to Tarvis, Eugène needed to use Predil Pass. He sent three battalions south to attack Hermann's bastion from the pass while Seras drove in from the other side. The French assault began on 18 May and met with tremendous resistance. Hermann and <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> of the 250 Croat defenders were killed in their last stand.
