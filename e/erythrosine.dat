50|$|Concerns over {{food safety}} led to {{numerous}} regulations throughout the world. German food regulations released in 1882 stipulated {{the exclusion of}} dangerous minerals such as arsenic, copper, chromium, lead, mercury and zinc, which were frequently used as ingredients in colorants. In contrast to today, these first laws followed the principle of a negative listing (substances not allowed for use); they were already driven by the main principles of today's food regulations all over the world, since all of these regulations follow the same goal: {{the protection of consumers}} from toxic substances and from fraud. In the United States, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 reduced the permitted list of synthetic colors from 700 down to seven. The seven dyes initially approved were Ponceau 3R (FD&C Red No. 1), amaranth (FD&C Red No. 2), <b>erythrosine</b> (FD&C Red No. 3), indigotine (FD&C Blue No. 2), Light Green SF (FD&C Green No. 2), Naphthol yellow 1 (FD&C Yellow No. 1), and Orange 1 (FD&C Orange No. 1). Even with updated food laws, adulteration continued for many years and this, together with more recent adverse press comments on food colors and health, has continued to contribute to consumer concern about color addition to foodstuffs.|$|E
50|$|A {{panchromatic}} emulsion produces a realistic reproduction {{of a scene}} as it appears to the human eye. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic, but some types are orthochromatic and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of <b>erythrosine</b> the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost {{two to three times}} as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.|$|E

40|$|Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) {{involves}} {{the administration of}} a tumor localizing photosensitizing agent, which upon activation with light of an appropriate wavelength leads {{to the destruction of}} the tumor cells. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the efficacy of <b>erythrosine</b> as a photosensitizer for the PDT of oral malignancies. The drug uptake kinetics of <b>erythrosine</b> in malignant (H 357) and pre-malignant (DOK) oral epithelial cells and their susceptibility to erythrosine-based PDT was studied along with the determination of the subcellular localization of <b>erythrosine.</b> This was followed by initial investigations into the mechanism of cell killing induced following PDT involving both high and low concentrations of <b>erythrosine.</b> The results showed that at 37 °C the uptake of <b>erythrosine</b> by both DOK and H 357 cells increased in an <b>erythrosine</b> dose dependent manner. However, the percentage of cell killing observed following PDT differed between the 2 cell lines; a maximum of ~ 80 % of DOK cell killing was achieved as compared to ~ 60 % killing for H 357 cells. Both the DOK and H 357 cell types exhibited predominantly mitochondrial accumulation of <b>erythrosine,</b> but the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) studies showed that the H 357 cells were far more resistant to the changes in ΔΨ(m) when compared to the DOK cells and this might be a factor in the apparent relative resistance of the H 357 cells to PDT. Finally, cell death morphology and caspase activity analysis studies demonstrated the occurrence of extensive necrosis with high dose PDT in DOK cells, whereas apoptosis was observed at lower doses of PDT for both cell lines. For H 357 cells, high dose PDT produced both apoptotic as well as necrotic responses. This is the first instance of erythrosine-based PDT's usage for cancer cell killing...|$|E
40|$|Photon {{activation}} of the halogenated fluorescein derivative <b>erythrosine</b> caused a marked calcium-dependent contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the guinea-pig taenia coli superfused in vitro. Neither high intensity illumination alone (up to 5 X 10 (4) lux) nor <b>erythrosine</b> alone (up to 2 X 10 (- 4) M) altered {{the tone of the}} taenia or its ability to respond to carbachol (5 X 10 (- 5) M); photo-irradiation of <b>erythrosine</b> before tissue contact was also ineffective. The magnitude of the photodynamic contraction was dependent upon the concentration of <b>erythrosine,</b> the intensity and wavelength of the incident light, and the presence of oxygen; indirect effects via neurotransmitter release or cyclo-oxygenase activation were specifically excluded. The photodynamic response was blocked by zero-[Ca]o and addition of EGTA (1 mM) but not by omission of [Mg]o or a decrease in [Cl]o or [Na]o. D 600 (methoxyverapamil) 10 (- 5) M, or a ten fold increase in [Mg]o, to 11. 3 mM, partly inhibited the photodynamic contraction at low, but not high, light intensities. These observations are consistent with the following sequence of events: (i) photo-{{activation of}} the <b>erythrosine</b> molecule, (ii) the generation of highly reactive singlet oxygen, (iii) local peroxidation of cell membrane proteolipid, (iv) increased membrane permeability to Ca 2 +, (v) the influx of Ca 2 + and, (vi) muscle contraction.

40|$|<b>Erythrosine</b> B {{is widely}} used for {{coloring}} in various applications, especially in the food industry, despite its already proved toxicity and carcinogenicity. The agrowaste pumpkin seed hulls were applied as potential adsorbent {{for the removal of}} <b>Erythrosine</b> from aqueous solutions. Adsorption mechanism and kinetics were analyzed for design purposes. The seed hulls were characterized by specific techniques before and after dye retention. It was found that the attachment of <b>Erythrosine</b> B molecules on adsorbent surface may be attributed to the interactions between carboxyl and/or carbonyl groups of both dye and agrowaste wall components. A univariate approach followed by a factorial design was applied to study and analyze the experimental results as well as to estimate the combined effects of the process factors on the removal efficiency and dye uptake. Adsorption mechanism may be predominantly due to intraparticle diffusion, dependent on pore size. The four equilibrium models applied fitted the data well; the maximum adsorption capacity for <b>Erythrosine</b> was 16. 4 mg/g. The results showed that adsorbent is effective for <b>Erythrosine</b> B removal for a large concentration range in aqueous solutions (5400 mg/L) in batch systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy with <b>erythrosine</b> and rose bengal using a light-emitting diode (LED) on planktonic cultures of S. mutans. Ten S. mutans strains, including nine clinical strains and one reference strain (ATCC 35688), were used. Suspensions containing 10 (6) cells/mL were prepared for each strain and were tested under different experimental conditions: a) LED irradiation in the presence of rose bengal as a photosensitizer (RB+L+); b) LED irradiation in the presence of <b>erythrosine</b> as a photosensitizer (E+L+); c) LED irradiation only (P-L+); d) treatment with rose bengal only (RB+L-); e) treatment with <b>erythrosine</b> only (E+L-); and f) no LED irradiation or photosensitizer treatment, which served as a control group (P-L-). After treatment, the strains were seeded onto BHI agar for determination of the number of colony-forming units (CFU/mL).

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to provide {{preliminary}} data on the most effective <b>erythrosine</b> concentration and light dose for the erythrosine-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) of oral plaque biofilms formed in vivo. Method: A randomized controlled study with 15 volunteers was carried out to investigate the effect of photosensitiser and light dose on the killing of bacteria in oral plaque biofilms formed in vivo. All volunteers wore a removable in situ appliance carrying 6 enamel slabs for two phases of two weeks each. During this time, plaque biofilms accumulated on the enamel slabs. The slabs were then removed from the appliances for PDT-treatment in vitro. In the first phase of the study, <b>erythrosine</b> doses of 22 and 220 uM were used for the photodynamic treatment of the biofilms. In the second phase, the <b>erythrosine</b> concentration was kept constant, and the light dose was varied. Following treatment, the biofilms were disaggregated, and the total bacterial killing determined using colony counting. Results: The <b>erythrosine</b> dose of 220 uM caused the most cell killing relative to controls. Fifteen minutes continuous irradiation with light and light fractionation of 5 x 1 minute irradiation separated by 2 minute dark recovery periods were found to be the most effective bactericidal regimes.
