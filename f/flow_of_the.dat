5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification.

It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
