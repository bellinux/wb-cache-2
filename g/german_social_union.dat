40|$|In dem Beitrag wird die regionalen Handlungsbedingungen der Gewerkschaften in Ostdeutschland fast zwanzig Jahre nach dem Beginn des Transformationsprozesses am Beispiel der Metall- und Elektroindustrie untersucht. Es werden aktuelle, gewerkschaftlich {{relevante}} Entwicklungstendenzen in der ostdeutschen Ökonomie, Politik, Alltagskultur und in der Gewerkschaftsorganisation dargestellt und der Praxisbezug der regionalen Gewerkschaftsakteure auf diese sozialen Voraussetzungen der Interessenvertretung feld- und habitustheoretisch analysiert. Dabei zeigt sich, dass, anders als einseitige Niedergangsszenarien glauben machen wollen, trotz des Fortbestands der bekannten Problemlagen der Gewerkschaften in Ostdeutschland eine weitere Konsolidierung möglich erscheint, sofern die Gewerkschaftsakteure die spezifischen Anforderungen der regionalen sozialen Felder ausreichend reflektieren und ihre Praxis danach ausrichten. " (Autorenreferat) "This {{article examines}} the specific regional circumstances facing unions in East Germany almost twenty years {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall and German Reunification, taking the metal and electrical industry as an example. It looks at some current developments in East German politics, the economy and the local culture, as they relate to the unions and their organization. Applying the concept of ‘habitus’ to analyse a field study, this contribution focuses on the relationship between East <b>German</b> <b>social</b> conditions and <b>union</b> activity. Contrary to many overly pessimistic accounts, and despite the continued existence of certain well-known problems facing unions in East Germany, a further consolidation appears possible, provided the unions take sufficient account of the specific demands posed by the region’s social realities in planning their future actions.

50|$|The Alliance for Germany (Allianz für Deutschland) was an {{opposition}} coalition in East Germany. It was formed on 5 February 1990 in Berlin (then West Berlin) {{to stand in}} the East-German Volkskammer elections.

50|$|In 2005, a {{nationwide}} Pro Germany Citizens' Movement (pro Deutschland) {{was founded in}} Cologne. The pro movement appears as a conglomerate of numerous small parties, voters' associations and societies, distinguishing themselves by campaigns against Islamic extremism and Muslim immigrants. Its representatives claim a zero tolerance policy and the combat of corruption. With the denial of a multiethnic society (Überfremdung) and the evocation of an alleged islamization, the pro politics extend to far-right positions. Other minor right-wing populist parties include the German Freedom Party founded in 2010, the former East German <b>German</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Union</b> (DSU), the dissolved Party for a Rule of Law Offensive ("Schill party").|$|E
50|$|Democratic Awakening now {{supported}} rapid German reunification {{and joined}} the Alliance for Germany (Allianz für Deutschland) along with the CDU and <b>German</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Union</b> (DSU) for the 1990 Volkskammer elections on March 18. Only a few days prior to the elections, party chairman Schnur had to confess to having been an informer for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), and resigned. Although Alliance for Germany won the elections, Democratic Awakening only collected 0.9% of votes, amounting to four seats in the Volkskammer. Eppelmann became minister for disarmament and defense in the new government and new party chairman. On August 5, 1990 Democratic Awakening ceased to exist after merging into the East German CDU, which in turn on 3 October 1990 merged into its West German counterpart, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).|$|E
5000|$|After {{the ruling}} Socialist Unity Party fell from power, the {{political}} progress of die Wende saw suggestions {{for a new}} national emblem.

On 31 May the newly elected parliament (Volkskammer) decided, at a suggestion from the conservative <b>German</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Union</b> party, that all images of the national emblem on public buildings would be removed or covered. There was never a decision made for a new national coat of arms or emblem. The emblem was never formally abolished but became obsolete on the same moment the German Democratic Republic was dissolved, on 3 October 1990.|$|E

A joint leadership of Eberhard Lehmann, Claudia Wiechmann (former chair of the FDVP) and Ulrich Paetzold took over and demanded Kappel's exclusion, later Lehmann was sidelined in favour of a joint leadership. Kappel successfully {{filed a lawsuit against}} the new executive committee, but has not further interfered with the DP policies. The party has been investigated by the state's Offices for the Protection of the Constitution in Thuringia and Bavaria as possibly extreme right, with the conclusion made that contacts exist. A party convention in July 2007 elected Alfred Kuhlemann chairman and by resolution condemned the coup against Kappel.|$|E

Strasser's brother Gregor Strasser and other elements of the NSDAP left were killed under Hitler's orders during the Night of the Long Knives. Strasser founded the <b>German</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Union</b> in 1956, as a Black Front successor, promoting a Strasserite [...] "nationalist and socialist" [...] policy. It was dissolved in 1962 due to lack of support. Other Third Reich associated groups existed in Germany since the 1950s; HIAG and Stille Hilfe; dedicated to advancing the interests of Waffen-SS veterans and rehabilitating them into the new democratic society. However, they did not claim to be attempting to restore National Socialism, instead working with the social democrats and Christian democrats.|$|E
