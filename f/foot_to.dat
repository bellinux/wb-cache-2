5|$|Persian satraps (and presumably their armies) {{were not}} to travel west of the Halys River (Isocrates) or closer than a day's journey on horseback to the Aegean Sea (Callisthenes) or closer than three days' journey on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> the Aegean Sea (Ephorus and Diodorus).|$|E
5|$|The Baptism of Christ– portrays Jesus with John the Baptist at the River Jordan. Mottled {{glass is}} used for the area around the water, with a layer of wavy glass over Christ's left <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> create the {{illusion}} of looking through water.|$|E
50|$|When {{the plaza}} level seats {{remained}} moveable, {{the capacity for}} baseball was 63,525 and the field size was as followed: 325 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> both left field and right field, 365 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> both left-center field and right-center field, 421 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> center field, and 60 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the backstop. Due to the reconfiguration of the lower bowl that began in 2011, the stadium can no longer host baseball games.|$|R

50|$|By contrast, a Public Land Survey System legal {{description}} of the same 2.5 acre property would be something like SW 1/4 SW1/4 NE1/4 SW1/4 SEC 18 T1S R1E. The metes and bounds description may be something like, Beginning at a monument located at the SE corner of the property now or formerly of J.W. Smith; thence north 330 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> a point; thence east 330 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> a point; thence south 330 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> a point, thence west 330 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the place of beginning.|$|R

5|$|After Congo-Léopoldville gained {{independence}} in 1960, it collapsed {{into a state}} of anarchy within a fortnight. The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the federation. Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E
5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that these small clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{dimensions of}} Bowman Field were quite large {{compared to the}} dimensions of modern baseball fields. Bowman Field measured 367 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the right field foul pole, 450 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> dead center field and 400 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the left field foul pole. Another unusual feature of the stadium was a terrace that was located on left field near the fence.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the centre}} field {{distance}} was posted as 420 feet, {{it was actually}} 417 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> straightaway centre, and 420 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the deep left and right centre field corners.|$|R
50|$|When it opened, the {{dimensions}} were reported <b>to</b> be 289 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the left field foul pole, 317 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the right field foul pole, and 385 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> dead center field. The first {{game was played}} on March 23, 2000, against St. Joseph's University; Penn beat St. Joe's 13-12. The ballpark does not have lights, so all games are played during the day.|$|R
5|$|Ford's {{father would}} often make him {{practice}} his football {{for two hours}} each day, using a tennis ball on his stronger right <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> improve control. He would also soak a leather football in water and make him wear an ordinary plimsoll on his stronger <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> stop Ford kicking the heavy ball with it. After moving into secondary school, Ford met teacher David Benyon, who was a prominent figure in youth football {{in the area and}} included him in the Swansea boys team he managed. Ford was selected to represent Wales at under-14 level in a series of matches against the other home nations of Britain but suffered a broken ankle in a match for his school side just days before the first scheduled fixture against Scotland. Although distraught at missing out, he became determined to return to action as soon as possible and returned to playing football and cricket soon after. At the age of 14, Ford was chosen to represent Wales against a London Schools under-15 side as a bowler, playing alongside his future Wales and Cardiff City teammate Alf Sherwood in the side, himself a keen cricketer.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Hugh Glass guides Andrew Henry’s trappers through unorganized territory. While {{he and his}} half-Pawnee son, Hawk, are hunting, the company's camp is {{attacked}} by an Arikara war party. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{as part of}} a defence review, the North Staffordshire Regiment, by now {{reduced to}} only a single regular battalion, was amalgamated with the South Staffordshire Regiment to form the Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's) which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th <b>Foot)</b> <b>to</b> form the Mercian Regiment. Today the traditions of the North Staffordshire Regiment are {{continued}} by the Mercian Regiment.|$|E

50|$|The playing {{surface of}} the field is mainly grass, and the {{dimensions}} from home plate are 308 1/3 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> left field, 380 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> center field and 290 2/3 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> right field. The 440-square-foot scoreboard, installed in 2013, is located in left center field. 14 flat screen televisions can be found throughout the stadium. There is a children's playground and picnic seating close to the foul lines in left field.|$|R
5000|$|Cobb Field had {{a natural}} grass surface. The {{dimensions}} were 335 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> left, 405 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> center, and 325 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> right. Cobb Field sat 4,200, though crowds {{had been known}} to eclipse 5,000. The stadium was primarily {{made up of the}} same wood used when it had been built and had shown substantial wear. Many areas of the stadium had needed wooden boards to be installed over holes in the floor.|$|R
5|$|Pincher, however, {{argued that}} as {{homosexual}} acts were criminal offences in Britain until 1967, Driberg was still vulnerable to blackmail, although he also {{claimed that the}} MI5 connection secured Driberg a lifelong immunity from prosecution. Driberg's colleague Michael Foot denied Pincher's claim that Margaret Thatcher, when prime minister, had made a secret agreement with <b>Foot</b> <b>to</b> protect Driberg if Foot, in turn, would remain silent about the supposed treachery of Roger Hollis, another of Pincher's recently dead targets.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{was born}} in Bedum, a {{satellite}} town of Groningen, in the northeastern Netherlands. He took to football from an early age, becoming an adherent of the Coerver Method. Robben's skill in ball control and technical footwork made him a valuable player, and he was quickly signed by regional club FC Groningen. Here, he developed his distinctive style of cutting inside from the right onto his left <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> score some quite spectacular goals.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Minh {{captured}} 8,000 French {{and marched}} them 500 miles on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> prison camps; {{less than half}} survived the march. Of 10,863 prisoners (including Vietnamese fighting for the French), only 3,290 were officially repatriated four months later; however, the losses figure may include the 3,013 prisoners of Vietnamese origin whose eventual fate is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The North Ridge is an inhospitable place. Besides {{being at}} 28,000 feet, {{it is located}} along a severe ridge line, {{dropping}} off 10,000 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> one side and 7,000 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the other. Oxygen and proper equipment are virtually essential.|$|R
50|$|The {{field is}} made of natural grass and {{features}} {{a state of the}} art irrigation and drainage system. The outfield dimensions are 333 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> the left field foul pole, 400 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> straightaway center, and 318 down the right field line.|$|R
50|$|Tingley Field had a 3000-seat {{concrete}} grandstand {{with a small}} pressbox {{which could}} accommodate only a few people. The outfield wall was built out of adobe. There were several light standards and telephone poles within the stadium itself, which occasionally caused problems for outfielders or interfered with potential home runs. The park was roughly {{the same size as}} Albuquerque Sports Stadium (360 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> left field, 350 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> right field, and 425 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> center), though the exact dimensions vary by source.|$|R
5|$|The {{causeway}} {{was originally}} a toll road, and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) {{for a person}} on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls were subject to an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, and {{it appears to have}} been Perth's only toll road.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump {{was included in the}} 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{designers}} performed {{extensive research}} in Hong Kong {{to create an}} accurate portrayal of the city. Art designers spent seven days in Hong Kong, where they studied the city's environment, and took more than 20,000 photos as references for the physical environment in the game. They travelled on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> various locales, such as clubs and malls, and interviewed ex-Triad members and retired members of the Hong Kong Police Force Anti-Triad unit, which inspired narratives and character design. The sound designers spent ten days in the city overseeing the dialogue sessions on weekdays and capturing ambient noises around the city at weekends.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Following his injury, Loxton played in neither; Australia won both by an innings. While in Scotland, Loxton's nose was {{operated}} on in Edinburgh. Following his injury, Loxton eschewed the sweep shot and advised {{students to do}} the same, exhorting them to move onto the front <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> drive instead.|$|E
5|$|According to Angela Davis, neutron {{activation}} analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur's fingers and forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C. did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> the administration building 200yards (183m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, {{more than an hour}} later.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} individual {{training at}} Ingleburn, the battalion moved on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> Bathurst to complete collective training. Following this, the 2/17th embarked for the Middle East from Sydney on 20 October 1940, {{on board the}} Queen Mary. Moving in convoy the Queen Mary briefly stopped in Fremantle, before continuing to Bombay in early November where the battalion was disembarked. Following {{a few days in}} camp ashore they were transferred to the Rohna for the next leg of the voyage. The convoy continued, sailing via the African coast into the Gulf of Aden and then through the Suez Canal, before finally berthing at El Kantara in Egypt. The battalion was assigned to the 20th Brigade, along with the 2/13th and 2/15th Battalions, which were initially allocated to the 7th Division; however, following its arrival in the Middle East in November 1940, the battalion was transferred {{along with the rest of}} the brigade to the 9th Division.|$|E
