25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> {{to be able to tell}} real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E

500|$|Cher {{signed with}} Liberty Records' Imperial imprint {{in the end}} of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single [...] "Dream Baby", {{released}} under the name [...] "Cherilyn", received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of Bob Dylan's [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> to Do", which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds' single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, [...] "We loved the Cher version... We didn't want the hassle. So we just turned our record over." [...] Cher's debut album, All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> to Do (1965), reached number 16 on the Billboard 200; it was later described by AllMusic's Tim Sendra as [...] "one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, rap-filk artist Luke Ski {{recorded}} and released {{a parody of}} the Beastie Boys song [...] "No Sleep till Brooklyn" [...] called [...] "No Sleep Till Babylon", which references spoo. A stanza attributed to the Babylon 5 character Londo Mollari contains the lyrics: [...] "Spoo. All <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> is Spoo. And in the morning it's Spoo. Cause in the evening it's Spoo. I like {{the way that it}} tastes. It's blue meatballs in greyish paste..." ...|$|E

Miss America's branding is so associated with the girl next door, which has always meant blonde {{hair and blue eyes}} with only a few exceptions, but the girl next door must evolve as the country evolves. When I was younger I wanted to fit in, but I was aware growing up that I didn't fit that mould, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to help make a change that meant young girls wouldn't feel like that.

500|$|Ferrari {{dominated}} the previous round in Malaysia, where Felipe Massa had claimed pole position, and led his teammate Räikkönen {{in second place}} through the opening stages of the race, before spinning off and retiring midway through. Räikkönen {{went on to win}} the race, and expressed his optimism about Bahrain: [...] "I have finished third in three successive Grands Prix in Bahrain. Time and again something has gone wrong. Sakhir is one of those circuits where <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to win. Finally." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' next single was [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> to Do", another {{interpretation}} of a Dylan song. [...] Despite the success of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the Byrds were reluctant to release another Dylan-penned single, feeling {{that it was too}} formulaic, but Columbia Records were insistent, believing that another Dylan cover would result in an instant hit for the group. [...] The Byrds' rendition of [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> to Do" [...] is noticeably different in structure to Dylan's original: it features an ascending melody progression in the chorus and utilizes a completely new melody for one of the song's verses, in order {{to turn it into a}} Beatlesque, minor-key bridge. [...] Issued on June 14, 1965, while [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was still climbing the U.S. charts, the single was rush-released by Columbia in an attempt to bury a rival cover version that Cher had released simultaneously on Imperial Records. [...] A chart battle ensued, but the Byrds' rendition stalled at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, while Cher's version reached number 15. [...] The reverse was true in the UK, however, where the Byrds' version reached number 4, while Cher's peaked at number 9.|$|E
5000|$|Donovan told auspOp: “It {{has been}} 10 years since I {{released}} my first independent EP Eye 2 Eye and I am {{so excited to}} be able to share this with the Australian public. I can’t wait for people to hear what I’ve been working on in the studio. It has been a long while coming. After finishing up with We Will Rock You late last year it dawned upon me that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to get back into writing my own music and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to make that my main focus.” ...|$|R

500|$|Following her {{retirement}} announcement, Napravnik became Sharp's assistant trainer, continuing to ride regularly. [...] After initially exercising the stable's race {{horses in the}} early months of her pregnancy, she moved over to ponying and other activities. [...] , she and Sharp currently hope to have two children fairly close together, and after that, Napravnik has not ruled out a return to race riding but has not made any firm decisions. As she explained in February 2015, [...] "I'm satisfied with the accomplishments that I've made. If I feel like <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to come back in a few years then I can do it. The greatest thing is I don't have to." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "crazy enough at the end that, if nothing else, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to know what happens next". He enjoyed the basic premise, {{involving}} the idea that aliens were active {{in the development of}} humanity—comparing it to Stanley Kubrick’s film [...] and Ridley Scott’s movie Prometheus. However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season. In the end, he noted that the entry was [...] "ambitious, but it doesn’t exactly make sense, which is pretty much where [...] is at now." ...|$|E
500|$|The role of Holly {{was created}} by series co-creator Ryan Murphy {{specifically}} for Paltrow, a personal friend. Murphy suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the December 2010 release of the film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Murphy said of Paltrow, [...] "Gwyneth is a great singer. She's done {{it a little bit}} but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to show it off and show everyone how great she is." [...] It {{was not the first time}} Paltrow had sung on screen: she played a karaoke singer in the movie Duets in 2000, and had a number one hit in Australia for her duet of [...] "Cruisin' from its soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|The Byrds {{initially}} {{planned to}} release [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in 1965, as {{a follow-up to}} their previous hit Bob Dylan covers, [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> to Do". The band's first attempt at recording the song was on June 28, 1965: resulting in an irreverent, garage rock style take on the song. This version was deemed unsatisfactory and remained unreleased for 22 years, until its inclusion on the Never Before album in 1987. The June 28, 1965 recording can also be heard on the 1996 expanded reissue of Turn! Turn! Turn! {{as well as on}} The Byrds and There Is a Season box sets.|$|E
500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{turned down}} a video {{treatment}} for lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song" [...] and [...] "Buddy Holly". Cuomo explained: [...] "I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to communicate my feelings directly and because I was so careful in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects." [...] The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing {{in time to the}} music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.|$|E

5000|$|Jones elaborated, [...] "With the {{addition}} of a few friends and local musicians it took on a new life and it was really apparent that it was a group of people <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to play with." ...|$|R
500|$|... "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] {{has been}} covered many times {{by a variety}} of artists, {{including}} Joan Baez, Bryan Ferry, The Seldom Scene, Them (also by Van Morrison as a solo artist), The Byrds, The Animals, The Chocolate Watchband, Graham Bonnet, Judy Collins, Joni Mitchell, Marianne Faithfull, Falco, The 13th Floor Elevators, the Grateful Dead, Link Wray, Hugh Masekela, Echo and the Bunnymen [...] and Bad Religion. Them's version, released in 1966 influenced garage bands during the mid-60's and Beck later sampled it for his 1996 single [...] "Jack-Ass". The Byrds recorded the song twice in 1965 as a possible follow up single to [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> to Do", but neither recording was released in that form. The Byrds did release a 1969 recording of the song on their Ballad of Easy Rider album (see 1969 in music).|$|E
500|$|In October 2012 {{during an}} interview, Milian spoke of her Young Money debut: [...] "Wayne just gets his artists, which is great, I {{have a very}} {{one-on-one}} business relationship with everybody from Mack Maine to Wayne. They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to pick the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, so I do not want to fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The Voice would be ended.|$|E
500|$|Spain's first match during {{qualification}} for the 2010 World Cup {{was against}} Bosnia and Herzegovina where Villa scored the only {{goal of the}} game. He {{would go on to}} score four goals in Spain's next three games, including a last minute winner against Belgium. Another goal during a friendly match against Chile saw him end the year with 12 goals, breaking Raúl's record of 10 goals held since 1999. Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala. Speaking of the goal, he said, [...] "I am very happy with the goal. Truth is, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to see it on TV. The record is very nice.
