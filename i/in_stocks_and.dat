5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Conquistadors, Chamberlain {{successfully}} went into business and entertainment, made money <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> real estate, bought a popular Harlem nightclub, which he renamed Big Wilt's Smalls Paradise, and invested in broodmares. Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and {{track and field}} teams, and also provided high-level teams for girls and women in basketball, track, volleyball and softball, and made money by appearing in ads for TWA, American Express, Volkswagen, Drexel Burnham, Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker. After his basketball career, volleyball became Chamberlain's new passion: being a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days, he became {{board member of the}} newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later. As a testament to his importance, the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it: he rose to the challenge and was named the game's MVP. He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979. Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame: {{he became one of the}} few athletes who were enshrined in different sports.|$|E
5|$|Zhou has {{appeared}} in various kinds of media including novels, comic books, and movies. Apart from The Story of Yue Fei and Iron Arm, Golden Sabre, he appears in a novel based around his older martial arts brother, Jin Tai. A recent graphic novel of The Story of Yue Fei, deletes all mythological elements from the storyline and presents it in a historical manner. Instead of traveling from Hebei to Hubei to inspect land, Zhou travels from Shaanxi to Kaifeng City in Henan to visit an old friend who had been promoted to General. While {{en route to the}} capital city, Zhou takes note of a great famine plaguing the peasantry and even hears stories of some people resorting to Cannibalism. However, when he arrives in Kaifeng, he sees the empire is wasting money on the construction of large imperial gardens, the court officials Cai Jing and Wang Pu have extravagant residencies, and hears that even eunuchs are rich because they are given high government posts. Upon locating his friend, Zhou is distressed to find him <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> shackles and being escorted to the farthest reaches of China by imperial guards. He later learns that the General had accidentally offended some court officials and was sentenced to permanent exile on some trumped up charges. Apparently having little or no money, Zhou decides to visit Wang Ming in Hubei (mistakenly called Hebei) and becomes the estate's tutor.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide information on the perceived effectiveness of 56 fraud-detecting standard audit procedures normally used <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> warehousing cycle, and to examine auditor and audit firm specific factors that influence the likelihood of detecting fraud <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> warehousing cycle <b>in</b> New Zealand. We gathered data through a mail survey of New Zealand auditors in order to ascertain their opinion on the effectiveness of these audit procedures. The results suggest that relatively few (less than half) of the 56 standard audit procedures are perceived by our surveyed auditors as being more effective in detecting fraud <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> warehousing cycle. Further, more than half of the 56 audit procedures are perceived by respondents as moderately effective in detecting fraud. Fifteen audit procedures are perceived as being less effective in detecting fraud the <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> warehousing audit cycle. A univariate analysis reveals no significant perpetual differences among our respondents on the basis of the location of their employers in New Zealand, and the type of audit firm employing them. We employed logit regression analysis to test a model to predict the likelihood of detecting fraud <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> warehousing cycle, given certain auditor and audit firm specific factors. The results of the regression analysis suggest that size of audit firm (measured by the number of employees), auditor’s position tenure, and auditor’s years of experience are statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of detecting fraud <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> warehousing cycle <b>in</b> New Zealand. Thus, the likelihood of fraud detection <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> warehousing increases as the auditor acquires more years of auditing experience, and with the audit firms employing more members of staff...|$|R

25|$|Chief {{economist}} for Japan at Credit Suisse, Hiromichi Shirakawa, {{said in a}} note to clients that the estimated economic loss may be around $171 billion–$183billion just to the region hit by the quake and tsunami. On 14 March, the Bank of Japan, {{in an attempt to}} maintain market stability, injected 15trillion yen into the money markets to assure financial stability amid a plunge <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> surge in credit risk. After it set up an emergency task force to ensure liquidity {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster, governor Masaaki Shirakawa and the bank's board also enlarged a programme to buy government bonds to exchange-traded funds to the tune of 10trillion yen. The BOJ chief told reporters cash injections will continue as needed. However, following the further nuclear leaks, its actions were read by the market as insufficient despite 8trillion yen being pumped into the market. On 15 March, the Topix index fell again marking a two-day plunge not seen since 1987 as Japan's default risk surged after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned of further leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant. Commodities were also significantly lower. Residents of Tokyo were reported to have gone on panic shopping sprees as daily necessities were sought after and gasoline was stocked up with the increasing risk of radioactivity releases.|$|E
500|$|The first {{generation}} were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly {{placed in the}} Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate {{that he had a}} good knowledge of both Latin and Greek. A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe. Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a valet de chambre at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good. Van der Weyden was a prudent investor <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine [...] "Mettengelde" [...] ("with the money"). Vrancke van der Stockt invested in land.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1961 Act, {{the areas}} {{trustees}} could invest in {{were based on}} the Trustee Act 1925, which set up a [...] "Statutory Lists" [...] system. The list contained only those investments available at the Post Office, along with land. It did {{not take into account the}} deprecation of currency or inflation, meaning that if the trustees invested <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> shares they were at risk of losing money simply because of the falling value of the pound sterling. As a result, even though the income from a trust might remain nominally constant, the real value of that income could be much reduced over the lifetime of the trust. This was recognised by lawyers, who had been advising their clients to structure trusts in such a way as to allow their trustees to invest in wider areas than the Statutory Lists. In 1952 the report of the Nathan Committee advocated reform, and the government published a White Paper on [...] "Government Policy on Charitable Trusts in England and Wales" [...] in 1955, which proposed a reform of the Statutory Lists system. This came about under the Variation of Trusts Act 1958, which allowed trustees to apply to the courts to widen their investment powers, a process that was expensive and slow.|$|E

500|$|Flames {{could be}} seen as far away as Corvallis. One {{volunteer}} firefighter, Floyd McMullen, a student at Willamette University, died in the fire, which drew firefighters {{from as far away as}} Portland. Salem sent seven fire trucks to the scene; three more came from Portland. Only the outer walls were left standing after the fire was extinguished. Losses were estimated at $1.5 million ($ as of [...] ), and the state did not carry insurance. The losses, which included historic artifacts such as the portraits of all the governors, could have been worse had the state not used fire-proof vaults in the basement to store valuables such as more than $1 million ($ as of [...] ) <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> bonds. During the blaze, firefighters poured water on these vaults to help keep them cool and prevent the contents from disintegrating. Years earlier, the state had turned over many historical documents to the Oregon Historical Society in Portland for preservation, and those records were preserved. Although the Supreme Court had moved to the Oregon Supreme Court Building in 1914, the two buildings were connected by underground tunnels used for electricity and heating. At the time of the fire, the Oregon State Library was in the basement and first floor of the Supreme Court Building. Many books in the basement suffered water damage when water used to fight the fire flooded underground tunnels and seeped into the Supreme Court Building. Offices previously housed in the capitol were moved to other government buildings and to leased space in downtown Salem until a new building was built.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1912, {{the vast}} number of imitators {{prompted}} Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell. In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked <b>in</b> <b>stocks,</b> <b>and</b> he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked {{to the top of}} the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult – the cage prevented Houdini from turning – the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called [...] "Houdini Upside Down". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did.
