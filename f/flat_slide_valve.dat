5000|$|With a single-cylinder {{piston pump}} the medium is [...] "stuffed" [...] {{out of a}} feed chute into the {{delivery}} cylinder and by the cylinder into the delivery line on the forward stroke. Depending {{on the level of}} the delivery pressure in the pipe and on the flow properties of the medium, the delivery flange of the pump will be fitted with a <b>flat</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valve</b> or a lamellar non-return valve in order to prevent flowback of the material on the return stroke. Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.|$|E
50|$|The steam is fed to {{the rear}} {{cylinders}} first and from there it passes along flexible pipes to the front cylinders. All cylinders have <b>flat</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and outside Heusinger valve gear with lifting links and Kuhn slides.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were {{equipped with a}} two-cylinder, compound engine. The most striking feature was the large, horizontal pipe connecting the two steam domes. Ninety eight engines of this class were built by 1907; they initially had <b>flat</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valves,</b> but from 1903 piston valves were installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{builders}} {{chose not}} {{to adhere to the}} original designs and specifications. The cylinder stroke was reduced to 20 in and two inner cylinders of the same dimensions were added to drive the rack mechanism independently. A plate frame was used instead of the specified bar frame. The main plate frames were 1+1/4 in thick and were arranged outside the coupled wheels. The balanced <b>flat</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> were actuated by Joy valve gear.|$|R
5000|$|The U {{class was}} {{designed}} to fill a need to provide more powerful and faster passenger locomotives than the N and V classes then in service. The class were the first express locomotives on the NZR to have Walschaerts valve motion and also introduced the 4' 6" [...] driving wheel which would be considered standard for express passenger work. They did however have <b>flat</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and {{would be the last}} NZR locomotives so built.|$|R
50|$|Like the Class NG5, the {{locomotives}} {{were built}} on plate frames and their valves were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, {{but they were}} fitted with piston <b>valves</b> instead of <b>flat</b> <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> While the sand boxes of the older locomotives were mounted {{on top of the}} boiler, aft of the dome on the Class Hd and ahead of the dome on the Class NG5, those of the Class NG15 were arranged on the running boards. The seats of the driver and stoker were mounted on poles which allowed them to be swung around to outside the cab and crews could often be seen riding outside in hot weather. Similar swing-seats were used on the SAR's narrow-gauge Garratts and on the Cape gauge Class 6 and Class 7.|$|R
5000|$|Superheating, a {{developing}} {{practice at the}} time, which Hughes had experience of with smaller classes, although the valve and lubrication problems were still an issue. The use of piston valves {{was a response to}} this, their piston ring sealing working better at these increased steam temperatures than the <b>flat</b> faces of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> had done.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's {{trailing}} wheels were positioned {{below the}} firebox. The cylinders were arranged outside the frames, with <b>flat</b> Murdoch's D <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> arranged at an incline above the cylinders and actuated by Allan straight link valve gear, driven by eccentric sheaves which were {{mounted on a}} return crank. The brakes were actuated by hand screw from the cab. The engine had 4 in thick wooden buffer beams and was equipped with cowcatchers.|$|R
50|$|The Zwillinge could {{negotiate}} {{curves of}} 66 ft and could haul loads of 32 lt t up a 1 in 25 (4%) gradient. They had balloon-type spark arresters in their chimneys and were coal-fired, the coal being imported from Germany. The steam regulator was arranged outside the high steam dome and, on some, two sandboxes were arranged {{on top of}} the boiler, fore and aft of the dome, while others had two small cylindrical sandboxes attached to the smokebox. They had <b>flat</b> Murdoch's D <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> which were actuated by Stephenson valve gear, arranged outside the 5/8 in plate frames.|$|R
40|$|This paper fully {{describes}} the working principle of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> in single-screw expanders (SSEs). A geometric analysis of suction and volume ratio <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{is presented to}} determine the relations between volume ratio, suction closure volume, discharge opening volume and <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> are much better than those without <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> When the condensing temperature is 40 Â°C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The presented geometric analysis of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and the thermodynamic model integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be used to}} provide a theoretical and technical basis for designing the <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> of SSEs and the control strategies of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> under varied operating conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} used Murdoch's D unbalanced <b>slide</b> <b>valves,</b> arranged horizontally {{above the}} cylinders outside the plate frames and actuated by Heusinger valve gear.
