5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> {{is almost}} {{identical}} in appearance to the North American black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia) {{and at one}} time the two races {{were considered to be}} conspecific. In 2000, the American Ornithologists' Union decided to treat the black-billed magpie as a separate species based on studies of the vocalization and behaviour that indicated that the black-billed magpie was closer to the yellow-billed magpie (Pica nuttalli) than to the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> is {{believed}} {{not only to}} be among the smartest of birds but among the most intelligent of all animals. Along with the jackdaw, the Eurasian magpie's nidopallium is approximately the same relative size as those in chimpanzees and humans, significantly larger than the gibbon's. Like other corvids, such as ravens and crows, their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to most great apes' and cetaceans'. A 2004 review suggests that the intelligence of the corvid family to which the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> belongs is equivalent to that of great apes (chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas) in terms of social cognition, causal reasoning, flexibility, imagination, and prospection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> (Pica pica): The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> is {{the only}} non-mammal to have passed the mirror test. Researchers applied a small red, yellow or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, {{where they could be}} seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. The feel of the sticker on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with {{coloured}} stickers caught a glimpse of themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> has an {{extremely}} large range. The European population {{is estimated to}} be between 7.5 and 19 million breeding pairs. Allowing for the birds breeding in other continents, the total population {{is estimated to be}} between 46 and 228 million individuals. The population trend in Europe has been stable since 1980. There is no evidence of any serious overall decline in numbers, so the species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|Since crows and magpies {{have benefited}} and even {{increased}} in numbers due to human development, {{it was suggested}} that this might cause increased rates of nest predation of smaller bird species, leading to declines. Several studies have shown this concern to be unfounded. One study examined American crows, which had increased in numbers, were a suspect in nest predation of threatened marbled murrelets. However, Steller's jays, which are successful independently of human development, are more efficient in plundering small birds' nests than American crows and common ravens. Therefore, the human relationship with crows and ravens did not significantly increase nest predation, compared to other factors such as habitat destruction. Similarly a study examining the decline of British songbirds found no link between <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> numbers and population changes of 23 songbird species.|$|E
25|$|Magpies {{have been}} {{observed}} engaging in elaborate social rituals, possibly including the expression of grief. Mirror self-recognition has been demonstrated in European magpies, making them one of but a few species and the only non-mammal known to possess this capability. The cognitive abilities of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> are regarded as evidence that intelligence evolved independently in both corvids and primates. This is indicated by tool use, an ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic memory, using their own experience to predict the behavior of conspecifics. Another behavior exhibiting intelligence is cutting their food in correctly sized proportions for {{the size of their}} young. In captivity, magpies {{have been observed}} counting up to get food, imitating human voices, and regularly using tools to clean their own cages. In the wild, they organise themselves into gangs and use complex strategies hunting other birds and when confronted by predators.|$|E
40|$|A major {{number of}} West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans {{occurred}} in 2010 in northern Greece, with 262 laboratory confirmed cases. In 2011, fewer cases were reported, but the pattern was more dispersed throughout the Greek mainland. Isolated strains {{were similar to}} lineage 2 strains detected in previous years in Austria and Hungary from birds of prey. We conducted a serological surveillance study on hunter-harvested wild birds, to determine possible exposure of avian species during the current outbreak. Serum samples from a total of 113 <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpies</b> and 85 turtle doves (abundant resident and migratory avian species, respectively, with potential roles in WNV epidemiology) were tested. These birds were hunter-harvested during 2011 from various prefectures both affected and not affected by the WNV outbreak in Greece. Sera were tested {{for the presence of}} WNV IgG antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Verification of positive results by a micro-virus neutralization test (VNT) was also performed. A total of 23 out of 113 (20. 4 %) <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpies</b> and 6 / 85 (7. 1 %) turtle doves were found positive. Results showed association of human cases with wild birds' exposure to the virus; no avian sera were found positive in prefectures not affected by the WNV outbreak. In contrast, positive avian sera were found in every prefecture that human WNV cases occurred in 2011. High seroprevalence in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpies</b> suggests high activity of WNV in the areas. Findings of past exposure of migratory birds like turtle doves to WNV upon their arrival in resting areas in Greece suggest various avian species with similar migration traits as target species for viral isolation studies, as they can be considered candidates for the introduction of WNV lineage 2 in Greece from Central Europe...|$|R
5|$|The main predators of {{the garden}} warbler are Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora's falcon hunts the garden warbler and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. Eurasian jays and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpies</b> take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. The garden warbler is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The blackcap has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.|$|R
50|$|Conservation of {{the fairy}} pitta {{requires}} measures specific to local levels and international cooperation, since {{the species is}} exposed to various threats during migration and stopovers. It {{has been suggested that}} more surveys of breeding sites, population sizes, and distribution of the bird be conducted along with research into its ecology, current conservation measures in parks, and the need for more sanctuaries. Enforced management of existing protected forests and restrictions on hunting and trapping are critical for saving the species. Specific measures for individual regions have been proposed. On Jeju Island, for instance, it has been advised that developments - including the construction of buildings, golf courses, roads, and trails - in forested or near breeding areas be regulated, and that a predator control program reducing the number of jungle crows and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpies</b> (Pica pica) should be considered.|$|R
25|$|The fauna of Ladakh {{has much}} in common with that of Central Asia in general and that of the Tibetan Plateau in particular. Exceptions to this are the birds, many of which migrate from the warmer parts of India to spend the summer in Ladakh. For such an arid area, Ladakh has a great {{diversity}} of birds— a total of 225 species have been recorded. Many species of finches, robins, redstarts (like the black redstart), and the hoopoe are common in summer. The brown-headed gull is seen in summer on the river Indus and on some lakes of the Changthang. Resident water-birds include the brahminy duck also known as the ruddy sheldrake and the bar-headed goose. The black-necked crane, a rare species found scattered in the Tibetan plateau, is also found in parts of Ladakh. Other birds include the raven, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie,</b> red-billed chough, Tibetan snowcock, and chukar. The lammergeier and the golden eagle are common raptors here specially in Changthang region.|$|E
500|$|Archaeopteryx {{lived in}} the Late Jurassic around 150million years ago, {{in what is now}} {{southern}} Germany during a time when Europe was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in size to a <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie,</b> with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, the largest species of Archaeopteryx could grow to about [...] in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx had more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than with modern birds. In particular, they shared the following features with the dromaeosaurids and troodontids: jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which also suggest warm-bloodedness), and various features of the skeleton.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpie</b> or common magpie (Pica pica) is a {{resident}} breeding bird throughout Europe, much of Asia and the Maghreb.

50|$|Human {{language}} {{is used for}} self-expression; however, expression displays different stages. The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings {{in the form of}} sound, i.e., language. Intelligent animals such as dolphins, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpies,</b> and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy. When such animals view their reflection (mirror test), they recognize themselves and exhibit self-consciousness. Notably, humans evolved in a quite different environment than that of these animals. The human environment accommodated the development of interaction, self-expression, and tool-making as survival became easier with the advancement of tools, shelters, and fire-making. The increasing brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic era that built upon the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and hand versatility allowed the development of human language. In a series of interrelated steps, concentrated self-consciousness arose and human language developed.|$|R
5|$|Blackcaps {{are caught}} by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the {{breeding}} range, and by Eleonora's falcons on migration. Eurasian jays and <b>Eurasian</b> <b>magpies</b> take eggs and young, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. Domestic cats {{are the most}} important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier to spot the intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past, and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved.|$|R
40|$|Based on phenotypes, two {{subspecies}} of <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Magpies</b> (Pica pica) {{are recognized}} in Norway, with nominate P. p. pica in southern Norway, and P. p. fennorum in northern Norway. In this study, we investigated {{whether there are}} genetically distinct groups of Magpies in Norway, which can {{be considered in the}} discussion of the subspecies status. We collected DNA from 61 Magpies from seven locations in Norway, and measured genetic diversity using two types of markers: mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellites. Genetic differentiation among the Magpies was extremely low. Most of the variance was within populations, and th e population identity and the putative subspecies border did not explain the genetic variance among the samples. Although microsatellite markers indicated genetic differentiation, the pattern was not consistent with the geographic locations of the sampling sites. Mismatch analysis suggested that the Magpie populations in Norway were formed by rapid expansion. Our results suggest that all the Magpies in Norway have originated from the same refugia after the last glaciation, their colonization in Norway happened quickly, and that the subspecies status of Magpies in Norway needs to be reconsidere...|$|R

40|$|Corvids in Zhytomyr city reach maximum {{density in}} the winter period. Rooks and Eurasian Jackdaws were the most {{abundant}} species in winter, usually feeding in multispecies flocks and forming collective roosts. Suburban green areas (buffer zones) were characterized by a considerably high diversity of Corvidae species: this habitat was occupied by all six species. We also registered the highest density of Eurasian Jays and Hooded Crows in this habitat. The green areas in the city center were also characterized by significant corvid density, especially during the breeding season. The maximum breeding density of Rooks was in these habitats, which held 6 of 12 identified urban colonies in Zhytomyr. We found that the European <b>Magpies,</b> <b>Eurasian</b> Jays, and Hooded Crows also had high breeding success here. Eurasian Jackdaws occurred here only in autumn and winter, when they fed together with Rooks on lawns, gardens, and parks. With stable snow cover the Rook density in habitats of the green areas decreased due to the depletion of food resources. The individual buildings zone of the city were characterized by the lowest density of all corvid species, except for European <b>Magpies</b> and <b>Eurasian</b> Jays. The number of common species (Rooks, Eurasian Jackdaws, and Hooded Crows) was low because of shortage of food resources, lack of sites for large roosting flocks and shortage of suitable nesting sites. However, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Magpies</b> reached one of their highest densities in this habitat (12. 8  birds/km 2). This species was registered in habitats around private buildings all the year round, successfully nesting in the yards of private houses and on trees in the streets. Its breeding density was 11. 2 birds/km 2. During three years of research (2009 – 2012) the density of all corvids except for European Magpie, practically did not change, although we determined a slight positive trend for all the species. The strong {{increase in the number}} of Eurasian Jackdaws could be explained by the increasing density of wintering populations or due to the increasing number of migrants from more northern regions...|$|R
