It is {{on the east side}} of Route 9W, just north of Middle Hope, west of Roseton, and southwest of Cedar Cliff. It was founded in the 1850s. Notables buried there include Andrew Jackson Downing, the world-famous landscape architect closely associated with the City of Newburgh, and Eric Carr, drummer for the rock group Kiss.|$|E

The local church was vehemently opposed {{to the principle of}} establishing burial grounds outside the confines of local parishes, and even more so to the principle of multi-faith internment. Plague cemeteries were built outside urban areas but these were many a time neglected and had fallen into a state of disrepair. British servicemen had previously been buried in the Msida Bastion Cemetery, but by 1850 it could no longer accommodate more graves due to its restricted size. A new cemetery had to be planned for those adhering to the Protestant faith and other denominations who could not be buried in Catholic cemeteries. Ta’ Braxia was conceived as an <b>interdenominational</b> <b>cemetery.</b> It was built on a site just outside Porte des Bombes, and was readily accessible given its close proximity to Valletta and the Three Cities. It soon became the island’s principal garrison cemetery and the most important burial site for British servicemen {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. The site was already partially occupied by a few small cemeteries, including the Plague and Jewish cemeteries that straddled the old San Giuseppe road connecting Porte des Bombes to Marsa. In 1855, works commenced in earnest with the construction of the boundary wall as detailed plans of the new cemetery were presented to the Commanding Royal Engineer. This was necessary as clearance had to be sought from the military authorities to ensure that the cemetery as planned would not compromise the efficacy of the fortifications and defensive lines in the vicinity. The planning of the cemetery was entrusted to the Maltese architect Emmanuele Luigi Galizia (1830 - 1907). peer-reviewe...|$|E

[...] The consequently disused mortuary chapel, {{which became a}} worship place for the Apostolic Church in 1929, was demolished after being partly burned down (by children) in 1943. It was on part of the cemetery that the present Wellspring Apostolic Church, whose building had been transplanted from Minsterley in 1949, was erected.|$|R
