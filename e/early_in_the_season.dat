5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E

5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring arthroscopic surgery, in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Few storms formed this season, but it {{was very}} eventful. Twelve {{tropical}} cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either too <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> or not damaging enough to dedicate {{a significant portion of}} disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{full-time}} season, Pearson {{won his first}} of three NASCAR championships in 1966. He won 15 of 49 events, which was the second most in NASCAR history at that time. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Pearson won at Hickory, Columbia, Greenville-Pickens, and Winston-Salem Speedway to complete four straight victories. Throughout the season, Pearson won at Richmond, Dog Track Speedway, New Asheville Speedway, Smokey Mountain Raceway, the second Greenville-Pickens race, Bridgehampton Race Circuit, Fonda Speedway, Bowman Gray Stadium, and the second Richmond race.|$|E

5|$|Leyland {{missed a}} {{substantial}} amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, barely playing in July, and missing the Test series against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 runs at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Injuries continued to trouble him in 1938. He scored 1,884 first class runs at 43.81, but a shoulder strain <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> adversely affected his form. He was not selected for the first three Tests against Australia, not least as the England side contained several promising batsmen. However, he had his best season with the ball. A succession of hard, dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> he took eight for 63 against Hampshire, the best figures of his career. Just as his batting form returned, and when he was likely to be recalled to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. However, he recovered in time to play in the final Test of the series. Australia's victory in the fourth Test had given the team a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
5|$|Not {{known for}} his {{offensive}} ability, Regehr ended a 100-game goal scoring drought <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> finishing with four for the season.

He played the final two games of the Stanley Cup Final despite tearing ligaments in his foot in game five. His performance in the post season earned him the praise of his opponents.|$|E

Following the major league season, he was named the National League Rookie of the Year. This made him the second former player from Nashville to receive such honors. Closer Mark Corey set the career franchise record for saves during the 2003 and 2004 seasons.|$|E
