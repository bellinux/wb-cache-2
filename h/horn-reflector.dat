50|$|Because {{the radio}} waves travel in narrow beams {{confined}} to a line-of-sight path from one antenna to the other, they don't interfere with other microwave equipment, so nearby microwave links can use the same frequencies, called frequency reuse. Antennas must be highly directional (high gain); these antennas are installed in elevated locations such as large radio towers {{in order to be}} able to transmit across long distances. Typical types of antenna used in radio relay link installations are parabolic antennas, dielectric lens, and <b>horn-reflector</b> antennas, which have a diameter of up to 4 meters. Highly directive antennas permit an economical use of the available frequency spectrum, despite long transmission distances.|$|E
50|$|Soon after American Tower was founded, {{the company}} began {{purchasing}} numerous AT&T Long Lines microwave telephone relay towers. Upon acquisition of these sites from the now defunct AT&T Communications, Inc., American Tower began repurposing the towers for use as cell towers, and leasing antenna space to various American cell phone providers and private industries. Then, most of the former AT&T Long Lines sites had their <b>horn-reflector</b> antennas removed, either by helicopter or by crane, {{to make room for}} more antennas. Since AT&T's Long Lines Program was decommissioned in the 1980s, and the company no longer had any use for the towers themselves, American Tower now owns most of these tower structures across the entire continental United States. The picture below depicts a former AT&T Long Lines microwave radio relay tower, now repurposed by American Tower Corporation.|$|E

50|$|This type of antenna {{is called}} a Hogg or <b>horn-reflector</b> antenna, invented by Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941. It was built by David C. Hogg. It {{consists}} of a flaring metal horn with a curved reflecting surface mounted in its mouth, at a 45° angle to the long axis of the horn. The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, so the antenna is really a parabolic antenna which is fed off-axis. A Hogg horn combines several characteristics useful for radio astronomy. It is extremely broad-band, has calculable aperture efficiency, and {{the walls of the}} horn shield it from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis. The back and side lobes are therefore so minimal that scarcely any thermal energy is received from the ground. Consequently, it is an ideal radio telescope for accurate measurements of low levels of weak background radiation. The antenna has a gain of about 43.3 dBi and a beamwidth of about 1.5° at 2.39 GHz and an aperture efficiency of 76%.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} design of a novel two-element <b>horn-reflector</b> antenna, which has been used on an {{interferometer}} built for studying the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background at an angular scale of ≈ 2 ° and a frequency of 33 GHz. The design consists of a pair of closely packed parabolic mirrors fed by two rectangular corrugated horns, each at an offset angle of 75 ° to the axis of its mirror. The offset angle and the <b>horn-reflector</b> dimensions were chosen so that the antenna has elliptical primary beams producing a synthesized beam with circular lobes. We have designed and tested the radiation pattern of the individual antennas and the performance of the interferometer using bright radio sources. Our measurements revealed that the individual antennas have low side-lobes and that the crosstalk between the two elements of the interferometer is less than - 80 dB. We therefore conclude that this design is suitable for the required astronomical application...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the design and operation of a 350 -GHz flnline superconductor-insulator- 4 superconductor mixer. The mixer is fed by a <b>horn-reflector</b> antenna, and the superconducting circuit is fabricated using planar-circuit technology and fully integrated tuning. An important feature of the mixer is that it employs an antipodal flnline section, deposited {{on one side of}} a quartz substrate, which transforms the high impedance of the waveguide (~ 300 fi) to the low impedance of the microstrip (- 420 II). The Nb/Al-oxide/Nb tunnel junction is fabricated {{at the same time as}} the flnline circuit. In this paper, {{we describe}} the design procedure in some detail. We pay particular attention to the synthesis of the flnline taper and the electromagnetic design of the <b>horn-reflector</b> antenna. We have tested a flnline mixer over the frequency range of 330 - 370 GHz and measured a receiver noise temperature of 90 K, which remained unchanged over the whole frequency range. Our investigation has demonstrated that it is possible to make superconducting flnline mixers for frequencies as high as 350 GHz. © 2000 IEEE...|$|E

Using a variable-temperature cryogenic noise source, we measured a DSB system noise temperature of 32 ± 1 K. The mixer contributes 3 ± 3 K, supporting the theoretically-predicted result that the noise temperature of a DSB mixer can be less than (Latin small letter hwith stroke) ω/ 2 k (8. 6 K). © 2001 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the design and preliminary results of testing a tunerless finline mixer over the frequency range of 330 - 360 GHz. The mixer is fed by a conical <b>horn-reflector</b> antenna, machined into an alu-minium split block {{to ensure that the}} mixer has low sidelobe level and high aperture efficiency, without the employment of a phase correcting lens. The mixer chip itself comprises an antipodal finline taper and a miniature microstrip line, which contains an Nb/Al-oxide/Nb junction. Our preliminary test of the mixer at 4. 7 K yielded receiver noise temper-ature of about 90 K DSB which includes some IF and RF losses. The measured beam pattern of the conical horn reflector antenna was in ex-cellent agreement with the computed results...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an antenna for high-performance submillimetre-wave imaging arrays. The antenna comprises a corrugated horn with an off-axis paraboloidal reflector at its aperture. The corrugated horn is machined directly into two halves of a split aluminium block. This approach avoids electroforming and is compatible with E-plane circuit technology. The resulting antenna is light weight and is ideal for space applications. For compatibility with submillimetre-wave optics, the the behaviour has been calculated by using Gaussian-Hermite modes, {{and the integrity of}} the theory has been verified by modelling the behaviour of a 17 GHz antenna. The manufacturing procedure has been investigated by machining and testing a <b>horn-reflector</b> antenna for 450 - 500 GHz. Our next step is to extend the technique to 1 THz...|$|E

The three <b>horn-reflector</b> antennas each have a diameter of 70 em and are mounted on rails to provide baselines between 1 and 5 m. The instrument can observe in a 500 MHz bandwidth centred anywhere between 13 and 17 GHz and can reach a temperature sensitivity of a few μK per month of good observing. We have taken extreme care to ensure that uncalibrated instrumental offsets are absent at this level. CAT observations should provide both confirmation of primordial fluctuations on an angular scale of about 0. 5 degree and strong constraints on current theories of galaxy formation...|$|E

The cosmic microwave background radi-ation, considered a relic of the explosion at the beginning of the universe some 18 billion years ago, is one of the most powerful aids in determining these features of the universe. This paper is about the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. It starts with a section on radio astronomical measuring techniques. This is followed by the history of the detection of the background radiation, its identification, and finally by a summary of our present knowledge of its properties. I I. RADIO ASTRONOMICAL METHODS A radio telescope pointing at the sky receives radiation not only from space, but also from other sources including the ground, the earth’s atmosphere, and the components of the radio telescope itself.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{successful}} {{operation of a}} superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) flnline mixer operating near the superconducting energy gap of Nb. The mixer employs {{a new type of}} Pickett-Potter <b>horn-reflector</b> (PPHR) antenna, which exhibits low sidelobes and low cross-polarization levels, and yet is easy to fabricate. The SIS tunnel junction and all of the integrated superconducting tuning circuits are fabricated from Nb using planar-circuit technology. The mixer employs an antipodal finline section, deposited on one side of a quartz substrate, which transforms the high impedance of the waveguide (≈ 300 Ω) to the low impedance of the microstrip line (≈ 20 Ω). The Nb/Al-oxide/Nb tunnel junction is fabricated {{at the same time as}} the flnline circuit. In this paper, we describe the design and testing of the mixer, and pay particular attention to the electromagnetic design of the PPHR antenna. We investigate the noise temperature and gain of the mixer over 642 - 714 GHz, and analyze the experimental results using rigorous theories that were developed specifically for the purpose. Our investigation demonstrates that finline mixers have good performance both below and above the superconducting energy gap...|$|E
40|$|The {{miniaturization}} of receiver arrays {{permits the}} arrangement of numerous poloidally staggered radial sightlines of an electron cyclotron emission (ECE) diagnostic for the measurement of the electron temperature and its fluctuations, making two-dimensional (2 D) imaging of the electron temperature and its fluctuations caused by plasma turbulence possible. For the stellarator W 7 -AS, {{the development of a}} fully monolithic microwave integrated circuit 150 GHz subharmonic mixer array is under development. As a first step, a 2 D ECE system for the measurement of electron temperature fluctuations using four individual <b>horn-reflector</b> arrangements in conjunction with multichannel heterodyne radiometers was installed and set into operation. With Gaussian beam optics and four poloidally staggered sightlines, electron temperature fluctuations could be characterized in radial and poloidal directions simultaneously. First observations in purely electron cyclotron resonance heated stellarator plasmas reveal a broadband drift-wave feature. Earlier experiments showing a decrease of the electron temperature fluctuation level with increasing heating power were confirmed. Additionally, it was revealed, using the 2 D ECE correlation radiometer, that an increased velocity shear might account for the decrease of the coherence length and thus for the reduction of the electron temperature fluctuation level...|$|E
