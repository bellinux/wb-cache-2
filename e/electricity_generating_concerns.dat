50|$|The coal {{produced}} by Peabody Energy fuels approximately 10% of the <b>electricity</b> <b>generated</b> in the United States and 2% of <b>electricity</b> <b>generated</b> throughout the world. In 2014, Peabody Energy recorded sales of 249.8 {{million tons of}} coal. Peabody markets coal to <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> and industrial customers in more than 25 nations on six continents. As of December 31, 2014, the company had approximately 7.5 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1890s, both Newton Abbot and Torquay {{developed}} their own <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> capacity to serve the local areas.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{the total}} <b>electricity</b> <b>generated</b> in the NF {{scenario}} {{is greater than}} that of the NM scenario. About the cooperative model, it can be stated that the total <b>electricity</b> <b>generated</b> in the CF scenario with increase in the minimum quota has absolutely descending trend, whereas the CM scenario shows a convex shape. When the minimum requirement of green electricity is less than 60 %, the total <b>electricity</b> <b>generated</b> in the CF scenario is {{greater than that of}} the CM scenario.|$|R

50|$|Every {{kilowatt-hour}} of <b>electricity</b> <b>generated</b> with {{renewable energy}} can replace {{the same amount}} of <b>electricity</b> that is <b>generated</b> with a fossil fuel. If the <b>electricity</b> <b>generated</b> with a 1.2-MW Gulf Stream Turbine were to replace that generated by a coal-fired plant, the CO2 emissions would be cut by about 13,000 tons. If that <b>electricity</b> replaced that <b>generated</b> by a gas-fired turbine, those emissions would be reduced by about 5,900 tons.|$|R
