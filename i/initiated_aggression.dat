5000|$|When {{considering}} the emotional state of psychological abusers, psychologists {{have focused on}} aggression as a contributing factor. While it is typical for people to consider males to be the more aggressive of the two sexes, researchers have studied female aggression to help understand psychological abuse patterns in situations involving female abusers. According to Walsh and Shluman, [...] "The higher rates of female <b>initiated</b> <b>aggression</b> psychological aggression may result, in part, from adolescents' attitudes about the unacceptability of male aggression and the relatively less negative attitudes toward female aggression". This concept that females are raised with fewer restrictions on aggressive behaviors (possibly due to the anxiety over aggression being focused on males) is a possible explanation for women who utilize aggression when being mentally abusive.|$|E
40|$|Studies of contest {{competition}} between wild and farmed fish have mostly focused on fish with strongly territorial behaviour. Little {{is known about}} species with more plastic social behaviour, such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), a species that can either aggressively defend territories or shoal. There is also concern that cod that escape from farms will compete with wild populations. We examined dyadic contest {{competition between}} wild and farmed juvenile cod using an intruder–resident experimental set-up in the laboratory. No prior residency advantage was observed, but the differences between farmed and wild cod were clear. Farmed cod were more submissive than wild cod and fled earlier during contests, which suggests that wild fish often out-compete farmed intruders. Both fish types <b>initiated</b> <b>aggression</b> earlier against fish of the same background. A multivariate analysis of 11 different behavioural traits indicated {{that a group of}} 59 % of farmed fish were behaviourally very similar to the 55 % most submissive wild fish. These results suggest that wild juvenile cod may be quite robust towards competition for food and shelter from juvenile farmed cod, but {{further research is needed to}} verify this pattern...|$|E
40|$|Nonnative {{species have}} been shown to {{negatively}} impact the native community in which they are introduced. In the Great Lakes, competition with nonnative salmonids may be hindering the restoration efforts of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, a once-native top predator in Lake Ontario. We examined the effects of brown trout S. trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, two nonnative fishes in Lake Ontario, on the social dominance and growth rate of juvenile Atlantic salmon from three strains being used for reintroduction efforts in Lake Ontario. Using seminatural stream channels, we found that the presence of either rainbow trout or brown trout reduced aggression, dominance, and food consumption of the Atlantic salmon. Brown trout had the strongest effect, increasing aggression levels in the channels by a factor of two and sharply reducing the dominance of Atlantic salmon. When both nonnatives were present, <b>initiated</b> <b>aggression</b> by Atlantic salmon decreased by a factor of three and food consumption halved as compared with when the salmon were alone. Consequently, over a 7 -d time period, standard growth rate of the Atlantic salmon dropped from no change in mass when alone to a value of – 0. 3 % per day when with the nonnative species. Of the three strains tested, one strain was least affected by the nonnative trouts, implicating genetic differences among the strains and suggesting that one strain may have greater poststocking success in Lake Ontario tributaries with naturalized populations of brown trout and rainbow trout...|$|E

40|$|Here, {{we present}} {{estimates}} of heritability and selection on network traits {{in a single}} population, allowing us to address the evolutionary potential of social behavior and the poorly understood link between sociality and fitness. To evolve, sociality must have some heritable basis, yet the heritability of social relationships is largely unknown. Recent advances in both social network analyses and quantitative genetics allow us to quantify attributes of social relationships and estimate their heritability in free-living populations. Our analyses addressed a variety of measures (in-degree, out-degree, attractiveness, expansiveness, embeddedness, and betweenness), and we hypothesized that traits reflecting relationships controlled by an individual (i. e., those that the individual initiated or were directly involved in) would be more heritable than those based largely {{on the behavior of}} conspecifics. Identifying patterns of heritability and selection among related traits may provide insight into which types of relationships are important in animal societies. As expected, we found that variation in indirect measures was largely explained by nongenetic variation. Yet, surprisingly, traits capturing initiated interactions do not possess significant additive genetic variation, whereas measures of received interactions are heritable. Measures describing <b>initiated</b> <b>aggression</b> and position in an agonistic network are under selection (0. 3 < |S| < 0. 4), although advantageous trait values are not inherited by offspring. It appears that agonistic relationships positively influence fitness and seemingly costly or harmful ties may, in fact, be beneficial. Our study highlights the importance of studying agonistic as well as affiliative relationships to understand fully the connections between sociality and fitness...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Aggression minimisation {{training}} {{is essential for}} mental health staff. No studies to date have investigated the impact of knowledge, prior learning and staff occupations on confidence. Additionally, no studies have followed-up trained staff following actual aggressive and violent incidents to investigate skills used, perceived confidence, fear and satisfaction with the management of incidents. Aim: This research examines: i) the effectiveness of training in aggression minimisation on mental health staff confidence (Study 1) and; ii) the use of learnt skills on staff perceived confidence and fear during actual aggression and violence on inpatient mental health units (Study 2). Method: 103 mental health staff were trained over two days in aggression minimisation. A knowledge evaluation, appraisal of skills questionnaire and the 2 ̆ 7 Confidence in Coping With Patient Aggression Instrument 2 ̆ 7 were administered pre and post training to measure changes in knowledge, skills and confidence. Participants were subsequently followed up over 18 months. Forty-five trained staff were involved in 95 consecutive incidents of patient <b>initiated</b> <b>aggression</b> and violence. Following actual aggressive and violent incidents participants were interviewed on skills used from training and made ratings of their perceived fear, satisfaction in managing incidents, and completed the 2 ̆ 7 Confidence in Coping With Patient Aggression Instrument 2 ̆ 7 {{in relation to the}} incident. Results: Training led to significant increases in knowledge, skills and confidence. Key training skills subsequently used in actual incidents included verbal de-escalation, physical self-defence and team work. Staff perceived confidence during aggressive and violent incidents was lower in female staff and lower during highly fearful incidents. Male patients and patients displaying physically threatening behaviour evoked higher fear in staff. Staff perceived themselves to be also less confident in managing patients who were physically aggressive. Staff who were more afraid were more likely to use restrictive interventions such as seclusion. Conclusion: Training increases staff confidence and improves skills. Ongoing education is important for all staff to reinforce learning, keep learnt skills current, and for targeting those incidents which are more fear evoking and for which staff lack confidence in managing...|$|E
40|$|Aggressive {{contests}} probably {{occur in}} networking environments where information about fighting ability is conveyed both to an opponent and to individuals peripheral {{to the fight}} itself, the bystanders. Our primary aim {{was to investigate the}} relative influences of eavesdropping and prior social experience on the dynamics of aggressive contests in Xiphophorus helleri. A bystander's ability to witness an encounter was manipulated using clear, one-way mirror, and opaque partitions. After watching (or not watching) the initial contest, the bystander encountered either the winner or loser of the bout. Treatment comparisons of bystander-winner or bystander-loser contest dynamics indicated {{the presence or absence of}} winner, loser, or eavesdropping effects. Winner and loser effects had negligible influences on bystander contest dynamics. Eavesdropping significantly reduced the bystander's propensity to <b>initiate</b> <b>aggression,</b> escalate, and win against seen winners regardless of whether the watched bout had escalated or not. Though eavesdropping had relatively little effect on bystander-loser contest dynamics, bystanders were less prone to <b>initiate</b> <b>aggression</b> and win against losers that had escalated in the witnessed bout. Thus, bystanders appear to preferentially retain and utilize information gained about potentially dangerous opponents (winners or persistent losers).

40|$|Biogenic amines have {{widespread}} {{effects on}} numerous behaviors, but their natural functions are often unclear. We investigated {{the role of}} octopamine (OA), the invertebrate analogue of noradrenaline, on initiation and maintenance of aggression in male crickets of different social status. The key-releasing stimulus for aggression is antennal fencing between males, a behavior occurring naturally on initial contact. We show that mechanical antennal stimulation (AS) alone is sufficient to initiate an aggressive response (mandible threat display). The efficacy of AS was augmented in winners of a previous fight, but unaffected in losers. The efficacy of AS was not, however, influenced by OA receptor (OAR) agonists or antagonists, regardless of social status. Additional experiments indicate that the efficacy of AS is also not influenced by dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5 HT). In addition to initiating an aggressive response, prior AS enhanced aggression exhibited in subsequent fights, whereby AS with a male antenna was now necessary, indicating a role for male contact pheromones. This priming effect of male-AS on subsequent aggression was dependent on OA since it was blocked by OAR-antagonists, and enhanced by OAR-agonists. Together our data reveal that neither OA, DA nor 5 HT are required for <b>initiating</b> <b>aggression</b> in crickets, nor do these amines influence {{the efficacy of the}} natural releasing stimulus to <b>initiate</b> <b>aggression.</b> OA’s natural function is restricted to promoting escalation and maintenance of <b>aggression</b> once <b>initiated,</b> and this can be invoked by numerous experiences, including prior contact with a male antenna as shown here...|$|R

Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to <b>initiate</b> <b>aggression</b> against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|R

40|$|Aggression is {{ubiquitous}} {{in the animal}} kingdom, whenever the interests of individuals conflict. In contests between animals, the larger opponent is often victorious. However, counter intuitively, an individual that has little chance of winning (generally smaller individuals) sometimes initiates contests. A number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain this behaviour, including the ‘desperado effect’ according to which, the likely losers <b>initiate</b> <b>aggression</b> {{due to lack of}} alternative options. An alternative explanation suggested recently is that likely losers attack due to an error in perception: they mistakenly perceive their chances of winning as being greater than they are. We show that explaining the apparently maladaptive <b>aggression</b> <b>initiated</b> by the likely loser can be explained on purely economic grounds, without requiring either the desperado effect or perception errors. Using a game-theoretical model, we show that if smaller individuals can accurately assess their chance of winning, if this chance is less than, but close to, a half, and if resources are scarce (or the contested resource is of relatively low value), they are predicted to be as aggressive as their larger opponents. In addition, when resources are abundant, and small individuals have some chance of winning, they may be more aggressive than their larger opponents, as it may benefit larger individuals to avoid the costs of fighting and seek alternative uncontested resources...|$|R

40|$|Male-male {{conflict}} is common among animals, but questions remain as to when, how {{and by whom}} <b>aggression</b> should be <b>initiated.</b> Factors that affect agonistic strategies include residency, {{the value of the}} contested resource and the fighting ability of the two contestants. We quantified initiation of aggression in a fish, the desert goby, Chlamydogobius eremius, by exposing nest-holding males to a male intruder. The perceived value of the resource (the nest) was manipulated by exposing half of the residents to sexually receptive females for two days before the trial. Resident male aggression, however, was unaffected by perceived mating opportunities. It was also unaffected by the absolute and relative size of the intruder. Instead resident aggression was negatively related to resident male size. In particular, smaller residents attacked sooner and with greater intensity compared to larger residents. These results suggest that resident desert goby males used set, rather than conditional, strategies for <b>initiating</b> <b>aggression.</b> If intruders are more likely to flee than retaliate, small males may benefit from attacking intruders before these have had an opportunity to assess the resident and/or the resource...|$|R

Studies of scrotal coloration in male vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) {{suggest that}} it is an important intrasexual signal, with relatively dark, colourful males dominating paler males. To date, no studies have examined the influence of male colour on intersexual social interactions in vervet monkeys. The primary goal {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether female vervet monkeys attend to male coloration. We experimentally introduced females, housed with either “pale” or “dark” males, to stimulus males whose scrota were pale, dark, or pale but painted to look dark. Overall, during introductions, females did not differ in time spent directing affiliative behaviour toward pale, dark, and painted males; however, females, permanently housed with dark males, spent significantly more time directing affiliative behaviour toward pale than painted males. When the stimulus male was pale, affiliative exchanges between males and females were longer than when the stimulus male was painted. Home male colour was not related to female-initiated aggression. Home male colour was also not related to male-initiated aggression, although painted stimulus males were more likely to <b>initiate</b> <b>aggression</b> than pale stimulus males.

Despite the global distribution of tuberculosis (TB) in free-living wild mammal populations, little is known of the mechanisms of social transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between individuals. Here, I use a network approach to examine for correlations between five distinct types of intra- and intergroup social interaction and changes in TB status of 110 wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in five social groups over two years. Contrary to predictions, the most socially interactive animals were not at highest risk of acquiring infection, indicating {{that in addition to}} contact frequency, the type and direction of interactions must be considered when quantifying disease risk. Within social groups, meerkats that groomed others most were more likely to become infected than individuals who received high levels of grooming. Conversely, receiving, but not <b>initiating,</b> <b>aggression</b> was associated with M. bovis infection. Incidence of intergroup roving by male meerkats was correlated with the rovers themselves subsequently testing TB-positive, suggesting a possible route for transmission of infection between social groups. Exposure time was less important than these social interactions in influencing TB risk. This study represents a novel application of social network analysis using empirical data to elucidate the role of specific interactions in the transmission of an infectious disease in a free-living wild animal population...|$|R

To end hostilities and show his willingness to protect the planet's fragile peace, Fortress Maximus {{and a few of}} his followers discard their weapons in front of the Nebulan capital. When that failed to dissuade them, he made the ultimate sacrifice by offering them his head. Four more Autobots did the same, while the remained returned to their camp unarmed.Intending to use the situation to his advantage, corrupt Nebulan politician Lord Zarak learned more about the Autobots and the war they left behind and used this information to contact Cybertron. Zarak's message was received by Fortress Maximus's Decepticon equal, Scorponok. After lying to Zarak about the intentions of the Autobots, Scorponok led an invasion force to the planet. Armed only with weapons that had not seen use in millennia, the Nebulan defense were no match for the intentionally aggressive Decepticons. With little options left, Galen, leader of the Nebulan world council, made arrangements for himself and others to become Autobot Headmasters. Although the Headmaster process made them able to drive off the Decepticons, all Galen had succeeded in doing was re-igniting the Transformers' war on Nebulous. After Scorponok and now-captive Lord Zarak developed a way to duplicate the process (as well as a later Targetmaster Process), the Nebulos theatre of the Transformers' war escalated. After casualties and collateral damage mounted, Galen eventually convinced Zarak to take their conflict off-world, with nearly all Transformers from both factions following a distress beacon sent by Goldbug from Earth.|$|R

Spider monkeys are ripe fruit specialists and, as a result, are considered extremely vulnerable to habitat disturbance that disrupts the production of their food supply. Our expectation was that the hurricane would have devastating impacts on the monkeys in the short term. However, we were able to show that spiders may use flexible dietary and social strategies by relying on other fall-back foods like leaves, and by adjusting group size to mitigate feeding competition.

M-FDA may be an expression of feeding competition, direct sexual coercion, or indirect sexual coercion, and F-FDA may function to limit scramble competition. We collected detailed data on all observed incidences of aggression (N= 193) in two spider monkey communities between January 2008 and August 2011. Of these, 154 were instances of M-FDA, and 29 incidents were F-FDA. Oneway ANOVA shows that adult and subadult males are significantly more likely to <b>initiate</b> <b>aggression,</b> and that subadult females are the most common targets. In instances of F-FDA, subadult females were the targets in 53 % of the cases. Nonparametric tests show that contexts of aggression differed between M-FDA and F-FDA; M-FDA occurred most often during subgroup fusions (males joining subgroups containing females who were not feeding) and during feeding (37 % and 31 % respectively, N = 154); in contrast, F-FDA aggression rarely occurred during fusions but was more likely during feeding (14 % and 41 % respectively, N= 29). Our results support the hypothesis that M-FDA is a form of indirect sexual coercion, and as a result may encourage sexual segregation as females try to avoid potentially aggressive males...|$|R

When delegates from 131 nations established the criminal court in 1998, they did not initially include <b>initiating</b> wars of <b>aggression</b> as a war crime. With Whitney Harris and Benjamin Ferencz, two of the other prosecutors from Nuremberg, King traveled to the convention in Rome to successfully lobby for the court's jurisdiction over the instigators of such wars. Michael Scharf described their role in Rome: [...] "They used their moral authority; they were persistent, and ultimately the delegates included a reference to the crime of war of aggression in the court’s statute.” ...|$|R
40|$|Behaviour {{therapy is}} now {{beginning}} to assess the social validity, along with efficacy, of its treatments. Literature dealing with the social validity of parent-training programs is reviewed. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to obtain acceptability ratings of the “time out” procedure from the perspective of behaviour problem and non-problem children. The study looked at acceptability ratings of five maternal behaviours/disciplinary techniques (permissiveness, physical punishment, directed discussion, quiet time, time out) across four different situations (non-compliance with an <b>initiating</b> instruction, <b>aggression</b> toward others, non-compliance with a terminating instruction, non-compliance with known rule) by samples of clinical (problem behaviour) children and control children. Both groups were alike in rating permissiveness as less acceptable {{than any of the other}} behaviours across most situations and rating it as unacceptable in absolute terms. Time out was rated equally acceptable with physical punishment, directed discussion and quiet time. The results support previous findings that young children prefer interventionist to permissive parents, including the use of exclusionary time out. In a second study, ratings were taken from two clinical groups, treatment and waitlist, both at pre- and post-treatment. Despite large individual differences in the treatment group, no change in acceptability ratings was found at post-treatment. Thus, experiencing time out did not change the children 2 ̆ 7 s evaluation of this procedure. Possible reasons for these findings and their practical implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Diploid and {{triploid}} {{brown trout}} Salmo trutta were acclimated for 6 weeks on two feeding regimes (floating and sinking). Thereafter, aggression and surface feeding response were compared between pairs of all diploid, all triploid and diploid and triploid S. trutta in an experimental stream. In each pair-wise matching, fish of similar size {{were placed in}} allopatry and rank {{was determined by the}} total number of aggressive interactions recorded. Dominant individuals <b>initiated</b> more <b>aggression</b> than subordinates, spent more time defending a territory and positioned themselves closer to the surface food source (Gammarus pulex), whereas subordinates occupied the peripheries. In cross ploidy trials, diploid S. trutta were more aggressive than triploid, and dominated their sibling when placed in pair-wise matchings. Surface feeding, however, did not differ statistically between ploidy irrespective of feeding regime. Triploids adopted a sneak feeding strategy while diploids expended more time defending a territory. In addition, we also tested whether triploids exhibit a similar social dominance to diploids when placed in allopatry. Although aggression was lower in triploid pairs than in the diploid and triploid pairs, a dominance hierarchy was also observed between individuals of the same ploidy. Dominant triploid fish were more aggressive and consumed more feed items than subordinate individuals. Subordinate fish displayed a darker colour index than dominant fish suggesting increased stress levels. Dominant triploid fish, however, appeared to be more tolerant of subordinate individuals and did not display the same degree of invasive aggression as seen in the diploid and diploid or diploid and triploid matchings. These novel findings suggest that sterile triploid S. trutta feed similarly but are less aggressive than diploid trout. Future studies should determine the habitat choice of triploid S. trutta after release and the interaction between wild fish and triploids during the breeding season prior to utilization of triploids as an alternative management strategy within freshwater fisheries...|$|R
