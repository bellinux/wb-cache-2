Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city {{experiences}} an earthquake sent by Poseidon, killing the three young sons of Helen and Paris. After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector and his younger brother Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy. Akhilles kills Penthesilea in battle, and soon after Kassandra fires a fatally poisoned arrow at his unprotected heel.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> tell her story because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects {{the role of the}} ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} set in the mid-1950s, shortly after Bergman's award win at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival for Smiles of a Summer Night. After his return to Stockholm, Bergman <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> go to a cinema and watch a Hollywood {{blockbuster}} movie. As he exits the cinema, he inexplicably finds himself transported to Hollywood, where a limo driver is waiting to take him to a film studio. The studio's executives, who give Bergman a lavish welcome, are desperate to entice him to stay in Hollywood and make movies for them, the American way: [...] "We're not hicks, but we must deliver kicks." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{half the}} poems in Shaker focus on love and doomed relationships. [...] In [...] "The Lie", for example, the speaker <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> use {{deception}} {{to protect herself}} from her lover's abandonment. [...] In the brief poem [...] "Prelude to a Parting", the speaker instinctively senses the inevitable and implicit end of her relationship, especially when her lover draws away from her touch. [...] Not all the love poems in the volume focus on dishonesty or deception, but most, such as the title poem [...] "Shaker, Why Don't You Sing?", describe the inevitable loss of love.|$|E

Their lovemaking is passionate, but Marie's behaviour is unusual. She is sometimes cold or trance-like, {{at one point}} reciting words in an unidentified language, and she is physically detached and unaware of the time — Julien corrects her [...] "" [...] to [...] "". She is jealous of his ex, compulsively decorates and rearranges a room in his attic, <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> act out her dreams, and does not bleed when scratched — something she keeps from Julien. She sees a girl in her dreams who shows her a [...] "forbidden sign" [...] with her hands.

500|$|... "Ali's Smile" [...] by William Burroughs is a {{short story}} {{originally}} published by Unicorn in 1971 and later republished in Burroughs's collection of short stories, Exterminator! (1973). At {{the opening of the}} story, Clinch Smith, a former colonial official, is living in an English town overshadowed by a giant slag heap. He is upset when he receives a letter from a Scientologist friend saying that he will [...] "disconnect" [...] from Smith, describing him as a [...] "suppressive person". A kris hanging on the wall of his room reminds Smith of Ali, whom he had met 30 years ago in Malaya. Ali had been put under a latah spell by an old woman, forcing him to dance in the marketplace. Smith rescued Ali, making the young man his houseboy. Ali returned to the market, however, and ran amok, killing several of the women with the kris. Smith was forced to shoot Ali, and kept the kris as a souvenir. Back in the present, Smith <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> take the kris from the wall and goes to town, where there is a fight going on between hippies and locals, with members of Scientology's Sea Org in the crowd as well. Smith goes on a killing spree with the kris, which seems to have a life of its own. He stabs Lord Westfield, a Home Office official who has asked a private investigator to infiltrate a Scientology organization, a woman, and several Sea Org members, and then a bystander shoots him dead. Police and more combatants prepare to join the fight. As they do so, the slag heap collapses and buries everyone. At the end, the [...] "ghost face" [...] of Ali smiles over all.|$|E
500|$|In season three's [...] "Birthday", Cordelia learns {{from the}} demon Skip (David Denman) that her visions are slowly killing her because {{human beings are}} {{not strong enough to}} control them. To save her life, Cordelia accepts Skip's offer to alter history so that she never met Angel in L.A., instead landing her big break as an actress. However, even in this {{alternate}} timeline, Cordelia <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> help others and eventually crosses paths with Angel again, who received the visions in her place and is now insane. Unable to let her friend suffer, Cordelia has Skip return the timeline to normal, and agrees to become half-demon, with new powers, in order to harbor the visions safely. This season also sees Angel become a father, with Cordelia stepping in to mother the infant Connor until he is kidnapped into a hell dimension in the episode [...] "Sleep Tight", only to emerge as a disturbed teenager (Vincent Kartheiser) in [...] "The Price". In the episode [...] "Waiting in the Wings", Angel realizes he has romantic feelings for Cordelia, but is prevented from voicing them by the return of Groosalugg. Cordelia dates Groosalugg {{for the remainder of the}} season, but Groo notices she loves Angel instead and decides to leave. In the season finale, Cordelia arranges to meet Angel to confess her feelings, but is prevented from doing so by Skip, who informs her that she has become a higher being. Cordelia accepts her duty, and leaves Earth for another dimension. In season four, Cordelia feels trapped in her position as a higher being, and so in the episode [...] "The House Always Wins" [...] she returns to Earth in an amnesiac state. In [...] "Spin the Bottle", her memories are returned via a spell, along with a vision of a mysterious Beast (Vladimir Kulich). Afterward, she admits to Angel the feelings she once had for him. As L.A. succumbs to the apocalypse in season four's [...] "Apocalypse, Nowish", Cordelia begins to behave out-of-character; she seduces Connor, murders Lilah (Stephanie Romanov) in the episode [...] "Calvary", commands the Beast in [...] "Salvage", and magically battles former friend Willow to keep Angel from his soul in the episode [...] "Orpheus". In season four's [...] "Players", the team realize that the now pregnant Cordelia is possessed, so Cordelia takes the unstable Connor on the run with her so they may give birth to their supernatural offspring, Jasmine (Gina Torres). In [...] "Inside Out", Skip explains that Jasmine is his master, and a higher being who possessed Cordelia before her returning to Earth, manipulating events to be born in a new body of her own.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{begins on}} April 29, with the player (who remains unnamed) {{receiving}} {{a message from}} his brother, Pete Crowhurst, an architect working on the redevelopment of an abandoned train station and hotel in Dowerton, Dorset. Pete pleads for his brother to come to Dowerton, as something is wrong and he needs help. He mentions he is working with two ghost hunters, and says [...] "I think whatever they were hunting has found them. I think its found me too."

2500|$|This {{observation}} {{was made}} {{first by the}} Roscher Lexicon: [...] "Ianus is he too, doubtlessly, a god of wind" [...] and repeated in the RE Pauly-Wissowa s.v. Boreas by Rapp. P. Grimal has taken up this interpretation connecting it to a vase with red figures representing Boreas pursuing the nymph Oreithyia: Boreas is depicted as a two headed winged demon, the two faces with beards, one black and the other fair, perhaps symbolising the double movement of the winds Boreas and Antiboreas. This proves that the Greeks of the 5th century BC knew the image of Janus. Gagé <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> mention here another parallel with Janus {{to be found in}} the figure of Argos with one hundred eyes and in his association with his murderer Hermes.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the captain}} has {{withdrawn}} his protection of Charlotte, she <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> replace Zachariah as a crew member, as she feels guilt for her naive part in revealing the crew's plans. The crew {{allows her to}} join them after she successfully climbs {{up and down the}} tallest mast, the royal yard, on the ship. To climb the ship, she must either use the ratlines or shimmy up the mainmast itself. She chooses the ratlines. While climbing down, she gets tangled and almost falls to her death, but she gets herself untangled and makes it safely down. When she comes down, however, the captain is there, and Charlotte tells him she is joining the crew. Annoyed by her change of heart, he dubs her [...] "Mister Doyle" [...] and moves her things from her cabin to the forecastle. Captain Jaggery strikes Charlotte across the face, and she vows to reveal his cruelty to the courts after they complete their voyage and insists that her reasons are justified.|$|E

2500|$|Playing {{can also}} be seen in the use of a {{transitional}} object, Winnicott's term for an object, such as a teddy bear, that has a quality for a small child of being both real and made-up at the same time. Winnicott pointed out that no one demands that a toddler explain whether his Binky is a [...] "real bear" [...] or a creation of the child's own imagination, and went on to argue that it's very important that the child is allowed to experience the Binky as being in an undefined, [...] "transitional" [...] status between the child's imagination and the real world outside the child. For Winnicott, {{one of the most important}} and precarious stages of development was in the first three years of life, when an infant grows into a child with an increasingly separate sense of self in relation to a larger world of other people. In health, the child learns to bring his or her spontaneous, real self into play with others; in a false self disorder, the child has found it unsafe or impossible to do so, and instead <b>feels</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> hide the true self from other people, and pretend to be whatever they want instead. Playing with a transitional object can be an important early bridge between self and other, which helps a child develop the capacity to be genuine in relationships, and creative.|$|E
