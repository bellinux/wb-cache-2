40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project {{was to assess the}} quality of sugarcane powder, during storage, that had been biofortified with kefir grains (SP+KG). The powder was obtained by spray drying (SD) sugarcane concentrate that was previously fermented with kefir grains (KG). Maltodextrin, 20 % w/w, was used as a <b>drying</b> <b>additive,</b> and high viability of the microbial consortium (lactobacilli, lactococci and yeast) was always sought in order to obtain a functional food enriched with probiotic microorganisms, which facilitate storage and consumption. The product was packed, both vacuum (V) and non-vacuum (WV), and stored at 10, 20 and 30 °C for 180 days. The results showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the survival rate of lactobacilli and lactococci for the time, temperature and packaging type (PT) factors; however, the yeast showed no significant differences for the PT factor. For the survival of yeast, lactococci and lactobacilli, the best temperature was 10 °C and the best packaging type was V. The survival rates reached with these conditions were 62. 82 % (yeast), 81. 22 % (lactococci) and 87. 82 % (lactobacilli). In addition, the levels attained in terms of physical and chemical properties defined the quality specifications of the product.

40|$|Summary. Statement of the problem. In recent years, {{products}} {{based on}} gypsum binding materials is widespread, as their application allows {{to increase the}} productivity and quality of work. However, their production is constrained by lack of efficient <b>dry</b> <b>additives.</b> Domestic additives for adjusting the properties of gypsum binders are mainly in the liquid state. The use of imported additives increases the cost of products. One {{of the ways to}} obtain the <b>dry</b> <b>additive</b> is the use of polyvinyl acetate dispersion, which is widely used in liquid form to adjust the properties of cementations materials. But by the reworking to the dry condition the dispersion is aggregated. Furthermore, the additive does not have the required functional properties. The main problem of the production of dispersible polymer powders is development of the mechanism of their dispersion and film formation, and selection of regulators. So the stabilizers in the system prevent the coagulation of the emulsion (dispersion). Protective colloid provides obtaining of the dispersion powder, then is able to disperse in the water. And, finally, drying (moisture removal) leads to the film formation. ...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the Activity of Baker's Compressed and Active Dry Yeast. Parameters {{important in the}} production of Baker's Yeast were correlated with the product's final activity. Activity was a measure of the gas evolved in a fermenting dough, expressed as mMCO 2 /hr/g yeast solids. The drying of Compressed Yeast to Active Dry Yeast was optimised in terms of the drying air. A tunnel tray drier was used to dry yeast to a 9 % moisture content (dry weight). At 40 °C. the optimum drying humidity was found to be 30 - 32 % relative humidity. The leavening ability of yeast dried at 17 % and 45 % relative humidity decreased. A <b>drying</b> <b>additive,</b> 2 % glyceryl monostearate, halved the drying time to 4 hours. Equations were developed to describe these observations as a function of relative humidity, drying time and additive concentration. The equilibrium relative humidity of stored dried yeast was found to be 32 % at 20 °C. Fermentation parameters were correlated with the activity of Compressed Yeast using an experimental design. Growth temperatures varied from 28 °C. to 37 °C., initial pH from 4 to 6, glucose concentrations from 0. 5 % to 3 %, nitrogen concentrations from 0. 3 % to 1. 2 % and dissolved oxygen varied as either agitated or standing cultures. Factors significantly affecting cell yield and yeast activity were growth temperature, dissolved oxygen and glucose concentrations. Maximal yeast activity occurred at 0. 5 % glucose concentration, 28 °C. and non-agitated conditions. A model was developed to describe yeast activity as a function of these variables. The observed optimal conditions for cell yield were similar to those for yeast activity except for the dissolved oxygen level. Maximum yeast activity of Compressed Yeast occurred in non-agitated fermentations, compared with cell yield which required agitated conditions to achieve the greatest cell yield. A rapid screening test for evaluating dried yeast was incorporated into the yeast activity analysis. This involved monitoring foam production during rehydration...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} whether freezing, freeze <b>drying</b> protective <b>additives,</b> or freeze <b>drying</b> of plasma samples from patients on coumarin treatment and from normal individuals affects prothrombin times or the international sensitivity index (ISI) calibration. METHODS: The {{effect of the}} addition of the protective additives singly and combined on the prothrombin time of coumarin samples and normal samples before and after freeze drying was observed using high and low ISI reference thromboplastins. ISI values were also determined. RESULTS: Freezing caused a prolongation of prothrombin time in the normal plasma samples with both reagents, which was significant with the low ISI human. Prolongation (non-significant) of the prothrombin time in coumarin plasma samples occurred with the human reagent only. Significant prolongation of normal prothrombin time by some of the protective additives before and after freeze drying was observed with both thromboplastins but to a greater extent with the human. Significant prolongation of prothrombin time in coumarin plasma samples was observed, but again was more marked with human thromboplastin. An approximate ISI was determined on the 20 coumarin samples. The only marked ISI change was with the WHO human thromboplastin after freeze drying of plasma, where a decrease from 0. 95 to 0. 90 was observed, corresponding to a marked prothrombin ratio increase. CONCLUSIONS: Freeze <b>drying</b> <b>additives</b> and the freeze drying procedure prolong normal and coumarin prothrombin times, with low ISI thromboplastin. Less marked prolongations occurred with a high ISI rabbit reagent, coumarin samples showing more significant prolongations. Marked ISI change in freeze dried plasma was only recorded with the low ISI ECAA human reagent. Frozen normal plasma samples cannot be used with confidence for ISI calibrations...|$|R

They are {{classified}} to Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita moschata, Cucurbita maxima and Cucurbita mixta, according to the texture and shape of their stems. The nutritional value of pumpkin fruits is high, varies from one species or cultivar to another. Pumpkins are reach in vitamins C, B 1, B 6, K, and in mineral substances. There are no data found about vacuum microwave dried pumpkin application in wheat bread production. The main purpose of the research was to evaluate quality parameters of microwave vacuum dried pumpkins and to verify its application in wheat bread production. Following quality parameters of pumpkins and bread made with pumpkin additive were evaluated: moisture content (oven – drying method), vitamin C content (iodometric), carotenoid content (spectrophotometric), reducing sugars (LVS 252 : 2000), colour changes (ColorTec- PCM), total fat content (ISO 6492 : 1999), degree of bread liking (ISO 4121 : 2003), bread baking loss and dry off. Quality parameters of non dried pumpkins were: content of reducing sugars − 2. 40 g⋅ 100 g- 1, vitamin C – 0. 26 g⋅ 100 g- 1, carotenoids – 0. 50 mg % (in dry matter). The technological parameters for pumpkins drying in vacuum microwave drier were used: pressure (70 – 50 mmHg), speed of tumbler – 6 rpm, one working cycle and three stages. During the pumpkins drying process a decrease in the following parameters was observed: moisture content – 10. 5 times, vitamin C content – 2. 0 times; increase of yellowness (b*) value – 1. 5 times. The optimal <b>dried</b> pumpkin <b>additive</b> to the wheat dough was 10 % of the total flour amount.

Model stuffings were composed from pork meat and lard (80 % vs. 20 %), water (30 %), curing salt (2 %). Black currant, black chokeberry and carrot were added at two different levels (3 % and 7 %). The quality assessment of pasteurized sausages included: chemical analyses (fat, protein, ash and water/total solids content), fat degradation level was measured by free acids and peroxides level and microbiological load; also the sensory score and texture profile of sausages was performed. The sausages were stored {{in the refrigerator for}} 14 days and the assessment of fat degradation level- free acids and peroxides level, sensory evaluation (except last day of storage), texture profile and microbiological load were checked.

Unlike with the M bh-(velocity dispersion) diagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remains unknown whether barred and non-barred Sérsic galaxies are offset from each other in the M bh-L diagram. While black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain what was previously thought to be a nearly constant M bh/M Spheroid mass ratio of ~ 0. 2 %, we advocate that the near-linear M bh-L and M bh-M Spheroid relations observed at high masses may have instead arisen largely from the <b>additive</b> <b>dry</b> merging of galaxies. We argue that feedback results in a dramatically different scaling relation, such that black hole mass scales roughly quadratically with the spheroid mass in Sérsic galaxies. We therefore introduce a revised cold-gas "quasar" mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect what we dub the quadratic growth of black holes in Sérsic galaxies built amidst gas-rich processes. Finally, we use our new Sérsic M bh-L equations to predict the masses of candidate intermediate mass black holes in almost 50 low-luminosity spheroids containing active galactic nuclei, finding many masses between that of stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes...|$|R
30|$|For shoot <b>dry</b> weight, nine <b>additive</b> QTLs were {{significant}} by IM. Three QTLs located on chromosome 5 (qDWT 5.2, qDWT 5.4 and qDWT 5.5) were large-effect QTLs {{that accounted for}} 11, 15 and 15  % of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Other QTLs were distributed on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, and 11, with PVE of at least 5  %. In contrast, ICIM detected five significant QTLs for DWT. Two QTLs (qDWT 4.32 and qDWT 5.4) were common in both methods. Among the five QTLs by ICIM, qDWT 5.4 had the largest effect (PVE[*]=[*] 13  %) with LOD score of 7.6. All DWT additive QTLs had increasing effects coming from Pokkali alleles. Analysis of epistatic QTLs detected six pairs of interacting QTLs. All pairs of interacting QTLs except qDWT 4.16 and qDWT 10.19 had large effects of at least 10  % PVE. Intervals of all epistatic QTLs were independent of additive QTLs.|$|R
