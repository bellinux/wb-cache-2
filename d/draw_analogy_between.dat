Here we develop matrices for the correction of piston phase aberration by use of image sharpness and also by phase retrieval. these are both presented in wavefront sensor formulation in order to <b>draw</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>between</b> the approaches. We then discuss solution ambiguity affecting both methods and describe array design to prevent such ambiguity. the problem of increased image aliasing under image sharpness correction is also highlighted. The work presented here was carried out under the sponsorship of the Electro Magnetic Remote Sensing Defence Technology Centre (EMRS DTC), Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), and the U. S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) under Grant FA 8655 - 05 - 1 - 3050...|$|E
40|$|Continuous-domain visual {{signals are}} usually {{captured}} as discrete (digital) images. This operation is not invertible in general, {{in the sense}} that the continuous-domain signal cannot be exactly reconstructed based on the discrete image, unless it satisfies certain constraints (e. g., bandlimitedness). In this paper, we study the problem of recovering shape images with smooth boundaries from a set of samples. Thus, the reconstructed image is constrained to regenerate the same samples (consistency), as well as forming a shape (bilevel) image. We initially formulate the reconstruction technique by minimizing the shape perimeter over the set of consistent binary shapes. Next, we relax the non-convex shape constraint to transform the problem into minimizing the total variation over consistent non-negative-valued images. We also introduce a requirement (called reducibility) that guarantees equivalence between the two problems. We illustrate that the reducibility property effectively sets a requirement on the minimum sampling density. One can <b>draw</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>between</b> the reducibility property and the so-called restricted isometry property (RIP) in compressed sensing which establishes the equivalence of the ℓ_ 0 minimization with the relaxed ℓ_ 1 minimization. We also evaluate the performance of the relaxed alternative in various numerical experiments. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Computer ScienceWilliam H. HsuData is {{generated}} {{all the time}} over Internet, systems sensors and mobile devices around us this {{is often referred to}} as ‘big data’. Tapping this data is a challenge to organizations because of the nature of data i. e. velocity, volume and variety. What make handling this data a challenge? This is because traditional data platforms have been built around relational database management systems coupled with enterprise data warehouses. Legacy infrastructure is either technically incapable to scale to big data or financially infeasible. Now the question arises, how to build a system to handle the challenges of big data and cater needs of an organization? The answer is Lambda Architecture. Lambda Architecture (LA) is a generic term that is used for scalable and fault-tolerant data processing architecture that ensures real-time processing with low latency. LA provides a general strategy to knit together all necessary tools for building a data pipeline for real-time processing of big data. LA comprise of three layers – Batch Layer, responsible for bulk data processing, Speed Layer, responsible for real-time processing of data streams and Service Layer, responsible for serving queries from end users. This project <b>draw</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>between</b> modern data platforms and traditional supply chain management to lay down principles for building a big data platform and show how major challenges with building a data platforms can be mitigated. This project constructs an end to end data pipeline for ingestion, organization, and processing of data and demonstrates how any organization can build a low cost distributed data platform using Lambda Architecture...|$|E
