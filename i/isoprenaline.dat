25|$|Catecholamine receptors {{persisted in}} this {{wavering}} state {{for more than}} forty years. Additional blocking agents were found such as tolazoline in Switzerland and phenoxybenzamine in the United States, but like the ergot alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became <b>isoprenaline,</b> N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine bronchodilation. Intravenous injection of pilocarpine to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their bronchodilator effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” <b>Isoprenaline</b> also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Boehringer introduced it for use in asthma in 1940. After the war it became available to Germany’s former enemies {{and over the years}} was traded under about 50 names. In addition to this therapeutic success {{it was one of the}} agonists with which Raymond P. Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: overdosage caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
25|$|The catecholamines {{comprise}} the endogenous substances dopamine, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) {{as well as}} numerous artificially synthesized compounds such as <b>isoprenaline.</b> Their investigation constitutes a prominent chapter {{in the history of}} physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology. Adrenaline was the first hormone extracted from its endocrine gland and obtained in pure form, before the word hormone was coined. It was also the first hormone the structure and biosynthesis of which were clarified. Apart from acetylcholine, adrenaline and noradrenaline were the first neurotransmitters to be discovered and the first intercellular biochemical signals to be found in intracellular vesicles. The β-adrenoceptor was the first G protein-coupled receptor the gene of which was cloned.|$|E
25|$|Experiments with cultured white {{fat cells}} from several animal species, {{including}} human, by Carpéné and co-workers showed that racemic synephrine produced lipolytic effects, {{but only at}} high concentrations (0.1-1 mM). The potency, {{expressed in terms of}} pD2 of synephrine in these species was as follows: rat: 4.38; hamster: 5.32; guinea pig: 4.31; human: 4.94. In comparison, <b>isoprenaline</b> had a pD2 = 8.29 and norepinephrine had pD2 = 6.80 in human white fat cells. The lipolytic effect of 1 mM/L of synephrine on rat white fat cells was antagonized by various β-antagonists with the following inhibitory concentrations (IC50): bupranolol: 0.11 μM; CGP-20,712A (β1 antagonist): 6.09 μM; ICI-118,551 (β2 antagonist): 3.58 μM; SR-5923A (β3 antagonist): 17 μM.|$|E

2500|$|... β receptors {{have the}} subtypes β1, β2 and β3. All three {{are linked to}} Gs {{proteins}} (although β2 also couples to Gi), which in turn are linked to adenylate cyclase. Agonist binding thus causes {{a rise in the}} intracellular concentration of the second messenger cAMP. [...] Downstream effectors of cAMP include cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which mediates some of the intracellular events following hormone binding. <b>Isoprenaline</b> is a non-selective agonist.|$|E
2500|$|The α,β-terminology {{initially}} {{was slow to}} spread. This changed with two publications in 1958. In the first, from Lilly Research Laboratories, dichloroisoprenaline selectively blocked some smooth muscle inhibitory effects of adrenaline and isoprenaline; in the second, it blocked cardiac excitatory effects of adrenaline and <b>isoprenaline</b> as well. In the first, which does not mention Ahlquist, dichloroisoprenaline blocked ″certain adrenergic inhibitory receptor sites″; but in the second the results ″support the postulate of Ahlquist (1948) that the adrenotropic inhibitory receptors and the cardiac chronotropic and inotropic adrenergic receptors are functionally identical, i.e., that both are beta type receptors. … It is suggested that this terminology be extended {{to the realm of}} adrenergic blocking drugs, e.g., that blocking drugs be designated according to the receptor for which they have the greatest affinity, as either alpha or beta adrenergic blocking drugs.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Ahlquist {{was head}} of the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Georgia School of Medicine, now Georgia Regents University. In 1948 he saw what had escaped Dale in 1906. “The adrenotropic receptors have been {{considered}} to be of two classes, those whose action results in excitation and those whose action results in inhibition of the effector cells. Experiments described in this paper indicate that although {{there are two kinds of}} adrenotropic receptors they cannot be classified simply as excitatory or inhibitory since each kind of receptor may have either action depending on where it is found.” Ahlquist chose six agonists, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, α-methylnoradrenaline and <b>isoprenaline,</b> and examined their effects on several organs. He found that the six substances possessed two – and only two – rank orders of potency in these organs. For example, the rank order of potency was ″adrenaline > noradrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > isoprenaline″ in promoting contraction of blood vessels, but ″isoprenaline > adrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > noradrenaline″ in stimulating the heart. The receptor with the first rank order (for example for blood vessel contraction) he called alpha adrenotropic receptor (now α-adrenoceptor or α-adrenergic receptor), while the receptor with the second rank order (for instance for stimulation of the heart, but also for bronchodilation) he called beta adrenotropic receptor (now β-adrenoceptor or β-adrenergic receptor). ″This concept of two fundamental types of receptors is directly opposed to the concept of two mediator substances (sympathin E and sympathin I) as propounded by Cannon and Rosenblueth and now widely quoted as ‘law’ of physiology. … There is only one adrenergic neuro-hormone, or sympathin, and that sympathin is identical with epinephrine.” ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Isoprenaline</b> (isoproterenol) is a {{medication}} {{used for the}} treatment of bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart block, and rarely for asthma. In humans, it is a non-selective β adrenoreceptor agonist that is the isopropylamine analog of epinephrine (adrenaline).|$|E
50|$|<b>Isoprenaline</b> is a β1 and β2 {{adrenoreceptor}} agonist and {{has almost}} no activity against alpha adrenergic receptors. Its agonist effects at TAAR1 provide {{it with a}} pharmacodynamic effects that resemble those of the endogenous trace amines, like tyramine.|$|E
50|$|People {{experiencing}} bronchospasm {{due to the}} β2 receptor-blocking {{effects of}} nonselective beta blockers may be treated with anticholinergic drugs, such as ipratropium, which are safer than beta agonists in patients with cardiovascular disease.

50|$|Dobutamine is a {{sympathomimetic}} drug used in {{the treatment}} of heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Its primary mechanism is direct stimulation of β1 receptors of the sympathetic nervous system. Dobutamine was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Ronald Tuttle and Jack Mills at Eli Lilly and Company, as a structural analogue of <b>isoprenaline.</b>|$|E
50|$|Historically, it {{was used}} to treat asthma via metered aerosol or nebulizing devices; it was also {{available}} in sublingual, oral, intravenous, and intramuscular formulations. The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel recommends against its use as a nebulizer for acute bronchoconstriction; the use of any beta2-agonists including <b>isoprenaline</b> is not recommended in an asthmatic respiration crisis.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{treatment}} can be medical, involving {{the use of}} drugs like <b>isoprenaline</b> (Isuprel) and epinephrine (adrenaline). Definitive treatment is surgical, involving the insertion of a pacemaker - most likely one with sequential pacing such as a DDI mode as opposed to the older VVI mechanisms, and the doctor may arrange the patient to undergo electrocardiography to confirm this type of treatment.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, a {{technology}} competing against the nebulizer was launched by Riker Laboratories (3M), {{in the form}} of pressurized metered-dose inhalers, with Medihaler-iso (<b>isoprenaline)</b> and Medihaler-epi (adrenaline) as the two first products. In these devices, the drug is cold-fill and delivered in exact doses through some special metering valves, driven by a gas propellant technology (i.e. Freon or a less environmentally damaging HFA).|$|E
50|$|Other {{treatment}} {{that may be}} used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias until Fab is acquired are magnesium, phenytoin, and lidocaine. Magnesium suppresses digoxin-induced ventricular arrhythmias while phenytoin and lidocaine suppresses digoxin-induced ventricular automaticity and delay afterdepolarizations without depressing AV conduction. In the case of an abnormally slow heart rate (bradyarrhythmias), Atropine, catecholamines (<b>isoprenaline</b> or salbutamol), and/or temporary cardiac pacing can be used.|$|E

Approximately half of the patients have endocrine disorders such as diabetes, nutritional disorders such as pellagra or kwashiorkor, or have taken drugs such as guanethidine, thioridazine, or <b>isoprenaline.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Isoetarine is a {{selective}} short-acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonist. It {{can be called}} the [...] "granddaughter of adrenalin" [...] {{in the line of}} β2 agonists that gave quick relief for bronchospasm and asthma.

Isoetharine was the third drug in this line, thus the third generation or granddaughter of the original.|$|E
50|$|Early {{treatments}} included garlic, {{cinnamon and}} ipecac, among others. Modern treatments were {{developed during the}} second half of the 20th century. Evidence supporting the use of steroids in COPD was published in the late 1950s. Bronchodilators came into use in the 1960s following a promising trial of <b>isoprenaline.</b> Further bronchodilators, such as salbutamol, were developed in the 1970s, and the use of LABAs began in the mid-1990s.|$|E
50|$|In 1940 isoproterenol (<b>isoprenaline)</b> was discovered. This {{compound}} had {{a similar}} effect as adrenalin but fewer side effects were found. In 1949 isoproterenol was used generally to treat asthma patients, given sublingually or inhaled. The first pressurized metered-dose inhaler was introduced in 1956. This was much more convenient for patients than the previously used squeeze-bulb inhalers. The pressurized metered-dose inhaler technique developed rapidly in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{approved}} in the US in 1947.Between 1963 and 1968 in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand {{there was an}} increase in deaths among people using <b>isoprenaline</b> to treat asthma. This was attributed to overdose: the inhalers produced in that area were dispensing five times the dosage dispensed by inhalers produced in the US and Canada, where the deaths were not observed.|$|E
50|$|Since NMT {{is one of}} the {{constituents}} of bitter orange, Citrus aurantium, Mercader and co-workers studied its effects on lipolysis, finding that it inhibited lipolysis in rats. NMT (in common with tyramine) also failed to stimulate lipolysis in human adipocytes at a concentration of 10 μg/mL (i.e. ~ 66 μM/L); even at ≥ 100 μg/mL, NMT and tyramine induced only 20% of the lipolysis produced by the reference standard drug, <b>isoprenaline.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pindolol is a nonselective {{beta blocker}} with partial beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} agonist activity and also possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. This means that pindolol, particularly in high doses, exerts effects like epinephrine or <b>isoprenaline</b> (increased pulse rate, increased blood pressure, bronchodilation), but these effects are limited. Pindolol also shows membrane stabilizing effects like quinidine, possibly accounting for its antiarrhythmic effects. It also {{functions as a}} 5-HT1A receptor weak partial agonist / antagonist (Ki = 33 nM).|$|E
50|$|Isoprenaline's {{effects on}} the {{cardiovascular}} system (non-selective) relate to its actions on cardiac β1 receptors and β2 receptors on smooth muscle within the tunica media of arterioles. <b>Isoprenaline</b> has positive inotropic and chronotropic {{effects on the}} heart. β2 adrenoceptor stimulation in arteriolar smooth muscle induces vasodilation. Its inotropic and chronotropic effects elevate systolic blood pressure, while its vasodilatory effects tend to lower diastolic blood pressure. The overall effect is to decrease mean arterial pressure due to the β2 receptors' vasodilation.|$|E
50|$|Research by Carpéné and {{co-workers}} showed that phenylethanolamine {{did not significantly}} stimulate lipolysis in cultured adipocytes ("fat cells") from guinea pig or human. Moderate stimulation (intrinsic activities about half that of the reference standard, <b>isoprenaline)</b> was observed in adipocytes from rat or hamster. This lipolysis was inhibited completely by bupranolol (considered to be a non-selective β-blocker), CGP 20712A (considered to be a selective β1-antagonist), and ICI 118,551 (considered to be a selective β2-antagonist), but not by SR 59230A (considered to be a selective β3-antagonist).|$|E
