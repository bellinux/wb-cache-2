5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> Dr. William M. Gray, {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The July 23, 1983 forecast predicted that after the slow start to the season, that a total of eight storms would form, and five of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. However, the predictions proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming {{by the end of the}} season and three of those reaching hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|The previews of {{the film}} were held at various places, where it was well {{received}} by critics and audiences. Noted writer M. Govindan wrote a cover story in his magazine Sameeksha, and organised a seminar on the film in Chennai, then known as Madras. Various intellectuals and writers took part in it, including noted film <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> P. Bhaskaran and director Balu Mahendra. Noted critic and film director Vijayakrishnan mentioned that Devadas's sound mixing work {{was one of the}} major attractions {{of the film}}. Considerable use of natural sound, apart from background music, was new for Malayalam cinema. Cast performances were also praised by critics. Bharath Gopi received considerable attention even for his minimal screen appearance. Though Madhu had acted previously in several films, including Ramu Kariat's National Award-winning film, Chemmeen (1965), Swayamvaram marked a turning point in his career.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>experts,</b> <b>like</b> former U.S. Drug Enforcement agent Mike Vigil, {{argue that}} the split in Los Zetas was an {{inevitable}} result given the cartel's rapid growth.

25|$|His {{warnings}} of impending {{economic crisis and}} a loss of confidence in the dollar in 2005 and 2006 were at the time derided by many economists, but accelerating dollar devaluation in 2007 led <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan to reconsider hard money policies such as those of Paul.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>experts,</b> <b>like</b> {{physicists}} Luiz Pinguelli Rosa and José Goldemberg, have voiced {{their opposition}} to Brazil’s nuclear endeavor, calling it a very expensive source of energy. Indeed, the vast costs associated with nuclear energy are considered an obstacle to Brazilian development of a domestic renewable energy market according to Greenpeace.|$|E
25|$|Actually {{for some}} <b>experts</b> (<b>like</b> Tripodi) the {{question}} arises how it all {{could get to the}} end {{in such a short time}} and without major incidents: no loss of life happened.

30|$|Yet despite {{extensive}} {{knowledge of}} expert characteristics, most introductory physics courses are still largely unsatisfactory {{in terms of}} engendering physics expertise in college physics students. College physics students frequently employ heuristic methods such as equation hunting during problem solving, rather than using more <b>expert</b> <b>like</b> strategies (Tuminaro 2004; Walsh et al. 2007).|$|R
25|$|While in Modern Hebrew etrog is {{the name}} for citron of any variety or form, whether kosher for the ritual or not, its English usage applies only to those {{varieties}} and specimens used {{as one of the}} Four Species. Some taxonomic <b>experts,</b> <b>like</b> Hodgson and others, have mistakenly treated etrog as one specific variety of citron. The various Jewish rites utilize different varieties, according to their tradition or the decision of their respective Posek.|$|E
25|$|Sancerre {{is often}} {{compared}} to neighboring Pouilly-Fumé which also specializes in 100% Sauvignon blanc wines, {{and while there}} are some differences, wine <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> Robinson, Johnson and Karen MacNeil note that only very experienced tasters can distinguish the differences in a blind tasting. Broadly speaking, Sancerre tends to have a fuller body with more pronounced aromas, while Pouilly-Fumé wines are more perfumed. However, both wines have naturally high acidity and the potential to exhibit the minerally, flinty notes described as pierre à fusil or gunflint, as well as citrus and spicy notes.|$|E
25|$|Sauternes are {{characterized}} by the balance of sweetness with the zest of acidity. Some common flavor notes include apricots, honey, peaches but with a nutty note, which is a typical characteristic of noble semillon itself (cf. Australian noble (late-harvest) semillon). The finish can resonate on the palate for several minutes. Sauternes are some of longest-lived wines, with premium examples from exceptional vintages properly kept having the potential to age well even beyond 100 years. Sauternes typically starts out with a golden, yellow color that becomes progressively darker as it ages. Some wine <b>experts,</b> <b>like</b> Ed McCarthy and Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, believe that only once the wine reaches the color of an old copper coin has it started to develop its more complex and mature flavors.|$|E

25|$|The Supergiant {{management}} axed MS Dhoni as {{captain and}} named Smith as captain for the 2017 season. In RPS's first game against Mumbai Indians, Smith led {{his team to}} victory in style, scoring 84* and was rewarded with the Man of The Match award. Three consecutive losses, however, left his team reeling at the last position in the points table. An incredible run of 8 wins in 10 matches helped Supergiant finish in the second position, and thus qualify for the play-offs, with Smith receiving praise for his captaincy from renowned cricketers and <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> Sunil Gavaskar and Kevin Pietersen. He led his team to the final with a 20 run victory over Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 1. In the final Smith's men faced Mumbai yet again. He scored 51 off 50 balls but could not lead RPS to victory. Pune lost the match by one run.|$|E
500|$|Congressional Democrats {{and health}} policy <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> MIT {{economics}} professor Jonathan Gruber and David Cutler argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate {{to ensure that}} adverse selection and/or [...] "free riding" [...] would not result in an insurance [...] "death spiral". This approach was taken because the president and congressional leaders had concluded that more progressive plans, such as the (single-payer) Medicare for All act, could not obtain filibuster-proof support in the Senate. By deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas—the same basic outline was supported by former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Tom Daschle and George J. Mitchell—the bill's drafters hoped to garner the votes necessary for passage.|$|E
500|$|The {{water quality}} has also {{deteriorated}} due to intense pollution {{caused by the}} untreated sewage and solid waste that is fed into the lake from the peripheral areas and from the settlements and houseboats. Besides, some <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> Dr. A.A. Kazmi (Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee and {{in charge of the}} Environmental Engineering Lab) believe that deforestation in the catchment of Dal and Telbal stream may have led to more nitrogen and phosphorus-rich run-off, further aiding eutrophication. [...] Encroachments of water channels and consequent clogging has diminished the circulation and inflows into the lake, so with the building up of phosphates and nitrogen, this has led to extensive weed growth and consequences on the biodiversity of the lake.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{towards the}} end of the century MacBride's {{theories}} were being challenged, the medical establishment in Britain remained wedded to the notion that scurvy was a disease of internal ‘putrefaction’ and the Sick and Hurt Board, run by administrators, felt obliged to follow its advice. [...] Within the Royal Navy, however, opinion – strengthened by first-hand experience of the [...] use of lemon juice at the siege of Gibraltar and during Admiral Rodney's expedition to the Caribbean – had become increasingly convinced of its efficacy.

2500|$|Another {{viewpoint}} on sex education, historically {{inspired by}} sexologists like Wilhelm Reich and psychologists like Sigmund Freud and James W. Prescott, holds {{that what is}} at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual mores. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized sexual oppression and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship <b>experts</b> <b>like</b> Reid Mihalko of [...] "Reid About Sex" [...] suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.|$|E
