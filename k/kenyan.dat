5|$|In October 2011, {{following}} a weekend preparatory meeting between Somali and <b>Kenyan</b> military {{officials in the}} town of Dhobley, the Kenya Defence Forces launched an attack across the border against Al-Shabaab, aiming for Kismayo. In early June 2012, <b>Kenyan</b> troops were formally integrated into AMISOM.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{examples}} include <b>Kenyan</b> runner Bernard Lagat, {{who became a}} United States citizen in May 2004. The <b>Kenyan</b> constitution requires that one renounce their <b>Kenyan</b> citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics {{even though he had}} already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a <b>Kenyan</b> citizen, jeopardising his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Kenyan</b> government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The <b>Kenyan</b> government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
50|$|During {{his inaugural}} speech, Uhuru promised {{economic}} transformation through Vision 2030, unity among all <b>Kenyans,</b> free maternal care {{and that he}} will serve all <b>Kenyans.</b> He also promised to improve the standards of education in Kenya.

40|$|Using {{the data}} {{collected}} from 212 participants, {{this study examined the}} perceptions that <b>Kenyans</b> have toward television news with cancer messages and how the audiences use the messages. Using both close-ended and open-ended survey questions, this study investigated the motives that <b>Kenyans</b> have prior to watching news, how these motives affect their frequency of watching such news, how engaged they are with the news, their views of such news, how television news contribute to their knowledge about cancer, and their personal experiences with cancer. Some of the results suggest that the motives that <b>Kenyans</b> have are to gain knowledge on the disease and understand how people are managing the disease. Besides, motives account for a significant amount of television news that <b>Kenyans</b> watch. Additionally, <b>Kenyans</b> have had personal experiences with cancer touching on family members, friends, and patients in hospitals. Specific theoretical and practical implications, limitations, strengths, and proposals for future research are discussed in detail...|$|R

5|$|A {{key issue}} facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region {{and claimed that}} it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to their demands, insisting that the land remain <b>Kenyan.</b> In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.|$|E

The most recent growth may now be coming from ethnically black African <b>Kenyans,</b> mirroring wider trends across the continent of economic migration to the richer industrialised nations.

50|$|<b>Kenyans</b> are a {{world leader}} {{in the number of}} solar power systems {{installed}} per capita.

5|$|The {{provisional}} favourite for the women's {{race was}} <b>Kenyan</b> runner Florence Kiplagat, {{who was the}} fastest entrant in the field through her win at the Lille Half Marathon in September (also her debut for the distance). Her compatriots Peninah Arusei and Sarah Chepchirchir – second and third in Lille – completed the strongest three of the <b>Kenyan</b> women's team, which was considered {{the team to beat}} for the title. The Ethiopians, led by Boston Marathon winner Dire Tune, were their main opposition for the team race, although the nation had sent relatively inexperienced runners to the championships on this occasion. China's leading athlete was Zhu Xiaolin, who despite being an established marathon runner had less experience over the half distance. Although Japan lacked a leading figure individually, their overall consistency (which had brought them team medals in the last five editions) demonstrated their team pedigree. Kenya entered the tournament as the reigning team champions.|$|E
