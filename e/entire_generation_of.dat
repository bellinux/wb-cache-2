An <b>entire</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> identical workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s.

5|$|Josce's {{grandson}} Fulk fitzWarin, {{who died}} in 1258, is ostensibly the hero of a lost romantic poem called Fouke le Fitz Waryn. The work survives as French prose in a loose corpus of medieval literature known as the Matter of England. However, it appears to confuse events of Fulk fitzWarin's lifetime with those of his grandfather's. Other errors in the work include transposing some of the Welsh Marcher barons of King Henry I of England's reign into nobles of William the Conqueror's time, and omitting an <b>entire</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> fitzWarins. Although scholars believe Fouke le Fitz Waryn draws on genuine tradition, the difficulty in separating the fitzWarin biographies makes it a problematic source.|$|E
5|$|The Marathas marched {{beyond the}} Indus as their empire grew. The {{responsibility}} {{for managing the}} sprawling Maratha empire in the north was entrusted to two Maratha leaders, Shinde and Holkar, as the Peshwa was busy in the south. The two leaders did not act in concert, and their policies were influenced by personal interests and financial demands. They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs, the Jats, and the Rohillas, and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders. A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against the Afghan Ahmad Shah Abdali. An <b>entire</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield {{as a result of}} that conflict.
