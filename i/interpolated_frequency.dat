40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for design of FIR Filters is proposed. The design method is based on Weighted Least Square (WLS) optimization. In this algorithm, Newton and Quasi-Newton method is used. The main reason to {{formulate}} and solve the design problem in a WLS optimization formulation is that the complementarily conditions associated with the WLS optimization lead to {{a very small number}} of non-zero Lagrange multipliers that need to be updated in a given iteration. This in turn improves design efficiency as well as the algorithm’s numerical stability which is of critical importance for the design filter. Simulation results with comparisons are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In this thesis from pole zero plots, the stability in WLS optimization technique is much higher than in the traditional method of optimization (Parks-McClellan algorithm). From the simulation results, WLS technique is better than Parks McClellan Algorithm. WLS methodreduces the ripple in the <b>interpolated</b> <b>frequency</b> response...|$|E
30|$|Channel {{estimation}} is {{a necessary}} process before demodulation as the radio channel is frequency selective. For multicarrier modulation systems, the estimation is usually performed by sending a training data sequence, called pilot tones, {{on a set of}} carriers known to the receiver. The channel is then estimated at the pilot frequencies using the classical least squares (LS) or minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators [10]. When pilot tones are not available on every carrier, a process of interpolation is required to recover the complete channel response [11]. The interpolation may be done in the time domain [12]. A time-domain channel impulse response is obtained using an inverse Fourier transform of the channel estimated at the pilot frequencies. A filter may then be applied to reduce noise effects and border effects. An <b>interpolated</b> <b>frequency</b> domain channel is then processed by Fourier transform. Another solution may be to interpolate the channel in the frequency domain. Many algorithms, such as linear interpolation, low-pass filtering and spline cubic interpolation have been proposed [13, 14]. For most interpolation schemes, the channel is poorly interpolated on the carrier located on the edges of the frequency band. This effect may be neglected when the number of carriers per contiguous frequency band is large but may lead to significant performance degradation of the overall system when the multicarrier modulation is applied to a fragmented spectrum. A robust interpolation scheme for the complete spectrum, including the edges is therefore critical. A solution has already been proposed in [12] using interpolation in the time domain. Performance is increased at the price of higher complexity. Furthermore, instability issues are not addressed and may lead to noise enhancement. A stable and robust scheme based on interpolation filters in the frequency domain is proposed in this paper.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the multifarious genetic heterogeneity of Europe and neighboring regions from a geographical perspective. We created composite maps outlining the estimated geographical distribution of major groups of genetically similar individuals {{on the basis}} of forensic Y-chromosomal markers. We analyzed Y-chromosomal haplotypes composed of 7 highly polymorphic STR loci, genotyped for 33, 010 samples, collected at 249 sites in Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, deposited in the YHRD database (www. yhrd. org). The data set comprised 4176 different haplotypes, which we grouped into 20 clusters. For each cluster, the frequency per site was calculated. All geostatistical analysis was performed with the geographic information system GRASS-GIS. We <b>interpolated</b> <b>frequency</b> values across the study area separately for each cluster. Juxtaposing all 20 interpolated surfaces, we point-wisely screened for the highest cluster frequencies and stored it in parallel with the respective cluster label. We combined these two types of data in a composite map. We repeated this procedure for the second highest frequencies in Europe. Major groups were assigned to Northern, Western and Eastern Europe. North Africa built a separate region, Southeastern Europe, Turkey and Near East were divided into several regions. The spatial distribution of the groups accounting for the second highest frequencies in Europe overlapped with the territories of the largest countries. The genetic structure presented in the composite maps fits major historical geopolitical regions and is in agreement with previous studies of genetic frequencies, validating our approach. Our genetic geostatistical approach provides, {{on the basis of}} two composite maps, detailed evidence of the geographical distribution and relative frequencies of the most predominant groups of the extant male European population, examined on the basis of forensic Y-STR haplotypes. The existence of considerable genetic differences among geographic subgroups in Europe has important consequences for the statistical inference in forensic Y-STR haplotype analyses...|$|E

40|$|We present several new, {{efficient}} algorithms that extract low complexity {{models from}} frequency response measurements of large-scale dynamical systems. Our work {{is motivated by}} the fact that, in many applications, analytical models of a dynamical system are seldom available. Instead, we may only have access to its frequency response measurements. For example, for a system with multiple inputs and outputs, we may only have access to data sets of S-parameters. In this setting, our new approach extracts models that interpolate the given measurements. The extracted models have low complexity (or reduced order) and, thus, lead to short simulation times and low data storage requirements. The main tool used by our approach is Lagrange rational interpolation [...] a generalization of the classic result of Lagrange polynomial interpolation. We present an in-depth look at Lagrange rational interpolation and provide several new insights and simplified proofs. This analysis leads to new algorithms that rely on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Loewner matrix pencil formed directly from the measurements. We show several new results on rational interpolation for measurements of linear, bi-linear and quadratic-linear systems. Furthermore, we generalize these results to parametrized measurements, that is, we show how to <b>interpolate</b> <b>frequency</b> response measurements that depend on parameters.

Maps of annual means were cross-validated and tested against independent observations. These replicated known features such as peak rainfall totals in the Highlands and western escarpment, as well as maximum temperatures along the coastal plains and interior. The weather generator reproduced daily and annual diagnostics when run with parameters from observed meteorological series for a test site at Taiz. However, when run with <b>interpolated</b> parameters, the <b>frequency</b> of wet-days, mean wet-day amount, annual totals and variability were underestimated. Stratification of sites for model calibration improved representation of growing season rainfall totals. Future work should focus on {{a wider range of}} model inputs to better discriminate controls exerted by different landscape units...|$|R
