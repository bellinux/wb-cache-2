25|$|On {{the night}} of 18 October 1972, a Royalist Commando Raiders team made a low level {{parachute}} drop from an Air America Twin Otter to secure a landing zone near Salavan. The following morning, the 22nd Special Operations Squadron (22nd SOS) began helilifting Groupement Mobile 42 (GM 42) into rice paddies adjoining the Salavan airstrip on its westward side. Although the first contingent landed without resistance, in a subsequent lift seven of the 22nd SOS's CH-53s suffered battle damage. Air America <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the airlift duties as the 22nd SOS withdrew for repairs.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009, it was {{reported}} that company was struggling to repay its debts of 1.1 billion euros. The fiscal year ending in August resulted in an operating loss, and the company had to re-negotiate with its 15 funding banks debt repayment schedules for the years 2009–2011. The banks took a more controlling role in the company: it could no longer pay dividends, make investments, or sign new contracts without its creditors' approval. Tallink also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the pace in debt repayments if conditions were to improve, and had to look for options to sell or rent some of its ships. Most of its debts were incurred for purchasing Silja Line for 470 million and Superfast Ferries for 310 million euros.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, he and Satyendranath Tagore {{were the}} first two Indians to sail to England to prepare for and appear in the Indian Civil Service examinations. The {{competition}} {{was one of the}} stiffest, if not the stiffest, in the world at that time, but more so because any plan to cross the seas and travel to Europe was bound to meet with the strongest opposition from the Indian society. Preparations for the examination was tough, as they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> many subjects not taught in India. Moreover, Ghose was subject to racial discrimination. The examination schedules and syllabus were altered. He sat for the examinations twice but failed to succeed. Satyendranath Tagore went through and became the first Indian to join the ICS.|$|E

500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was in an {{emotional}} state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn, her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. One day, while recording of the title track {{was going on at}} Jonny Yuma Studios, producer Patrick Leonard <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> his daughter Jessie from school and, since his wife was out of town, had to bring her back to the studio. Madonna, who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival, struck up a rapport with Jessie. She commented: [...] "It was like as if I was my mother and [...] was me. We were playing in our backyard again." [...] Witnessing their connection, Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter, titled [...] "Dear Jessie". Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer; it was finished within the next three days.|$|E

On November 21 (a Thursday) Oswald asked Frazier for an unusual mid-week lift back to Irving, saying he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> some curtain rods. The next morning (the day of the assassination), he returned to Dallas with Frazier. He left behind $170 and his wedding ring, but took a large paper bag with him. Frazier reported that Oswald told him the bag contained curtain rods, The Warren Commission concluded that the package of [...] "curtain rods" [...] actually contained the rifle that Oswald was going to use for the assassination.|$|E
2500|$|The network {{put up a}} green ABC Sports graphic {{while it}} {{scrambled}} to repair the video feed (the broadcast cameras and mics were powered by the local power supply), but audio from the stadium was restored {{after a few seconds}} via a telephone link. Michaels <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, [...] "Well, folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!" [...] accompanied by the combined screams of excitement and panic from fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere. ABC then switched to an episode of Roseanne which was on standby for a rain delay situation, while attempting to restore electricity to its remote equipment.|$|E

It is still the biggest loss ever suffered by the Lithuanian squad, who scored only 34.2% of their shots. The Americans still recognized that they aimed to ramp up their game specially to counter the Lithuanians, with Larry Bird acknowledging that [...] "we knew the Lithuanians were capable of scoring, (so) we didn't take them lightly", and Magic Johnson saying that [...] "they're a dangerous team, so we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> our intensity, play better defense". Afterwards, the Lithuanian team coaches decided to start resting the primary players for the bronze medals game.|$|E

One of the young men who had <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the heart he had flung at Ann's feet and carry it away for repairs had once confided to an intimate friend, after the sting had to some extent passed, that the feelings of a man who made love to Ann might be likened to the emotions which hot chocolate might be supposed to entertain on contact with vanilla ice-cream. Jimmy, had the comparison been presented to him, would have endorsed its perfect accuracy. The wind from the sea, until now keen and bracing, had become merely infernally cold. The song of the wind in the rigging, erstwhile melodious, had turned into a damned depressing howling.|$|E

Of course I expected {{that there would be a}} big hue and cry for him, but I had no fear whatever of his being found.

She had thrown his wife more than once in his face, after the fashion of women when they are wooed by married men since the days of Cleopatra downwards. But he had taken that simply as encouragement.

6000|$|The same Pesne, an {{excellent}} Artist, has painted Friedrich as Prince-Royal: {{a beautiful young}} man with MOIST-looking enthusiastic eyes of extraordinary brilliancy, smooth oval face; considerably resembling his Mother. After which period, authentic Pictures of Friedrich are sought for to little purpose. For it seems he never sat to any Painter, in his reigning days; and the Prussian Chodowiecki, [Pronounce KODOV-YETSKI;--and endeavor to make some acquaintance with this [...] "Prussian Hogarth," [...] who has real worth and originality.] Saxon Graff, English Cunningham <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> his physiognomy from the distance, intermittently, as they could. Nor is Rauch's grand equestrian Sculpture a thing to be believed, or perhaps pretending much to be so. The commonly received Portrait of Friedrich, which all German limners can draw at once,--the cocked-hat, big eyes and alert air, reminding you of some uncommonly brisk Invalid Drill-sergeant or Greenwich Pensioner, as much as of a Royal Hero,--is nothing but a general extract and average of all the faces of Friedrich, such as has been tacitly agreed upon; and is definable as a received pictorial-myth, by no means as a fact, or credible resemblance of life.|$|E
6000|$|After {{saying so}} much there remains the last {{tale of the}} book, still untouched. The End of the Tether {{is a story of}} sea-life in a rather special way; and the most {{intimate}} thing I can say of it is this: that having lived that life fully, amongst its men, its thoughts and sensations, I have found it possible, without the slightest misgiving, in all sincerity of heart and peace of conscience, to conceive the existence of Captain Whalley's personality and to relate the manner of his end. This statement acquires some force from the circumstance that the pages of that story--a fair half of the book--are also the product of experience. That experience belongs (like [...] "Youth's") to the time before I ever thought of putting pen to paper. As to its [...] "reality" [...] that is for the readers to determine. One <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> one's facts here and there. More skill would have made them more real and the whole composition more interesting. But here we are approaching the veiled region of artistic values which it would be improper and indeed dangerous for me to enter. I have looked over the proofs, have corrected a misprint or two, have changed a word or two--and that's all. It is not very likely that I shall ever read The End of the Tether again. No more need be said. It accords best with my feelings to part from Captain Whalley in affectionate silence.|$|E
