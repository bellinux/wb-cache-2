40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{mechanical}} behaviour of a tungsten <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> (WHA) with potential {{use as a}} kinetic energy penetrator is investigated. Mechanical properties related to tensile loading are measured at strain rates up to 400 s 1 and at temperatures from 20 C to about 500 °C. From the experimental data parameters for the constitutive equations developed by Johnson and Cook (J&C) as well as Zerilli and Armstrong (Z&A) are determined. From the extracted models isothermai and adiabatic flow stress curves are calculated and compared to experiments. At high strain rates or high temperatures the J&C model deviates about 5 - 10 % from experimental results, while the Z&A model shows a better agreement with the collecte data. It should be emphasised that the Z&A model used in this work is developed for materials with body centred crystals whereas the WHA is a composite with both face centred-and body centred crystals. 1...|$|E

50|$|The {{hardness}} {{and density}} of tungsten are applied in obtaining <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>alloys.</b> A {{good example is}} high speed steel, which can contain as much as 18% tungsten. Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile. Tungsten alloys are used {{in a wide range}} of different applications, including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding. Superalloys containing tungsten, such as Hastelloy and Stellite, are used in turbine blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings. Quenched (martensitic) tungsten steel (approx. 5.5% to 7.0% W with 0.5% to 0.7% C) was used for making hard permanent magnets, due to its high remanence and coercivity, as noted by John Hopkinson (1849 - 1898) as early as 1886. The magnetic properties of a <b>metal</b> or an <b>alloy</b> are very sensitive to microstructure. For example, while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic (but iron, of course, is), when present in steel in these proportions, it stabilizes the martensite phase, which has an enhanced ferromagnetism, as compared to the ferrite (iron) phase, due to its greater resistance to magnetic domain wall motion.|$|R

40|$|In 2005, over 200, 000 Americans {{underwent}} a hip arthroplasty, {{the replacement of}} a hip joint with an artificial prosthesis. Of these arthroplasties, metal-on-metal type implants represent an increasing usage percentage. Metal-on-metal implants are selected largely for their low volumetric wear rate, durability, and resistance to corrosion. In spite of these advantages, little is known concerning the long-term consequences of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> use in the body, although early research indicates potentially carcinogenic results. This thesis is a preliminary investigation into these long term effects and their root causes. An improved comprehension of the corrosion kinetics {{and the rate of}} ion production from the high surface energy wear debris released by implant articulation can assist in illustrating the relative clinical significance of exposure to these metallic bodies over time. This thesis primarily focuses on developing a test methodology for the detection and analysis of ion dissociation in simulated body fluids. In order to validate this test methodology, the ion dissociation rates and surface characteristics of several predetermined diameters of cobalt chromium alloy spherical particles were analyzed. The effect of changing particle diameter, and thus surface area to volume ratio, on ion dissociation rate was determined to be significant when not affected by localized agglomeration. Additionally, preferential corrosion of cobalt within individual grains was observed and correlated to elevated cobalt concentrations in the electrolyte. These results suggest that ion dissociation kinetics for true wear particles can be determined through the refinement and application of the methodology developed...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advance}} of {{industrial}} mass production, modern micro-electronics and computers, the intervals between the release of new generations of consumer products have been dramatically reduced and so have their lifetime cycles. While it was very natural in the post-war era, that sophisticated consumer products like television sets and stereo equipment would not be replaced with a new product until they break, and usually beyond that point since it was very common to have a broken television set serviced, the habits of consumers have changed during {{the last quarter of}} the 20 th century. A modern consumer product, like Apple's famous iPhone has a market life of approximately one year until a successor is announced and subsequently pushed into the market. Usually these new generations bring a bunch of new features, have a higher performance while maintaining the price or becoming even cheaper, thus the consumer greatly benefits from the reduced lifetime cycle of these products. However, electronic devices not only require a lot of of Earth's limited resources for their production, but their production processes are a major source for harmful climate gases like carbon dioxide and toxic waste like <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>alloys,</b> acids and alkalis. And last but not least is every obsoleted iPhone a candidate for waste facilities unless consumers are going to sell them on the second hand market. While we can not expect consumers and manufacturers to go back to the early days of consumer products where lifetime cycles reached up to 20 years, the world record being the famous "Centennial Lightbulb" in Livermore, CA in the US, which has been lit for over 100 years, it is certainly about time to rethink modern consumerism with regard to responsibility to future generations.
