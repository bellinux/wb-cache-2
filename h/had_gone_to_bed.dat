5|$|Five {{months after}} his wedding, on Sunday, 18 August 1850, Balzac died in the {{presence}} of his mother; Eve de Balzac (formerly Countess Hańska) <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> He had been visited that day by Victor Hugo, who later served as a pallbearer and the eulogist at Balzac's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Despite this he {{had neither}} an office nor office staff, {{dealing with all}} the {{correspondence}} himself. Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after {{the rest of his}} party <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Garran {{joked that}} the long work of the {{drafting}} committee breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working {{late into the night}} preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E
25|$|Hawtrey hit the {{headlines}} after his house caught fire on 5 August 1984. He <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> {{with a much}} younger man and had left a cigarette burning on his sofa. Newspaper photographs from the time show a fireman carrying an emotional, partially clothed and toupee-less Hawtrey down a ladder to safety.|$|E
25|$|Entwistle died in Room 658 at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 27 June 2002, one {{day before}} the {{scheduled}} first show of the Who's 2002 United States tour. He <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> that night with a stripper/groupie, who woke that morning to find Entwistle cold and unresponsive. The Clark County medical examiner determined that his death was due to a heart attack induced by a cocaine overdose. His funeral was held at St Edward's Church in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, England, on 10 July 2002. He was cremated and his ashes were buried privately. A memorial service was held on 24 October at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London. Entwistle's huge collection of guitars and basses was auctioned at Sotheby's in London by his son, Christopher, to meet anticipated taxes on his father's estate.|$|E

500|$|McClellan further damaged his {{reputation}} by his insulting insubordination to his commander-in-chief. He privately referred to Lincoln, {{whom he had}} known before the war as {{a lawyer for the}} Illinois Central, as [...] "nothing more than a well-meaning baboon", a [...] "gorilla", and [...] "ever unworthy of ... his high position." [...] On November 13, he snubbed the president, who had come to visit McClellan's house, by making him wait for 30 minutes, only to be told that the general <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and could not receive him.|$|E
500|$|As Titanic {{approached}} her fatal collision, most passengers <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and {{command of the}} bridge had passed from Second Officer Charles Lightoller to First Officer William Murdoch. Lookouts Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee were occupying the crow's nest, [...] above the deck. The air temperature had fallen to near freezing, and the ocean was completely calm. Colonel Archibald Gracie, one of {{the survivors of the}} disaster, later wrote that [...] "the sea was like glass, so smooth that the stars were clearly reflected." [...] It is now known that such exceptionally calm water is a sign of nearby pack ice.|$|E
500|$|At {{some time}} during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at his home ("Far Leys") in Tanworth-in-Arden, from an {{overdose}} of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was used to hearing him do this many times before but, during this instance, he {{did not make a}} sound. They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills [...] "to help him sleep".|$|E

500|$|He died {{suddenly}} {{at his home}} in Chichester on 28 February 1819. His obituary reported that he <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> [...] "in good health, and was seized by a spasmodic affectation in his chest, which terminated his existence at 8o'clock". The Naval Chronicle declared that Admiral Murray's [...] disposition is so gentle, and his manners are so mild, that but few men are equally well beloved in the navy; while few possess the facility of commanding with such ease, and, at the same time, with such energy and effect. His wife Ann outlived him by a considerable number of years. She died in Boulogne in 1859, at the age of 95.|$|E
500|$|In April 2008, {{the coroner}} {{recorded}} a verdict of [...] {{in relation to}} Collins. The {{cause of death was}} [...] "cocaine toxicity and immersion in hot water", according to the consultant pathologist. The inquest found that she had taken [...] "very significant" [...] amounts of cocaine with sleeping pills and vodka, and that she had suffered 60% burns to her body, including her tongue. The coroner noted that at some stage in the night after both Speight and Collins <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> Collins got up to have a bath. He said that it was [...] "more likely than not" [...] that a heart problem had caused Collins to fall unconscious while the hot tap was running. Following Collins's death, Speight moved in with Collins's mother.|$|E

2500|$|..... hailstones fell {{the size}} of golf-balls, and the trim field was swiftly reduced to a lake whereon floated the stumps. What was equally {{extraordinary}} was {{the strength of the}} tropical Queensland sun which next morning sucked away the moisture, so against all prediction, and thanks also to the sandy soil perfect for drainage, play was possible sharp at time. I recall broadcasting home from the ground... describing the scene of desolation with part of the playing arena still under a foot of water... English listeners who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with this comforting information had to be told when they woke up next morning that fifteen English wickets had fallen and the game was over.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of June 23, 1855, after {{the rest of his}} family <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> Robert Newsom came to Celia’s cabin, as he had told her he would. Celia made an attempt to reject his sexual advances, and when he refused to back down, she clubbed him over the head with the stick that she had brought into her cabin earlier that day. After she hit him the first time, he reached out his arms as if he was trying to grab her and she clubbed him a second time, killing him. She then moved his body into her {{fireplace}} and {{spent the rest of the}} night burning his remains. She crushed some of Newsom’s smaller bones with a rock, and hid the bones that were too big to crush “under the hearth, and under the floor between a sleeper and the fire-place.” The next morning, Celia enlisted the help of Newsom’s grandson, twelve-year-old Coffee Wainscott, in scattering the ashes of Robert Newsom. According to Coffee’s testimony, Celia told him “she would give [...] two dozen walnuts if [...] would carry the ashes out.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their father's death, their mother would slip into a deep depression and {{spend a lot of}} time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E
