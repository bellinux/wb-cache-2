30|$|Generally the {{behaviour}} {{of potassium}} (K+) {{is similar to}} the sodium content in the water but not found in the concentration as much as the sodium in groundwater. It maintains fluids in balance stage in the human body. In present investigation, potassium concentration ranged from 4 to 80  mg/l (Fig.  4 b) with an average value of 23.526. The permissible limit of potassium is 10  mg/l (BIS 1991) and in study area, 12 water sampling sites exceed the permissible limit. Thus, the excess amount of potassium present in the water sample may lead to nervous and digestive disorder (Tiwari and Mishra 1985). The higher values in the area may be contributed due to the effluent discharged by industries and <b>domestic</b> <b>sewages.</b> However, excessive fertilizer usage may also increase its concentration in groundwater.|$|R

25|$|Some {{industrial}} facilities generate ordinary <b>domestic</b> <b>sewage</b> {{that can be}} treated by municipal facilities. Industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of conventional pollutants (e.g. oil and grease), toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or other non-conventional pollutants such as ammonia, need specialized treatment systems. Some of these facilities can install a pre-treatment system to remove the toxic components, and then send the partially treated wastewater to the municipal system. Industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own complete on-site treatment systems. Some industries have been successful at redesigning their manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants, through a process called pollution prevention.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined {{secondary}} treatment {{based on the}} performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage. Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30mg/l BOD and less than 30mg/l suspended solids. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and {{secondary treatment}} is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from <b>domestic</b> <b>sewage.</b> The EPA regulations describe stabilization ponds as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from combined sewers, dilute industrial wastewater, or Infiltration/Inflow.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than <b>domestic</b> <b>sewage,</b> and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E

30|$|Nitrate {{concentrations}} vary between 4 and 243.7  mg L− 1 with {{an average}} concentration of 55.6  mg L− 1 (Fig.  8 j). Many parameters such {{as the amount of}} fertilizer used, surface water quality, land use type, depth of groundwater level, land drainage by the river and sediment type have resulted in variations of nitrate concentrations {{in different parts of the}} plain (Barzegar 2014). The lowest nitrate concentration is obtained from the northwest of the plain (sample 16) because of low agricultural activity, confined aquifers in these areas and fine-grained sediments in comparison with other parts of the area. The highest nitrate concentration (sample 29) is in the west of Tabriz city, which is attributed to urban and <b>domestic</b> <b>sewages</b> and dense farming in this area (Barzegar 2014). Nitrate concentration is much higher in the southern part of Aji-Chay River; it would be due to intensive agricultural activity, industrial concentration, type of aquifer and shallow groundwater. The presence of high nitrate concentration in the drinking water increases the incidence of gastric cancer and other potential hazards to infants and pregnant women (Nagireddi Srinivasa Rao 2006).|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{manipulating}} ionic conductivity (EC) to harvest the maximum electrical energy from seawater-based <b>domestic</b> wastewater <b>sewage</b> sludge (SWS), unique {{to only a}} few cities, through microbial fuel cell (MFC).

25|$|Policy {{concerning}} the prevention and reduction of eutrophication {{can be broken}} down into four sectors: Technologies, public participation, economic instruments, and cooperation. The term technology is used loosely, referring to a more widespread use of existing methods rather than an appropriation of new technologies. As mentioned before, nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication, and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced. Waste disposal technology constitutes another factor in eutrophication prevention. Because a major contributor to the nonpoint source nutrient loading of water bodies is untreated <b>domestic</b> <b>sewage,</b> it is necessary to provide treatment facilities to highly urbanized areas, particularly those in underdeveloped nations, in which treatment of domestic waste water is a scarcity. The technology to safely and efficiently reuse waste water, both from domestic and industrial sources, should be a primary concern for policy regarding eutrophication.|$|E
25|$|Standards are set {{for sewage}} sludge {{generated}} or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat <b>domestic</b> <b>sewage</b> and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.|$|E
