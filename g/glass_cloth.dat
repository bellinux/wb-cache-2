Phenolic sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of paper or <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> impregnated with synthetic resin. Cellulose paper, cotton fabrics, synthetic yarn fabrics, glass fabrics and unwoven fabrics are all possible materials used in lamination.

25|$|Ballistic panels, {{also called}} {{micrometeorite}} shielding, {{are incorporated into}} the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels depends on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS, a thin aluminium sheet is held apart from the hull and causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> over the top. It is about 50% {{less likely to be}} punctured, and crew move to the ROS when the station is under threat. Punctures on the ROS would be contained within the panels which are 70cm square.|$|E

50|$|The {{adhesive}} {{applied to}} a tape is often a critical determining factor for a given masking situation. There are three thin types of adhesives (with many chemical variations of each): rubber-based, acrylic-based, and silicone-based. Rubber-based adhesives generally provide the greatest adhesion, but the lowest temperature resistance. Acrylic-based adhesives offer a wide temperature range, providing adhesion from sub-freezing temperatures up to 275-325 °F (about 150 °C). Silicone-based adhesives provide the highest temperature resistance, with some tapes (such as some polyimide films and <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> tapes) allowing for intermittent use up to 500 °F (260 °C).|$|E
5000|$|Epoxy resin {{formulations}} {{are important}} in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, and insulators.

The largest volume type of circuit board—an [...] "FR-4 board"—is a sandwich of layers of <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin.

50|$|The MOMBA 2C had a pod and {{boom type}} fuselage. The pilot's seat was just {{forward of the}} wing leading edge, placing him in a {{reclining}} position under a long, single piece canopy, shaped from an uncut Slingsby Kestrel moulding. The cockpit had some unusual features, principally that access to it was by rolling the whole nosecone and canopy forwards along a rail from a join around the fuselage ahead of the wing. This provided an aerodynamically very clean and well sealed forward fuselage, as well as easy access for instrument panel servicing. The control column was side mounted on a raised side beam on the right; flap and undercarriage levers were similarly mounted on the other side. This arrangement avoided underfloor control cables, keeping the fuselage cross section low and simplifying the control linkages. The cockpit was narrow and low {{and would not have}} been comfortable for bigger pilots than Sunderland. The nosecone was skinned with <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> over balsa. Instrument panel, controls, seat and the retractable monowheel undercarriage were supported by a central, sturdy, sheet alloy frame linked to the wing. The fuselage tapered from the leading edge aft, an area covered <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> over PVC foam. Behind this the boom was a roughly oval metal tube, with flat top and bottom plates for ease of construction. Tail surfaces were all straight edged; the tall, metal skinned fin had a slightly swept GRP leading edge and carried a tapered, fabric covered rudder. The MOMBA 2C had a T-tail, with a metal surfaced, high aspect ratio, tapered tailplane and a plywood surfaced elevator. There was a small, semi-recessed tailwheel below the fin.|$|E
50|$|When {{constructed}} with plastic films instead of paper, masking tapes {{can be used}} for more rigorous applications. Polyester-based tapes are used to mask off during etching, plating, and in particular, powder coating. Tapes based on polyimide films can resist molten solder in electronics applications. <b>Glass</b> <b>cloth</b> tapes are often used in powder coating and sandblasting operations. Foil or vinyl tapes are often used in plating. Layered tapes made from multiple materials laminated together {{can be used for}} masking flame spray, thermal spray and HVOF. Masking tape {{can also be used to}} adhere posters to walls up to the day rating. Masking tape can basically be used for any purpose required of it, and is not limited solely to painting needs.|$|E
50|$|The MOBA 2C was {{of mixed}} construction. Its wing was in three sections, with a {{constant}} chord centre piece mounted {{high on the}} fuselage and straight tapered outer panels. It was built around a single metal, rectangular, PVC plastic foam filled box spar, with GRP/plywood sandwich ribs. The space between the ribs was also filled with PVC foam, which was then shaped to the Wortmann FX 67-K-150 section and covered with <b>glass</b> <b>cloth.</b> The outer panels carried long span ailerons and the inner sections full span, metal skinned flaps, which could be set at angles between +20° and -15°. They were lowered for landing, increasing lift at lower speed and acting as airbrakes. Aerodynamically, the wing was designed to operate at speed, a natural choice for soaring in Australia with its strong thermals and long inter-thermal distances.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decoration}} of churches {{was from the}} first {{an important part of}} the business. A great wave of church-building and remodelling by the Church of England in the 1840s and 1850s increased the demand for ecclesiastical {{decoration of}} all kinds, especially stained glass. But this market shrank in the general depression of the later 1860s, and the firm increasingly turned to secular commissions. [...] On its non-ecclesiastical side, the product line was extended to include, besides painted windows and mural decoration, furniture, metal and <b>glass</b> wares, <b>cloth</b> and paper wall-hangings, embroideries, jewellery, woven and knotted carpets, silk damasks, and tapestries.|$|R
40|$|During {{phenolic}} liner manufacture, resin-impregnated (pre-preg) {{bias tape}} of silica, <b>glass,</b> or carbon <b>cloth</b> is tape-wrapped, cured, machined, and then wiped with 1, 1, 1 tri-chloroethane (TCA) to remove contaminants {{that may have}} been introduced during machining and handling. Following the TCA wipe, the machined surface is given a resin wet-coat and over-wrapped with more prepreg and cured. A TCA replacement solvent for these wiping operations must effectively remove both surface contaminants, and sub-surface oils and greases while not compromising the integrity of this interface. Selection of a TCA replacement solvent for phenolic over-wrap interface cleaning began with sub-scale compatibility tests with cured phenolics. Additional compatibility tests included assessment of solvent retention in machined phenolic surfaces. Results from these tests showed that, while the candidate solvent did not degrade the cured phenolics, it was retained in higher concentrations than TCA in phenolic surfaces. This effect was most pronounced with <b>glass</b> and silica <b>cloth</b> phenolics with steep ply angles relative to the wiped surfaces...|$|R
