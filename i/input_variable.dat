That slot contains a block, and that block's position in its slot is determined by another block right next to it.

25|$|If the ordered pairs {{representing}} the original input function are equally spaced in their <b>input</b> <b>variable</b> (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform {{is known as}} a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of step size equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled for 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1Hz frequency spacing.|$|E

Neuronal tuning functions {{can be expressed}} by the conditional probability of observing a spike given any combination of <b>input</b> <b>variables.</b> However, accurately determining such probabilistic tuning functions from experimental data poses several challenges such as determining the neuronal latencies and finding the combination of <b>input</b> <b>variables</b> which is most related to neuronal activity. Our approach solves these issues by maximizing the mutual information between the probability distributions of spike occurrence and <b>input</b> <b>variables.</b> |$|R
