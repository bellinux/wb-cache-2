5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> woman rather than out of the picture, and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a couple on the table.|$|E

The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} between {{interior and exterior}} - and between structure and image - was to be developed very purposefully in the Renaissance and beyond, especially once the dome became reinstated in the Western tradition as {{a key element in}} church design. Michelangelo's dome for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by Giacomo della Porta, for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural. Baltasar Neumann, in his baroque churches, perfected light-weight plaster vaults supported by wooden frames. These vaults, which exerted no lateral pressures, were perfectly suited for elaborate ceiling frescoes. In St Paul's Cathedral in London there is a highly complex system of vaults and faux-vaults. The dome that one sees from the outside is not a vault, but a relatively light-weight wooden-framed structure resting on an invisible - and for its age highly original - catenary vault of brick, below which is another dome, (the dome that one sees from the inside), but of plaster supported by a wood frame. From the inside, one can easily assume that one <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same vault that one sees from the outside.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} shows Eakins {{and five}} friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each {{of the men}} <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water, {{in the words of}} Martin A. Berger, [...] "apparently lost in a contemplative moment". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c.1865– c.1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c.1880–90), George Reynolds (c.1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.|$|E
500|$|In April 2012, Susan {{starts to}} {{struggle}} with her MS again, following her split from Karl and her promotion to editor of the Erinsborough News. Jackie Brygel of TV Week said Susan {{has a lot to}} prove with Paul breathing down her neck, but her new role puts her health in jeopardy when she begins displaying signs of an MS relapse. Woodburne explained [...] "She's working 24 hours a day {{to try to get the}} paper to take on a different form and is running herself into the ground. She's unable to stop the trembling in her hand, is quite dizzy and her vision becomes blurred - all indications of an MS relapse, which would be her worst nightmare." [...] Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported Susan refuses to turn to Karl, who always helped her with an episode, and instead she relies on help from Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber). Woodburne revealed Karl asks Susan to slow down, but she ignores him. The actress said Karl <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> situation from the perspective of an ex-husband who has feelings for her, but also as a doctor. Susan finds herself unable to do the housework, but Rhys understands that she wants to keep her independence. A spokesperson told Hill [...] "She always knew it was going to be hard living alone but Karl is the last person she wants to turn to. She doesn't want to admit she needs him but she does. In the end she confides in Dr Rhys." ...|$|E

2500|$|By early 1975 Genie showed {{comprehension}} of simple and complex sentences where {{the object was}} the relative clause, such as [...] "The boy <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl who is frowning", or sentences where the subject was the relative clause and did not end in a noun phrase, such as [...] "The boy who is frowning <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl". However, when interpreting a complex sentence in which a relative clause ending in a noun phrase came before the main verb, such as [...] "The boy who <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl is frowning", she interpreted the noun closest to the verb as the subject. The scientists wrote that this meant that she was using a word order strategy, which they considered progress because her earlier responses to them were clearly guesses. By this time Genie could only consistently count as high as 7 in sequential order, which came {{at the expense of}} her ability to do so via gestalt perception.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2014, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a {{contract}} to study the feasibility of building the SR-72's propulsion system using existing turbine engine technologies. [...] The $892,292 contract funds a design study to determine the viability of a TBCC propulsion system by combining one of several current turbine engines, with a very low Mach ignition Dual Mode Ramjet (DMRJ). [...] NASA previously funded a Lockheed Martin study that found speeds up to Mach 7 could be achieved with a dual-mode engine combining turbine and ramjet technologies. [...] The problem with hypersonic propulsion {{has always been the}} gap between the highest speed capabilities of a turbojet, from around Mach 2.2 to the lowest speed of a ramjet at Mach 4. Typical turbine engines cannot achieve high enough speeds for a ramjet to take over and continue accelerating. [...] The NASA-Lockheed Martin study <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a higher-speed turbine engine or a ramjet that can function in a turbine engine's slower flight envelope; the DARPA HTV-3X had demonstrated a low-speed ramjet that could operate below Mach 3. [...] Existing turbofan engines powering jet fighters and other experimental designs are being considered for modification. [...] If the study is successful, NASA will fund a demonstrator to test the DMRJ in a flight research vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The first sound {{adaptation}} of the play was in 1929; Sam Taylor's The Taming of the Shrew, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (the first sound {{adaptation of}} any Shakespeare play). This version was simultaneously shot as a silent film, and, depending on whether a given theatre was equipped to screen sound films, was released both as a [...] "talkie" [...] and a silent. Using only 500 lines from the original play, and a few lines from David Garrick's 1754 adaptation of Shrew, Catharine and Petruchio, the film is primarily known for how Pickford delivers Katherina's last speech. As she moves though the litany of reasons why a woman should obey her husband, she winks toward Bianca (Dorothea Jordan), unseen by Petruchio. Bianca smiles in silent communication with Katherina, thus acknowledging that Katherina has not been tamed at all. The film opens with a Punch and Judy puppet show which several critics have argued performs a similar function to the Christopher Sly Induction in the original play, but also works to instill a sense of false anticipation in the audience; the puppet show ends with Judy sinking lovingly into Punch's arms after he beats her. In the film, Katherina never sinks into Petruchio's arms. Indeed, Pickford's Katherina is much more resistant than in many stage versions; there is an extended scene of her wrecking Baptista's home, she only agrees to marry Petruchio when he stands on her foot and her scream is taken by the priest as consent, when she falls in the mud {{on the way to}} Petruchio's house, he offers to help but she refuses, she rejects meat at the dinner table rather than being tempted by it. Most significantly, when Petruchio outlines his plan to tame her [...] "with kindness" [...] (4.1.195), which is usually a soliloquy, Katherina hears him. She then proceeds to 'out-tame' him; when he messes up the bed clothes, she overturns the entire mattress, sparking a game of one-upmanship which ends when she flings a stool at him and knocks him out. The conversation about the sun and moon, so often seen as a pivotal turning point in the taming is then delivered with a befuddled Petruchio apparently genuinely unsure whether he <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun or the moon, and a worried Katherina trying to placate him. This is immediately followed by her 'submission' speech, and her wink. Elizabeth Schafer believes this is a Katherina that has not been tamed; [...] "unlike Shakespeare's Katherina, Pickford's Katherina knows what Petruchio is trying to do in taming her and she responds to this tactically and successfully. Her surpassing of Petruchio's outrageous behaviour leaves him nonplussed and concussed." [...] However, Pickford herself was unhappy with the film, and with how Taylor had directed her. In her autobiography, she wrote she wanted to play Katherina as a ferocious woman, but Taylor told her [...] "We don't want any of that heavy stage drama; we want the old Pickford tricks." [...] Pickford said of her performance, [...] "Instead of being a forceful tiger-cat, I was a spitting little kitten." ...|$|E
