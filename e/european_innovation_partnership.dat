40|$|Purpose: We {{investigate}} how the structural conditions of eight different <b>European</b> agricultural <b>innovation</b> systems can facilitate or hinder collaboration and social learning in multidisciplinary innovation networks. Methodology: We have adapted the Innovation System Failure Matrix {{to investigate the}} main barriers and enablers eight countries (England, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, The Netherlands and Switzerland). Findings: Results show {{some of the recent}} trends the AKS actors in these countries have experienced and how these have affected their potential to act as collaborators in multidisciplinary innovation networks. Lack of funds, combined with horizontal and vertical fragmentation and the lack of proper evaluation criteria for collaborative innovation networks are among the most important threats we found. Practical Implications: This study shows that each national AIS has some unique features. This means that the implementation of policies promoting collaboration and social learning (e. g. the <b>European</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Partnerships</b> and Operational Groups) should depend on a critical reflection of the existing structural elements of the AIS in each country and whether {{there is a need for}} inclusion of new actors, or whether certain innovations for collective goods should be promoted. Originality: The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion in the scientific literature on the advantages and disadvantages of privatization of extension and advisory services and the shift from thinking in terms of the traditional Agricultural Knowledge System towards a broader Agricultural Innovation System...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{respiratory}} diseases (CRDs) {{are major}} non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that induce a significant burden. Asthma often occurs along {{the life cycle}} from early childhood, affecting 30 million children and adults under 45  years of age in Europe. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has an estimated annual death rate of over 3 million people globally. The annual direct and indirect costs in the 28 European Union (EU) countries due to COPD or asthma are estimated at 48 billion euros and 34 billion euros respectively. Rhinitis occurs in over 100 million people in Europe, and indirect costs are enormous. Asthma is a common risk factor for COPD. CRDs impact ageing and should be prevented, recognised and managed across the life cycle to promote {{active and healthy ageing}} (AHA). There is an urgent need to act globally. <b>European</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Partnerships</b> (EIPs) aim to enhance EU competitiveness and tackle societal challenges through research and innovation. To tackle the potential of ageing in the EU, the European Commission, within its Innovation Union policy, launched the EIP on AHA (between the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG Santé) and Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT)). The B 3 Action Plan promotes integrated care models for chronic diseases, including the use of remote monitoring. The initiative AIRWAYS-ICPs (integrated care pathways for airway diseases) has been approved by the EIP on AHA as the model of chronic diseases of the B 3 Action Plan. It is a Research Demonstration Project of the World Health Organization's Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD). AIRWAYS-ICPs was initiated in 2013 by the WHO Collaborating Centre of Montpellier and the EIP on AHA Reference Site MACVIA-LR (Contre les MAladies Chroniques Pour un Vieillissement Actif en Languedoc-Roussillon, France) led by the Région Languedoc-Roussillon (France).

40|$|Editorial to the Special Issue on "Learning and Innovation Networks for Sustainable Agriculture: Processes of Co-evolution, Joint Reflection and Facilitation". There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} that the technological and organizational solutions the agricultural sector has undertaken in the past are not always compatible with the constraints and opportunities that the rural economy and society will face in the next future. This has generated an increased emphasis on transition towards new business, technological and policy models that address the challenge of sustainability. Innovation is key to transition, but the institutions that are charged with fostering innovation are often locked into old approaches and methods of intervention. The linear view of knowledge transfer as a top-down process from research to advice and practice is still predominant. Increasingly, this view is challenged and partly replaced by systems approaches in which agricultural producers are seen as important actors, rather than merely consumers of technologies that are generated by agricultural {{research and development and}} transferred by extension services for subsequent adoption. Such a systems approach has been discussed and further developed in this Journal (see e. g. the special issue 2014 (3) edited by Koutsouris and Cristovao; and Knickel et al. 2009) and in other publications, including Röling and Engel 1991; Hall et al. 2003; Sumberg and Reece 2004. The systems approach has also inspired a recent document of the EU Standing Committee of Agricultural Research (EU SCAR 2013) and many of the aspects of this approach {{can be found in the}} recent <b>European</b> <b>Innovation</b> <b>Partnerships</b> policy (EU Commission 2010). This special issue synthesizes the findings of the three year European funded research project SOLINSA ‘Agricultural Knowledge Systems in Transition: Towards a more effective and efficient support of Learning and Innovation Networks for Sustainable Agriculture’ (GA No. 266306). The special issue assembles papers that explore new ways of learning and knowledge co-production for sustainable agriculture and rural development and critically reflect the role of research and policy for supporting sustainable innovation in rural Europe. In particular, it discusses the institutional aspects of joint learning and reflection in what has been coined as Learning and Innovation Networks for Sustainable Agriculture or LINSA, and how joint learning and innovation in these LINSA has actually been supported and can be supported to further enhance sustainability...|$|R
