A lower ratio of government consumption spending to GDP would also increase the output of the selected economies. Hence, fiscal prudence is needed, and the conventional approach of real depreciation to stimulate exports and raise real output does not apply to the selected Southeast Europe economies. When private household consumption is employed in the model, the coefficient on government spending to nominal GDP is insignificant implying that Ricardian equivalence does hold for the selected countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{taxation}} on output volatility in OECD countries {{to shed light on}} the sources of observed heterogeneity over time and across countries. To this end, we derive tax effects on macro aggregates in a stochastic neoclassical model. As a result, taxes are shown to affect the second moment of <b>output</b> growth <b>rates</b> without (long-run) effects on the first moment. Taking the model to the data, we exploit observed heterogeneity patterns to estimate effects of tax rates on macro volatility using panel estimation, explicitly modeling the unobserved variance process. We find a strong empirical link between <b>effective</b> tax <b>rates</b> and <b>output</b> volatility, with some evidence of a cointegrating relationship. In accordance with theory, taxes on labor income and corporate income empirically are found to be negatively related to volatility of macro aggregates whereas the capital tax ratio has positive effects.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityWomen who are {{interested}} in controlling the timing of their pregnancies have many birth control and family planning options. The majority of women use exogenous forms of contraception, including oral contraceptive pills, hormone shots or patches, intra-uterine devices, or barriers such as condoms, sponges or diaphragms. Many of the exogenous methods have negative side effects including allergic reactions and increased risk of blood clotting, and cancer. Additionally, there can be religious objections to these methods. In an attempt to provide women other, natural, birth control options, an array of methods have been developed over time using knowledge of a woman's menstrual cycle. These methods are referred to as fertility awareness based methods because they track various symptoms of a woman's menstrual cycle to determine when she is fertile. Changes in the cervix, cervical mucus secretions, and basal body temperature indicate the fertile window when a woman is most likely to get pregnant. To avoid pregnancy, women using fertility awareness based methods abstain from unprotected intercourse during their fertile windows. Using cycle length and observed physical changes, six methods have been developed. The goal of this thesis is to review and compare the methods. Of the developed methods, the Standard Days method is a calendar method with an average method <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 95 % and an average typical-use <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 88 %. The Billings Ovulation method, a cervical mucus only method, has an average method <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 98. 5 % and an average typical-use <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 82 %. The Creighton Model of Fertility Care System, also a cervical mucus only method, has an average method <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 99 % and an average typical-use <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 87 %. A simpler, cervical mucus only method is the TwoDay method which has an average method <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 96 % and a typical-use <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> of 91 %, higher than the other cervical mucus methods, likely due to its ease of use. The symptothermal method uses a combination of symptoms to create a double-check system for entering and exiting the fertile window. The method <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> is the highest at 99. 5 % and the average typical-use <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> is 95 %. This method is the most effective, but also the most difficult to learn. Finally, the Marquette Model uses cervical mucus and an electronic fertility monitor to indicate the fertile window. The average method <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> is 97. 8 % and the average typical-use <b>effective</b> <b>rate</b> is 83 %. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
