This was in part due to major exports to Australia starting in the 1880s. The carpenter shop was destroyed in a fire in 1897 and never rebuilt.|$|E
500|$|Because Great Southern was {{involved}} in a controversial industry, it figured in policy debates throughout its life as a publicly listed company. At the centre of Great Southern's business was the development of new <b>forest</b> <b>estates</b> for commercial harvest. Australia's state and federal governments had agreed in 1992 to a National Forest Policy Statement, which included the goal of expanding Australia's plantation forests. On this foundation, in July 1996, the federal forests minister and his state and territory counterparts met and [...] "endorsed the plantation industry's target of trebling the plantation estate from 1.1 million hectares to 3million hectares by the year 2020". In October 1997 governments, the Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council, the Australian Forest Growers, and the National Association of Forest Industries, jointly released Plantations for Australia: The 2020 Vision, known as [...] "Plantations 2020".|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to civilizations in relatively arid regions (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt), the Greeks, Romans, Celts, Britons, and Gauls all {{had access to}} forests suitable for using as fuel. Over the centuries there was a partial deforestation of climax forests {{and the evolution of}} the remainder to coppice with standards woodland as the primary source of wood fuel. These woodlands involved a continuous cycle of new stems harvested from old stumps, on rotations between seven and thirty years. One of the earliest printed books on woodland management, in English, was John Evelyn's [...] "Sylva, or a discourse on forest trees" [...] (1664) advising landowners on the proper management of <b>forest</b> <b>estates.</b> H. L. Edlin, in [...] "Woodland Crafts in Britain", 1949 outlines the extraordinary techniques employed, and range of wood products that have been produced from these managed forests since pre-Roman times. And throughout this time the preferred form of wood fuel was the branches of cut coppice stems bundled into faggots. Larger, bent or deformed stems that were of no other use to the woodland craftsmen were converted to the end of World War two. Since then much of these woodlands have been converted to broadscale agriculture. Total demand for fuel increased considerably with the industrial revolution but most of this increased demand was met by the new fuel source coal, which was more compact and more suited to the larger scale of the new industries.|$|E

40|$|Estimates of the {{economic}} benefit ofbiosecurity and forest health research to the New Zealand forest-growing industry and urban <b>forest</b> <b>estate</b> were made using cost-benefit analysis. The cost associated {{with the arrival of}} exotic forest pests was the sum of costs of eradication and control programmes, reduced harvest value, household expenditures to control the exotic pest, and replacement of affected trees in the urban forest. The expected cost associated with each of these was dependent on the likelihood of pest arrival, detection, eradication, and successful control, and the effect of research on these. Depending on the assumed efficacy of the research, the net present benefit of the $ 3. 5 million annual research cost ranged from $ 3, 519 million to $ 5, 888 million, so there is considerable benefit to the New Zealand forest-growing industry and urban <b>forest</b> <b>estate</b> from biosecurity and forest health research. Sensitivity analysis showed benefits of research to be most sensitive to the estimate {{of the value of the}} urban <b>forest</b> <b>estate...</b>|$|R
