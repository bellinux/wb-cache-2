5000|$|Generally, {{an escape}} {{character}} {{is not a}} particular case of (<b>device)</b> <b>control</b> <b>characters,</b> nor vice versa. If we define <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> as non-graphic, or as having a special meaning for an output device (e.g. printer or text terminal) then any escape character for this <b>device</b> is a <b>control</b> one. But escape characters used in programming (such as the backslash, [...] "\") are graphic, hence are not <b>control</b> <b>characters.</b> Conversely most (but not all) of the ASCII [...] "control characters" [...] have some control function in isolation, therefore are not escape characters.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>device</b> <b>control</b> codes (DC1 to DC4) were {{originally}} generic, {{to be implemented}} as necessary by each device. However, a universal need in data transmission is to request the sender to stop transmitting when a receiver can't take more data right now. Digital Equipment Corporation invented a convention which used 19, (the <b>device</b> <b>control</b> 3 <b>character</b> (DC3), also known as control-S, or XOFF) to [...] "S"top transmission, and 17, (the <b>device</b> <b>control</b> 1 <b>character</b> (DC1), a.k.a. control-Q, or XON) to start transmission. It has become so widely used that most don't realize it {{is not part of}} official ASCII. This technique, however implemented, avoids additional wires in the data cable devoted only to transmission management, which saves money. A sensible protocol for the use of such transmission flow control signals must be used, to avoid potential deadlock conditions, however.|$|R

40|$|<b>Controlling</b> {{a virtual}} <b>character</b> {{with a pen}} input device is difficult. Pen input devices require {{freeform}} gestures and users are not confined to particular mapping of a key or a button that is exactly repeatable. This is a problem since an intuitive motion gesture for one user might not be intuitive for another user. In this paper, we explore user preferred input gestures for <b>character</b> <b>control</b> through user experiments. Most previous pen input gesture sets {{are based on the}} preference of the developer. Our goal is to try to find common pen gesture features for common commands through user experiments. For our experiment, we have chosen navigational motions that are common for <b>controlling</b> a <b>character</b> in a virtual world. The users were asked to make gestures for a set of navigational motions according to their intuition. We then analyzed the gesture data and outlined some gesture design guidelines as well as compared the resulting gestures to those used in existing applications that use pen <b>devices</b> for <b>character</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{fundamental}} part {{of university}} education creates {{a connection between}} the theoretical or simulation approaches of experimental methods for verifying the coincidence of laboratory stands. An illustration of practical physical model properties is of cardinal importance for experimental engineering exercises, for comparing computer simulation tasks with practical experience and with real-time measured signals from technological aggregates. This paper deals with the important role laboratory experimental stands play with microcomputers for quality control engineering education and the design and verification of new control algorithms. At the Department of CSI VŠB-TU FME Ostrava a HAA 2005 model (Hot-Air Aggregate) of climate unit with two controlled variables (temperature, air flow) was designed and produced. The HAA model, as an air tool (air-conditioning), is a dynamic system with multiple inputs and outputs. Experimental laboratory models allow us to easily understand the principles of the aggregate parts, measurement and <b>control</b> <b>devices,</b> signal <b>character,</b> noise, dynamic responses and to cross over easier to real technological systems.

40|$|A Dialogue of Forms is an {{investigation}} of typeface design tools and processes. The aim of this investigation is to develop techniques of deriving letterforms automatically from a subset of letters called the <b>control</b> <b>characters.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> are representative letters that contain the primary structural elements, design attributes, and proportional rela-tionships that characterize a typeface. Design information derived from the <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> is used to constrain the design of other letterforms. The lower case letters o, h, v, and p are the <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> studied in this investigation. The <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> are interactively created and edited by the designer, and stored as sets of primitive parts. These parts are used as building blocks to construct other letters automatically. Knowledge about letterform structure and font design consistency is represented and used to manage the derivation process. Generated designs may be edited by the designer and changes to parts can be propagated. Automatic letterform derivation can aid the designer by reducing time consuming labor...|$|R
