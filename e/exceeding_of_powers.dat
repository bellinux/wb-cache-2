5000|$|The {{provisions}} of the Act of 1820, known as the Missouri Compromise, were voided as a legislative act, since the act <b>exceeded</b> the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> Congress, insofar as it attempted to exclude slavery and impart freedom and citizenship to non-white persons {{in the northern part}} of the Louisiana Purchase.|$|R
30|$|If {{the total}} amount of fans’ energy {{absorption}} <b>exceeds</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> 60  W, the use of the heat recovery exchanger could be no more advisable. With reference to the case treated here, a weak energy gain occurs and it is more pronounced when the HR efficiency is equal to 0.6.|$|R
50|$|The {{validity}} of his acceptance {{on behalf of}} the Tibetan government has been questioned. The Tibetan exiled community claims that his signature of the Agreement was obtained under duress, and that, as only the governor of Chamdo, signature <b>of</b> the agreement <b>exceeded</b> his <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> representation and is therefore invalid.|$|R
50|$|In the past, the {{subthreshold}} conduction of transistors has {{usually been}} very small in the off state, as gate voltage could be significantly below threshold; but as voltages have been scaled down with transistor size, subthreshold conduction {{has become a}} bigger factor. Indeed, leakage from all sources has increased: for a technology generation with threshold voltage of 0.2 V, leakage can <b>exceed</b> 50% <b>of</b> total <b>power</b> consumption.|$|R
40|$|From voltage {{stability}} {{point of}} view, maximum permissible loading limits {{must not be}} <b>exceeded</b> in operation <b>of</b> <b>power</b> systems. In this study, a maximum power transfer phasor diagram is proposed for easy evaluation the relations between major parameters affecting voltage stability margins. In construction of that diagram, local bus measurements and estimated parameters of Thevenin equivalent for N-bus power system are used. Critical values for major parameters and a voltage stability margin are evaluated from the constructed phasor diagram...|$|R
5000|$|Hybrid velomobiles can {{use both}} human power and {{assistance}} by an electric motor. [...] Many in the velomobile community {{expect that the}} assistance from an electric motor will not <b>exceed</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the human rider, that is a 1:1 ratio. Velomobiles exceeding this ratio are {{often referred to as}} a pedelecs. or e-bikes. Small three- and four-wheeled motor vehicles are called microcars.|$|R
50|$|Romain Grosjean {{received}} a cumulative series <b>of</b> penalties for <b>exceeding</b> his quota <b>of</b> <b>power</b> unit components, totalling a twenty-place grid penalty. With Grosjean qualifying sixteenth—before Red Bull were excluded—he {{was unable to}} serve the full penalty. However, as the race marked the final Grand Prix of the 2014 season, the stewards were unable to carry the penalty over to the 2015 Australian Grand Prix, and so Grosjean was given a pit lane drive-through penalty {{in lieu of the}} remaining grid penalty.|$|R
50|$|The thinned array curse {{means that}} while {{synthesized}} apertures {{are useful for}} receivers with high angular resolution, they are not useful for power transmitters. It also means that if a filled array transmitter has gaps between individual elements, the main lobe of the beam will lose an amount <b>of</b> <b>power</b> proportional {{to the area of}} the gaps. Likewise, if a transmitter comprises multiple individual transmitters, some of which fail, the power lost from the main lobe will <b>exceed</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the lost transmitter, because power will be also be diverted into the side lobes.|$|R
40|$|The Administrative law of August 14, 1938 has {{organized}} the local public government by the principles ofstrict centralism meant {{to give the}} Government a full control over local communities. By this law were established thelands whose existence was justified {{by the fact that}} they, being strong administrative bodies, are is considered to entail:personal spending economy and possibilities of large administrative achievements, <b>exceeding</b> the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> counties...|$|R
5000|$|On February 13, 2006, the American Bar Association (ABA) {{denounced the}} warrantless {{domestic}} surveillance program, accusing the President <b>of</b> <b>exceeding</b> his <b>powers</b> under the Constitution. The ABA also formulated a policy opposing any future government use of electronic surveillance in the United States for foreign intelligence purposes without obtaining warrants from a special secret court {{as required by}} the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove that for each k, the {{expressive}} <b>power</b> <b>of</b> k–ary fixed–point logic, i. e. the fragment of fixed–point logic whose fixed–point operators {{are restricted to}} arity ≤ k, strictly <b>exceeds</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> (k − 1) –ary fixed–point logic. This solves a problem that was posed by Chandra and Harel in 1982. Our proof has a rather general form that applies to several variants of fixed–point logic and also to transitive–closure logic...|$|R
50|$|Several natural {{complexity}} {{classes are}} known to be low for themselves. Such a class is sometimes called self-low. Scott Aaronson calls such a class a physical complexity class. Note that being self-low is a stronger condition than being closed under complement. Informally, a class being low for itself means a problem can use others problems in the class as unit-cost subroutines without <b>exceeding</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the complexity class.|$|R
40|$|DE 19848636 A UPAB: 20000712 NOVELTY - The {{discharge}} current and/or voltage {{of each of}} two half-waves within a period of the AC voltage discharge is measured, {{and the difference between}} the measured values for the second half-wave and those for the first half-wave are compared with tolerance standards. If the tolerance standards are <b>exceeded,</b> the supply <b>of</b> <b>power</b> is reduced so the discharge momentarily extinguishes. USE - For sputter coating apparatus. ADVANTAGE - Safely prevents the discharge state from progressing from abnormal glow discharge to arc discharge...|$|R
50|$|Overload {{protection}} {{protects the}} cable from excess current. The protective device will automatically switch {{off when the}} devices plugged into it are drawing more power than the strip is rated to supply. For example, the standard rating for overload protected power strips is 2400W in Australia, so <b>exceeding</b> that amount <b>of</b> <b>power</b> will make the circuit breaker trip. Power strips offering only overload protection generally {{do not have a}} power light, but they do have a reset switch, which is used to return the strip to service after an overload has caused it to trip.|$|R
50|$|Venezuela {{formally}} {{raised the}} issue again at an international level before the United Nations in 1962, four years before Guyana won independence from Britain. Venezuela cited the alleged Russia-UK deal noted above as an offence of collusion, {{as well as several}} improprieties and vices in the ruling, especially Ultra Vires, {{due to the fact that}} the referees drew the border between British Guiana, Brazil and Suriname, and also decreed freedom of navigation in the Amacuro and Barima rivers, <b>exceeding</b> the scope <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> granted by the arbitration treaty, in 1897.|$|R
60|$|Much time, {{and some}} trouble were {{expended}} before the whole party were, {{to the great}} joy of Caesar, comfortably arranged around the table, with proper attention to all points of etiquette and precedence.

25|$|Chief Justice John Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito {{joined the}} majority. Justices Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter, and Breyer dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court {{abortion}} precedent, and also offering an equality-based justification for abortion precedent. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey should be reversed, and also {{noting that the}} Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act possibly <b>exceeded</b> the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> Congress under the Commerce Clause.|$|R

50|$|SMECO {{has filed}} a {{complaint}} with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), alleging that the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) coerced utilities into purchasing excess solar power generated by the state's community solar program at much higher retail rates rather than paying the amount it would have cost these utilities to create the power themselves, also known as the avoided cost. This would be in violation with the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which establishes that any payment given to such qualifying power plants equate the utility's avoided cost. In addition, PURPA mandates that these plants do not <b>exceed</b> 80 MW <b>of</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R
