Using a new regional data base for the period 1988 - 2002, we examine the time lags involved in the relationship. We also investigate whether the relationship differs by sector and by degree of urbanization. We find that the maximum effect of new businesses on regional development is reached after about 6 years. Our results also suggest that the overall <b>employment</b> <b>impact</b> of new-firm start-ups is positive but that the immediate employment effects may be small in The Netherlands.

40|$|Most non-survey {{methods of}} {{estimating}} single-region multipliers {{have been shown}} to produce a systematic upward bias, unless a considerable amount of "superior" data is added. Here it is argued that this conclusion does not need to apply to the case of a non-survey, spatial disaggregation of multipliers. The method proposed consists of four steps with two substantive formulas. The first secures the non-survey interpolation of the lacking intra-regional multipliers for the smaller regions by means of regression. The second secures the non-survey spatial disaggregation of the inter-regional spill-overs by means of second-order distance decays. The method is illustrated numerically by means of the interpolation and disaggregation of the 2 x 14 Type II biregional employment multipliers for aggregate Dutch regions into one 40 x 40 <b>inter-regional</b> <b>employment</b> multiplier matrix for the Netherlands as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Business {{incentive}} policies, {{over the}} past decades, have become popular tools to boost local economic development, employment and firm innovation outcomes, both in Italy and in the EU. Despite the increasing importance of these policies, as of today, a small body of empirical evidence is available on their actual <b>employment</b> <b>impact,</b> retrieved against a credible counterfactual estimate. This paper exploits a firm-level data base of unusual richness, formed by merging longitudinal employment and firm demographic information with the firm-level archives of all incentive payments performed by each of the many different (national, regional and EU co-sponsored) business incentive programs assisting firms located in a large Northern Italian region. The analysis developed in the paper yield the <b>employment</b> <b>impacts</b> of the policies under plausible identification assumptions, disentangling the <b>employment</b> <b>impacts</b> of different values of both the economic intensities of the program assistance and different forms of assistance (the latter distinguishing between capital grants and below-market interest rate/revolving loans). ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the development of procedures which provide useful information to decision-makers and affected people regarding the national income and <b>employment</b> <b>impacts</b> of railroad branch line abandonment. There are three major parts to this paper. The first part probes the underlying assumptions of public investment analysis. It is noted that non-Pareto optimal welfare changes occur whether or not abandonment takes place. The decision of whether or not to subsidize branch lines is based on the decision-makers' evaluation of certain important consequences, expressed in terms of criterion variables. It is argued that analyses should provide information regarding criterion variables to which decision-makers can assign values in the ultimate abandonment decision. The second part presents a conceptual approach within which two criterion variables -national income and employment impacts-can be isolated. National income impacts are composed of changes in the amount of resources devoted to transport cost and changes in output. <b>Employment</b> <b>impacts</b> are examined in the dimensions of occupational groups and geographical areas. The last part applies the conceptual approach by estimating and displaying national income and <b>employment</b> <b>impacts</b> for four connecting branch lines in Michigan.

Section 1820, “Overall Employment in a Hydrogen Economy,” requires the Secretary of Energy to carry out a study of the effects of a transition to a hydrogen economy on several employment [types] in the United States. As required by Section 1820, the present report considers: • Replacement effects of new goods and services • International competition • Workforce training requirements • Multiple possible fuel cycles, including usage of raw materials • Rates of market penetration of technologies • Regional variations based on geography • Specific recommendations of the study Both the Administration’s National Energy Policy and the Department’s Strategic Plan call for reducing U.
