Questions remain {{as to the}} variation of skid resistance with thin water films and the transition between the dry state and the so-called “damp” or “humid” state at which the skid resistance drop can {{be as high as}} 30 - 40 %.

40|$|Abstract In {{the arid}} and {{semi-arid}} regions, closed lakes are extensively used {{to satisfy the}} high water demands that threats their existence. The Bakhtegan lake is considered {{as one of the}} biggest lakes in Iran and has been drying out in the past years due to intensive irrigation in that region. The multiple modifications applied to the Kor river feeding Bakhtegan has affected the lake water intake drastically where the lake dries out completely during the irrigation season and hot summer days. The river inflow data has been missing between the years 1984 and 1997 due to the destruction of the closest gauge stations which was installed above the lake. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the flow data during this period by combining water balance simulation and remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing has been considered as a very efficient tool in analyzing water features for many water resources engineering applications. Based on the remotely sensed images of Bakhtegan and the water balance equation for the period (1998 – 2000), we obtained all components of effective parameters of water balance equation (all inflow, e. g., river inflow, rainfall and outflow, e. g., evaporation) and consequently the area-volume <b>depth</b> <b>curve</b> of the lake was developed. The water balance simulation based on the developed area-volume <b>depth</b> <b>curve</b> was validated for the period (2001 – 2003) that we had real hydrological and climate data.

The main objectives are the estimation of local water depths trapped at the tire/road interface and the definition of a critical water depth which can be used for driver assistance and information systems. Tests are performed in laboratory. Specimens are slabs made of asphalt concrete and mosaics composed of coarse aggregates. The aggregate mosaics are sandblasted to simulate different microtexture levels. Friction is measured by the Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) machine at various speeds ranging between 20 km/h and 80 km/h. Microtexture profiles are measured by laser sensors. It was found that the friction-water <b>depth</b> <b>curves</b> have an inverse-S shape and present an initial constantfriction part before decreasing to a minimum value.
