5|$|In 1767 Pennant {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} the Royal Society. About this time he met the much-travelled Sir Joseph Banks and visited him at his home in Lincolnshire. Banks {{presented}} him with the skin of a new species of penguin recently brought back from the Falkland Islands. Pennant wrote an account of this bird, the <b>king</b> <b>penguin</b> (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and all the other known species of penguin which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo's long {{association}} with penguins began in January 1914, {{with the arrival}} of three king penguins from the Christian Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching of a <b>king</b> <b>penguin</b> chick in 1919 was the first penguin to be hatched in captivity. These were the first penguins to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily penguin parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This proved so popular with visitors and the penguins that it is a daily feature of the zoo today.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 the zoo gained {{yet more}} {{military}} credentials when <b>king</b> <b>penguin</b> Nils Olav {{was adopted by}} the Norwegian King's Guard. Norway's connection with Edinburgh's penguins began with the Salvesen family's links to the zoo, and renewed interest was sparked when a lieutenant called Nils Egelien visited the zoo with the King's Guard in 1961. On his return in 1972 Egelien arranged for the unit to adopt one of the penguins. Nils Olav was named after Egelien and in honour of King Olav V of Norway, and given the rank of lance corporal. A statue of the penguin now stands outside the zoo.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to the zoological society's {{connection}} with the Salvesen family, some of the zoo's first animals were three king penguins, arriving from South Georgia with a Christian Salvesen whaling expedition that docked in Leith in early 1914. They were the first penguins to be seen {{anywhere in the world}} outside of the South Atlantic. The zoo successfully hatched the first ever captive <b>king</b> <b>penguin</b> chick in 1919. Penguins continued to arrive with whaling ships for years afterwards. Today, king penguins are perhaps the zoo's most famous animals.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{similarly}} coloured but smaller <b>king</b> <b>penguin</b> (A. patagonicus), the emperor penguin {{is one of}} two extant species in the genus Aptenodytes. Fossil evidence of a third species—Ridgen's penguin (A. ridgeni)—has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40million years ago.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSince fasting <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> (Aptenodytes patagonicus) need to {{conserve}} energy, {{it is possible}} that they exhibit particularly low metabolic rates during periods of rest. We investigated the behavioural and physiological aspects of periods of minimum metabolic rate in <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> under different circumstances. Heart rate (fH) measurements were recorded to estimate rate of oxygen consumption during periods of rest. Furthermore, apparent respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was calculated from the fH data to determine probable breathing frequency in resting penguins. The most pertinent results were: minimum fH achieved (over five minutes) was higher during respirometry experiments in air than during periods ashore in the field; minimum fH during respirometry experiments on water was similar to that while at sea; RSA was apparent in many of the fH traces during periods of minimum fH and provides accurate estimates of breathing rates of <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> resting in specific situations in the field. Inferences made from the results include: <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> do not have the capacity to reduce their metabolism to a particularly low level on land; however they can achieve surprisingly low metabolic rates at sea while resting in cold water; during respirometry experiments <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> are stressed to some degree, exhibiting an elevated metabolism even when resting...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is ro {{summarise}} and discuss the changes in glaciers, <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> and fur seals reported by the nine wintering parties and 11 summer expeditions that have visited Heard Island since 1947, with emphasis upon those of the years between 1947 and 1971. These early years were notable for an initial period (1947 - 55) of minimal change, and a subsequent period (1963 - 71) of rapid change in which a complex pattern of asynchronous glacier retreat and readvance was observed and the main features of the island's recolonisation by <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> and fur seals were established. Subsequent expeditions (1980 - 93) have reported continuing glacier recession, evidently in response to warmer air temperatures, and a continuing exponential increase in <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> and fur seals. The glacier observarions show that the Heard Island glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change in the Southern Ocean, and of the interactions between climate and glacier topography. The island's recolonisation by <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> and fur seals is attributed mainly to an improved food supply which may itself, like the glacier recession, be a response to changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Glacier recession and its consequences are changing the island's coastline, and the expanding populations of <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> and fur seals are damaging the vegetation. All these phenomena, occurring as they do in an island with a hitherto undamaged ecosystem and no introduced predators, clearly warrant continuing study...|$|R
25|$|The <b>king</b> <b>penguin</b> is able {{to breed}} at three years of age, {{although}} {{only a very small}} minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands) actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. King penguins are serially monogamous. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. The long breeding cycle may contribute to this low rate.|$|E
25|$|The Crozet Islands {{are home}} to four species of penguins. Most {{abundant}} are the macaroni penguin, of which some 2million pairs breed on the islands, and the <b>king</b> <b>penguin,</b> home to 700,000 breeding pairs; half the world's population. The eastern rockhopper penguin also can be found, {{and there is a}} small colony of gentoo penguins. There is also an endemic subspecies of the duck Eaton's pintail. Other birds include black-faced sheathbills, petrels, and albatross, including the wandering albatross.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} large size, <b>king</b> <b>penguin</b> chicks take 14–16 months {{before they are}} ready to go to sea. This is {{markedly}} different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{study of}} scats of adult male Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (AFS) {{revealed}} occasional frequent capture of penguins. Although AFS adult males have been occasionally reported to kill <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> Aptenodytes patagonicus at the shore, here we report the first observations of at-sea predation by AFS on adult <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> in the Crozet archipelago, southern Indian Ocean. During our 20 days survey, we observed 17 penguins attacked and either severely injured or killed and con-sumed. Only AFS adult males were seen catching <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> successfully. Some adult females and sub-adults also attempted to catch penguins, either at sea or in land, {{and so did}} subantarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis individuals. Our results confirm the ability of fur seals to catch and predate large seabirds, even at sea...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesAnimals at Marion Island can be {{affected}} by logistic disturbance (especially helicopter noise), incidental pedestrian disturbance and research disturbance. The responses of wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) and <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> (Aptenodytes patagonicus) were investigated through standardised pedestrian approaches. Intensity of behavioural responses and levels of prolactin (females only) indicated that adult wandering albatrosses had become sensitised by high levels of chronic disturbance. Responses were greatest during the Prospecting and Early Incubation phases. Frequency of disturbance did not influence behavioural responses, but birds visited most often over three consecutive days had the lowest chick survival. Guarding <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> {{were less likely to}} move away during disturbance than non-breeding groups. Visit duration and approach distance affected behavioural responses. There was evidence of habituation by <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> to current levels of incidental disturbance. Grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma) adults and chicks showed short-term behavioural responses to research disturbance, and recovery times were variable. Level of chronic disturbance did not explain breeding success differences between colony sections. Instantaneous scans or counts of guarding and brooding gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), incubating Crozet shags (Phalacrocoraxmelanogenis), pre-fledging grey-headed albatross chicks and non-breeding <b>king</b> <b>penguins</b> were made before and during helicopter operations...|$|R
25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, southern giant petrel, snow petrel, slender-billed prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the <b>king</b> <b>penguin,</b> wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern giant petrel, Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, great shearwater, common diving petrel, south polar skua and parasitic jaeger.|$|E
