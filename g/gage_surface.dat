40|$|This {{study is}} part of a {{continuing}} investigation to develop methods for measuring local transient surface heat flux. A method is presented for simultaneous measurements of dual heat fluxes at a surface location by considering the heat flux as a separate function of heat stored and heat conducted within a heat flux <b>gage.</b> <b>Surface</b> heat flux information is obtained from transient temperature measurements taken at points within the gage. Heat flux was determined over a range of 4 to 22 MW/sq m. It was concluded that the method is feasible. Possible applications are for heat flux measurements on the turbine blade surfaces of space shuttle main engine turbopumps and on the component surfaces of rocket and advanced gas turbine engines and for testing sensors in heat flux gage calibrators...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{breaking}} cracks {{are one of}} {{the most}} feared defects in engineering structures. Many methods are available today to locate them. There are procedures for gaging the depths of deep surface cracks and some other techniques for measuring the density of microcracking close to the surface. Intermediate cracks, with depths from about 1 mm to 6 mm, however, have yet to be gaged accurately. Rayleigh waves, which represent a special case of surface waves, are very energetic close to the surface of a medium. Most of their energy is, in fact, concentrated in the first two wavelengths of penetration of the wave into the medium. Broadband Rayleigh waves contain a wide range of wavelengths at the surface. Since the different frequencies have different depths of penetration, the deeper portion of such a wave will be devoid of the higher frequency components. The research presented in this dissertation is concerned mostly with the use of the aforementioned characteristic of the Rayleigh wave to <b>gage</b> <b>surface</b> breaking fatigue cracks. If a discontinuity exists in the field of propagation of a Rayleigh wave, it will act as a filtering device for the frequencies or wavelengths that do not penetrate deeper than the flaw itself;All of the research reported here was conducted on steel specimens. To be able to work in the range of crack lengths of 1 mm to 6 mm, it was necessary to use frequencies between 0. 5 - 5. 5 MHz. The method proposed in this dissertation is not, though, reserved to metals. Applicability could be found in the fields of geophysics, to study faults and their extension into the earth crust, and to obtain crack depth measurements in any material capable of transmitting acoustic waves...|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} of torque in a rotating shaft {{is not easy}} to implement with technologies such as optic fiber sensors or strain <b>gages.</b> <b>Surface</b> acoustic wave (SAW) sensors are wireless and passive and can be used to monitor strain in moving parts. Commercial solutions (sensors, antennas and interrogation unit) can easily be purchased from some companies; however, they are not customized and may not meet the specificity of the measurements. In order to evaluate the adequacy of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, temperature and strain sensors fabricated by SENSeOR (Besançon, France) were mounted on a load cell. The sensors were calibrated using a thermal chamber and a universal testing machine. The load cell was then assembled together with a steel shaft that rotated at different speeds inside an oven. The commercial antennas were replaced with an RF (radio frequency) coupler and the sensors were interrogated with the commercial interrogation unit. The influence of rotation in the accuracy on the measurements, as well as the adequacy of the sensors structure, was evaluated. It can be concluded that SAW sensors can be used to measure temperature or torque in a rotating environment; however, some customization of the components is required in order to overcome the limitations posed by COTS sensing solutions...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} method is described for measuring hygroscopic swelling strains and mechanical strains of moisture-conditioned composite specimens. The method consists of embedding encapsulated strain gages in the midplane of the composite laminate; thus {{it does not}} interfere with normal moisture diffusion.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how the deformation propensities of individual grains of 316 L stainless steel influence intergranular cracking behavior in supercritical water (SCW). The grain-to-grain variations in deformation propensities were estimated from the Schmid and Taylor factors of grains. Resulting stress inhomogeneities and strain incompatibilities which were evaluated to determine the conditions that promoted intergranular cracking in SCW. Proton irradiation of 316 L caused hardening and radiation induced depletion of chromium at grain boundaries and was found to increase intergranular cracking severity. The SCW environment increased the crack density on the <b>gage</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the specimen by a factor of 18 compared to a 400 ˚C argon environment. Intergranular cracks preferentially occurred along grain boundaries oriented perpendicular to the tensile axis and adjacent to grains with low Schmid factors. The Schmid-Modified Grain Boundary Stress (SMGBS) model was developed to analyze local grain boundary stresses. The model was validated by showing that the Schmid factor dependence of cracking in SCW could be predicted from the trace inclination distribution, and confirmed that cracking was driven by the normal stresses acting on grain boundaries. The similar dependencies of slip discontinuity and intergranular cracking on trace inclination, Schmid factor, Taylor factor, and grain boundary character suggest that slip discontinuity contributes to intergranular cracking. Grains with low Taylor factors decreased slip discontinuity propensity at grain boundaries with trace inclinations > 50 ˚ because they provided multiple favorably oriented slip systems on which deformation could occur. Grain boundary engineering reduced the intergranular cracking propensity of 316 L stainless steel in SCW by virtue of the fact that special grain boundaries were more resistant to intergranular cracking in SCW than random high angle grain boundaries. The findings of this study indicate that the intergranular cracking resistance of 316 L stainless steel in a SCW environment would be greatest for a microstructure with a large population of grains with high Schmid factors (for a specified stress state), a high frequency of grain boundaries oriented nearly parallel to the tensile direction, and a large fraction of special grain boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} {{of the high}} heat transfer rates experienced during the hypersonic portion of planetary entry and descent is critical to vehicle survival. Two types of sensors {{that can be used}} to measure surface heat flux are coaxial thermocouple gages and thin film resistance thermometers. Individually, both types of gages have been used successfully in a number of studies [1 – 19]. Both thermocouple and thin film <b>gages</b> measure <b>surface</b> temperature from which heat transfer can be calculated. Both have µs response times, and can be flush-mounted in models. Coaxial thermocouples are robust, can survive challenging experimental conditions, and are typically used in higher enthalpy flows. Thin film resistance gages typically provide improved signal levels, but are less robust, have to be individually calibrated, and are typically used in lower enthalpy flows. As a result, there are few studies which directly compare measurements from the two types of gages. In the present work, we perform experimental measurements at a range of intermediate enthalpies in hypervelocity flow and make direct comparisons between temperature histories and heat flux data obtained from thermocouple and thin film gages...|$|R
40|$|Conventional in situ wave gages, {{like the}} {{pressure}} gage and current meter (PUV) and the directional wave gage (DWG), cannot satisfy all water-wave measurement requirements {{in the coastal}} zone. Specifically, new measurement technologies are required to allow for wave measurement within navigation channels and near navigation structures where bottom-mounted gages are not easily de-ployed or may themselves become hazards to navigation. Bottom-mounted wave gages do not di-rectly measure the elevation of the water surface. Instead, these measurements approximate water surface elevation based on other hydrodynamic processes. The results can be faulty if these proc-esses are different than assumed during analysis. In December 1999, a non-intrusive directional li-dar wave gage (LWG) was tested. The LWG uses lidar technology to directly measure water sur-face elevation. So unlike bottom-mounted <b>gages,</b> the <b>surface</b> elevation measurement from the LWG is independent of other hydrodynamic processes. The prototype LWG consists of four rangefinders, a compass, and an inclinometer. Each rangefinder collected water surface elevation time series {{at a rate of}} 10 Hz.

40|$|A FORTRAN {{computer}} code for the reduction {{and analysis of}} experimental heat transfer data has been developed. This code can be utilized to determine heat transfer rates from surface temperature measurements made using either thin-film resistance <b>gages</b> or coaxial <b>surface</b> thermocouples.

The analytical solution {{is based on a}} one-dimensional, semi-infinite wall thickness model with the approximation of constant substrate thermal properties, which is empirically corrected for the effects of variable thermal properties. The finite-volume solution is based on a one-dimensional, implicit discretization. The finite-volume model directly incorporates the effects of variable substrate thermal properties and does not require the semi-finite wall thickness approximation used in the analytical model. This model also includes the option of a multiple-layer substrate. Fast, accurate results can be obtained using either method.

To investigate these affects, a method has been devised and implemented which is capable of monitoring the groundwater conditions within a highway construction zone. The method includes a system of measurement devices which are strategically placed within small watersheds that {{are representative of the}} entire construction zone. These devices, which include groundwater wells, rain <b>gages,</b> and <b>surface</b> water flumes, are arranged in sparse networks aligned along the direction of water flow. This has been done to reduce the cost and complexity of the system and to allow for easy adaptation to future sites and conditions. The installed equipment was monitored for over one year, during which time a method of data organization, manipulation, and analysis was devised and utilized. The data was processed into easy to understand formats that would be accessible to all organizations involved with the construction project. Hydrologic phenomena such as groundwater table fluctuation, recharge, and flow rate, were all analyzed and used in conjunction with other data to represent the aquifers. After studying the behaviors of each watershed, inferences were made on how well the data collection system was able to capture the responses of the aquifer. Since the system was based on a limited network of devices, many estimates and assumptions had to be made which reduced its success at explicitly demonstrating the effects of the construction.

40|$|Predicting the {{degradation}} of railway track parameters such as <b>gage,</b> wear and <b>surface</b> quality can aid {{the process of making}} proactive estimates of maintenance requirements. Though extrapolation of point-based regression over historical data collected on curves or portions of tangents can be used for such predictions, it can produce inconsistent predictions in certain cases due to relatively minute aberrations in track measurement data. In order {{to improve the quality of}} these predictions, a novel profile-based methodology, described here, has been developed that models the behavior of track as a whole rather than as discrete points and models the variation of track in space and time domains using advanced statistical methods. While modeling the data, the most prominent variations in track degradation observed over time are retained and the relatively uncommon aberrations are filtered out. Predictions based on the re-modeled data are more consistent and eliminate unrealistic behavior observed in point-based regression methods. Profile-based prediction methodology requires that the recorded track geometry data taken on different test dates be aligned with its correct geographic location within an acceptable degree of accuracy. A data synchronization methodology critical to the prediction process has been developed for aligning large quantities of geometry data within a reasonable accuracy. The statistical techniques employed can work even in absence of previously aligned data or Global Information System (GIS) information. In case data synchronization is found to be inadequate, the prediction methodology can correct such data or reject it in extreme cases...|$|R

Alloy 625, the nickel based superalloy commonly called Inconel* 625, was investigated for its susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in sea water using the slow strain rate tensile test method. Four microstructures of the alloy commonly found in end products were investigated. Bimetallic couplings with other metals were simulated with a potentiostat at plus and minus one volt {{with respect to a}} saturated standard calomel electrode (SCE). Baseline tests were conducted in air and sea water without applied potential. The response of the alloy to cathodic protection of minus three volts SCE was also investigated on the two most commonly used microstructures, as cast" and "forged/annealed". The different microstructures developed were characterized with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The <b>gage</b> lengths, fracture <b>surfaces,</b> and sections of test specimens were also examined with a SEM. The data from the slow strain rate tensile tests were compared with data from standard tensile tests performed on the same processed material. The results from this investigation indicate that Alloy 625 is not susceptible to stress corrosion cracking in the normal sea water service environment where temperatures are close to ambient. However, the results indicated that Alloy 625 is susceptible to the hydrogen embrittlement form of stress corrosion cracking when subjected to potentials that produce hydrogen evolution. This embrittlement leads to intergranular cracking. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Accepted manuscriptIn {{unidirectional}} carbon fiber-reinforced plastic laminates, {{the distance}} between fibers can varies from submicron to micron length scales. The mechanical properties of the matrix at this length scale are not well understood. In this study, processing methods {{have been developed to}} produce high quality epoxy micro-fibers with diameters ranging from 100 to 150 [*]µm that are used for tensile testing. Five types of epoxy resin systems ranging from standard DGEBA to high-crosslink TGDDM and TGMAP epoxy systems have been characterized. Epoxy macroscopic specimens with film thickness of 3300 [*]µm exhibited brittle behavior (1. 7 to 4. 9 % average failure strain) with DGEBA resin having the highest failure strain level. The epoxy micro-fiber specimens exhibited significant ductile behavior (20 to 42 % average failure strain) with a distinct yield point being observed in all five resin systems. In addition, the ultimate stress of the highly cross-linked TGDDM epoxy fiber exceeded the bulk film properties by a factor of two and the energy absorption was over 50 times greater on average. The mechanism explaining the dramatic difference in properties is discussed and is based on size effects (the film volume is about 2000 times greater than the fiber volume within the <b>gage</b> sections) and <b>surface</b> defects. Based on the findings presented in this paper, the microscale fiber test specimens are recommended and provide more realistic stress–strain response for describing the role of the matrix in composites at smaller length scales.

The surface of a fluvially transported granite boulder was instrumented with (1) six acoustic emission (AE) sensors that record micro-crack associated, elastic wave-generated activity within the three-dimensional space of the boulder, (2) eight rectangular rosette foil strain <b>gages</b> to measure <b>surface</b> strain, (3) eight thermocouples to measure surface temperature, and (4) one surface moisture sensor. Additionally, a soil moisture probe and a full weather station that measures ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, barometric pressure, insolation, and precipitation were installed adjacent to the test boulder. AE activity was continuously monitored by one logger while all other variables were acquired by a separate logger every 60 s. The protocols associated with the instrumentation, data acquisition, and analysis are discussed in detail. During the first four months, the deployed boulder experienced almost 12 000 AE events, the majority of which occur in the afternoon when temperatures are decreasing. This paper presents preliminary data that illustrates data validity and typical patterns and behaviors observed. This system offers the potential to (1) obtain an unprecedented record of the natural conditions under which rocks fracture and (2) decipher the mechanical processes that lead to rock fracture at a variety of temporal scales under a range of natural conditions...|$|R
40|$|In-situ Thermal Protection System (TPS) sensors are {{required}} to provide traceability of TPS performance and sizing tools. Traceability will lead to higher fidelity design tools, which in turn will lead to lower design safety margins, and decreased heatshield mass. Decreasing TPS mass will enable certain missions that are not otherwise feasible, and directly increase science payload. NASA Ames is currently developing two flight measurements as essential to advancing the state of TPS traceability for material modeling and aerothermal simulation: heat flux and surface recession (for ablators). The heat flux gage is applicable to both ablators and non-ablators and is therefore the more generalized sensor concept of the two with wider applicability to mission scenarios. This paper describes {{the development of a}} microsensor capable of surface and in-depth temperature and heat flux measurements for TPS materials appropriate to Titan, Neptune, and Mars aerocapture, and direct entry. The thermal sensor will be monolithic solid state devices composed of thick film platinum RTD on an alumina substrate. Choice of materials and critical dimensions are used to tailor gage response, determined during calibration activities, to specific (forebody vs. aftbody) heating environments. Current design has maximum operating temperature of 1500 K, and allowable constant heat flux of q= 28. 7 watts per square centimeter, and time constants between 0. 05 and 0. 2 seconds. The catalytic and radiative response of these heat flux gages can also be changed through the use of appropriate coatings. By using several co-located <b>gages</b> with various <b>surface</b> coatings, data can be obtained to isolate surface heat flux components due to radiation, catalycity and convection. Selectivity to radiative heat flux is a useful feature even for an in-depth gage, as radiative transport may be a significant heat transport mechanism for porous TPS materials in Titan aerocapture. This paper also reports on progress to adapt a previously flown surface recession sensor, based on the Jupiter probe Galileo Analog Resistance Ablation Detector (ARAD), to appropriate aerocapture conditions...|$|R
40|$|For {{the summer}} of 1964, {{precipitation}} intensity {{in the vicinity of}} Montreal, observed by CPS- 9 radar, was recorded on constant-altitude maps at six heights. To allow for attenuation (at A = 3. 2 cm) and other radar uncertainties, the distribution with rainfall rate R at 5, 000 ft was matched to that for one rain <b>gage</b> at the <b>surface.</b> The extent (area X time) in excess of a given R decreased rapidly with increasing R and with increasing height: a factor 1000 from 0. 4 to 100 mm hr- 1, a factor 10 per 15, 000 ft. The pattern in plan at any height (with resolution limited to about 2 mi in the recorded maps) can be described in terms of cells with intensity decreasing outward approximately exponentially. A logarithmic function of intensity was used: T = 1. 66 log (R/Ro) where R 0 = 0. 25 mm hr- 1. The value of T for a contour bounding a central areaA is given by T = T, [...] z where T, is the maximum and-z = (A/ 17. 5 n. mi?) l/a. (With this relation, one can estimate peak intensity from the area bounded by any given intensity.) The number of cells having T, greater than a given value of T, per lo 8 n. mi. 2 of map area (as for hourly maps of area 20, 000 n. mi. a throughout a 5, 000 -hr summer) is No, where log No= 8. 8 - T- H and H = height/ 15, 000 ft. As to shape, the maximum and minimum extents were always within a factor 6 of each other. Usually, the area in the horizontal section of a cell decreased with height. Occasionally it increased to a maximum, at about 20, 000 ft, as much as four times greater than the area at 5, 000 ft. These maxima aloft were generally identifiable with storms reaching 40, 000 ft, which is tall for Montreal. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to better {{understand}} the evolution of damage in brittle matrix composites, the mechanical behavior of a ceramic matrix composite, unidirectional SiC/CAS (SiC fibers reinforcing a calcium aluminosilicate matrix), was studied. The presented results are based on uniaxial tension experiments for specimens with the fibers aligned in the loading direction. Post-test optical and scanning electron microscopy was also used to identify the various micromechanisms of damage; axial and transverse strain gauges on all four <b>gage</b> section <b>surfaces</b> and in situ acoustic emission and ultrasonic wave speed measurements were used to monitor the evolution of damage. The experimental results demonstrate the existence of "zones of deformation" which are associated with the onset of different damage mechanisms. The energy dissipated in each of these zones was calculated. It is shown that the observed stress-strain behavior can be qualitatively explained in terms of the material properties of the matrix and the fiber, the material processing, and the postulated zones of deformation. The experimental results for SiC/CAS were compared with an existing shear-lag model, and the shortcomings of the model are discussed. By approximating matrix cracks as penny shaped cracks, a micromechanical model was used to estimate the change in the axial modulus of the composite. These results also present another way to interpret the acoustic emission data. The evolution of damage in the SiC/CAS experiments was found to be strain rate dependent even within the quasi-static strain rate regime. For higher rate experiments, the transition from elastic to matrix cracked occurred at a stress level that was nearly twice that of the same transition in the lower rate experiments. This phenomenon and the mechanisms which cause it was further investigated with a model material system (a brittle epoxy resin sandwiched between aluminum strips). In situ quantification of the stress during damage initiation and propagation was realized by the optical method of Coherent Gradient Sensing. Based on these results, the reasons for strain rate dependence of the composite are postulated. Detailed understanding of aspects of the evolution of in brittle matrix composites was achieved with finite element simulations. This modeling was based on an axisymmetric unit cell composed of a fiber and its surrounding matrix. The unit cell was discretized into linearly elastic elements for the fiber and the matrix and cohesive elements which allow cracking in the matrix, fiber-matrix interface, and fiber. The cohesive elements failed according to critical stress and critical energy release rate criteria (in shear and/or in tension). After failing, the cohesive elements could slide with Coulomb friction. The tension and shear aspects of failure were uncoupled. The cohesive elements were used to simulate a Dugdale penny shaped crack in a homogeneous cylinder; results compared well to the analytical solution. In order to solve the composite axisymmetric unit cell problem, inertia and viscous damping were added to the formulation. The resulting dynamic problem was solved implicitly using the Newmark Method. Results were compared to the experiment by assuming that only a given number of unit cells were active at any point during the simulation. The effects of changing material properties (e. g., interface strength and toughness and matrix toughness) and loading rate are discussed. Several aspects of the experimentally observed material response of SiC/CAS composite were reproduced by the numerical simulations. ...|$|R
