5|$|In 1988, CBS {{tried to}} revive the format of Our World with a {{television}} pilot called Try to Remember. Anchored by veteran newscaster Charles Kuralt, Try to Remember covered August 11–17, 1969, echoing Our Worlds pilot coverage of the summer of 1969. The show aired on Thursday, June 23. Try to Remember did not <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> up as a regular series.|$|E

Even the pilot Prudence and the Chief, which was a spoof on The King and I, did not <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> up as a TV series. In addition, musicals were now failing {{at the box office}} and that avenue was closed to her. As a result, she returned almost exclusively to the musical stage, appearing in only a few more films and TV productions.|$|E
25|$|Alam {{was picked}} {{to play against}} England in 2010 and {{wanted to make the}} most of his {{opportunity}} to <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> for the two upcoming tours and then be selected for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He also stated that he had played a little bit of club cricket in England to help him get used to the english conditions and to train for the tour. Alam scored well in the first two matches but his major break came in the third One-Day International when he increased his top score to 64. He then retained his place for the ODI series against South Africa in the UAE. After scoring 123 runs in the 5 match series, he was subsequently dropped from the ODI team and later that year, lost his place in the T20 team after the tour to New Zealand.|$|E

500|$|In May 2016, Tancharoen said [...] "we’re always open" [...] to the {{possibility}} of Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood appearing in the season, after they left the series' cast during the third season for the spin-off series Marvel's Most Wanted, which ultimately did not <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> up. Whedon reiterated in January 2017 that [...] "Once an agent, always an agent, so it’s always out there in the ether", but stated that the pair were unlikely to return during the fourth season.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's meticulous {{planning}} {{may also}} have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team. [...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime." [...] Furthermore, [...] "if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans." ...|$|E
500|$|A strong {{start to}} the 2006–07 Australian {{domestic}} season, exemplified by 150* against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126* against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup (previously ING Cup) saw White recalled to the Australia one-day squad. [...] Chief of selectors, Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad, praising his [...] "great form with the bat and [...] has had some terrific performances with the ball". In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, White professed his relief at returning to the international scene, stating that [...] "I don't really care if I <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder, or just as a bat or bowler, as long as I get picked." [...] An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with {{a man of the}} match award for his 40* off 20 balls, and 1/11 with the ball in hand. In his next batting innings, White scored 45runs including 3sixes against New Zealand, leading teammate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball, saying that [...] "when you've got that going on at the other end, it makes it a lot easier for me". Despite his excellent form with the bat, White's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective. For this reason, as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball, he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad.|$|E

2500|$|Keane has reiterated his displeasure {{with the}} {{attitude}} and selection {{policy of the}} FAI. In March 2007, Keane claimed that several Republic of Ireland players <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> {{solely on the basis}} of their media exposure and that the organisation was biased towards players originating from Dublin or other regions of Leinster: [...] "Once you keep playing them on the reputation they've built up through the media or because they do lots of interviews, then it's wrong. There's a fine line between loyalty and stupidity." [...] Keane claimed that Sunderland player Liam Miller was not picked because he was from Cork and that players with significant potential were failing to <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> for the national team. He also alleged that the FAI were incompetent in the running of their affairs.|$|E
2500|$|ABC did {{not pick}} up the show for its 2007 Autumn schedule. Iannucci distanced himself from the pilot stating [...] "It was terrible...they took the idea and chucked out all the style.

2500|$|In a Huffington Post {{feature on}} the band {{prior to the}} 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, Jacobs {{revealed}} that The Hub had opted not to renew The Aquabats! Super Show! for another season following extensive network rebranding by Hasbro and Discovery, effectively canceling the series. Jacobs admitted he was surprised by this turn of events, noting [...] "Everything we heard was that the show {{has been a real}} Cinderella story for the Hub and that it was rating really well with viewers. We just assumed that we'd eventually go back into production or at least <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> up for Season 3", but ultimately concluded [...] "it is what it is" [...] in regard to the network's decision.|$|E

50|$|The 1945 NFL Draft {{was held}} on April 8, 1945. It was the last draft held in Chicago; {{later in the year}} the league moved its offices to Philadelphia. It would be 32 rounds with the Eagles <b>getting</b> <b>picks</b> in 30 of them. The Eagles would pick 9th in the rounds.|$|R
2500|$|The show also starred a Broadway actress, {{also from}} New York City, Jean Stapleton, {{in the role}} of Bunker's long-suffering wife, Edith Bunker, whom Lear remembered from seeing in the play and film Damn Yankees. The {{producer}} sent the show over to ABC twice, but it did not <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> up. They then approached CBS with more success, and accordingly, All in the Family was retooled and debuted early in 1971. The show also starred unknown character actors, such as Rob Reiner as Archie's liberal son-in-law, Michael [...] "Meathead" [...] Stivic, and Sally Struthers as Archie and Edith's only child and Mike's wife, Gloria. The cast had a unique on- and off-camera chemistry, especially Reiner, who became O'Connor's best friend and favorite actor.|$|E
2500|$|Following the draft, Quinn {{was criticized}} by fellow Notre Dame quarterback Joe Theismann {{in a radio}} interview, {{claiming}} that Quinn looked [...] "unprofessional" [...] {{when he was on}} stage following his name being called. Theismann was bothered by the appearance of Quinn's hair {{and the fact that he}} was chewing gum. Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, when you finally <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and everything looked good. I was just trying to get on stage as fast as possible and get that Browns jersey in my hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, {{a cartoon}} based upon The New Teen Titans comics began development. It was {{created as a}} {{companion}} for the Super Friends, to be set in the same continuity. Robin wasn't going to be featured in the cartoon though, at least not as a regular, since in the Super Friends universe, {{he was a member}} of the Justice League. Like Super Friends, the show was to be developed by Hanna-Barbera for ABC, but since shows like The Smurfs (airing on NBC) were so popular at the time, this show was never picked up by the network. The show would have featured Wonder Girl as the leader, along with Cyborg, Kid Flash, Changeling, Raven and Starfire. Although the show failed to <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> up, a television commercial with a substance abuse theme did feature the Titans, as they would have appeared in the animated series, along with a new superhero named [...] "The Protector" [...] who would have been the replacement character for Robin. A Teen Titans animated TV program was eventually produced, adding Robin and removing Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, and The Protector.|$|E

2500|$|The songs,all {{written by}} Davis herself, are mostly built around funk grooves, driving {{percussion}} and heavy guitars. Davis' vocal stylings are expressive and boisterous (as on [...] "If I'm In Luck I Might <b>Get</b> <b>Picked</b> Up"), but also playful and sensual (as on [...] "Anti Love Song"). On the former she boldly sings [...] "I'm wigglin' my fanny, I'm raunchy dancing, I'm-a-doing it doing it". [...] "Steppin' In Her I. Miller Shoes", {{tells the story}} of a talented young woman who comes to the 'jungle' with big dreams, only to end up a tragic victim of the entertainment industry. The up-tempo song features hard rock guitars and backing vocals by The Pointer Sisters. In a 2007 interview Davis revealed that the song was based on the life of Devon Wilson, a one-time girlfriend of Jimi Hendrix with whom Davis had been close friends. Wilson is also the subject of [...] "Angel" [...] by Hendrix. With their hard-funk/rock-fused sounds, few of the songs catered to radio play; perhaps the closest is [...] "In The Meantime" [...] featuring prominent organ and the most restrained and straightfoward performance on the album.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film has}} also been subject to parody. [...] In 2015, the Comedy Central TV series Inside Amy Schumer aired a half-hour parody of the film titled [...] "12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer". BBC Radio comedy Hancock's Half Hour, {{starring}} Tony Hancock and Sid James, written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as Twelve Angry Men. The Flintstones story [...] "Disorder in the Court" [...] and The Simpsons story [...] "The Boy Who Knew Too Much" [...] similarly feature the respective patriarchs of both families playing holdout jurors. Family Guy paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled [...] "12 and a Half Angry Men". King Of The Hill acknowledged the film with their parody [...] "Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men" [...] in season 3. The American sitcom Happy Days also features a similar story when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie <b>get</b> <b>picked</b> for a jury, with Fonzie being the lone hold-out for innocence and swaying {{the rest of the}} jury in the season 5 episode [...] "Fonzie for the Defense". [...] Saturday Night Live parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater.|$|E
2500|$|The {{period of}} {{captaincy}} under Atherton {{was seen as}} one of disaster followed by more and more disappointment for England's fans. Selectoral differences between Atherton and Raymond Illingworth often meant that players such as Angus Fraser and Devon Malcolm would not <b>get</b> <b>picked,</b> against the captain's wishes. Teams would sometimes have too many batsmen, no spin bowler and the plethora of players who would come into the side and then quickly disappear, was symptomatic of a troubled side. [...] The demands of county cricket often meant that injuries would deny Atherton key players and when compared with Australian cricket, it was seen as antiquated by many. [...] Performances of great excellence would often crop up, amid the rubbish. These included two centuries in a test match at Port of Spain by Alec Stewart, nine wickets in an innings from Devon Malcolm against South Africa, seven wickets on debut by Dominic Cork against the West Indies and Michael Atherton and Jack Russell batting for ten hours to salvage a draw in Johannesburg. By 1997, calls for Atherton to step down were only put off by an exciting victory at The Oval against Australia, despite losing the series 3–2. On the following tour to the West Indies, a 3–1 defeat forced the beleaguered captain to step down, [...] {{to be replaced by}} wicketkeeper-batsman Alec Stewart.|$|E
