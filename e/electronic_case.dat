25|$|The {{challenge}} {{of managing the}} {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemic (November 2002 to June 2003) is often credited with further motivating the government to take aggressive policy action on HIV-related issues. SARS showed not only how infectious diseases could threaten economic and social stability but also the effect of China's policies on international health problems. Policymakers announced a change of focus from purely economic goals to increasing the focus on health and social wellbeing and, as a result, increased support for public health agencies. In controlling SARS, contact between the government and international agencies such as WHO, UN, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was essential and further stimulated stronger international collaboration for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Intervention strategies necessary for SARS control have been translated into HIV/AIDS prevention – e.g., real-time <b>electronic</b> <b>case</b> reporting.|$|E
2500|$|The terms {{electronic}} health records, {{personal health}} records, and patient portals {{are not always}} used correctly. [...] The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the ownership of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are {{the property of the}} provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient. [...] A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an electronic copy as well. In the UK, according to the governments's information strategy for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015. In 2012, only 1% did so. Electronic health records and electronic medical records contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care. [...] The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system. [...] The patient portal is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records. [...] In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, <b>electronic</b> <b>case</b> management, etc. [...] Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing. [...] This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, but the point is it now resides in a location of the patient's choosing. [...] Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.|$|E

40|$|In medical education, virtual {{patients}} are now widely {{used to support}} and enhance clinical teaching. However, there is still only a limited adoption of similar methods in veterinary education. This paper describes an initiative at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in London to develop student-authored cases during clinical rotations that were subsequently adapted for self-directed learning in the undergraduate curriculum as virtual patients. This approach was designed to {{enhance the quality of}} the clinical learning experience, assist in the development of clinical reasoning skills, and complement the existing teaching caseload. The creation of virtual patients involved a two-stage process. In the first stage, students compiled clinical case data and media from patients admitted to the teaching hospitals. They then used these resources to develop <b>electronic</b> <b>cases</b> using a customized Microsoft PowerPoint template that were presented at grand rounds to clinicians and other students. In the second stage, selected cases were further developed with the integration of self-assessment and additional media to create virtual patients for use in teaching. A survey was used to gather feedback on students' experiences in creating and using <b>electronic</b> <b>cases.</b> It was completed by 163 final-year students (81 %) and the results indicated that all respondents had created <b>electronic</b> <b>cases</b> on one or more rotations (mean= 4. 3 rotations, range= 1 - 9). Overall, the feedback suggested that the students found creating and using these cases useful and that the experience improved their approach to a case...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Timely and {{accurate}} information {{is important to}} guide the medical treatment process. We developed, implemented and assessed an order-entry system to support documentation of prostate histologies involving urologists, pathologists and physicians in private practice. Methods We designed electronic forms for histological prostate biopsy reports in our hospital information system (HIS). These forms are created by urologists and sent electronically to pathologists. Pathological findings are entered into the system and {{sent back to the}} urologists. We assessed time from biopsy to final report (TBF) and compared pre-implementation phase (paper-based forms) and post-implementation phase. In addition we analysed completeness of the electronic data. Results We compared 87 paper-based with 86 <b>electronic</b> <b>cases.</b> Using <b>electronic</b> forms within the HIS decreases time span from biopsy to final report by more than one day per patient (p Conclusion Electronic documentation can significantly reduce the time from biopsy to final report of prostate biopsy results and generates a reliable basis for quality management and research purposes. </p...|$|R

50|$|Police {{maintained}} and expanded {{the use of}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>case</b> tracking system for human trafficking investigations, although this system did not track judicial activity, such as prosecutions and convictions. Corruption among low-level officials enabled trafficking in certain instances, and individual police officers tolerated the operation of unlicensed brothels and the prostitution of children. No investigations or allegations of official complicity with trafficking activity were reported last year. The government provided training on human trafficking to law enforcement officials, immigration officials, diplomats, and legal officials, among others. The government collaborated with foreign governments on anti-trafficking initiatives and investigations.|$|E
