5|$|In August Belgrano again took {{command of}} the Army of the North, but with very limited people and resources. He was ordered to avoid trying to advance against the royalists in the north, and was {{to stay in a}} {{defensive}} state at Tucumán. With Güemes in Salta, his task was to prevent the Royalists from moving to the south. The Supreme Director Pueyrredón was supporting an alternative plan designed by José de San Martín: create the Army of the Andes at Cuyo and, after making the Crossing of the Andes, defeat the royalists in Chile, <b>get</b> <b>control</b> of the Chilean navy, and attack the royalist stronghold of Lima with it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to <b>get</b> <b>control</b> of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

25|$|The {{methods used}} in a typical pirate attack have been analyzed. They show that while attacks can be {{expected}} at any time, most occur during the day; often in the early hours. They may involve two or more skiffs that can reach speeds of up to 25 knots. With the help of motherships that include captured fishing and merchant vessels, the operating range of the skiffs has been increased far into the Indian Ocean. An attacked vessel is approached from quarter or stern; RPGs and small arms are used to intimidate the operator {{to slow down and}} allow boarding. Light ladders are brought along to climb aboard. Pirates then will try to <b>get</b> <b>control</b> of the bridge to take operational control of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century new {{railways}} were proposed which were likely to enable the Barry Railway to encroach on the GWR area of dominance at Swansea. The R was a possible means of getting this access if another railway could <b>get</b> <b>control,</b> or running powers, and this motivated the GWR to negotiate with the R for control. In 1906 agreement was reached by which the GWR took over the management of the R system in return for generous financial guarantees. The colliery activity in the area was at its peak and the R directors were able to use this fact to the advantage of their shareholders in the negotiation. The ordinary dividend of the R had been % in 1902; the GWR now guaranteed 3% rising to 5% in 1907. This was in effect a lease; the arrangement took effect from 30 June 1906.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of her first three movies, Shirley's parents {{realized}} that their daughter was not being paid enough money. Her image also began to appear on numerous commercial products without her legal authorization and without compensation. To <b>get</b> <b>control</b> over the corporate unlicensed use of her image and to negotiate with Fox, Temple's parents hired lawyer Loyd Wright to represent them. On July 18, 1934, the contractual salary was raised to $1,000 a week and her mother's salary was raised to $250 a week, with an additional $15,000 bonus for each movie finished. Temple's original contract for $150 per week is equivalent to $2,750 in 2015, adjusted for inflation. However, the economic value of $150 during the Great Depression was equal to $18,500. The subsequent salary increase to $1,000 weekly had the economic value of $123,000 and the bonus of $15,000 per movie (equal to $275,000 in 2015) was equivalent to a staggering $1.85 million in a decade when a quarter could buy a meal. Cease and desist letters were sent out to many companies and the process was begun for awarding corporate licenses.|$|E
25|$|When a goaltender blocks or stops a {{shot from}} going into his goal net, that action {{is called a}} save. Goalies often use a {{particular}} style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goalie's own team to <b>get</b> <b>control</b> of the puck. Goalies may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goalie may choose {{to hold on to}} the puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goalie holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goalies have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.|$|E
25|$|Kashmiri Gate {{is one of}} the {{original}} 14 gates built into the wall {{to the north of the}} city. It was built by the British in 1835 by Major Robert Smith. Local people also call it Truckman gate. It has a square plan. There are two openings of the gate: one for entry and another for exit (pictured). During 1835, the British enlarged and straightened it into a two-way gate as defensive measure against enemy attacks. In the present city setting, the gate is close to the Inter State Bus Terminals. It is now preserved as monument on the road to the Old Secretariat and the Delhi University. It was named as Kashmiri Gate since it was used by the emperors to go through on their visits to Kashmir and North India. It was also the historic venue of the intense fighting which took place in 1857, between the British army and the Indian freedom fighters. The fortifications were used to fire cannons at the British army encamped at Ludlow Castle. The freedom fighters gathered at a place close to the St. James Church to discuss war strategy. British troops fought fiercely at this gate and re-captured the city from mutinous Indian soldiers. During the war, the gate was badly damaged by the British to <b>get</b> <b>control</b> over Delhi. Subsequently, area surrounding the Kashmiri Gate became the commercial hub of Delhi, when the Civil Lines were developed by the British.|$|E

As a result of her parents' death, she and her brother, Cecil Tunt, inherit an estimated US$1 billion in trust funds; it is split evenly amongst each party, which culminated with Cheryl's net worth increasing tenfold. This prompts a group of robbers to cultivate a plan to abduct her, which ultimately fails as they mistake Pam for her. In that same episode, it is also revealed that she owns an ocelot named Babou, for which Archer develops a fondness (similar to Salvador Dalí, who had a pet ocelot by that name with whom he frequently traveled.) Cecil later tricks ISIS into a mission with the intent to videotape members talking of Cheryl's insanity so he can <b>get</b> <b>control</b> of her half of the fortune. It turns out Cecil has spent all of his half of the fortune on various charities, including an undersea base whose insane leader used the funds to buy nerve gas missiles.|$|E
