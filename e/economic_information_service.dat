40|$|In asserting a {{competitive}} market environment as a justification for regulatory forbearance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 finally articulated a clear standard for the FCC's public interest standard, {{one of the most}} protean concepts in communications. This seeming clarity has not, however, inhibited intense political conflict over the term. This paper examines public and regulatory debate over the AOL Time Warner merger {{as an example of the}} way in which the linkage between competitions and commons policy becomes relevant to communications policy, particularly in relation to mass media, and discusses interpretations of the public interest in the current FCC. The paper proposes that the Telecom Act's goal of fostering <b>economic</b> competition among <b>information</b> <b>service</b> providers, and the democratic ideal of nurturing public relationships and behaviors can be linked. Competition policy that creates the opportunity for untrammeled interactivity also provides a sine qua non to nurture the social phenomenon of the commons. The linked concepts of competition and commons could also provide useful ways to interpret the public interest in policy arenas as spectrum allocation and intellectual property.

Productivity indexes were developed by the Tornquist methodology that produces index numbers free of base year bias.

The surveys are taken as representative of the whole in such calculations. In this paper we analyse the Meat and Wool <b>Information</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Service</b> (MWI) survey of sheep and beef farms for the past 20 years and develop an index of whole farm productivity (total productivity) free of base year bias.

40|$|Subject of Research. The paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} {{of the effectiveness of}} redundant queries based on untrusted computing in computer systems, represented by multi-channel queuing systems with a common queue. The objective of research is the possibility of increasing the efficiency of service requests while performing redundant copies of requests in different devices of a multi-channel system under conditions of calculations unreliability. The redundant service of requests requires the infallibility of its implementation at least in one of the devices. Method. We have considered estimation of the average time spent in the system with and without the use of redundant requests at the presentation of a simple queuing model of the M / M / n type to analyze the effectiveness of redundant service of requests. Presented evaluation of the average waiting time in the redundant queries is the upper one, since it ignores the possibility of reducing the average waiting time {{as a result of the}} spread of the probability of time querying at different devices. The integrated efficiency of redundant service of requests is defined based on the multiplicative index that takes into account the infallibility of calculations and the average time allowance with respect to the maximum tolerated delay of service. Evaluation of error-free computing at reserved queries is received at the requirement of faultless execution of at least one copy of the request. Main Results. We have shown that the reservation of requests gives the gain in efficiency of the system at low demand rate (load). We have defined the boundaries of expediency (efficiency) for redundant service of requests. We have shown the possibility of the effectiveness increasing of the adaptive changes in the multiplicity of the reservation of requests, depending on the intensity of the flow of requests. We have found out that the choice of <b>service</b> discipline in <b>information</b> <b>service</b> systems is largely determined by the <b>economic</b> efficiency of <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> estimated by the profit from the error-free provision of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> obtained per time unit (rate of profit). We have demonstrated the existence of an efficiency area of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> at the redundant service of requests under failures and errors. We have determined the flow rate threshold of requests below which a redundant service of requests is appropriate.

However, the digital home service levels have not sufficiently met rising demand from users. Therefore, it is urgent to propose and develop new service modes for the digital home. Geographic <b>information</b> <b>services</b> can provide various spatial <b>information</b> <b>services</b> such as map search, spatial information query.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a market}} where {{the provision of}} <b>information</b> <b>service</b> is costly, but <b>information</b> <b>service</b> has {{the characteristics of a}} public good. Consumers, on the other hand, can use the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> to make an informed purchase decision and derive higher utility from consuming their ideal product. However, after receiving the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> from an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider, consumers can easily free ride by purchasing at low-price sellers who do not provide any <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> The paper examines the competition where sellers compete by providing <b>information</b> <b>service</b> for horizontally differentiated products and where technology reduces consumers' search cost. It is found that in this market a seller needs to establish itself as an <b>information</b> <b>service</b> provider in order to make positive profits, even when there is free riding. A seller, however, cannot make positive profits by free riding all the time. Also, with an increase in competition in the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> market, sellers have reduced incentives to provide <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> It is also found that in this market a decrease in search cost may increase or decrease social welfare. free riding, search cost, electronic markets, electronic commerce...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a {{structured}} literature review, design concepts, and research propositions related to a product-oriented design theory for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Information</b> <b>services</b> facilitate the exchange of information goods with or without transforming these goods. Exemplar <b>information</b> <b>services</b> are e-publishing, electronic communities-of-practice, and management reporting. The importance of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the current economy merits the development of an explicit product- and process-oriented design theory. Design/methodology/approach – This article focuses on the product-oriented design theory by applying Walls et al. 's framework. A product-oriented design theory of <b>information</b> <b>services</b> identifies relevant descriptive and explanatory insights (i. e. content, use, value, and revenue), meta-requirements, and meta-designs. The paper describes design problems for <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> and gives key requirements for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> Next, it describes the information, organizational and information technological components of an <b>information</b> <b>service,</b> and identifies at least four <b>information</b> <b>service</b> architectures. Finally, it gives research hypotheses, research ideas, and discusses practical implications. Findings – The results form a product-oriented design theory for <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> The paper gives a structured way for practitioners to analyze <b>information</b> <b>service</b> design challenges, and suggestions are given for requirements and design decisions on three aspects (content, use feature, and revenue).
