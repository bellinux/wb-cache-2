25|$|The Tale was {{originally}} published in 1704 by John Nutt. Swift had used Benjamin Tooke previously when publishing for Sir William Temple. He would use Tooke for both the fifth edition of the Tale (1710) and later works. Tooke's successor, Benjamin Motte, published Swift's Gulliver's Travels. This difference in printer <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things that led to debate over authorship of the work.|$|E

25|$|Complementary metal-oxide {{semiconductor}} (CMOS) {{technology has been}} the industry standard for implementing Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) devices {{for the last two}} decades, mainly due to the consequences of miniaturization of such devices (i.e. increasing switching speeds, increasing complexity and decreasing power consumption).

Although intraocular pressure <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, {{the novel}} gives {{an insight into}} the power {{structure}} which dominates a large institution of learning, where an individual teacher can never be sure whether a perceived attack on his own well-being has happened out of malice or sheer stupidity, {{or a combination of}} both.

25|$|Pastoralists do {{not exist}} at basic subsistence. Pastoralists often compile wealth and {{participate}} in international trade. Pastoralists have trade relations with agriculturalists, horticulturalists, and other groups. Pastoralists are not extensively dependent on milk, blood, and meat of their herd. McCabe noted that when common property institutions are created, in long-lived communities, resource sustainability is much higher, which {{is evident in the}} East African grasslands of pastoralist populations. However, it needs to be noted that the property rights structure <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many different parameters that affect the sustainability of resources, and common or private property per se, does not necessarily lead to sustainability.|$|E

25|$|The {{geometric}} or floral, interlaced forms, taken together, {{constitute an}} infinitely repeated pattern that {{extends beyond the}} visible material world. To many in the Islamic world, they symbolize the concept of infinite proves of existence of one eternal God. The repetitiveness, simplicity contrasted with complexity and percision suggests that our complex universe <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many manifestations of the infinitely obvious and present Allah, the one God. Furthermore, the Islamic artist conveys a definite spirituality without the iconography of Christian art. Non-figural ornaments are used in mosques and buildings around the Muslim world, {{and it is a}} way of decorating using beautiful, embellishing and repetitive Islamic art instead of using pictures of humans and animals (which some Muslims believe is forbidden (Haram) in Islam).|$|E
25|$|While the Matterhorn is the {{culminating}} {{point of the}} Valtournenche on the south, it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many 4000 metres summits of the Mattertal valley on the north. Its height is exceeded by four major summits: the Weisshorn (4,505 m), the Dom (4,545 m), the Liskamm (4,527 m) and the second highest in the Alps, Monte Rosa (4,634 m). This section of the Pennine Alps, including the Matterhorn, the Zinalrothorn, the Dent Blanche, the Dent d'Hérens, the Breithorn, the Strahlhorn, the Rimpfischhorn and the Alphubel, concentrates most of western Europe's highest mountains and forms a crown of peaks around Zermatt. The deeply glaciated region between the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa (named Dent Blanche-Matterhorn-Monte Rosa) is listed in the Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments since 1983.|$|E
25|$|The rarest {{reported}} type of Eucharistic miracle {{is where}} the Eucharist becomes human flesh as in the miracle of Lanciano which some Catholics believe occurred at Lanciano, Italy, in the 8th century A.D. In fact, Lanciano <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reported cases of Eucharistic miracles where the host {{has been transformed into}} human flesh. However, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported by Catholics is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts to trickle from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass. Other types of purported miracles include consecrated hosts being preserved for hundreds of years, such as the event of the Miraculous Hosts of Siena. Other miracles include a consecrated host passing through a fire unscathed, stolen consecrated hosts vanishing and turning up in churches, and levitating consecrated hosts.|$|E

The identity of Pelayo, however, is still an open subject, and that <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theories. The leader of the Astures, whose origin is debated by historians, had at that time his home in Bres (in the district of Piloña) and Munuza sent his troops there under al-Qama. After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the Piloña and headed toward the narrow, easily defended valley of Auseva mountain, and took refuge in one of its caves, Covadonga. After an attempt at siege was abandoned due to the weather and the exposed position of the deep valley gorge, the troops are said to have taken to exit through the high ports to the south, in order to continue in the search and destroy action against other rebels. There the locals were able to ambush the Muslim detachment, which was annihilated. The rest of its survivors continued south to the plains of Leon, leaving the maritime districts of Asturias exposed and weakened of defenders.|$|E
