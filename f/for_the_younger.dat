40|$|This work gives a {{comprehensive}} look on talk programmes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> in <b>the</b> offer of Czech Radio since 1992 to present. It focuses on characteristics of talk programmes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> across stations of Czech Radio (2, 3 and 6) and {{a summary of}} talk programmes of station <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Radio Wave. <b>The</b> offer of talk programmes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> since 1992 to present shows that Czech Radio since its inception deals with insufficient or imbalanced filling of the Act, which obliges Czech Radio in relation to young listeners. Its current offer could be considered sufficient but certainly not balanced. Prevailing journalistic talk programmes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> tend to expand their field of interest {{but on the other}} hand they deal with narrowing range of genres. Programmes Assault (Přepadení) and Demolition (Bourání) prove that talk programmes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> have <b>the</b> potention to enrich radio production in general with new topics and new forms. But talk programmes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> of Czech Radio are facing one crucial problem and that is of lack of audience in the age between 15 and 30. Some of necessary steps that will lead to improvement will probably be putting station <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> back to analogue broadcasting and extension of programmess <b>for</b> youth on <b>the</b> internet...|$|R

5|$|At that time, Syrgiannes and John Kantakouzenos {{bought for}} {{themselves}} governorships in Thrace, where discontent {{with the old}} emperor was rife, and they quickly mobilized support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Andronikos. Together with Alexios Apokaukos and Theodore Synadenos, they prepared to overthrow the aged Andronikos II in favour of his grandson. In Easter 1321, the younger Andronikos came to Adrianople, and the uprising broke out. Syrgiannes led a large army towards the capital, forcing the old emperor to negotiate. Consequently, on 6 June 1321, an agreement was reached which partitioned the empire. Young Andronikos III was recognized as co-emperor and given Thrace to govern as a quasi-appanage, setting up his court at Adrianople, while Andronikos II continued to rule from the capital, Constantinople, as senior emperor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E
5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official term <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E

5|$|Politically, the {{treatise}} was a success. At {{the time}} of writing On the Art of the Cinema, Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Kim to prepare for his succession. By authoring the work, Kim Jong-il gained social and political power. He secured his father's confidence, thus making succession possible. Kim Jong-il continued to write on the arts until the 1990s and published treatises On the Art of Opera (1974), On the Art of the Drama (1988), On the Art of Dance (1990), On the Art of Music (1991), On Fine Art (1991), On Architecture (1991), On Juche Literature (1992), and On Acrobatics.|$|E
5|$|Sebille {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps {{two weeks after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan. He began flight {{training}} in January 1942, in spite of being two months older than the cutoff age of 26, as the desperate need for pilots combined with Sebille's skills as a pilot allowed him to waive the age restriction. During that time he was described as an outstanding pilot and leader, and his maturity was helpful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> flight trainees. After completing flight training, Sebille was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 450th Bombardment Squadron, 322nd Bombardment Group 3rd Bombardment Wing at MacDill Field, Florida. Sebille flew B-26 Marauder aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Dave Finnegan {{was cast}} as Mickah Wallace, a belligerent and hot-tempered bouncer {{who becomes a}} drummer for the band. Parker's first meeting with Finnegan began civilly before their exchanges grew more and more heated. They soon became {{verbally}} abusive, threatening each other with disturbing acts of violence. Parker cast Finnegan immediately, explaining that he simply wanted to test the limits of Finnegan's aggression, as he wanted the truculence of the character to be convincing. Colm Meaney first learned of the film adaptation while working with Parker on Come See the Paradise. After Parker held auditions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> cast members, Meaney secured the role of Jimmy's father Jimmy Rabbitte, Sr. The audition scene in the film, in which various musicians audition at Jimmy Rabbitte's home, required more than 100 band members. Peter Rowen, brother of Irish artist Guggi, appears as a young skateboarding boy who asks to audition for the band. At {{the time of the}} film's production, Rowen had appeared on the cover art of U2's albums Boy (1980) and War (1983), and was a national skating champion.|$|E

5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E
