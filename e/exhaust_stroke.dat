25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke</b> in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E
2500|$|This sudden {{pulse of}} {{pressure}} causes the loud “choo” sound {{that members of}} the public associate with steam engines, because they mostly encounter engines at stations, where efficiency is sacrificed as trains pull away. [...] A steam engine well adjusted for efficiency makes a soft “hhHHhh” sound that lasts throughout the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke,</b> with the sounds from the two cylinders overlapping to produce a nearly constant sound.|$|E
2500|$|To {{simplify the}} engine and reduce costs, the V-twin {{ignition}} was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor. This {{is known as a}} dual fire ignition system, causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke, with the other spark plug firing on its cylinder's <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke,</b> effectively [...] "wasting a spark". The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of the subharmonic components occurrence in acoustic signal spectrum of internal combustion engines have been assumed. The main mechanism, in author’s opinion, is {{the interaction of}} acoustic fields, generated by single cylinders’ <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes,</b> through near fields, as well as complicated spatial pressure redistribution in manifold. These factors result in nonidentity of single <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes</b> both in amplitude and width. The numerical simulation has shown how one of these factors influences the subharmonic’ occurrence and their quantitative proportions...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Atkinson cycle {{piston engine}} allowed the intake, compression, power, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes</b> of the four-stroke cycle {{to occur in}} a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto cycle engines.|$|R
50|$|Scavenging {{is equally}} {{important}} for both two- and four-stroke engines. However {{it is more difficult}} to achieve in two-stroke engines, owing to the proximity, or even overlap, of their induction and <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes.</b> Scavenging is also equally important to both petrol and diesel engines.|$|R
2500|$|By comparison, a {{turbocharger}} {{does not}} place a direct mechanical {{load on the}} engine, although turbochargers place exhaust back pressure on engines, increasing pumping losses. This is more efficient because while the increased back pressure taxes the piston <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke,</b> much of the energy driving the turbine {{is provided by the}} still-expanding exhaust gas that would otherwise be wasted as heat through the tailpipe. In contrast to supercharging, the primary disadvantage of turbocharging is what is referred to as [...] "lag" [...] or [...] "spool time". This is the time between the demand for an increase in power (the throttle being opened) and the turbocharger(s) providing increased intake pressure, and hence increased power.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{innovations}} {{are currently}} available on various cars. In some models, {{rather than one}} central coil, there are individual coils on each spark plug, sometimes known as direct ignition or coil on plug (COP). This allows the coil a longer time to accumulate a charge between sparks, and therefore a higher energy spark. A variation on this has each coil handle two plugs, on cylinders which are 360 degrees out of phase (and therefore reach TDC at the same time); in the four-cycle engine this means that one plug will be sparking during {{the end of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke</b> while the other fires at the usual time, a so-called [...] "wasted spark" [...] arrangement which has no drawbacks apart from faster spark plug erosion; the paired cylinders are 1/4 and 2/3. Other systems do away with the distributor as a timing apparatus and use a magnetic crank angle sensor mounted on the crankshaft to trigger the ignition at the proper time.|$|E

5000|$|The wasted spark {{system is}} an {{ignition}} system {{used in some}} four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines.

5000|$|The GY6 {{design is}} a single-cylinder, {{four-stroke}} engine, in a near horizontal orientation. It is forced-air cooled, with a chain-driven overhead camshaft and a crossflow hemi head. Fuel metering is {{by a single}} constant-velocity style sidedraft carburetor, typically a Keihin CVK clone or similar. Ignition is by CDI, with a magnetic trigger on the flywheel. Because the trigger is on the flywheel instead of the cam, the ignition will fire on both the compression and <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes,</b> known as [...] "wasted spark" [...] ignition". An integrated magneto provides 50 V AC power for the CDI system and 20-30 V AC rectified and regulated to 12 V DC for chassis accessories (such as lighting), and to charge a battery.|$|R

50|$|By {{retarding}} the cams at idle or {{very low}} engine loads, you achieve a smoother, easier idle. From idle through medium engine loads, AVCS advances the intake valves to begin opening {{during the last}} part of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke,</b> when the exhaust valves are still slightly open.

40|$|Wave {{energy is}} one of the {{renewable}} energy sources with the highest potential. Several pilot plants have been built based on the principle of the Oscillating Water Column (OWC). Among the different solutions that have been suggested, the Wells turbine has gained particular attention due to its simplicity and reliability. The majority of available studies concentrate on the steady operation of the Wells turbine, while only few analyze its performance under an unsteady and bi-directional air flow, as determined by the presence of the OWC system. In this work, experimental and numerical performance of a high-solidity Wells turbine with NACA 0015 profiles under the bi-directional flow generated by a hydraulic piston is compared. The numerical simulations have been conducted using commercial CFD software and focus on unsteady predictions, with particular attention to the behavior of the flow upstream and down-stream of the rotor, flow hysteresis between acceleration and deceleration phases and differences between intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes</b> due to the non-symmetrical configuration of the machine...|$|R

50|$|One {{difficulty}} {{experienced at}} this time was that the low compression ratio also implied a low expansion ratio during the power <b>stroke.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> gases were thus still hot, hotter than a contemporary engine, and this led to frequent trouble with burnt exhaust valves.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a modern {{internal}} combustion engine {{requires the use of}} advanced analysis and development tools to carry an in-depth investigation on internal combustion process and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation by using high performance computers. In this work, the algorithm for moving or deformed mesh for a 1. 6 -litre four-cylinder four-stroke direct-injection engine has been developed. This type of mesh is required for transient simulation of fluid flow and combustion process inside the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. This mesh deforms with the movement of intake and exhaust valves as well as piston. Hence, the purpose of the work is to verify the moving mesh algorithm and to establish the correct mesh configuration at any crank angle. The simulation covers the full engine cycle consisting of intake, compression, power and <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes</b> and the orderof piston motion is set according to the firing order of the selected engine. The algorithm established defines events in which any of the designated engine components moves in terms of time and duration of occurence. The verification of teh algorithm was performed for the whole four-stroke cycle of 720 degree crack angle, where the position of the intake valve, exhaust valve, cylinder and piston were updated accordingly with respect to crack angle. The finalised algorithm and mesh can be used to simulate the in-cylinder fluid flow and internal combustion process for the full engine cycle...|$|R
50|$|During the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke,</b> {{scavenging}} {{occurred as}} the air moving past the cylinder exterior lowered the pressure inside due to the direct exposure of the exhaust port to the slipstream. The piston continued its <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke</b> until top dead center (TDC) was reached, but the valve remained open. The piston began to move down on its intake stroke with the valve still open, pulling new air into the cylinder. It remained open until it was {{two-thirds of the way}} down, at which point the valve closed and the remainder of the intake stroke greatly reduced the air pressure. When the piston uncovered the transfer ports again, the low pressure in the cylinder drew in the balance of the charge.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{deactivate}} a cylinder, the exhaust valve is prevented from opening after the power stroke and the exhaust gas charge is {{retained in the}} cylinder and compressed during the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke.</b> Following the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke,</b> the intake valve is prevented from opening. The exhaust gas in the cylinder is expanded and compressed {{over and over again}} and acts like a gas spring. As multiple cylinders are shut off at a time (cylinders 1, 4, 6 and 7 for a V8), the power required for compression of the exhaust gas in one cylinder is countered by the decompression of retained exhaust gas in another. When more power is called for, the exhaust valve is reactivated and the old exhaust gas is expelled during the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke.</b> The intake valve is likewise reactivated and normal engine operation is resumed. The net effect of cylinder deactivation is an improvement in fuel economy and likewise a reduction in exhaust emissions. General Motors was the first to modify existing, production engines to enable cylinder deactivation, with the introduction of the Cadillac L62 [...] "V8-6-4" [...] in 1981.|$|E
50|$|A stroke is {{the action}} of a piston {{travelling}} {{the full length of}} its cylinder. In a two-stroke engine, one of the two strokes combines the intake stroke and the compression stroke, while the other stroke combines the combustion stroke and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Atkinson {{produced}} {{three different}} designs {{that had a}} short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The first Atkinson-cycle engine, the differential engine, used opposed pistons. The second and most well-known design, was the cycle engine, which used an over-center arm to create four piston strokes in one crankshaft revolution. The reciprocating engine had the intake, compression, power, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>strokes</b> of the four-stroke cycle in a single turn of the crankshaft, and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines. Atkinson's third and final engine, the utilite engine, operated much like any two-stroke engine. The common thread throughout Atkinson's designs is that the engines have an expansion stroke that is longer than the compression stroke, and by this method the engine achieves greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine. Atkinson's engines were produced by the British Gas Engine Company and also licensed to other overseas manufacturers. Many modern engines now use unconventional valve timing to produce {{the effect of a}} shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, Miller applied this technique to the four-stroke engine, so it is sometimes referred as the Atkinson/Miller cycle, US patent 2817322 dated Dec 24, 1957. In 1888, Charon filed a French patent and displayed an engine at the Paris Exhibition in 1889. The Charon gas engine (four- stroke) used a similar cycle to Miller, but without a supercharger. It {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Charon cycle" [...] Modern engine designers are realizing the potential fuel-efficiency improvements the Atkinson-type cycle can provide.|$|R
50|$|A {{two-stroke}} engine {{does not have}} a discrete <b>exhaust</b> and intake <b>stroke</b> and thus is incapable of self-aspiration.
