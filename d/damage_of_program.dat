40|$|Bile acids (BA) are {{signaling}} molecules with pleiotropic paracrine and endocrine functions (for recent reviews see [1 - 4] {{and references}} herein).

40|$|TP 53 gene {{is known}} as the "guardian of the genome" as it plays a vital role in {{regulating}} cell cycle, cell proliferation, DNA <b>damage</b> repair, initiation <b>of</b> <b>programmed</b> cell death and suppressing tumor growth. Non uniform usage of synonymous codons for a specific amino acid during translation of protein known as codon usage bias (CUB) is a unique property of the genome and shows species specific deviation. Analysis of codon usage bias with compositional dynamics of coding sequences has contributed to the better understanding of the molecular mechanism and the evolution of a particular gene. In this study, the complete nucleotide coding sequences of TP 53 gene from eight different mammalian species were used for CUB analysis. Our results showed that the codon usage patterns in TP 53 gene across different mammalian species has been influenced by GC bias particularly GC 3 and a moderate bias exists in the codon usage of TP 53 gene. Moreover, we observed that nature has highly favored the most over represented codon CTG for leucine amino acid but selected against the ATA codon for isoleucine in TP 53 gene across all mammalian species during the course of evolution...|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{shows that}} IMF {{programs}} hurt {{economic growth in}} the short run and finds no evidence that they help in the long run (Przeworski and Vreeland 2000). Why would governments choose to enter into programs that lower growth? It turns out that the <b>damaging</b> effects <b>of</b> IMF <b>programs</b> may not be evenly distributed. Two studies on the effects <b>of</b> IMF <b>programs</b> on income distribution find that they are negative (Pastor 1987 a,b, Garuda 2000). So while {{the economy as a whole}} may suffer under the IMF, some groups may not be hurt at all. Using a dynamic version of the Heckman selection model, I study the effect <b>of</b> IMF <b>programs</b> on the labor share of income from manufacturing. The income of capital from manufacturing is found to increase when the government participates in an IMF program even though overall economic growth declines. This conclusion is supported by 2, 095 observations of 110 countries from 1961 to 1993.

Understanding the severity <b>of</b> the <b>damages</b> and the magnitude of the recovery efforts are important for both private and public decision makers deploying resources in the affected area. This paper provides initial estimates <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> in a number of infrastructure categories and residential and commercial structures, content and equipment. The estimation is based upon earlier analysis (Burton and Hicks, 2003) which provided an economic model <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> based upon the upper Mississippi floods of 1993. Specifically we estimate that Hurricane Katrina has generated commercial structure <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 21 Billion, commercial equipment <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 36 Billion, residential structure and content <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> almost $ 75 Billion, electric utility <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 231 Million, highway <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 3 Billion, sewer system <b>damages</b> <b>of</b> $ 1. 2 Billion and commercial revenue losses of $ 4. 6 Billion.
