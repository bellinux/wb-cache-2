5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted <b>hyena</b> {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the <b>hyena</b> uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted <b>hyena</b> is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped <b>hyena.</b> Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the <b>hyena</b> can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the <b>hyena</b> was held in high regard among the Magi, and that <b>hyena</b> body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted <b>hyena</b> mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted <b>hyena</b> usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted <b>hyena</b> mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed <b>hyena</b> with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted <b>hyena</b> faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a <b>hyena</b> relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>hyena</b> (cave <b>hyena</b> subspecies) is {{depicted}} in {{a few examples of}} Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a <b>hyena</b> outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's steeped profile, it is thought that the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a <b>hyena.</b> In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a <b>hyena</b> is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and {{is depicted}} in profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ariège shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal’s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the spotted <b>hyena,</b> as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that evokes a smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a spotted <b>hyena</b> based on its broad muzzle and long neck.|$|E
50|$|Other predators such as African leopards, East African {{wild dogs}} and <b>hyenas</b> also {{threaten}} the cheetahs. Spotted and striped <b>hyenas</b> frequently scavenges from the cheetah kills, and the cheetahs would surrender their meals to the incoming <b>hyenas</b> without a fight.|$|R
50|$|Attacks {{on humans}} by spotted <b>hyenas</b> are underreported. A pair of <b>hyenas</b> were {{responsible}} for killing 27 people in Mulanje, Malawi in 1962. In 1910 spotted <b>hyenas</b> were observed to kill sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps.|$|R
5000|$|In AdventureQuest Worlds, the War <b>Hyenas</b> are {{humanoid}} <b>hyenas</b> {{that are}} similar to the Gnolls and reside in the Sandsea.|$|R
5|$|As for the Indian lion, {{sympatric}} predators {{include the}} Indian leopard, mugger crocodile, Golden jackal and striped <b>hyena.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cheech Marin as Banzai, an {{aggressive}} and hot-headed <b>hyena</b> prone to complaining and acting on impulse.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised {{the differences between}} the spotted and striped <b>hyena.</b> However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted <b>hyena</b> converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, <b>hyena</b> biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one <b>hyena</b> researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.|$|E
5|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four <b>hyenas</b> killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted <b>hyenas</b> primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for <b>hyenas,</b> especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted <b>hyenas</b> attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|R
50|$|The few {{carnivores}} {{preying on}} hartebeests in southern Africa include lions, spotted <b>hyenas,</b> leopards, and cheetahs. However, hartebeests {{are not the}} primary food source {{of any of these}} species, particularly spotted <b>hyenas.</b> Lions only consume hartebeests for about 7% of their diets, <b>hyenas</b> consume hartebeests in 3.5%, cheetahs consume hartebeests in 1.75%, and leopards consume hartebeests in 6.25% of their diets. Lions typically prey on adult males, while both spotted <b>hyenas</b> and leopards tend to prey on young calves. These predatory habits are likely attributed to the difficulty of catching nomadic hartebeests, as well as the better success <b>hyenas</b> and leopards have with catching calves.|$|R
50|$|The film also {{describes}} Richardson’s {{relationship with}} spotted <b>hyenas</b> native to South Africa. Richardson communicates affectionately the logistics {{and differences between}} lions and spotted <b>hyenas.</b> He comments on the strict hierarchy in a clan of <b>hyenas</b> {{as well as his}} own standing within specific clans. He goes on to defend <b>hyenas</b> when he rejects the prejudice that they are aggressive scavengers when he describes the mammal as misunderstood and calls out individual <b>hyenas</b> as “loving”, “friendly”, “gorgeous”, and with having a “lovely personality.” Richardson admits that when he first came in contact with <b>hyenas</b> {{he did not know what}} he was getting into however goes on to explain the joy they have contributed to his life. Throughout the short film Richardson brings attention to the contemporary issues and consequences surrounding the loss of wildlife habitats in South Africa.|$|R
5|$|Spotted <b>hyena</b> {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in <b>hyena</b> {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted <b>hyena</b> further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted <b>hyena</b> clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The {{ancestors of}} the spotted <b>hyena</b> probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, {{as is the case}} for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted <b>hyena</b> clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females. Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the giant short-faced <b>hyena.</b> As {{there is no evidence of}} environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced <b>hyena</b> became extinct due to competition with the spotted <b>hyena.</b>|$|E
5|$|The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It {{is scarce}} or absent in {{tropical}} rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, {{it occurs in}} riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted <b>hyena</b> outnumbers other large carnivores, including other <b>hyena</b> species. However, the striped and brown <b>hyena</b> occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.|$|E
5|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> usually keep a safe {{distance}} from Nile crocodiles. Though they readily take to water to catch and store prey, <b>hyenas</b> will avoid crocodile-infested waters.|$|R
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} <b>hyenas,</b> though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. <b>Hyenas</b> do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four <b>hyenas</b> were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|R
25|$|Though {{attacks on}} live humans are rare, striped <b>hyenas</b> will {{scavenge}} on human corpses. In Turkey, stones {{are placed on}} graves to stop <b>hyenas</b> digging the bodies out. In World War I, the Turks imposed conscription (safar barlek) on mount Lebanon; people escaping from the conscription fled north, where many died and were subsequently eaten by <b>hyenas.</b>|$|R
5|$|The spotted <b>hyena</b> (Crocuta crocuta), {{also known}} as the {{laughing}} <b>hyena,</b> is a species of <b>hyena,</b> currently classed as the sole member of the genus Crocuta, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching. The species may have originated in Asia, and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years {{until the end of the}} Late Pleistocene. The spotted <b>hyena</b> is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt, its more dual purposed dentition, its fewer nipples and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>hyena</b> {{has been}} hunted for its body parts {{for use in}} {{traditional}} medicine, for amusement, and for sport, though this is rare, as the species is generally not considered attractive. There is fossil evidence of humans in Middle Pleistocene Europe butchering and presumably consuming spotted hyenas. Such incidences are rare in modern Africa, where most tribes, even those known to eat unusual kinds of meat, generally despise <b>hyena</b> flesh.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>hyena</b> is {{a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted <b>hyena</b> makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted <b>hyena</b> displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyenas</b> do {{not raise}} their legs as canids do when urinating, as {{urination}} serves no territorial function for them. Instead, <b>hyenas</b> mark their territories using their anal glands, a trait found also in viverrids and mustelids, but not canids and felids. Unlike other female mammals, female spotted <b>hyenas</b> urinate, copulate, and give birth through an organ called the pseudo-penis.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hyenas</b> feature {{prominently}} in the folklore and mythology of human cultures {{with which they are}} sympatric. <b>Hyenas</b> are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt. In some cultures, <b>hyenas</b> are thought to influence people’s spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children. Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in traditional African medicine.|$|R

5|$|The spotted <b>hyena</b> is {{the most}} {{carnivorous}} member of the Hyaenidae. Unlike its brown and striped cousins, the spotted <b>hyena</b> is a predator, not a scavenger; this has been shown since the 1960s. One of the earliest studies to demonstrate their hunting abilities was done by Hans Kruuk, an African wildlife ecologist, and he showed through a 7-year study of <b>hyena</b> populations in Africa that spotted hyenas hunt as much as lions, and with later studies this {{has been shown to}} be the average in all areas of Africa. However spotted hyenas remain being mislabeled as scavengers, often even by ecologists and wildlife documentary channels.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>hyena</b> is {{the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours. Its social {{organisation}} is unlike {{that of any other}} carnivore, bearing closer resemblance to that of cercopithecine primates (baboons and macaques) with respect to group-size, hierarchical structure, and frequency of social interaction among both kin and unrelated group-mates. However, the social system of the spotted <b>hyena</b> is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted <b>hyena</b> society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted <b>hyena.</b> There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and eating a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young <b>hyena</b> was killed by the leopard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyenas</b> feature {{prominently}} in the folklore and mythology of human cultures {{with which they are}} sympatric. <b>Hyenas</b> are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt, and are associated with witchcraft, because their body parts are used as ingredients in traditional medicine. In some cultures, <b>hyenas</b> are thought to influence people’s spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children.|$|R
50|$|Though {{attacks on}} live humans are rare, striped <b>hyenas</b> will {{scavenge}} on human corpses. In Turkey, stones {{are placed on}} graves to stop <b>hyenas</b> digging the bodies out. In World War I, the Turks imposed conscription (safar barlek) on mount Lebanon; people escaping from the conscription fled north, where many died and were subsequently eaten by <b>hyenas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> usually keep a safe {{distance}} from Nile crocodiles. Though they readily take to water to catch and store prey, <b>hyenas</b> will avoid crocodile infested waters.|$|R
5|$|Fossils of a {{range of}} animals have been found {{including}} the Pleistocene lion (Felis leo spelæ), Cave <b>hyena</b> (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) and Badger (Meles meles). Wookey Hole was occupied by humans in the Iron Age, possibly around 250-300 BC, while nearby <b>Hyena</b> Cave was occupied by Stone Age hunters. Badger Hole and Rhinoceros Hole are two dry caves on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age. Just outside the cave the foundations of a 1st-century hut have been identified. These had been built on during the Roman era up {{to the end of the}} 4th century.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} <b>hyena</b> is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific <b>hyena</b> species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted <b>hyena</b> as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the striped}} <b>hyena,</b> {{for which a}} number of {{subspecies}} were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the spotted <b>hyena</b> is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised {{that all of this}} variation could be applied to individual differences in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted <b>hyena</b> skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking.|$|E
25|$|For {{protection}} from land predators, the plains zebra retreats into open areas with good visibility at night. When the groups forage or sleep, one zebra will keep watch, {{and if a}} predator is spotted, it will bark or snort loudly. When being hunted by <b>hyenas</b> or wild dogs, a zebra harem stays close together and cooperates to protect threatened members, particularly the young. The harem stallion will go on the offensive and attack the dogs or <b>hyenas.</b> Though <b>hyenas</b> may harass the stallion, they usually only concentrate on the herd, and attempt to dodge the stallion's assaults. Unlike stallions, mares typically only react aggressively to <b>hyenas</b> or dogs when their foals are threatened. Unlike wildebeest, zebras rarely take to water when escaping <b>hyenas.</b> With lions, a zebra's best defense is to outpace them, as lions do not have as much endurance as <b>hyenas</b> or wild dogs. Cheetahs and leopards are mostly threats to foals, as an adult zebra is fully capable of driving them away.|$|R
50|$|Brown <b>hyenas</b> are {{primarily}} scavengers {{the bulk of}} whose diet consists of carcasses killed by larger predators, but they may supplement their diet with rodents, insects, eggs, fruit and fungi (the desert truffle Kalaharituber pfeilii). They are however poor hunters, and live prey makes up only {{a small proportion of}} their diet: in the southern Kalahari, species such as springhare, springbok lambs, bat-eared foxes and korhaan species constitute only 4.2% of their overall diet, while on the Namib coast, cape fur seal pups compose 2.9% of their food. They have an exceptional sense of smell and can locate carcasses kilometers away. Brown <b>hyenas</b> are aggressive scavengers, frequently appropriating the kills of black-backed jackals, cheetahs, and leopards. Single brown <b>hyenas</b> may charge at leopards with their jaws held wide open and can tree adult male leopards; they have been observed treeing leopards even when no kill was in contention. In the Kalahari Desert, brown <b>hyenas</b> are often the dominant mammalian carnivores present because of this dominance behavior and the relative scarcity of lions, spotted <b>hyenas,</b> and packs of African wild dogs. In areas where they overlap, brown <b>hyenas</b> may on rare occasions be killed by spotted <b>hyenas</b> and lions.|$|R
500|$|While female spotted <b>hyenas</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as hermaphrodites or as intersex, and scientists of antiquity (ancient and later historical times) believed that they were hermaphrodites, modern scientists do not refer to them as such. That designation is typically reserved for those who simultaneously exhibit features of both sexes; the genetic makeup of female spotted <b>hyenas</b> [...] "are clearly distinct" [...] from male spotted <b>hyenas.</b>|$|R
