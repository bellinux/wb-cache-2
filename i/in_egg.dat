5|$|Although most serpins control {{proteolytic}} cascades, some proteins with a serpin structure are not enzyme inhibitors, {{but instead}} perform diverse {{functions such as}} storage (as <b>in</b> <b>egg</b> white—ovalbumin), transport as in hormone carriage proteins (thyroxine-binding globulin, cortisol-binding globulin) and molecular chaperoning (HSP47). The term serpin is used to describe these members as well, despite their non-inhibitory function, since they are evolutionarily related.|$|E

5|$|Temnothorax unifasciatus, a myrmicinid ant, {{has been}} shown not to have {{collective}} worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions <b>in</b> <b>egg</b> laying are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{in urban}} areas {{contains}} the residues of past land-uses and practices. Urban farming (keeping chickens, vegetable gardening) requires soil disturbance and can increase exposure of residents to these contaminants. We measured the level of lead, arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc contaminants <b>in</b> soil and <b>eggs</b> from 26 backyard chicken coops across the Lower Hunter, NSW Australia. We compared the levels of metals in soil to Health Investigation Levels and metals <b>in</b> home-grown <b>eggs</b> to the levels <b>in</b> commercial <b>eggs</b> tested <b>in</b> this study or published by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. The levels of arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc were low, both in soil and <b>in</b> home-grown <b>eggs</b> and were comparable to commercial <b>eggs</b> tested <b>in</b> this study. The Health Investigation Level for lead in soil (300 mg lead/kg soil) was exceeded at 7 of the 26 sites. The level of lead <b>in</b> home-grown <b>eggs</b> was generally higher than <b>in</b> commercial <b>eggs.</b> The reference health standard for meat (including chicken), fruit and vegetables of 0. 1 mg lead/kg produce was exceeded <b>in</b> home-grown <b>eggs</b> from 7 of the 26 sites. There was {{a significant relationship between}} the lead level <b>in</b> <b>eggs</b> and the lead level in soil accessible to chickens. As soil lead increased, concentrations of lead <b>in</b> <b>eggs</b> tended to increase. No relationship was detected between the lead level in feed and <b>in</b> <b>eggs.</b> We recommend strategies to reduce ingestion of soil by chickens thereby reducing metal contamination <b>in</b> home-grown <b>eggs...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J.

The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway along the corridor.

5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein <b>in</b> <b>egg</b> white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

Additionally, concentrations of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TCDD-EQs) {{were determined by}} use of relative potency factors (TEQs) or the H 4 IIE-luc bioassay TCDD-EQs.

5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies <b>in</b> <b>egg</b> yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
5|$|US30 heads {{southeast}} into Hammonton, Atlantic County, {{continuing through}} rural areas with increasing development. The road comes to its intersection with the southern terminus US206 {{and the northern}} terminus of Route54. A short distance later, the route has a concurrency with CR542 that begins adjacent to the former Atlanticare - Kessler Memorial Hospital that closed in 2009 and passes by Hammonton Lake. US30 turns south-southwest past the CR542 concurrency before heading south. The route crosses CR561 and turns southeast again, entering Mullica Township. Here, the White Horse Pike enters more forested areas with a few buildings, running a short distance to the northeast of the Atlantic City Line. Past the intersection with CR623 in the developed community of Elwood, US30 becomes a divided highway with grass median and jughandles. This configuration continues until Egg Harbor City, when the median ends. <b>In</b> <b>Egg</b> Harbor City, US30 passes a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting Route50 and CR563 {{in the center of}} town. At this point, CR563 forms a concurrency with US30 and the two routes continue through more of the town before crossing into Galloway Township at the intersection with CR674. The road passes through rural areas with some development, reaching the community of Cologne. In this area, there is a crossroads with CR614 before CR563 splits from US30 by turning south onto Tilton Road. Past Cologne, the road reaches a junction with CR575 in the developed community of Pomona.|$|E
