25|$|Ice {{crystals}} in {{the fuel}} were blamed {{as the cause}} of the accident, clogging the <b>fuel-oil</b> heat exchanger (FOHE) of each engine. This restricted fuel flow to the engines when thrust was demanded during the final approach to Heathrow. Boeing identified the problem as specific to the Rolls-Royce engine <b>fuel-oil</b> heat exchangers, and Rolls-Royce subsequently developed a modification to its FOHE; the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) mandated that all affected aircraft were to be fitted with the modification before 1 January 2011.|$|E
25|$|This {{accumulation}} of ice {{had no effect}} on the flight until the final stages of the approach into Heathrow, when increased fuel flow and higher temperatures suddenly released it back into the fuel. This formed a slush of soft ice which flowed forward until it reached the <b>Fuel-Oil</b> Heat Exchangers (FOHEs) where it froze once again, causing a restriction in the flow of fuel to the engines.|$|E
40|$|Heavy <b>fuel-oils,</b> used engine {{oils and}} animal fat {{can be used}} as dense, viscous {{combustibles}} within industrial boilers. Burning these combustibles {{in the form of an}} emulsion with water enables to decrease the flame length and the formation of carbonaceous residue, in comparison with raw combustibles. These effects are due to the secondary atomization among the spray, which is a consequence of the micro-explosion phenomenon. This phenomenon acts in a single emulsion droplet by the fast (< 0. 1 ms) vaporization of the inside water droplets, leading to complete disintegration of the whole emulsion droplet. First, the present work demonstrates a model of spray combustion of raw fuel. Secondly, the spray combustion of water-in-oil emulsified fuel is exposed to the same burning conditions, taking into account the micro-explosion phenomenon. Finally, the comparison between the results with and without second atomization shows some similar qualitative tendencies with experimental measurements from the literature...|$|R

25|$|On 11 March 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board issued urgent safety {{recommendation}} SB-09-11 {{calling for the}} redesign of the <b>fuel-oil</b> heat exchangers used on Rolls-Royce Trent 800 Series engines. A build-up of ice from water naturally occurring in the fuel had caused a restriction {{of the flow of}} fuel to the engines of G-YMMM. Rolls-Royce had already started on redesigning the component, with an in-service date of March 2010 at the latest. All affected engines were to be fitted with the redesigned component within six months of its certification. In May 2010 the Airworthiness Directive was extended to cover the Trent 500 and 700 series engines as well.|$|E

50|$|LPG {{has a lower}} {{energy density}} per liter than either petrol or <b>fuel-oil,</b> so the {{equivalent}} fuel consumption is higher. Many governments impose less tax on LPG than on petrol or <b>fuel-oil,</b> which helps offset the greater consumption of LPG than of petrol or <b>fuel-oil.</b> However, in many European countries this tax break is often compensated by a much higher annual tax on cars using LPG than on cars using petrol or <b>fuel-oil.</b> Propane is the third most widely used motor fuel in the world. 2013 estimates are that over 24.9 million vehicles are fueled by propane gas worldwide. Over 25 million tonnes (over 9 billion US gallons) are used annually as a vehicle fuel.|$|E

50|$|On 17 January 2008, a British Airways Boeing 777-236ER, {{operating}} as flight number BA038 from Beijing to London, crash-landed at Heathrow after both Trent 800 engines lost power during the aircraft's final approach with no fatalities.
