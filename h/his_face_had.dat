5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} his rule, Sukarno's lack of {{interest}} in economics created a distance between himself and the Indonesian people, who were suffering economically. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> become bloated by disease and his flamboyance and sexual conquests – which had once endeared him to the people – caused public criticism and turned support towards the army.|$|E
25|$|In his Annals of the Former World, John McPhee repeats a {{story told}} to {{geologist}} David Love in the 1930s by Love's family doctor, Francis Smith, M.D., when Love was a doctoral student. Smith {{stated that he}} had just seen Cassidy who told him that <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been altered by a surgeon in Paris, and that he showed Smith a repaired bullet wound that Smith recognized as work he had previously done on Cassidy.|$|E

25|$|While {{his sexual}} {{orientation}} {{was known to}} friends, colleagues and constituents, in 1987 the News of the World ran an issue that attempted to 'out' Mandelson as gay. Mandelson preferred to keep his personal life private, and did not respond. In 1998, again, Mandelson was outed by Matthew Parris in 1998 on the BBC programme Newsnight. This led to press harassment of his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, with the Daily Express sending a reporter {{to take pictures of}} him while he was at his languages course. An internal investigation later found that the photos had been obtained without Avila da Silva's consent, and images of him attempting to cover <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been secretly deleted.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} give Thanos [...] "the {{performance}} and the weight that he deserved", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his [...] "eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>had</b> [...] "to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face." ...|$|E
500|$|... "He {{was beyond}} the age of fifty, {{he was more than}} fifty, and {{standing}} upright he measured about eight feet. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> a golden tan, arched brows, a pair of bright eyes, a regular head form, a square mouth, a pair of protruding ears, and under his chin there were three locks of beard, a grizzled beard. On his head he wore a sky-blue satin scarf, and he was dressed in a stately sky-blue satin coat with a silken girdle, a pair of wide black trousers without crotch and satin boots with thin soles".|$|E

500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E
500|$|During the Christmas {{season of}} 1938, an alien {{spacecraft}} approaches Earth ready {{to destroy it}} when it suddenly explodes courtesy of the Doctor who escapes the ship and then falls to Earth by rapidly donning an impact space suit, though in his haste, the helmet is put on backwards. On crashing to Earth, he is found by Madge Arwell (Claire Skinner), wife of Reg (Alexander Amstrong) {{and mother of two}} children, Lily (Holly Earl) and Cyril (Maurice Cole). She helps the Doctor to his TARDIS, and the Doctor promises to repay her for her kindness. Three years later, during World War II, Reg is reported missing in action when the Lancaster bomber he was piloting disappeared over the English Channel. Madge is told this via telegram just before Christmas, but decides not to tell her children yet, hoping to keep their spirits up through the holiday. Madge and the children evacuate London to a relative's house in Dorset, where they are greeted by the Doctor, calling himself [...] "the Caretaker"; Madge does not recognise him from their previous encounter, as <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been hidden by the backwards helmet.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was known}} to set a number of {{aviation}} records. In 1927 he made the first [...] non-stop flight from Mexico City to Juarez (1200 miles). While in Sonora, he crashed and <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> to be reassembled with platinum screws. At age 22, on May 2425, 1928, he set {{the record for the}} third longest non-stop solo flight by flying 1,575 miles (3000km) from San Diego, California to Mexico City in 18.5 h. His safe arrival completed the longest non-stop flight by a Mexican. He was greeted by Plutarco Calles, then President of Mexico.|$|E

On few occasions, however, <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>has</b> at least partially been seen.|$|R

2500|$|With Williams' {{assistance}} Harlow shaved {{the scalp}} {{around the region}} of the tamping iron's exit, then removed coagulated blood, small bone fragments, and an ounce [...] of protruding brain. After probing for foreign bodies and replacing two large detached pieces of bone, Harlow closed the wound with adhesive straps, leaving it partially open for drainage; the entrance wound in the cheek was bandaged only loosely, for the same reason. A wet [...] was applied, then a nightcap, then further bandaging to secure these dressings. Harlow also dressed Gage's hands and forearms (which along with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "deeply burned") and ordered that Gage's head be kept elevated.|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, 1969, Hinman {{was found}} murdered in his home. <b>His</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been deeply slashed {{on the left}} side and he had two stab wounds to the chest. Hinman's house had been ransacked and the words [...] "Political Piggy" [...] written and a paw print (intended to be {{symbolic}} of the Black Panther Party) drawn on the wall in his blood. Both of Hinman's vehicles were missing: a Volkswagen van and a Fiat station wagon. On August 5, 1969, Beausoleil was found by the California Highway Patrol asleep in the back of Hinman's Fiat near San Luis Obispo, California. Beausoleil had a sheath knife attached to his belt.

2500|$|John Jakala from Anime News Network (ANN) was {{surprised}} by its first chapter because {{of the absence of}} on-screen appearance of the main character on it. He considered it [...] "a daring move" [...] but said [...] "it pays off: I found myself anxious to meet Sakuragi, and curious to see how he will deal with all of the political crises erupting around him." [...] However, Jakala affirmed the first actual appearance of Sakuragi probably would be more impactaful if <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> not been showed on a Jumbotron {{at the end of the}} chapter. [...] "Still, it was a cute bit", he said. The third chapter had [...] "a very powerful" [...] scene about the formation of a lifelong friendship between Sakuragi and a childhood's friend. Jakala deemed it [...] "inspirational without becoming overly sentimental". On the other hand, he criticized the [...] "'excited' word balloons" [...] in uppercase that seem to be shouting at him as [...] "painfully purple". In the end, Jakala said that [...] "certain situations or lines seem a bit too melodramatic, but overall the series maintains an engaging tone". About its tone, Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics stated it [...] "feature overly dramatic theatrics in the forms of speeches and actions by the protagonist" [...] — which led to a comparison to [...]|$|E
