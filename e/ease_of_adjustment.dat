50|$|The {{beauty of}} the SU lies in its {{simplicity}} and lack of multiple jets and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Adjustment is accomplished by altering the starting position of the jet relative to the needle on a fine screw (26TPI for most pre-HIF versions). At first sight, the principle appears to bear a similarity {{to that of the}} slide carburettor, which was previously used on many motorcycles. The slide carburettor has the same piston and main needle as an SU carburettor, however the piston/needle position is directly actuated by a physical connection to the throttle cable rather than indirectly by venturi airflow as with an SU carburettor. This piston actuation difference is the significant distinction between a slide and an SU carburettor. The piston in a slide carburettor is controlled by the operator's demands rather than the demands of the engine. This means that the metering of the fuel can be inaccurate unless the vehicle is travelling at a constant speed at a constant throttle setting - conditions rarely encountered except on motorways. This inaccuracy results in fuel waste, particularly as the carburettor must be set slightly rich to avoid a lean condition (which can cause engine damage). For this reason Japanese motorcycle manufacturers ceased to fit slide carbs and substituted constant-depression carbs, which are essentially miniature SUs. It is also possible - indeed, easy - to retrofit an SU carburettor to a bike that was originally manufactured with a slide carburettor, and obtain improved fuel economy and more tractable low-speed behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — For antennas {{to radiate}} at maximum efficiency, their {{dimensions}} {{must be on}} the same order as the radiated wavelength. At frequencies below 30 MHz, antennas with efficient radiation are often too large for mobile and portable applications. Smaller antennas can be made to radiate efficiently by use of matching networks. For installation convenience and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> these networks are usually placed between the transmitter and the antenna input; but it has been found that for best radiation efficiency, matching network elements should be placed at points on the antenna structure. Unfortunately, such matching networks must be tuned for each transmitting frequency and, when mounted on the antenna, they cannot easily be tuned. A meander element antenna was found to present some electrical and mechanical properties allowing convenient placement of tuning elements when configured as an electrically small transmitting antenna. Some simplified design guidelines were derived from experimental data. Index Terms—Antennas, electrically small antennas. I...|$|E

40|$|Advances in Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) {{composite}} materials and chair-side CAD-CAM systems offer a new landscape for the implant dentistry. Digital workflows are increasingly used, especially for single-unit restorations, and they allow straightforward and cost-effective protocols that improve patient satisfaction. The efficacy of immediate loading on single implants {{has been demonstrated}} (1, 2). Currently, to 12 promote osseointegration, the use of resin-based provisional crowns out of occlusion is recommended for immediate loading. Such protocols require several appointments and a significant contribution of the dentist and the lab technician, which affects overall treatment cost. On the other hand, CAD-CAM composites, especially Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic Network (PICN), are now competing with ceramics for definitive single-unit restorations, notably due to their better machinability (faster and in lower-thickness milling, with les edge chipping) (3) (4), the absence of post-milling firing and the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> in-mouth <b>adjustments.</b> In particular, their higher resilience and lower elasticity modulus could indicate them for immediate loading of implants.

40|$|Purpose: The study {{examined}} the factors that might contribute to {{the ease with which}} marketing executives in UK charities who have been promoted to senior general management positions adjust to the occupancy of these roles. Design/methodology/approach: Thirty-seven individuals with functional marketing backgrounds currently holding top general management positions in large fundraising charities were interviewed using a frame-worked occupational autobiographic narrative approach. The research was informed by aspects <b>of</b> newcomer <b>adjustment</b> theory, notably uncertainty reduction theory. Findings: Social and personal considerations were much more important determinants <b>of</b> the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> assimilation into top management positions in charities than were technical job-related matters. Role ambiguity constituted the main barrier to smooth adjustment. Mentoring, planned induction programmes, the nature of a person’s past work experience and the individual’s social status critically affected how readily a marketer fitted into a top management role. Disparate sets of factors influenced different elements <b>of</b> managerial newcomer <b>adjustment</b> (role clarity, self-efficacy and social acceptance). Research limitations/implications: As the participants in the study needed to satisfy certain narrowly defined criteria and to work in a single sector (large fundraising charities) the sample was necessarily small. It was not possible to explore the effects on operational performance of varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> newcomer <b>adjustment.</b> Practical implications: Individuals promoted to top management posts in charities should try psychologically to break with the past and should not be afraid of projecting a strong functional professional identity to their new peers. These recommendations can be expected to apply to organisations in general which, like large charities, need senior management mentoring and induction programmes to assist recently promoted individuals from function-specific backgrounds; job descriptions for top management posts that are clear and embody realistic expectations; and ‘shadowing’ and training activities for newly appointed senior managers with function-specific backgrounds. Originality/value: The study is the first to apply newcomer adjustment theory to the assimilation of functional managers into more senior general management. It examines a broader range of potential variables affecting managerial newcomer adjustment than has previously been considered. Relevant issues are examined {{in the context of an}} important sector: fundraising charities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, {{classical}} washout {{filters are}} extensively used in commercial motion simulators. Even {{though there are}} several advantages for classical washout filters, such as short processing time, simplicity and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> they have several shortcomings. The main disadvantage is the fixed scheme and parameters of the classical washout filter cause inflexibility of the structure and thus the resulting simulator fails to suit all circumstances. Moreover, it is a conservative approach and the platform cannot be fully exploited. The aim {{of this research is}} to present a fuzzy logic approach and take the human perception error into account in the classical motion cueing algorithm, in order to improve both the physical limits of restitution and realistic human sensations. The fuzzy compensator signal is applied to adjust the filtered signals on the longitudinal and rotational channels online, as well as the tilt coordination to minimize the vestibular sensation error below the human perception threshold. The results indicate that the proposed fuzzy logic controllers significantly minimize the drawbacks of having fixed parameters and conservativeness in the classical washout filter. In addition, the performance of motion cueing algorithm and human perception for most occasions is improved...|$|E

They require a tenth of the reagent quantities needed in conventional protocols and may be analyzed using standard transmission-based microplate readers. Preliminary results using this technique have yielded observable color gradients with distinctly linear trends.

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{development of}} the magnetorheological (MR) valve has successfully introduced a new high-performance compact-class MR valve using a meandering flow path structure. Aside from the performance improvement, in real applications, the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> performance <b>adjustment</b> {{also needs to be}} improved. This study focused on {{the development of a new}} design of a modular MR valve using a meandering flow path to improve the adjustability of the valve performance. The approach is proposed based on the high-performance advantages of a meandering flow path structure, while at the same time utilizing the benefit of the modular structure in terms of performance flexibility. In order to evaluate the performance of the modular structure, the analytical assessment was conducted for three different module stages: the single-stage module, the double-stage module, and triple-stage module. To predict the strength of the magnetic field in the effective area, the magnetic simulation was conducted through an open-source software called the FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics). The quasi-steady mathematical model of the proposed valve was also derived to conduct the analytical assessment as well as to predict the valve performance. In order to validate the simulation results, the prototypes of the proposed valve are experimentally tested with the aid of the hydraulic cylinder on a dynamic test machine. The results of the MR valve assessment from both the simulation and experimental test demonstrated that the pressure drop rating of the meandering type MR valve can be easily modified using modular structure by changing the number of module stages...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the influence of skills gained in nursing on the transition to a non-nursing career. Background: Little is known about the impact that nursing skills have on the transition to new careers or about the transferability of nursing skills to professions outside nursing. Method: A postal questionnaire was mailed to respondents who had left nursing. The questionnaire included demographic, nursing education and practice information, reasons for entering and leaving nursing, perceptions of the skills gained in nursing and the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to a new career. Data analysis included exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson product moment correlations and linear and multiple regression analysis.

40|$|Background. The {{desire to}} care for people, {{a family history of}} {{professional}} health care work, and security in career choice are documented reasons for entering nursing. Reasons for leaving include workload, unsafe work environments and harassment. The relationship between these factors and the time nurses spend in the profession has not been explored. Aim. This paper reports a study with people who have left nursing, to investigate why they became a nurse, how long they stayed in nursing, and their reasons for leaving. Method. A questionnaire was mailed to Registered Nurses currently working outside nursing, seeking respondents' reasons for entering and leaving nursing, and perceptions of the skills gained from nursing and the <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> to working in a non-nursing environment. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, correlational analysis and linear and multiple regression analysis. Results. A model incorporating the factors 'altruistic reasons', 'default choice' and 'stepping stone' explained 36 Ʋ% of the variance in reasons for becoming a nurse. A model incorporating the factors 'legal and employer', 'external values and beliefs about nursing', 'professional practice', 'work life/home life' and 'contract requirements' explained 55 ƴ% of the variance in reasons for leaving nursing. Forty-eight per cent of the variance in tenure in nursing practice was explained through personal characteristics of nurses (36 %), reasons for becoming a nurse (7 %) and reasons for leaving (6 %). Conclusion. The reasons why nurses entered or left the profession were varied and complex. While personal characteristics accounted for a large component of tenure in nursing, those managing the nursing workforce should consider professional practice issues and the balance between work life and home life.

Objectives: This paper aimed to describe a group of Zimbabwean wheelchair users’ satisfaction with wheelchairs, wheelchair services and wheelchair function. Method: A mixed method, descriptive study was done. Quantitative data was collected from 94 consecutively sampled wheelchair users, who accessed wheelchair services at 16 clinics in five Zimbabwean provinces between October 2013 and February 2014, using the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology for adults and children and Functioning Every day with a Wheelchair questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected through two focus group discussions (22 participants) and two case studies with participants purposively sampled from {{those who participated in}} the quantitative phase. Results: More than 60 % of participants were dissatisfied with the following wheelchair features: durability (78. 6 %), weight (75. 6 %), <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> (69. 1 %), effectiveness (69. 0 %), safety (66. 7 %), reliability (66. 7 %), and meeting user needs (60. 6 %).

The groups were well matched for gender (m:f ratio 1. 8 : 1 vs. 1. 7 : 1, p[*]=[*] 1. 000), age (51. 0 vs. 49. 6 years, p[*]=[*] 0. 528) and BMI (39. 8 vs. 40. 3 kg/m 2, p[*]=[*] 0. 585). There {{was no difference in}} port infection rates (0 / 68 vs. 1 / 68, p[*]=[*] 1. 000) but the subfascial group had more hernias (3 / 68 vs. 0 / 68, p[*]=[*] 0. 244). Subfascial patients experienced more pain during adjustments (score 4. 3 vs. 2. 6, p[*]=[*] 0. 047) but a combined analysis of cosmesis showed a slight positive trend (1. 58 vs. 1. 76, p[*]=[*] 0. 379). Conclusion: Both port locations are well tolerated. Subfascial placement is associated with more pain during adjustments but there is no difference in port infection or skin erosion rates...|$|R
500|$|Although {{most experts}} note that {{companies}} based in QIZs hire foreign laborers, thousands of Jordanians, particularly {{women from the}} rural countryside, have found jobs at garment factories in QIZs. In a traditional society such as Jordan, {{many of these women}} had little previous work experience and were largely caretakers of their home. Despite the low wages paid by apparel factories in the QIZs, some women have been able to support their families. However, traditional attitudes toward a woman’s place in the home persist, and many families continue to prohibit female members from working in QIZs. (See Women in Jordan) In response, the Jordanian Ministry of Labor has worked to <b>ease</b> the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> women moving from the home to a new job by providing free transportation to work, subsidizing the cost of food in QIZs, and paying for dormitories near factories to cut commuting times. and providing childcare ...|$|R
