In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, [...] "You took our house and our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and what did we get in return? A bullet in my mother’s chest. We opened our <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come to do theatre there. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone. That is when we saw the real face of the left in Israel." [...] The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades may reach peace with Israel, he says, but he won’t personally. He won’t forgive the killing of his mother and brother and the razing of his house.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Then {{if you are}} so {{uncertain}} of her movements, do you not think you had better let me learn them before you start? She {{might not even be}} gone <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> would not like to come back here again; if--' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because {{anything}} will {{be better}} than returning to Ireland. Why not go down and look after Saulsby? It would be a <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> need not tie yourself to it. I will speak to Papa about that. But you will get the seat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{all know}} that I have promised to take Adolay back to her own <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> know that I never break my promises. It is {{therefore}} my intention to set off to the Whale River after two suns have gone round the sky." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s quite possible," [...] {{declared}} the girl. [...] "I shall go back <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> must {{get back to}} Salthaven {{just in time to}} sail. Mr. Vyner will be so pleased at the news, he will let you stay away as long as you like, I am sure." ...|$|E

6000|$|She said no more, {{but seemed}} {{disappointed}} in his answer, and he suggested: [...] "Perhaps {{it is the}} cold that reminds you of our winters at <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> makes <b>you</b> feel that the scene is familiar." ...|$|R
