5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's <b>first</b> <b>name</b> and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's <b>first</b> <b>name</b> and a letter not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's <b>first</b> <b>name.</b> The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E

40|$|AThis {{article focuses}} on phonetic and phonotactic changes in the Finnish <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> The most Finnish <b>first</b> <b>names</b> were a Fennicized form of the Christian or Swedish <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> The part of these Fennicized <b>first</b> <b>names</b> were used in {{informal}} situations.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the question of}} the position of proper <b>names</b> (<b>first</b> <b>names)</b> in literary German-Polish translation. The empirical basis consists of <b>first</b> <b>names</b> from the novel by Thomas Mann (The Buddenbrooks) and its Polish translation. The first part of the article contains a theoretical introduction in the field of onomastics and {{discusses the}} nature and specific features of <b>first</b> <b>names</b> (1). In the next step different strategies of rendering of literary proper names are presented (2). The empirical analysis (3) shows the two main translation strategies: transcribing and adapting of literary <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> and their consequences for the target language reception. The article sums up the analysis of chosen <b>first</b> <b>names</b> presenting linguistic and cultural conditions for rendering of proper names in literary translation (4) ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the 19 th– 20 th-century <b>first</b> <b>names</b> of female servants {{in an apartment}} building in Budapest compared to the female <b>first</b> <b>names</b> used by the families that employed them. Sources were register books listing {{the inhabitants of the}} building between 1899 and 1947. Female servants arrived to the capital from over 40 % of the counties in the country at the time, while families employing them were mostly from Budapest. The most frequent <b>first</b> <b>names</b> in the register books coincide with the top 10 percent of <b>first</b> <b>names</b> in the country-wide statistics of the era. The assumption that mainly young unmarried female servants were listed in the register books by hypocoristic names has clearly not been justified. A comparison of the <b>first</b> <b>names</b> of the female servants and those of the female members of their employers’ families displays the approximate similarity of the most frequent <b>first</b> <b>names.</b> Differences between the two name stocks can only be observed with respect to female servants’ informal nicknames. The final conclusion of the paper is that <b>first</b> <b>names</b> borne exclusively by female servants did not exist...|$|R

5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the family name is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for <b>first</b> <b>name</b> than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>first</b> <b>names</b> in general, a particular attention is, however, given to their usage in communication, {{to the familiar}} modifications of <b>first</b> <b>names</b> and to the motivation of addressing by hypocoristic forms {{as well as to}} the origin of nicknames. Within the first part, all the theoretical themes are summarised. The focus is primarily aimed towards the overall setting of the issue within the field of onomastics and the role of antroponyms within the linguistic system. The theoretical part further focuses on <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> motivation of their origin, function, transformation of the repertory of <b>first</b> <b>names</b> and their function within communication, language characteristics and naming motives. The issue of <b>first</b> <b>names</b> is enriched with an interpretation about the usage of antroponyms and their auto-nominalisation and along with a historic development of the shift from single-naming towards double-naming. The key part of the theoretical section concerns hypocoristics, the development of the hypocoristic forms of <b>first</b> <b>names,</b> their usage within communication as well as specific categories of hypocoristics and their language and word-forming characteristics. Interest was also put on nicknames and their general characterisation. A practical part of the thesis is based on a proper [...] ...|$|R
