40|$|The {{self-evaluation}} {{process of}} the Master’s Degree Course in Biomedical Sciences (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) {{was based on the}} analysis of qualitative and quantitative information. For data collection, tools for <b>students,</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> and professors were applied. Results were organized according to the following categories: Student performance, survey results, strengths, weaknesses and limitations. Results showed that the students' grade average tended to increase as the academic period progressed. Statistical indicators point toward a greater homogeneity in the performance of <b>graduate</b> <b>students.</b> It was observed that in the courses taken only by regular students the average grades were above 17. 78. All of the students successfully finished their theses and one hundred percent of them obtained their Master’s degree. Another important issue observed was {{that the majority of the}} students did not have a good background in physics, chemistry and mathematics. For this reason, at the beginning it was difficult to reach the objectives of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology courses. This problem was overcome by increasing the number of class hours for levelling purposes, “in situ”. It is clear, therefore, that solving students’ academic deficiencies is a high priority. Therefore, other alternatives must be offered to meet the demands of higher level studies, such as creating a Speciality Course in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The data generated by this selfevaluation process leads us to propose some changes in the programs of <b>graduate</b> courses, <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>profile,</b> and curricular matrix, which were presented to the Graduate School Director of Carabobo University, Aragua Campus...|$|R

Assim, realça o desenvolvimento de competências profissionais e pessoais, relativas ao saber-agir ser e estar em contexto, fundamentadas num enquadramento teórico e legal conciso e exigente, sustentadas pela metodologia investigação-ação, recorrendo às estratégias de observação, planificação, ação, avaliação e reflexão no sentido da transformação da prática letiva, melhorandoas. Nesta linha de pensamento, a mestranda construiu o seu perfil profissional, desenvolveu atitudes indagadoras e um pensamento crítico na, para e sobre sua a ação, articulando a teoria com a prática. Realça, ainda, que a colaboração com o par pedagógico, educadora/professora cooperante e supervisores institucional constituiu um forte contributo para a construção de representações daquilo que é ser educadora/professora do 1 º CEB na atualidade. O relatório é, por si mesmo, um espaço de aprendizagem e reflete o início da construção da identidade profissional da futura educadora/professora. Under the Master in Preschool Education and Teaching in Primary Education, this {{internship}} report, {{which is}} essential to complete the Master’s degree, reflects the process of professional development of the <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> during her practice, developed in the stage of contexts in Pre-School education and Primary Education. Thus, this this emphasizes the development of professional and personal skills related to know-act in context, in a concise theoretical and legal framework and demanding, with the application of action research methodology, using, using the observation strategies, planning, action, evaluation and reflection. In line with this, the <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> built her professional profile, developed inquiring attitudes and critical thinking in, for and about her action, linking theory with practice. “It should also highlight the fact that, with the collaboration of the pedagogical pair, educator/teacher cooperative and institutional supervisors, constituted a strong contribution {{to the construction of}} the representations of what is to be an educator / teacher of the 1 st CEB today. The report is by itself a learning space and reflects the start of construction of the professional identity of future educator / teacher. ” Thus, the described report highlights and reflects the challenges proposed by the <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> in her career and raised learning, based on a theoretical and legal basis of the developed pedagogical practices and the characterization of stage settings, enabling a path analysis of formation of professional skills and professional <b>graduate</b> <b>student</b> <b>profile...</b>|$|R
