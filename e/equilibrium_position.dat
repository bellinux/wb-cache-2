5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position.</b> Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{controlling}} the swing-up {{motion of the}} double pendulum on a cart using a novel control. The system control is based on finding a feasible trajectory connecting the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions</b> from which the eigenfrequencies of the system are determined. Then the system is controlled during the motion between the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions</b> by the special harmonic excitation at the system resonances. Around the two <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions,</b> the trajectory is stabilized by the nonlinear quadratic regulator NQR (also known as SDRE – the State Dependent Riccati Equation). These together form the control between the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions</b> demonstrated on the double pendulum on a cart...|$|R

25|$|When {{the spring}} is {{stretched}} or compressed, kinetic {{energy of the}} mass gets converted into potential energy of the spring. By conservation of energy, assuming the datum is defined at the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position,</b> when the spring reaches its maximum potential energy, the kinetic energy of the mass is zero. When the spring is released, it tries to return to equilibrium, and all its potential energy converts to kinetic energy of the mass.|$|E
25|$|In polyatomic {{molecule}}s, {{the molecule}} motion {{can be described}} by a rigid body rotation and internal vibration of atoms about their <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position.</b> As {{a result of the}} vibrations of the atoms, the atoms are in motion relative to the rotating coordinate system of the molecule. Coriolis effects are therefore present, and make the atoms move in a direction perpendicular to the original oscillations. This leads to a mixing in molecular spectra between the rotational and vibrational levels, from which Coriolis coupling constants can be determined.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of thermodynamics, the kinetic energy is also {{referred}} to as thermal energy. The thermal energy may be partitioned into independent components attributed to the degrees of freedom of the particles or to the modes of oscillators in a thermodynamic system. In general, the number of these degrees of freedom that are available for the equipartitioning of energy depend on the temperature, i.e. the energy region of the interactions under consideration. For solids, the thermal energy is associated primarily with the vibrations of its atoms or molecules about their <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position.</b> In an ideal monatomic gas, the kinetic energy is found exclusively in the purely translational motions of the particles. In other systems, vibrational and rotational motions also contribute degrees of freedom.|$|E

40|$|In {{inertial}} microfluidics lift forces cause {{a particle}} to migrate across streamlines to specific {{positions in the}} cross section of a microchannel. We control the rotational motion of a particle and demonstrate that this allows to manipulate the lift-force profile and thereby the particle's <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions.</b> We perform two-dimensional simulation studies using the method of multi-particle collision dynamics. Particles with unconstrained rotational motion occupy stable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions</b> in both halfs of the channel while the center is unstable. When an external torque {{is applied to the}} particle, two <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions</b> annihilate by passing a saddle-node bifurcation and only one stable fixpoint remains so that all particles move {{to one side of the}} channel. In contrast, non-rotating particles accumulate in the center and are pushed into one half of the channel when the angular velocity is fixed to a non-zero value...|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to solve this many-body problem explicitly in either classical or quantum mechanics. In order to simplify the task, two important approximations are usually imposed. First, the sum is only performed over neighboring atoms. Although the electric forces in real solids extend to infinity, this approximation is still valid because the fields produced by distant atoms are effectively screened. Secondly, the potentials V are treated as harmonic potentials. This is permissible {{as long as the}} atoms remain close to their equilibrium positions. Formally, this is accomplished by Taylor expanding V about its equilibrium value to quadratic order, giving V proportional to the displacement x2 and the elastic force simply proportional to x. The error in ignoring higher order terms remains small if x remains close to the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a {{body with}} a single stable resting {{position}} is called monostatic, and the term mono-monostatic has been coined to describe a body which additionally has only one unstable point of balance. (The previously known monostatic polyhedron does not qualify, as it has three unstable equilibria.) A sphere weighted so that its center of mass is shifted from the geometrical center is a mono-monostatic body. A more common example is the Comeback Kid, Weeble or roly-poly toy (see left figure). Not only {{does it have a}} low center of mass, but it also has a specific shape. At equilibrium, the center of mass and the contact point are on the line perpendicular to the ground. When the toy is pushed, its center of mass rises and also shifts away from that line. This produces a righting moment which returns the toy to the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} of Domokos and Várkonyi has curved edges and resembles a sphere with a squashed top. In the top figure, it rests in its stable equilibrium. Its unstable <b>equilibrium</b> <b>position</b> is obtained by rotating the figure 180° about a horizontal axis. Theoretically, it will rest there, but the smallest perturbation will {{bring it back}} to the stable point. The mathematical gömböc has indeed sphere-like properties. In particular its flatness and thinness are minimal, and this is the only type of nondegenerate object with this property. Domokos and Várkonyi are interested to find a polyhedral solution with the surface consisting of a minimal number of flat planes. Therefore, they offer a prize to anyone who finds such solution, which amounts to $10,000 divided by the number of planes in the solution. Obviously, one can approximate their curvilinear gömböc with a finite number of discrete surfaces, however, their estimate is it will take thousands of planes to achieve that. They hope, by offering this prize, to stimulate finding a radically different solution from their own.|$|E

40|$|Dynamics of dust {{particles}} in a divertor plasma is simulated using numerical solutions of dust momentum and charging equations in an electrostatic sheath and an ionizing presheath, where an electrostatic force and a drag force due to absorption of plasma ions {{are taken into}} account. Spatial distributions of plasma parameters in a divertor are obtained with particle simulations including ionization by electron-impact. We found that the critical dust radius exists. Dust particles with a larger radius than this critical one are incapable to come off a divertor plate because the ion drag force is stronger compared to the electrostatic force. Control of the plate potential can suppress the dust motion from the plate. The radii of heavy {{dust particles}} are classified with respect to <b>equilibrium</b> <b>positions.</b> Considering dust particles started at the plate with radii smaller than the critical one, two types of dust motion were found.
