5|$|Five crew residencies {{took place}} over the station's lifespan, in late 1977-early 1978, late 1978, mid-1979, mid-1980, and early 1981, {{including}} cosmonauts from Warsaw Pact countries {{as part of the}} <b>Intercosmos</b> programme. These crews were responsible for carrying out the primary missions of Salyut 6, including astronomy, Earth-resources observations and the study of the effect of spaceflight on the human body. Following the completion of these missions and the launch of its successor, Salyut 7, Salyut 6 was deorbited on 29 July 1982, almost five years after its launch.|$|E
5|$|Mir was {{constructed}} between 1986 and 1996 {{and was the}} world's first modular space station. It was the first consistently inhabited long-term research station in space, and previously held the record for longest continuous human presence in space, at eight days short of ten years. Mir's purpose {{was to provide a}} large and habitable scientific laboratory in space, and, through a number of collaborations, including <b>Intercosmos</b> and Shuttle-Mir, was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts of many different countries. The station existed until March 23, 2001, at which point it was deliberately deorbited, and broke apart during atmospheric re-entry.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{launched}} {{as part of}} the Soviet Union's manned spaceflight programme effort to maintain a long-term research outpost in space, and following the collapse of the USSR, was operated by the new Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA). As a result, most of the station's occupants were Soviet; through international collaborations such as the <b>Intercosmos,</b> Euromir and Shuttle–Mir programmes, the station was made accessible to space travelers from several Asian, European and North American nations. Mir was deorbited in March 2001 after funding was cut off. The cost of the Mir programme was estimated by former RKA General Director Yuri Koptev in 2001 as $4.2 billion over its lifetime (including development, assembly and orbital operation).|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{space program}} was {{aggressive}} in broadening {{the pool of}} cosmonauts. The Soviet <b>Intercosmos</b> program included cosmonauts selected from Warsaw Pact member countries (Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania) and later from allies of the USSR (Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam) and non-aligned countries (India, Syria, Afghanistan). Most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals, but were generally given shorter flights than Soviet cosmonauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) {{took advantage of the}} program as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} the Shuttle–Mir Program {{can be traced back}} to the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, that {{resulted}} in a joint US/Soviet mission during the détente period of the Cold War and the docking between a US Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in 1975. This was followed by the talks between NASA and <b>Intercosmos</b> in the 1970s about a [...] "Shuttle-Salyut" [...] program to fly Space Shuttle missions to a Salyut space station, with later talks in the 1980s even considering flights of the future Soviet shuttles from the Buran programme to a future US space station – this [...] "Shuttle-Salyut" [...] program never materialized however during the existence of the Soviet <b>Intercosmos</b> program.|$|E
500|$|<b>Intercosmos</b> ("ИнтерКосмос" [...] Interkosmos) was a Soviet Union space {{exploration}} programme which allowed {{members from the}} military forces of allied Warsaw Pact countries to participate in manned and unmanned {{space exploration}} missions. Participation was also made available to governments of [...] countries, such as France and India.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} feature on Salyut 6, however, was {{the addition of}} a second docking port on the aft end of the station, which allowed two spacecraft to be docked at once. This, in turn, allowed resident crews to receive shorter, 'visiting' expeditions whilst they remained on board, and for crew handovers to take place. In addition, it allowed Soyuz spacecraft that had exceeded their operating lifespan to be returned to Earth and replaced by fresh ones (the Soyuz 7K used from 1972–81 had a maximum operating lifespan of three months). Such handovers, with one expedition vacating the station only after the next had arrived, permitted the long sought-after aim of continuous occupation to move a step closer. The very first long-duration crew to visit the station broke a long-standing endurance record set on board the American Skylab station, staying 96 days in orbit, whilst the longest expedition lasted 185 days. Some of the visiting expeditions were flown as part of the <b>Intercosmos</b> programme, with non-Soviet cosmonauts visiting the station. Vladimír Remek of Czechoslovakia, the first space traveller not from the US or USSR, visited Salyut 6 in 1978, and the station hosted cosmonauts from Hungary, Poland, Romania, Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam, and East Germany.|$|E
500|$|Remek (then a Captain) {{joined the}} <b>Intercosmos</b> program in 1976; his backup was Oldřich Pelčák, the other Czechoslovak {{cosmonaut}} selected to participate with the program. During the flight, Remek experimented with the Kristall furnace {{on board the}} capsule. The mission, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Soviet-backed 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, and including Remek, {{the son of a}} Czech mother and Slovak father, had propaganda value in stressing Czechoslovak-Soviet cooperation. Remek himself has not denied this although he retains pride in his voyage regardless of the circumstances. He became the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, and [...] with the entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. After Remek's March 1978 flight, he was celebrated in his home country with a series of receptions at factories and other civil workplaces. He was also recognized at a ceremony at Prague Castle as a guest of Gustáv Husák, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. On 16 March, Remek and Aleksei Gubarev, the other member of the crew, were awarded the medal Hero of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovak reaction to Remek's flight included comments about the media's inundation focused on Remek {{and the fact that he}} was only able to journey with a Soviet cosmonaut as if Remek needed a minder. One joke went: [...] "Why didn't the Soviets send up two Czechoslovak cosmonauts? Because they would've landed in West Germany." [...] Remek himself joked that his Soviet counterpart would slap Remek's hands off of controls if he touched anything without permission. French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien experienced this same behavior onboard Soyuz TM-7 in 1988.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} ESA was formed, its main goals did not {{encompass}} human space flight; rather it considered {{itself to be}} primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore {{not surprising that the}} first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it was Czechoslovak Vladimír Remek who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet or American in space (the first man in space being Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union) [...] on a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, followed by the Pole Mirosław Hermaszewski and East German Sigmund Jähn in the same year. This Soviet co-operation programme, known as <b>Intercosmos,</b> primarily involved the participation of Eastern bloc countries. In 1982, however, Jean-Loup Chrétien became the first non-Communist Bloc astronaut on a flight to the Soviet Salyut 7 space station.|$|E
50|$|From 1976 {{he became}} {{involved}} in the <b>Intercosmos</b> and made his third and final spaceflight on an <b>Intercosmos</b> flight with Polish cosmonaut Mirosław Hermaszewski on Soyuz 30.|$|E
50|$|Tamayo was {{selected}} {{as part of the}} Soviet Union's seventh <b>Intercosmos</b> program on March 1, 1978. His backup in the <b>Intercosmos</b> program was fellow Cuban José López Falcón. Tamyao would spend the next two and half years in training for the mission.|$|E
50|$|As soon as {{he entered}} the Soviet International Space Programme <b>Intercosmos</b> in 1978, he had to change his family name to Ivanov, because his {{original}} surname Kakalov occasionally had negative connotations in Russian. After intensive training, Ivanov was selected for the fourth mission under the <b>Intercosmos</b> program.|$|E
50|$|Soyuz 40 was the 16th {{expedition}} to Salyut 6 {{and carried the}} ninth international crew. It also ended {{the first phase of}} the <b>Intercosmos</b> program by carrying Romanian cosmonaut Dumitru Prunariu and Soviet cosmonaut Leonid Popov to the station. In all, nine <b>Intercosmos</b> missions were launched between 1978 and 1981.|$|E
50|$|When {{the visiting}} Soyuz 36 <b>Intercosmos</b> crew {{departed}} Salyut 6 on 3 June 1980 {{and the remaining}} resident crew almost immediately redocked the Soyuz craft left behind, observers speculated the secretive Soviets were possibly planning a second <b>Intercosmos</b> mission. The failure of Soyuz 33 the year before had forced the Soviets to juggle their launch schedule.|$|E
