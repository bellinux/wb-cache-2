40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of adding <b>ipronidazole</b> to the diet of turkey poults containing two different levels of methionine. A corn-soybean meal diet with 0 or. 18 % supplemental methionine was fed to Nicholas Large White poults from 1 to 21 days of age. The addition of. 18 % supplemental methionine significantly improved body weight and feed efficiency. The addition of <b>ipronidazole</b> to the diet with either level of methionine did not influence body weight, feed efficiency, or grams of sulfur amino acid required to produce a gram of weight.

40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of fourteen prohibited medicinal additives in pig and poultry compound feed. These compounds are prohibited for use as feed additives although some are still authorised for use in medicated feed. Feed samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of sodium sulphate. The extracts undergo a hexane wash to aid with sample purification. The extracts are then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. The samples undergo an ultracentrifugation step prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS system and are analysed in a run time of 26 minutes. The LC-MS/MS system is run in MRM mode with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method was validated over three days and is capable of quantitatively analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, <b>ipronidazole,</b> chloramphenicol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, dinitolimide, ethopabate, carbadox and clopidol. The method is also capable of qualitatively analysing for tylosin, virginiamycin and avilamycin. A level of 100 μg kg- 1 was used for validation purposes and the method is capable of analysing to this level for all the compounds. Validation criteria of trueness, precision, repeatability and reproducibility along with measurement uncertainty are calculated for all analytes...|$|E
40|$|A multiresidue {{method for}} the {{determination}} of seven nitroimidazoles and their hydroxy metabolites in milk was developed. Milk samples were extracted with acetonitrile and cleaned up on strong cation-exchange solid phase extraction cartridges. Evaporated to dryness first, the extracts obtained were then reconstituted in 0. 1 % formic acid and injected onto a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The separation of analytes was achieved on gradient mode using a C 18 column and a mobile phase consisting of 0. 1 % formic acid in acetonitrile and 0. 1 % formic acid in water. Multiple reaction monitoring mode was set for the MS/MS with positive electrospray ionisation. For quantification, the isotope dilution method was used with isotopically labeled analogues of the target analytes. The method was evaluated entirely in accordance with EU Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and all validation criteria were in the required ranges. The method can easily detect and confirm metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, <b>ipronidazole,</b> and their hydroxy metabolites below the recommended concentration level of 3 μg/kg. The decision limits and detection capabilities ranged from 0. 11 μg/kg to 0. 22 μg/kg and from 0. 19 μg/kg to 0. 37 μg/kg respectively. The overall recoveries were between 96. 6 % and 105. 2 % with a good coefficient of variation, less than 8. 7 % under within-laboratory reproducibility conditions...|$|E
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} - electrospray ionisation - tamdem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous detection and quantitation of 5 -notroimidazole veterinary drugs in lyophilised pork meat, the chosen format {{of a candidate}} certified reference material, has been developed and validated. Six analytes {{have been included in}} the scope of validation, i. e. dimetridazole, DMZ, metronidazole, MNZ, ronidazole, RNZ, hydroxy metronidazole, MNZOH, hydroxy <b>ipronidazole,</b> IPZOH, and 2 -hydroxymethyl- 1 -methyl- 5 -nitroimidazole, HMMNI. The analytes were extracted from the sample with ethyl acetate, chromatographically separated on a C 18 column, and finally identified and quantified by tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using matrix-matched calibration and d 3 -labelled analogues of the analytes (except for MNZOH, where d 3 -MNZ was used). The method was validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, by determining selectivity, linearity, matrix effect, apparent recovery, repeatability and intermediate precision, decision limits and detection capabilities, robustness of sample preparation method, and stability of extracts. Recovery at 1 ug/kg level was at 100 % (estimates in the range of 101 - 107 %) for all analytes, repeatabilities and intermedicate precisions at this level were in the range of 4 - 12 % and 2 - 9 %, respectively. Linearity of calibration curves in the working range 0. 5 - 10 ug/kg was confirmed, with r values typically > 0. 99. Decision limits (CCa) and the detection capabilities (CCß) according to ISO 11843 - 2 (calibration curve approach) were 0. 29 - 0. 44 and 0. 36 - 0. 54 ug/kg, respectively. The method reliably identifies and quantifies the selected nitroimidazoles in the reconstituted pork meat in the low and sub ug/kg range and will be applied in an interlaboratory comparison for determining the mass fraction of the selected nitroimidazoles in the candidate reference material currently developed at IRMM.

30|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} (mAb) has higher specificity {{and better}} repeatability than polyclonal antibody. Therefore, {{it is more}} suitable for the detection of the substance of a particular structure. By virtue of benefits drawn from their specific, sensitive, rapid, simple, and high-throughput characters, mAbs can be widely used in practical testing. Despite being useful, it also has some disadvantages. The approaches for preparing antibodies are mostly empirical and guided by nonstandardized protocols and individual experience [46]. During the experiment, great care has to be exercised to dilution factors and cultivation conditions {{such as the use of}} feeder cells [47]. Moreover, screening for single hybridoma cell clones that produce high-quality antibody is mainly done by ELISA. When using this method to isolate target cells, a large number of cells would be lost. This makes the whole process extremely time consuming and labor intensive [48]. Furthermore, the characteristic of antibody is vulnerable to be impacted by the feature of antigen. For example, the extent and yield of the antigen against protein’s chemical conjugation may be very important to mAb. Acevedo et al. [49] proved that combining double-chemically modified carrier proteins with hetero-functional crosslinkers allows preparing tailor-made hapten protein carrier conjugates. Wang et al. [50] prepared a generic mAb and developed a sensitive ic-ELISA for detecting phenothiazines in animal feed. The limit of detections of the method ranged from 1.1 to 15.3  μg/kg. Han et al. [51] produced an mAb with broad specificity to nitroimidazoles, dimetridazole, <b>ipronidazole,</b> ronidazole hydroxydimetridazole, and hydroxyipronidazole, with the IC 50 values of 4.79, 0.47, 5.97, 23.48, and 15.03  μg/L, respectively. Peng et al. [52] used arsanilic acid as a hapten, and produced the suitable mAb for simultaneously determining organoarsenic compounds including nitarsone, carbarsone, and arsanilic acid in animal tissue and feed.|$|E
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of eleven nitroimidazoles and also chloramphenicol in milk and honey samples. These compounds are classified as A 6 compounds in annex IV of council regulation 2377 / 90 and therefore prohibited for the use in animal husbandry. Milk samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of NaCl, while honey samples are first dissolved in water before a similar extraction. Honey extracts undergo a hexane wash to remove impurities. Both milk and honey extracts are evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. These are then injected onto an LC-MS/MS system and analysed in less than 9 minutes. The MS/MS is operated in MRM mode with positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method is validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and is capable of analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, <b>ipronidazole</b> and there hydroxy metabolites MNZ-OH, HMMNI and IPZ-OH. The method is also able to analyse for carnidazole, ornidazole, ternidazole, tinidazole and chloramphenicol. A level of 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 (RL) for MNZ, DMZ and RNZ has been recommended by the community reference laboratory responsible for this substance group and this method can easily detect all nitroimidazoles at this level. A minimum required performance level of 0. 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 is in place for chloramphenicol which the method can also easily detect. For nitroimidazoles the decision limits (CC) and detection capabilities (CC) range from 0. 41 to 1. 55 μg L- 1 and 0. 70 to 2. 64 μg L- 1 respectively in milk and from 0. 38 to 1. 16 μg kg- 1 and 0. 66 to 1. 98 μg kg- 1 respectively in honey. For chloramphenicol the values are 0. 07 and 0. 11 μg L- 1 in milk and 0. 08 and 0. 13 μg kg- 1 in honey.
