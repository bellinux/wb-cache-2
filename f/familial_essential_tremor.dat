40|$|Background. HTRA 2 {{has already}} been {{nominated}} as PARK 13 which may cause Parkinson’s disease, though there are still discrepancies among these results. Recently, Gulsuner et al. ’s study found that HTRA 2 p. G 399 S is responsible for hereditary essential tremor and homozygotes of this allele develop Parkinson’s disease by examining a six-generation family segregating essential tremor and essential tremor coexisting with Parkinson’s disease. We performed this study to validate the condition of HTRA 2 gene in Chinese <b>familial</b> <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> and familial Parkinson’s disease patients, especially essential tremor. Methods. We directly sequenced all eight exons, exon-intron boundaries, {{and part of the}} introns in 101 <b>familial</b> <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> patients, 105 familial Parkinson’s disease patients, and 100 healthy controls. Results. No exonic variant was identified, while one exon-intron boundary variant (rs 2241028) and one intron variant (rs 2241027) were detected, both with no clinical significance and uncertain function. There was no difference in allele, genotype, and haplotype between groups. Conclusions. HTRA 2 exonic variant might be rare among Chinese Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor patients with family history, and HTRA 2 may not be the cause of familial Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor in China...|$|E

40|$|Essential tremor (ET) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorders. The pathogenesis is as yet unknown, although a genetic cause has long been recognised. Clinical and molecular evidence suggested that the ET gene contains a CAG expanded region. We examined a cohort of 240 Italian ET patients, classified as familial (193 cases) and sporadic (47 cases). The clinical manifestations of ET patients confirmed that the disorder is characterised by a large phenotypic variability. Repeat expansion detection (RED) approach did not demonstrate large CAG expansions. Six families were genotyped with 12 microsatellites markers of 2 p and 3 q regions and analysed according to parametrical methods. Lod scores values obtained in these families excluded the association of ET with 2 p and 3 q loci. Our findings confirm the presence of genetic heterogeneity and suggest that at least a third locus is involved in the pathogenesis of <b>familial</b> <b>essential</b> <b>tremor...</b>|$|E

40|$|Currently {{the role}} of {{microbiota}} in diseases pathogenesis, its therapeutic and diagnostic potential are of the utmost interest for scientists and medical doctors. Parkinson’s disease is neurodegenerative disorder for which microbiota’s dysbiosis was previously shown. The main goal {{of the study is}} to compare the colon microbiota composition in case of Parkinson’s disease and other neurological pathologies, including idiopathic <b>familial</b> dystonia, <b>essential</b> <b>tremor,</b> multiple sclerosis, multiple system atrophy {{in order to determine the}} intestinal flora landscape specific to Parkinson’s disease. Material and methods. One hundred twenty-six patients, 93 with Parkinson’s disease and 33 with other neurological pathology were examined. For all patients, physical examination and fecal samples collection were performed. Microbiota taxonomic composition was analyzed by sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes followed by bioinformatic and statistical analysis. As a result of the study, significant differences between groups in microbiota composition were found. Gut microbiota of patients with Parkinson’s disease was characterized by increase of Desulfovibrio piger, Lactobacillus mucosae, Yokenella regensburgei, Alistipes indistinctus, Oscillospira capillosus, Clostridium bolteae, Soleaferrea massiliensis, Butyricimonas virosa, Dorea massiliensis, Victivallis vadensis abundances.

The familial form is called <b>familial</b> <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> (FET), which seems similar to sporadic essential tremor. ET is a cause of substantial disability, particularly in the elderly. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease and dystonia may be increased in families with ET, but other movement disorders are seldom encountered in these families. Here we report {{the results of a}} genome-wide scan for FET genes in 16 Icelandic families with 75 affected individuals, in whom FET was apparently inherited as a dominant trait. The scan, which was performed with a 10 -cM framework map, revealed one locus on chromosome 3 q 13 to which FET mapped with a genome-wide significance when the data were analysed either parametrically, assuming an autosomal dominant model (lod score = 3. 71), or non-parametrically (NPL Z score = 4. 70, p < 6. 4 x 10 (- 6) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} a case-control study on 100 patients with Parkinson's disease, their spouses {{and the same}} number of sex- and age-matched neurological controls to clarify if family history of Parkinson's disease or essential tremor may increase the risk for the disease. We included in the study 68 male and 32 female parkinsonian patients with a mean age +/- SD of 62. 0 +/- 9. 9 years and a mean disease duration of 7. 5 +/- 5. 7. The odds ratio for familial Parkinson's disease was 13. 4 (95 % confidence limits = 6. 5 - 27. 7) and for <b>familial</b> <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> 3. 1 (95 % confidence limits = 1. 5 - 6. 3). We also reviewed the genetic features of 122 parkinsonian patients with at least one affected relative. The presence of secondary cases among both first-degree (n = 83) and less close relatives (n = 72) suggests that sharing environmental factors does not explain the familial aggregation of the disease. Secondary cases were significantly more frequent in the paternal than in the maternal line (70 vs. 39). The presence of secondary cases among both siblings (46) and parents (37) and the unilateral distribution of ancestral secondary cases suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Essential tremor is {{a common}} {{movement}} disorder with a strong heritable component. Large families with inherited forms of essential tremor have undergone genetic analyses by different approaches. However, our knowledge of genetic variants unequivocally linked to essential tremor is remarkably limited. Several explanations have been put forth to explain this challenge, including the possibility of mutations in non-coding areas of the genome. Methods: We encountered a family with highly penetrant, autosomal dominant tremor. We hypothesized that, if a single coding gene mutation {{was responsible for the}} phenotype, novel genetic tools would allow us to identify it. We employed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays in 17 members of this family followed by next generation whole-exome sequencing in five affected subjects. Results: We did not identify any copy number variant or mutation that segregated with the disease phenotype. Discussion: This study emphasizes the remarkably challenging field of tremor genetics and indicates that future studies should perhaps shift to analysis of the non-coding genome.

Methods: A case-control clinical {{study was conducted to}} investigate the prevalence of migraine in 150 consecutive <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> patients and in 150 matched controls without tremor. Detailed information about <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> and migraine was obtained using a structured questionnaire at a face-to-face interview. Moreover, a functional variant of the dopamine receptor D 3 gene (Ser 9 Gly, rs 6280) was studied in 46 <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> patients with and without migraine using direct sequencing analysis. Results: The prevalence of lifetime migraine in <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> patients was significantly higher than that in controls (22. 0 % vs. 12. 7 %; p 0. 035; odds ratio 1. 95; 95 % confidence interval 1. 05 – 3. 60). No significant difference was found in the migraine features between the <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> and control groups and most tremor characteristics were no different in <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> patients with and without migraine.

Recently, a mutation located in the nuclear export signal (NES) of the FUS gene has been reported to cause an autosomal dominant form of <b>familial</b> <b>Essential</b> <b>tremor.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: We sequenced the exons coding the NES domains of five RNA-binding proteins (TARDBP, hnRNPA 2 B 1, hnRNPA 1, TAF 15 and EWSR 1) that have been previously implicated in neurodegeneration in a series of 257 essential tremor (ET) cases and 376 healthy controls. We genotyped 404 additional ET subjects and 510 healthy controls to assess the frequency of the EWSR 1 p. R 471 C substitution. RESULTS: We identified a rare EWSR 1 p. R 471 C substitution, which is highly conserved, in a single subject with familial ET. The pathogenicity of this substitution remains equivocal, as DNA samples from relatives were not available and the genotyping of 404 additional ET subjects did not reveal any further carriers. No other variants were observed with significant allele frequency differences compared to controls in the NES coding regions. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the NES domains of RNA-binding proteins are highly conserved. The role of the EWSR 1 p.

40|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> (ET), {{the most}} common {{inherited}} movement disorder, is generally transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. A genome-wide scan for ET revealed one major locus on chromosome 3 q 13. Here, we report that the Ser 9 Gly variant in the dopamine D 3 receptor gene (DRD 3), localized on 3 q 13. 3, is associated and cosegregates with familial ET in 23 out of 30 French families. Sequencing revealed no other nonsynonymous variants in the DRD 3 -coding sequence {{and in the first}} 871 bp of the 5 ’ flanking region. Moreover, Gly- 9 homozygous patients presented with more severe and/or earlier onset forms of the disease than heterozygotes. A replication study comparing 276 patients with ET and 184 normal controls confirmed the association of the Gly- 9 variant with risk and age-at-onset of ET. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 -transfected cells, the Gly- 9 variant did not differ from the Ser- 9 variant with respect to glycosylation and to anterograde and retrograde trafficking, but dopamine had an affinity that was four to five times higher. With the Gly- 9 variant, the dopamine-mediated cAMP response was increased, and the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signal was prolonged, as compared with the Ser- 9 variant. The gain-of-function produced by the Gly- 9 variant may explain why drugs active against tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) are usually not effective in the treatment of ET and suggests that DRD 3 partial agonists or antagonists should be considered as novel therapeutic options for patients with ET...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Parkinson's {{disease is}} the second most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Most cases are sporadic, however familial cases do exist. We examined 12 families with familial Parkinson's disease ascertained at the Movement Disorder clinic at the Oregon Health Sciences University for genetic linkage to a number of candidate loci. These loci have been implicated in familial Parkinson's disease or in syndromes with a clinical presentation that overlaps with parkinsonism, as well as potentially in the pathogenesis of the disease. Methods The examined loci were PARK 3, Parkin, DRD (dopa-responsive dystonia), FET 1 (<b>familial</b> <b>essential</b> <b>tremor),</b> BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), Ret, DAT 1 (the dopamine transporter), Nurr 1 and Synphilin - 1. Linkage to the α- synuclein gene and the Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism locus on chromosome 17 had previously been excluded in the families included in this study. Using Fastlink, Genehunter and Simwalk both parametric and model-free non-parametric linkage analyses were performed. Results In the multipoint parametric linkage analysis lod scores were below - 2 for all loci except FET 1 and Synphilin - 1 under an autosomal dominant model with incomplete penetrance. Using non-parametric linkage analysis there was no evidence for linkage, although linkage could not be excluded. A few families showed positive parametric and non-parametric lod scores indicating possible genetic heterogeneity between families, although these scores did not reach any degree of statistical significance. Conclusions We conclude that in these families there was no evidence for linkage to any of the loci tested, although we were unable to exclude linkage with both parametric and non-parametric methods. </p...|$|E

40|$|Genetic polymorphisms in Solute carrier family 1 (glial high {{affinity}} glutamate transporter), member 2 (SLC 1 A 2) {{have been}} linked with <b>essential</b> <b>tremor.</b> SLC 1 A 2 encodes excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 (EAAT 2), which clears glutamate from the synaptic cleft.

Using Western blotting, we compared the expression levels of the two main glutamate transporters in the cerebellar cortex, EAAT 1 and EAAT 2, in postmortem tissue from 16 <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> cases and 13 age-matched controls. We also studied the localization of EAAT 1 and EAAT 2 using immunohistochemistry in 10 <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> cases and 12 controls.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: An {{estimated}} 30 - 50 % of <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> diagnoses are incorrect, and {{the true}} diagnosis in those patients is often Parkinson’s disease or other tremor disorders. There are general statements about the <b>tremor</b> in these <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> and Parkinson’s disease, but published data on the more subtle characteristics of tremor are surprisingly limited. Postural tremor may occur in both disorders, adding to the difficulty. There are several anecdotal impressions regarding specific features of postural <b>tremor</b> in <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> vs. Parkinson’s disease, including joint distribution (e. g., phalanges, metacarpal-phalangeal joints, wrist), tremor directionality (e. g., flexion-extension vs. pronation-supination), and presence of intention tremor. However, there is little data to support these impressions. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients (<b>essential</b> <b>tremor,</b> 50 Parkinson’s disease) underwent detailed videotaped neurological examinations. Arm tremor was rated by a movement disorder neurologist who assessed severity and directionality across multiple joints. Results: During sustained arm extension, <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> patients exhibited more wrist than metacarpal-phalangeal and phalangeal joint tremor than did Parkinson’s disease patients (p< 0. 001), and more wrist flexion-extension tremor than wrist pronation-supination tremor (p< 0. 001). During the finger-nose-finger maneuver, intention tremor was present in approximately one in four (28 %) <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> patients vs. virtually none (4 %) of the Parkinson’s patients (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: We evaluated the location, severity, and directionality of postural <b>tremor</b> in <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> and Parkinson’s disease, {{and the presence of}} intention tremor, observing several clinical differences. We hope that detailed phenomenological data on <b>tremor</b> in <b>essential</b> <b>tremor</b> and Parkinson’s disease will help practicing physicians delineate the two diseases...|$|R
