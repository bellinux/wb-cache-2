25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines.

2500|$|A PM motor {{does not}} have a <b>field</b> <b>winding</b> on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the {{magnetic}} field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the <b>field</b> <b>winding.</b> Most larger DC motors are of the [...] "dynamo" [...] type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.|$|E
2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the <b>field</b> <b>winding</b> of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the <b>field</b> <b>winding.</b> Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E
2500|$|Stepper motors are a type {{of motor}} {{frequently}} used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled {{by a set of}} external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also {{be thought of as a}} cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized <b>field</b> <b>winding.</b> Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it [...] "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.|$|E

Two model options are considered. Finally, the ability of the resulting model to describe “realistic ” near-surface mesoscale <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> is evaluated.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple method, based on routine meteorological data, to produce high-resolution wind analyses throughout the {{planetary boundary layer}} (PBL). It is {{a new way to}} interpolate wind measurements. According to this method, high-frequency information from surface wind measurements is extrapolated to greater heights by assuming that the vertical shear of the horizontal wind, that is, the differential vertical wind profile, is horizontally more homogeneous than the wind profile itself. Under this assumption, it is sufficient to combine high-resolution surface wind measurements with low-resolution vertical profiles of differential winds—for which high-resolution measurements usually do not exist—to yield high-resolution wind analyses throughout the PBL. The method can thus be viewed as a diagnostic downscaling of large-scale <b>wind</b> <b>fields.</b> Downscaling works best during daytime within a homogeneous air mass and in flat terrain. A validation against sodar wind measurements demonstrates that downscaling actually improves large-scale <b>wind</b> <b>fields.</b> A comparison of trajectories calculated from large-scale <b>wind</b> <b>fields,</b> from downscaled <b>wind</b> <b>fields,</b> and from <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> produced by a conventional diagnostic <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> model, with daytime constant level balloon flights, again shows that the downscaled <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> are most accurate. 1...|$|R
