2500|$|The Justice {{also agreed}} that the outcome of Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982) {{was based on the}} Property Clause of Article IV, §3 and so was not a viable {{precedent}} in this case. Souter noted that the majority expressed their fear that a great many Executive branch actions would be open to lawsuit if they ruled for the Foundation, he said [...] "that does not mean taxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the merits, <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a claim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are meritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a compelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep them from being heard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] here rejoined Luke with {{a sudden}} show of resentment, [...] "Mr.--er--Travers, <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how my {{movements}} can be of concern to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{all sounds}} very clever," [...] commented the Old Maid; [...] "yet <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what good comes of ridiculing a thing one's heart tells one is sacred." ...|$|E
60|$|Very {{satisfactory}} {{to both of}} them, no doubt. But <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what <b>I</b> myself {{had to do with}} it, so far.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{had not the}} {{slightest}} intention of commencing the fray, I thought this good advice, though how Indaba-zimbi could [...] "make it all right" [...] <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
60|$|Paul and I {{were left}} {{somewhat}} {{in the rear}} because {{of not being able}} to keep the pace silently, and during more than half of the hour which passed, <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a single man ahead of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] I broke in, with a man's {{desire for}} solid fact {{in place of}} vague intuition. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> quite what {{that has to do}} with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘You have perhaps {{neglected}} one point,’ {{returned the}} unoffended Zero: ‘for, speaking as a philosopher, <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what {{means you can}} employ to force me. The will, my dear fellow—’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{a capital}} account, Mr. O'Connor," [...] Sir John Cradock said, smiling, as {{he brought it}} to a conclusion. [...] "But, so far, <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> your {{particular}} share in the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even the squaws {{have gone}} over to the British quarters; they've been paddlin' across the river for the last half-hour," [...] Jacob replied, {{and as a matter}} of fact <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a living being outside the lodges, search with my eyes as I might.|$|R
60|$|An odd man, with a {{personal}} appearance that might excite a prejudice against him, in some minds. <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it myself in that light. It struck me, as I walked home, that Cristel might have made many a worse friend than the retired prize-fighter.|$|R
5000|$|I {{issued a}} call for an unknown leader, ... capable of {{overturning}} the Jewish government and creating a new Russia. <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that, by the will of fate, of his own genius, and of millions of toilers, Comrade J.V. Stalin, {{the leader of the}} peoples, had become this unknown leader ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] she said, {{with an air}} not to be denied, [...] "I believe I can discern a {{point of}} honor as well as you. <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that you have a}} case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{came to my}} house. I put up with him, which I think {{describes}} it best, though <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much reason for doing so any longer. But {{what are you going}} to do about the lode?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a mistake}} for which you could {{scarcely}} hold me responsible," [...] Granet protested, [...] "and you must really excuse me if <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the connection. Perhaps you will tell me, Major Thomson, what I am here for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{the figure}} of a young woman," [...] {{answered}} the prince, [...] "but she kept a shawl so close round her head that <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her face. As to Gunrig, I did not think it worth my while to mind him at all, so I saw not whether his looks were scowling or pleased." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in his bearing {{anything}} to betoken {{that he had}} but lately faced death in its most horrible form {{in order to make}} an effort at saving the lives of strangers, and from that moment I looked up to the young man much {{as if he had been}} of a superior race from any I had previously seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{are serious}} questions, Mrs. Oldershaw--more serious than you suppose. I have {{had time to}} calm down, and I begin <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> what <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when <b>I</b> first took up my pen to write to you, the wisdom of looking at consequences. Have I frightened myself in trying to frighten you? It is possible--strange as it may seem, it is really possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't--dash it!" [...] said Colonel Mant. [...] "We're coming to that. And I {{should like to}} begin by saying that, though in a sense it was my fault, <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how I could have acted---" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Sue dear, {{that is what}} we must hope, {{unless we}} would have them come in time to meet their death. Two more men on the stockade would not greatly prolong the struggle, and <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how they, without other aid, could help us very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not to}} think, {{my dearest}} Esther, that <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what you see and fear what you fear. No one can {{understand}} him better than I do. The greatest wisdom that ever lived {{in the world could}} scarcely know Richard better than my love does." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a picture}} of a perverted mind, {{struggling}} between good and evil, and slowly losing ground under the stealthy influence of temptation, the letters certainly possessed a melancholy interest for any thoughtful reader. But (not being a spiteful woman) <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> in these extracts, the connection which Frau Meyer had attempted to establish between the wickedness of Madame Fontaine and the disappearance of her husband's medicine chest.|$|R
60|$|Pierre had {{apparently}} {{agreed with the}} Jerseyman, {{while at the same}} time it was in his mind to do that which we were setting out to accomplish, and I had no scruples about following him, for ponder over the matter as <b>I</b> might, <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how anything suspicious on our part could bring trouble or danger to the spy, or in any way menace the Cause.|$|R
6000|$|Was my own {{dullness}} {{of apprehension}} {{to blame for}} this? Would another man in my position have discovered what <b>I</b> had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a moment}} longer, {{now you are}} {{composed}} again," [...] Emily answered. [...] "I have been thinking of what has happened; and <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any necessity for putting off your departure until the doctor comes to-morrow morning. There is really no objection to your leaving me to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my dear Miss Wade"--I always {{dropped the}} title of [...] "Nurse," [...] by request, when once we were well clear of Nathaniel's,--"I have every confidence, you are aware, in your memory and your insight; but I do confess <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what bearing this {{incident}} can have on poor Hugo's chances of being hanged or committing suicide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{she went}} on, yet {{stopping}} to smell a rosebud in his buttonhole, [...] "I {{have a perfect}} right {{to come to my}} own home, goodness knows! and if I bring my own aunt, a married woman, with me,--although," [...] loftily, [...] "there may be a young unmarried gentleman alone there,--still <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any impropriety in it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am honoured {{with your}} confidence, Prince, but <b>I</b> still <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how these matters concern me," [...] I said, setting my teeth hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{as fully}} {{satisfied}} as ever {{of the truth}} of what Lady Clarinda told you," [...] he proceeded. [...] "But I see, on consideration, what <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at the time. The story admits of two interpretations--one on the surface, and another under the surface. I look under the surface, in your interests; and I say, it is just possible that Mrs. Beauly may have been cunning enough to forestall suspicion, and to set up an Alibi." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I looked, {{but could}} not see the likeness. You know how {{differently}} people seem to be affected by the same face. <b>I</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the sweet countenance framed in curling fair hair, and in the slight girlish figure of surpassing grace, my swarthy friend Pedro. She seemed startled at first by my father's abrupt manner. He questioned her. What was her name--`Mariquita,' she said. `I was sure of it,' rejoined my father. `Your surname, my girl?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am highly flattered," [...] I said. [...] "I {{have always}} {{heard that there}} are no limits to {{feminine}} intuition; and now I am half inclined to believe it is so. But still <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in what way my sagacity, practical or otherwise, can be of any service to Mrs Fyne. One man's sagacity is very much like any other man's sagacity. And with you at hand--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how Awonawilona {{could be}} {{developed}} out of the ghost of chief or conjurer. That in which all things potentially existed, yet who was more than all, is not {{the ghost of a}} conjurer or chief. He certainly is not due to missionary influence. No authority can be better than that of traditional sacred chants found among a populace which will not sing them before one of their Mexican masters.|$|E
6000|$|... "I readily admit your claim," [...] he answered, [...] "when you {{are sitting}} at your desk in my office. But, even {{in these days of}} strikes, co-operations, and bank holidays, an {{employer}} has one privilege left--he has not ceased to be a Man, and he has not forfeited a man's right to keep his own secrets. <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> anything in my conduct which has given you just reason to complain." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{point of}} view which <b>I</b> had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> was put with terrible {{directness}} of expression: the conviction that I was wrong was literally forced on me. What reply could I make? Rothsay evidently felt for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "The timber is {{certainly}} there, but <b>I</b> quite <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{how it could}} be of the least use to anybody situated where we are," [...] he said. [...] "That cañon is, I should fancy, one of the deepest in the province." ...|$|R
60|$|THE DEVIL. <b>I</b> still <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> Senor Don Juan, {{that these}} episodes in your earthly career {{and in that}} of the Senor Commander in any way {{discredit}} my view of life. Here, I repeat, you have all that you sought without anything that you shrank from.|$|R
