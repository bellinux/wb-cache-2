Using an unrestricted mean field approach, we map out the instability of the topological band insulator towards magnetically ordered insulators which emerge with increasing Hubbard repulsion. In addition to the topological Néel phase, we recover various chiral noncoplanar magnetic orders previously identified within a strong coupling approach. We compute the band structure of these ordered phases, showing that the triple-Q <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>phase</b> harbors topological Chern bands with large Chern numbers.

The internal friction of the Na 0. 5 Bi 0. 5 TiO 3 ceramic at low frequency (0. 5 ∼ 4 Hz) was measured in the temperature range from room temperature to 900 K. Three prominent internal friction peaks were observed. The P 1 peak is composed of three internal friction peaks. The lower temperature peaks (P 1 L 1 and (P 1 L 2) {{may be caused by}} the stress-induced motion of domain walls pinned by the oxygen vacancies and the oxygen ion diffusion in Na 0. 5 Bi 0. 5 TiO 3 sample, respectively. The higher temperature peak (P 1 H) may be related with the phase transition between the ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric phase. The broader P 2 peak shows that the phase transition between rhombohedral and tetragonal phase is a gradually changing process. The asymmetry of the P 3 peak includes the two subpeaks (P 3 L and P 3 H peak). The two subpeaks are caused by the light Na ions diffusion by vacancies in NBT sample and the phase transition between the <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>phase</b> and the cubic phase, respectively.

40|$|The phase {{evolution}} of zirconia (ZrO 2), sulfated zirconia (SO 42 -/ZrO 2) and yttrium oxide incorporated zirconia (Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2) from the <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>phase</b> to the monoclinic phase was studied using UV Raman spectroscopy, visible Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD). It is clearly observed {{that there are}} discrepancies between {{the results from the}} UV Raman spectra, visible Raman spectra and XRD patterns. The phase change from tetragonal to monoclinic is always earlier or at lower calcination temperatures as observed by UV Raman spectroscopy than by visible Raman spectroscopy and XRD. UV Raman spectroscopy is found to be more sensitive at the surface region while visible Raman spectroscopy and XRD supply the information mainly from the bulk. The inconsistency in the results from the three techniques suggests that the phase transformation of zirconia starts from its surface region and then gradually develops into its bulk. For SO 42 -/ZrO 2 and Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2, the transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase is significantly retarded owing to the presence of the sulfated groups and the yttrium oxide. Particularly, the tetragonal phase of Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 can be maintained up to 800 degreesC although its phase at the surface region changed into monoclinic at 500 degreesC.

Europe {{is one of the most}} important regions of consumption of these substances. In this context, Europe in its 'Raw materials' strategy puts the recycling at the center of its concerns to provide a part of securing its supplies in rare earth elements. Recycling of these substances, on an industrial scale, remains somewhat developed while it presents numerous advantages over the exploitation of primary resources. This paper will present some results obtained from characterization study of permanent magnets present in wastes of electric and electronic equipment. Three different electronic components containing magnets are identified: hard dick drives, small electric motors and speakers. Several kilograms of theses wastes have been sampled at recycling plant. The representative sample has been dismantled manually to recover the magnets contained to quantify the amount of magnets in the investigated components. Thorough characterization results show that the weight percentage of magnets varies in the three investigated electronic components: 4 6 % in the speakers, 2. 5 - 2. 8 % in the hard disks, and between 0. 8 and 2 % in some electric motors. The results of the thermal treatments of the magnets of the investigated samples show that the majority of these magnets lose their magnetic property upon reaching Curie temperature (300 - 400 ° C) in 15 - 20 minutes.

In this article, levitation techniques are briefly discussed, focusing most on electrostatic levitation.

40|$|Water and silicon are {{chemically}} dissimilar substances {{with common}} physical properties. Their liquids display {{a temperature of}} maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, they form tetrahedral crystals and <b>tetrahedral</b> amorphous <b>phases.</b> The common feature to water, silicon and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through {{the introduction of a}} nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1 % of the computational cost. We conclude {{that it is not the}} nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.

Our results reveal that the structural transition (TS ~ 55 K) has a weak effect on the electronic structure of iron ions, while at T < TN the spectra show a continuous distribution of hyperfine fields HFe. Shape of these spectra was analyzed in term of two models: (i) an incommensurate spin density wave modulation of iron magnetic structure, (ii) a formation of a microdomain structure or phase separation. It was shown that the hyperfine parameters obtained using these two methods have very similar values over the whole temperature range. The analysis of the temperature dependence HFe(T) with the Bean-Rodbell model leads to ksi = 1. 16 +/- 0. 05, suggesting that the magnetic phase transition is first-order in nature. A sharp evolution of the VZZ(T) and etha(T) parameters of the full Hamiltonian of hyperfine interactions near T ~ (TN, TS), were interpreted as a manifestation of the anisotropic electron redistribution between the dxz, dyz- and dxy-orbitals of the iron ions.

The acidic strength of the catalysts was measured using a n-butylamine potentiometric titration method. The bulk BaTiO 3 catalyst exhibits a tetragonal phase with the P 4 mm space group. A structural transition from <b>tetrahedral</b> to cubic <b>phase</b> was observed for Fe, Co and Ni doped BaTiO 3 catalysts with an increase in doped metal concentration from 1 to 5 mol%. The particle sizes of the catalysts were calculated from TEM images and are in the range of 30 - 80 nm. All the catalysts were tested for the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to azoxybenzene. The BaTiO 3 catalyst was found to be highly active and less selective compared to the doped catalysts which are active and highly selective towards azoxybenzene. The increase in selectivity towards azoxybenzene is due to an increase in acidic strength and reduction ability of the doped metal. It was also observed that the nature of the metal dopant and their content at the B-site has an impact on the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{first principles}} calculations on {{the properties of}} group IV elements and group III-V compounds. It includes investigations into what structure a material is likely to form in, and given that structure, what are its electronic, optical, and lattice dynamical properties {{as well as what}} are the properties of defects that might be introduced into the sample. The thesis is divided as follows:Chapter 1 contains some of the conceptual foundations used in the present work. These involve the major approximations which allow us to approach the problem of systems with huge numbers of interacting electrons and atomic cores. This involves a discussion of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, Bloch's Theorem, the concept of the pseudopotential, and the empirical pseudopotential method (EPM). We end with a discussion of density functional theory (DFT), which is methodology by which the majority of solid state work is carried out today. Then, in Chapter 2, we discuss one of the major limitations to the DFT formalism introduced in Chapter 1, namely its inability to predict the quasiparticle spectra of materials and in particular the band gap of a semiconductor. We introduce a Green's function approach to the electron self-energy $Sigma$ known as the $GW$ approximation and use it to compute the quasiparticle band structures of a number of group IV and III-V semiconductors. Our fully first principles calculations, which include spin-orbit effects, are in very good agreement with experimental values and illustrate the power of this approach to calculate quasiparticle energies. In Chapter 3 we present a first-principles study of a number of high-pressure metastable phases of Si with <b>tetrahedral</b> bonding. The <b>phases</b> studied include all experimentally determined phases that result from decompression from the metallic $beta$-Sn phase, specifically the BC 8 (Si-III), hexagonal diamond (Si-IV), and R 8 (Si-XII). In addition to these, we also study the hypothetical ST 12 structure found upon decompression from $beta$-Sn in germanium. We find that the DFT incorrectly predicts the Si-XII phase to be semimetallic and that the true quasiparticle spectrum exhibits a band gap. Our attention is then turned to the first principles calculations of optical properties in Chapter 4. The optical spectrum of the Si-XII is studied, which was shown in Chapter 3 to exhibit a small, indirect band gap. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is then solved to obtain the optical spectrum of this material including electron-hole interactions. The calculated optical spectrum is compared with experimental data for other forms of silicon commonly used in photovoltaic devices, namely the cubic, polycrystalline, and amorphous forms. The calculated values of the optical functions relevant to photovoltaic absorption are found to exhibit show greater overlap with the incident solar spectrum in Si-XII than those found in these other silicon phases. In Chapter 5 we present first principles calculations of the quasiparticle and optical excitation spectra of recently predicted silicon and germanium polytypes in the body-centered-tetragonal (bct) structure. The quasiparticle spectra calculated within the $GW$ approximation predict that both silicon and germanium in the bct structure are small band gap materials. The optical spectra are then evaluated by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation taking into account. We examine the low-pressure phases of Ge in Chapter 6 by performing first principles calculations of the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of the R 8, BC 8, ST 12, and hexagonal diamond structures of Ge. To aid future experimental investigation, we include predictions of the Raman-active frequencies of these phases as well as present the full phonon dispersion throughout the zone. Calculated equation of states within the LDA reveal a small pressure region where the R 8 phase is energetically favored over the other metastable BC 8 and ST 12 structures, although the energy differences involved are relatively small and affected by the approximations used in the choice of pseudopotential. The calculated zone-center Raman-active frequencies are then used to further support experimental evidence which suggests the R 8 phase of Ge to have been formed in indented samples of amorphous Ge. We also show that from an analysis of the pressure dependence of the zone-center Raman-active phonon frequencies that previous experimental results claiming to have the ST 12 phase of Ge in their experimental sample were actually likely seeing the signature of the R 8 phase, a phase which in Ge had until then remained unobserved. In Chapter 7 we demonstrate how first principles calculations can be used to predict new structures. In a study aimed at finding new useful forms of silicon, we use an ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) method to identify a new phase of silicon in the Ibam structure. The Ibam phase is found to be semimetallic within density functional theory with a small band overlap, and it is expected that quasiparticle corrections using the GW approximation would yield a semiconducting state with a small band gap. Calculation of the lattice dynamics reveals that the structure is locally stable. Enthalpy-pressure relations are calculated for the Ibam structure as well as all other known Si structures, including the previously predicted st 12 and bct phases. These results indicate that Ibam silicon is metastable over the pressure range considered. Calculated coexistence pressures of the other known phase transitions are in good agreement with experimental observation. We end this section with a discussion on evolutionary algorithms and their application to the problem of structure prediction. We then use this method to determine some interesting low-energy candidate structures for the unknown phase Si-VIII. We present a first-principles study of boron and phosphorus substitutional defects in Si-XII in Chapter 8. Recent result from nanoindentation experiments reveal that the Si-XII phase is semiconducting and has the interesting property that it can be doped n- and p-type at room temperature without an annealing step. Using the hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE), we examine the formation energies of the B and P defects at the two distinct atomic sites in Si-XII to find on which site the substitutional defects are more easily accommodated. We also estimate the thermodynamic transition levels of each defect in its relevant charge states. The hybrid calculations also give an independent prediction that Si-XII is semiconducting, in agreement with recent experimental data...|$|R
