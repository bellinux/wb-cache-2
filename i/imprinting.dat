5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the <b>imprinting</b> concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and <b>imprinting</b> so the analogy was dropped.|$|E

30|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations using tight-binding many body potential {{are carried}} out to study the roller <b>imprint</b> process of a gold single crystal. The effect of the roller tooth’s taper angle, <b>imprint</b> depth, <b>imprint</b> temperature, and <b>imprint</b> direction on the <b>imprint</b> force, adhesion, stress distribution, and strain are investigated. A two-stage roller <b>imprint</b> process was obtained from an <b>imprint</b> force curve. The two-stage <b>imprint</b> process included the <b>imprint</b> forming with a rapid increase of <b>imprint</b> force and the unloading stage combined with the adhesion stage. The {{results show that the}} <b>imprint</b> force and adhesion rapidly increase with decreasing taper angle and increasing <b>imprint</b> depth. The magnitude of the maximum <b>imprint</b> force and the time at which this maximum occurs are proportional to the <b>imprint</b> depth, but independent of the taper angle. In a comparison of the <b>imprint</b> mechanisms with a vertical <b>imprint</b> case, while high stress and strain regions are concentrated below the mold for vertical <b>imprint,</b> they also occur around the mold in the case of roller <b>imprint.</b> The regions were only concentrated on the substrate atoms underneath the mold in vertical <b>imprint.</b> Plastic flow increased with increasing <b>imprint</b> temperature.|$|R

The Didact is disturbed to find {{that many of the}} Precursor structures on the planet have fallen into ruin; Precursor structures were thought to be completely indestructible. The Didact also discovers that a prisoner, ensconced in both Precursor and human containment methods, has escaped.

5|$|As they {{continue}} taking missions, the three {{learn that the}} city's ruling Cardinals are directly responsible for the crisis. Over twenty years before, Prelate Frieda envisioned a world where people were free of Zenith's control. While she was popular among the Cardinals, with her closest ally being Cardinal Rowen, her ideals led to her being killed by extremists. Rowen was thrown into despair by her death, and when shown the truth about Zenith by Cardinal Sullivan, he is convinced {{to work with the}} other Cardinals to fulfill Frieda's vision. Rowen and Sullivan create test subjects programmed to die at specific times: Leanne was #20, designed to die on her 20th birthday. A sympathetic scientist named Juris freed Leanne, and when she learned the truth, she tried to commit suicide before being saved by Zephyr. At the same time, Sullivan studied Rebecca, who had developed natural immunity to the poisons beyond Basel's borders, and sought a way of <b>imprinting</b> her powers onto others. Zephyr was one of his test subjects, along with Zephyr's sister, who was killed by Zephyr during his rampage.|$|E

5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from <b>imprinting</b> on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E
25|$|In placental species, parent-offspring {{conflict}} {{can result}} {{in the evolution of}} strategies, such as genomic <b>imprinting,</b> for embryos to subvert maternal nutrient provisioning. Despite several attempts to find it, genomic <b>imprinting</b> has not been found in the platypus, reptiles, birds or fish.

25|$|Some human {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} genomic <b>imprinting,</b> a phenomenon in mammals where the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns for specific genomic loci in their germ cells. The best-known case of <b>imprinting</b> in human disorders is that of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome—both can be produced by the same genetic mutation, chromosome 15q partial deletion, and the particular syndrome that will develop depends on whether the mutation is inherited from the child's mother or from their father. This {{is due to the}} presence of genomic <b>imprinting</b> in the region. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is also associated with genomic <b>imprinting,</b> often caused by abnormalities in maternal genomic <b>imprinting</b> of a region on chromosome 11.|$|E

25|$|Recently, a {{new study}} has {{suggested}} a novel inheritable <b>imprinting</b> mechanism in humans that would be specific of placental tissue and that is independent of DNA methylation (the main and classical mechanism for genomic <b>imprinting).</b> Among the hypothetical explanations for this exclusively human phenomenon, two possible mechanisms have been proposed: either a histone modification that confers <b>imprinting</b> at novel placental-specific imprinted loci or, alternatively, a recruitment of DNMTs to these loci by a specific and unknown transcription factor that would be expressed during early trophoblast differentiation.|$|E
