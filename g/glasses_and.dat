25|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{different}} dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> epoxy), FR-5 (woven <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> epoxy), FR-6 (matte <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> polyester), G-10 (woven <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> epoxy), CEM-4 (woven <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> epoxy), CEM-5 (woven <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> fiber offers the best dimensional stability.|$|R

5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009.

It is said that the only way the curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> left hand.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glasses</b> <b>and</b> {{certain types}} of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, <b>glasses</b> <b>and</b> plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not be guaranteed. The ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials and representatives of the Turkish government.|$|E
5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid {{has to do with}} the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, <b>glasses,</b> <b>and</b> ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
