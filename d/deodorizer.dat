60|$|It will {{be remembered}} {{that my father was}} a <b>deodorizer</b> of dead dogs, but was unable to {{practice}} his useful and humble profession because no one would employ him. The dead dogs in consequence reeked rascally. Then they struck! From every vacant lot and public dumping ground, from every hedge and ditch and gutter and cistern, every crystal rill and the clabbered waters of all the canals and estuaries--from all the places, in short, which from time immemorial have been preëmpted by dead dogs and consecrated to the uses of them and their heirs and successors forever--they trooped innumerous, a ghastly crew! Their procession was a mile in length. Midway of the town it met the procession of cats in full song. The cats instantly exalted their backs and magnified their tails; the dead dogs uncovered their teeth as in life, and erected such of their bristles as still adhered to the skin.|$|E
60|$|My {{father was}} a <b>deodorizer</b> of dead dogs, my mother kept the only shop {{for the sale of}} cats'-meat in my native city. They did not live happily; the {{difference}} in social rank was a chasm which could not be bridged by the vows of marriage. It was indeed an ill-assorted and most unlucky alliance; and as might have been foreseen it ended in disaster. One morning after the customary squabbles at breakfast, my father rose from the table, quivering and pale with wrath, and proceeding to the parsonage thrashed the clergyman who had performed the marriage ceremony. The act was generally condemned and public feeling ran so high against the offender that people would permit dead dogs to lie on their property until the fragrance was deafening rather than employ him; and the municipal authorities suffered one bloated old mastiff to utter itself from a public square in so clamorous an exhalation that passing strangers supposed themselves to be in the vicinity of a saw-mill. My father was indeed unpopular. During these dark days the family's sole dependence was on my mother's emporium for cats'-meat.|$|E

30|$|Nanomaterials {{composed}} of metal nanoparticles are attracting significant attention {{because of their}} enormous applications in photonics [1], electronics [2], optoelectronics [3], catalysis [4, 5], sensing [6], antimicrobial products [7, 8], pharmaceuticals [9], and therapeutics [10, 11]. Currently, more than 50 % of the inventoried antimicrobial consumer products comprise nanosilver due to their cost effectiveness and broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal properties. These nanosilver-based antimicrobial products include fabrics, bandages, and food containers as <b>deodorizers</b> and disinfectants [12]. Serious efforts are being made to explore the use of silver nanoparticles for the disinfection of drinking water [13] and as pesticide to control pests attack on various crops [14]. The antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles is usually considered because of leached silver ions that affect the microbial growth either by inhibiting DNA replication [15, 16] or by inactivating cellular proteins [17]. Silver nanoparticles also interact with the bacterial cell membrane causing structural changes and damage which ultimately result in the cell death [8].|$|R

50|$|Feline {{asthma and}} other {{respiratory}} diseases may be prevented by cat owners by eliminating as many allergens as possible. Allergens {{that can be}} found in a cat’s habitual environment include: pollen, molds, dust from cat litter, perfumes, room fresheners, carpet <b>deodorizers,</b> hairspray, aerosol cleaners, cigarette smoke, and some foods. Avoid using cat litters that create lots of dust, scented cat litters or litter additives. Of course eliminating all of these can be very difficult and unnecessary, especially since a cat is only affected by one or two. It can be very challenging to find the allergen that is creating asthmatic symptoms in a particular cat and requires a lot of work on both the owner’s and the veterinarian's part. But just like any disease, the severity of an asthma attack can be propelled by more than just the allergens, common factors include: obesity, stress, parasites and pre-existing heart conditions. Dry air encourages asthma attacks so keep a good humidifier going especially during winter months.|$|R
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] For several decades {{developed}} countries have sought to protect the health of their citizens by monitoring and regulating outdoor air pollution. But are smog and other outdoor pollutants the gravest dangers to human health? A new {{way of looking at}} air pollution indicates that the danger is closer to home-in our homes, in fact, and in our cars and workplaces. About 90 percent of people's time in developed countries is spent indoors where cigarette smoke, household <b>deodorizers</b> and dry-cleaned clothes expose them to greater concentrations of pollutants than they will find outdoors in the most congested cities. The situation is even worse in developing countries where pollutants from household stoves help make respiratory diseases the chief cause of illness and death. Something less than 2 percent of global person-hours is spent in the urban outdoor settings of developed countries where 95 percent of pollution measurements have been taken. Measuring pollution where people are could result in dramatic changes in policy and funding priorities for controlling air pollution...|$|R

In spite of her limited knowledge of English, the audience was so impressed that from then on her appearances were regular. She and Owen were close friends, and she even helped him to found the Association of All Classes of All Nations, a group that espoused human rights for all people of all nations, sexes, races and classes.
