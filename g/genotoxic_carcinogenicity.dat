40|$|The {{published}} {{validation study}} of a new in vitro mammalian test, GreenScreen HC, has shown it to be both highly specific and highly sensitive in the detection of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogenicity,</b> with values higher than those {{for many of the}} regulatory genotoxicity tests. This test has great potential to fill a need for a new pre-regulatory test that is easier, cheaper and quicker to perform, while still being predictive of rodent carcinogenicity. In this thesis experimentation fell into three groups - investigation of compounds with positive results in one or more regulatory mammalian in vivo tests; testing of compounds with little or contradictory regulatory genotoxicity data and investigation into the effect of the GADD 45 a regulatory elements included within the reporter plasmid. The testing of false positive compounds showed GreenScreen HC to be second only to the MNT test for specificity and confirmed previously published data stating the high levels of specificity of GreenScreen HC. Testing of groups of compounds with little genotoxicity data highlighted genotoxic potential for a number of compounds including a number of the histone deacetylase inhibitors and the synthetic retinoid CD 437. The effect of the regulatory elements included in the assay were investigated through use of reporters with mutated response elements. With each mutation, the induction of GADD 45 a was lessened and this highlighted the importance of the use of cells with fully component DNA damage response pathways for genotoxicity testing.

40|$|Diverse non-steriodal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs and}} COX- 2 inhibitors are {{a class of}} drugs which selectively inhibit COX- 2, provide relief from pain and inflammation. However, they lack anti-thrombotic activity and hence lead to cardiovascular and renal liabilities apart from gastrointestinal irritation. To ameliorate this situation, research can be foccuss on the products originating from natural products that could offer better relief from inflammation than the currently used commercial drugs. Aspirin blocks the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX 1, 2) which {{is involved in the}} ring closure and the addition of O 2 to arachidonic acid, converting it to prostaglandins (which induce inflammation, pain and fever). The present study is undertaken to analyse the docking efficacy of aspirin with the target molecule (2 AW 1), to assess the best ligand for inhibiting COX and to analyze the docking program by Arguslab. Substituting aspirin ligand by sapelenin G, the finding suggests that sapelenin G is a better ligand than aspirin. It satisfies Lipinski Rule of 5. The PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) prediction results show that Sapelenin G has an anti-inflammatory activity. Toxicity estimations of Sapelenin G using Toxtree on humans and based on the Cramer rules, Verhaar, Structural Alerts for Reactivity in Toxtree (START) biodegradability, eye irritation/corrosion and skin irritation/corrosion fell into class 3, 5, 1, 2 and 1, respectively. Application of the Benigni-Bossa method showed that this compound is negative for <b>genotoxic</b> <b>carcinogenicity</b> and negative for non-genotoxic carcinogenicity. The cytochrome P- 450 mediated drug metabolism is negative for Sapelenin G only in SMARTCyp. Rank 2. sites of metabolism, and it fell into unreactive group of compounds by Michael addition. A skin sensitization evaluation reveals that the compound has no skin sensitization alert identified, moreover, Kroes Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) decision tree reveals that the Substance would not be expected to be a safety concern...|$|E
40|$|Neosugar, a {{fructooligosaccharide}} mixture, {{was tested}} for genotoxicity in three assays: (1) microbial reverse mutation assays in Salmonella typhimuriyn (Ames assay) and Esch-ericliia coli WP 2 uvrA, (2) the L 5178 Y mouse lymphoma TK mammalian cell mutation assay, and (3) an assay for the induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in human epithelioid cells (HeLa S 3). Each assay {{was conducted at}} {{a wide range of}} dose levels, both with and without metabolic activation. Test results gave no indication that neosugar possessed any <b>genotoxic</b> potential. The <b>carcinogenicity</b> and chronic toxicity of neosugar were examined in Fischer 344 rats. Rats were fed diets containing 0, 8000, 20, 000, or 50, 000 ppm neosugar for 104 weeks. No dose-related effects on survival, growth, hema-tology, blood chemistry, organ weights, or nonneoplastic lesions were observed. The in-cidence of rare and spontaneous tumors was comparable between control and neosugar treatment groups, with the exception of pituitary adenomas in male rats. In light of the background incidence of this tumor and an equivocal dose-response trend, it is unlikely that neosugar treatment is related to the incidence of pituitary adenomas in male rats. The results {{of this study indicate that}} neosugar is nonmutagenic and that rats are not ad-versely affected by chronic neosugar exposure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Since {{the finding}} in the 1930 s, {{a large number of}} {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of different structures have been tested for potential tumorigenicity. Structure-activity relationships of halo-PAHs have been investigated to determine the regions of a PAH that may be involved in cancer initiation. From these studies, a number of halo-PAHs were found to be tumorigenic in experimental animals. It was not until the 1980 s that halo-PAHs were found to be present in the environment, including municipal incinerator fly ash, urban air, coal combustion, soil, snow, automobile exhausts, and tap water. Due to their widespread presence in the environment and their <b>genotoxic</b> activities, including <b>carcinogenicity,</b> many of these compounds may pose a health risk to humans. Although the biological activities, including metabolism, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity, of halo-PAHs have been studied their phototoxicity and photo-induced biological activity have not been well examined. In this study, we study the photoirradiation of a series of structure-related halo-PAHs by UVA light {{in the presence of a}} lipid, methyl linoleate, and determine as to whether or not these compounds can induce lipid peroxidation. The halo-PAHs chosen for study include 2 -bromonaphthalene, 1 -chloroanthracene, 9, 10 -dibromoanthracene, 9 -chlorophenanthrene, 9 -bromophenanthrene, 7 -chlorobenz[a]anthracene, 7 -bromobenz[a]anthracene, 7 -bromo- 5 -methylbenz[a]anthracene, 6 -chlorobenzo[a]pyrene, and 6 -bromobenzo[a]pyrene.

40|$|The {{strategy}} for assessing human health risks of chemicals {{consists of a}} large number of tests in different research disciplines. Tests include acute and chronic toxicity, genotoxicity, reproduction toxicity and <b>carcinogenicity.</b> <b>Genotoxic</b> properties of chemicals are assessed in short-term in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests. There are two main endpoints for genotoxicity: gene mutations and chromosome aberrations. Under in vitro conditions, there are sufficient assays for both endpoints. Testing under in vivo conditions is essential to confirm in vitro data since it is impossible to mimic, in a petri dish, all the complex factors determining whether a chemical will induce mutations in a specific tissue in animals in vivo. Moreover, in a regulatory context, a relevant negative in vivo result from an adequately performed test overrules positive in vitro results. There are appropriate assays in existence to investigate in vivo chromosome aberration; however, problems occur when a compound induces gene mutations in vitro. In the absence of reliable in vivo gene mutation assays, a justified assessment of the genotoxic potential of chemicals may be hampered. Introduced in this report, based open literature data up to August 2000, are several promising new in vivo gene mutation assays. The report is not restricted to assays with the commercially available transgenic models; all assays - whether using transgenes or endogenous genes as reporter genes - are incorporated. In reviewing the current state of the art in evaluating these assays, the advantages and the disadvantages of the assays are discussed. This is to determine the feasibility of the routine use of these new in vivo gene mutation tests for health risk estimation. Gene mutation assays with transgenic animals have already been used on a small scale for legislation of chemicals. However, to allow the routine use of these assays for regulatory purposes, they will have to be validated further and an official OECD guideline prepared. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Safety {{assessment}} {{relating to}} the presence of impurities, residual materials and contaminants in vaccines is a focus area of research at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sponsors who submit Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for new vaccine products must report the results of safety assessments to the Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications (DVRPA). Scientifically defining thresholds of toxicological concern (TTCs) as they apply to vaccine constituents will provide a useful aid to the sponsors and public regarding safety assessments of compounds for which {{there is little or no}} toxicity data. TTCs are mathematically modeled and extrapolated levels, below which adverse human health effects are not expected to occur (Kroes, 2004). In this project, we accessed DVRPA 2 ̆ 7 s submission databases and open source data to yield an initial chemical test set. Using INCHEM, RepDose, RTECS and TOXNET, we gathered LD 50 and TDLo data. Using a structure-based decision tree, provided in the ToxTree software package, (3) different algorithms (The Cramer extended, the In vivo rodent micronucleus assay, and the Benigni-Bossa rule base for carcinogenicity by ISS) were applied to assign the initial test set (n= 197) of chemicals into structural families based on structural alerts (SAs). This resulted in six (6) potential methods for elucidating TTCs: In vivo rodent micronucleus assay/ LD 50, Benigni-Bossa/ LD 50, Cramer extended/ LD 50, In vivo rodent micronucleus assay/ TDLo, Benigni-Bossa/ TDLo, and the Cramer extended/ TDLo. After each algorithm designated two structural families each, the distribution of TDLo 2 ̆ 7 s and LD 502 ̆ 7 s for each structural family was subjected to a preliminary data analysis using JMP statistical software version 9. Based on an analysis of quantiles, skew, and kurtosis, it was concluded that the TDLo dataset was of poor quality and was dropped from further analysis, and that the In vivo rodent micronucleus assay algorithm failed to partition the initial test set in a meaningful way, so it too was culled from further consideration. This resulted in (2) remaining TTC methods for further consideration: Benigni-Bossa/ LD 50 and the Cramer extended/ LD 50. The remaining methods were subjected to internal validation based on Gene-Tox, CCRIS, CPDB, IARC, and EPA classaifications for <b>genotoxic</b> mutagenicity and <b>carcinogenicity.</b> Validation parameters were calculated for both methods and it was determined that the Benigni-Bossa/ LD 50 method outperformed the Cramer extended/ LD 50 method in terms of specificity (87. 2 vs. 48. 1...|$|R
