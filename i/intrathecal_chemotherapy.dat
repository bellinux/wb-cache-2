5000|$|Certain {{treatments}} for childhood cancer {{are known to}} cause learning problems in survivors, particularly when central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapies are used (e.g. [...] radiation; high-dose methotrexate or cytarabine; or <b>intrathecal</b> <b>chemotherapy).</b> As the mortality rates of childhood cancers have plummeted since effective treatment regiments have been introduced, greater {{attention has been paid}} to the effect of treatment on neurocognitive morbidity and quality of life of survivors.

Close monitoring of the patient and adequate hydration is essential during the process. Since Burkitts lymphoma has high propensity to spread to the central nervous system (lymphomatous meningitis), <b>intrathecal</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> with methotrexate and/or ARA-C and/or prednisolone is given alongside with systemic chemotherapy.|$|E

Whole-brain prophylaxis radiation used to be a common method in treatment of children’s ALL. Recent studies showed that CNS chemotherapy provided results as favorable but with less developmental side-effects. As a result, the use of whole-brain radiation has been more limited.

5000|$|Intrathecal protocols. One of the {{difficulties}} with brain and spinal tumors is that the blood brain barrier needs to be crossed so that the drug {{can get to the}} tumor. One mechanism to deliver the drug is through a device called an Ommaya reservoir. This is a device which shares some characteristics with a shunt in which a tube a surgically placed in the fluid surrounding the brain and a bulb shaped reservoir attached to the tubing is placed under the skin of the scalp. When the child is to receive <b>intrathecal</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> the drug is administered into this bulb reservoir. At other times intrathecal chemotherapeutic agents are delivered through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). A current Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium Protocol uses intrathecal mafosfamide, a pre-activated cyclophosphamide derivative, in addition to other modalities to try to effect this tumor.|$|E
5000|$|Chemotherapy {{is rarely}} {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of brain metastases, as chemotherapeutic agents penetrate the blood brain barrier poorly.

40|$|Candidal {{meningitis}} {{is a rare}} {{infectious disease}} that usually leads to substantial morbidity and mortality. We present a case of candidal meningitis refractory to systemic antifungal therapy (amphotericin B and fluconazole). A 63 -year-old female with lymphoblastic lymphoma and myelodysplasia with leukemia transformation developed prolonged fever and headache on the seventh day following <b>intrathecal</b> prophylactic <b>chemotherapy.</b> A lumbar puncture showed neutrophilic pleocytosis, and a cerebrospinal fluid culture yielded Candida albicans. The clinical course was complicated by brain edema, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus. Parenteral therapy with amphotericin B alone or amphotericin B in combination with fluconazole or intrathecal administration of amphotericin B failed to eradicate C. albicans in the cerebrospinal fluid. After 7 days of caspofungin therapy, however, the cerebrospinal fluid became sterile and the patient gradually regained consciousness. She was discharged 1 month after completing 4 weeks of caspofungin therapy. There were two critical issues we thought to be relevant to the favorable outcome of this case.

40|$|<b>Intrathecal</b> (IT) <b>chemotherapy</b> is an {{important}} component of the prophylaxis or treatment of hematologic malignancies in the central nervous system (CNS), especially in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and aggressive lymphomas. Different regimens of IT chemotherapies have been formulated, often in conjunction with systemic high-dose chemotherapy leading to penetration of the drugs into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The three commonest IT drugs are methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and corticosteroids. The CSF half-lives of methotrexate and Ara-C are much prolonged, a factor to be considered if these drugs are also administered systemically in high doses. Neurotoxicities attributed to IT chemotherapy have been reported, including spinal cord lesions, seizures, and encephalopathy. Spinal cord lesions, manifesting as tetraplegia, paraplegia, and cauda equina syndrome, are the commonest neurotoxicity. It is mostly related to combined IT methotrexate and Ara-C, or Ara-C as the sole IT agent when given at high doses or as a slow-release preparation. Cord lesions rarely recover and patients are left with motor deficits, bowel and urinary disabilities. Seizures and encephalopathy are reported in relatively fewer patients, with variable manifestations and prognosis. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics, dosing schedules and potential toxicities of IT chemotherapeutic drugs is important in the design of CNS prophylaxis and treatment in hematologic malignancies. © Springer-Verlag 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|While rare, {{cases of}} {{isolated}} extramedullary disease of B-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (B-LBL) without morphologic bone marrow involvement have been described. In this report, we illustrate {{the case of}} an elderly gentleman who presented with isolated testicular and vertebral LBL involvement but had no morphologic bone marrow involvement. The initial plan of treatment was to treat along the lines of Philadelphia negative B-ALL/LBL. During this time, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR testing for BCR-ABL 1 rearrangements were being performed on the marrow specimens as a part of routine diagnostic workup. While the FISH returned negative, PCR testing unexpectedly detected BCR-ABL 1 fusion transcripts at a low level of 0. 48 %. Given their presence, we performed FISH for BCR/ABL 1 rearrangement in both testicular and L 5 vertebral specimens which were 80 – 90 % positive. He subsequently received rituximab, hyper-CVAD, and dasatinib, along with prophylactic <b>intrathecal</b> prophylactic <b>chemotherapy.</b> The patient achieved a prolonged remission but eventually relapsed, 4 years later.
