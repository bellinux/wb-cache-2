The <b>Grecale</b> launched the boats, which then carried the chariots and their charioteers and released them three miles from La Spezia harbour.

5000|$|As the {{commander}} of the 3rd Division, Brivonesi was the protagonist of the Italian defeat in the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. On 8 November 1941, Brivonesi sailed from Messina with Trieste, Trento and the 13th Destroyer Flotilla (Granatiere, Bersagliere, Fuciliere, Alpino) as distant escort of the [...] "Beta" [...] convoy (later known as the [...] "Duisburg" [...] convoy), which consisted in 7 merchant ships (the Italian cargo ships Maria, Sagitta and Rina Corrado, the Italian tankers Conte di Misurata and Minatitlan and the German cargo ships Duisburg and San Marco, laden with 389 vehicles, 34,473 long tons of munitions and matériel and 17,281 long tons of fuel) with a close escort of six destroyers (under the command of Captain Ugo Bisciani on Maestrale). The convoy was spotted by a British reconnaissance plane, and Force K (light cruisers Aurora and Penelope and destroyers Lance and Lively) sailed from Malta to intercept. The attack happened during the following night; Force K took the close escort by surprise, sank one destroyer (Fulmine) and disabled another (<b>Grecale),</b> then proceeded to sink all the seven merchants, while the confused and disarticulated reaction of the other destroyers (left without orders, as Maestrales radio antenna was shot away) was unable to stop or damage the British ships. Brivonesi's 3rd Division, {{at the time of the}} attack (00:57 on 9 November), was sailing at 12 knots about three miles astern and to the east of the convoy. The Division only realized that the convoy was being attacked when they spotted the flash of the British guns; shortly before, at 00:30, Trieste had intercepted a coded message of unknown source and meaning (the source was Force K), and Brivonesi was about to send a general alert to all his ships, when the battle started. Trieste and Trento opened fire on Force K at 1:03, from a distance of 9,000-10,000 meters; Brivonesi's subsequent manoeuvre later drew heavy criticism: instead of turning southeast, where Force K was, to close in on the British ships and attack them at once, he turned starboard so that his cruisers could bring all guns to bear, which required several minutes. Brivonesi's ships briefly assumed a southerly course (thus distancing themselves from Force K even more), then turned to port and then to starboard, advancing at a speed of only 15-16 knots, less than half the speed that they could keep. Force K kept manoeuvring around the convoy so that the latter was constantly between the British ships and the Italian Division, which caused the blazing merchants and their smoke to hamper the aim of the Italian gunners. At 1:12 Brivonesi ordered to increase speed to 18 knots and at 1:25 to 24 knots, but by then the distance had risen to 17,000 meters, and he ordered to cease fire, as it was pointless. At 1:29 Brivonesi ordered to turn north, in order to intercept the Force K when the latter would turn back towards Malta (by then the convoy was completely destroyed). Meanwhile, however, Supermarina (the Italian Navy high command) had informed him that the risk of a torpedo bomber attack on his ships was high; as they were outside of Malta's aircraft's reach, Brivonesi believed that a British aircraft carrier was in the area. Upon realizing that the fires of the disabled merchant ships lighted up his ships, making them easier targets for submarines as well as aircraft, Brivonesi ordered to cease fire, leave the area and assume a northwesterly course, at 1:32. Overall, Trieste and Trento had fired 207 8-inch shells, without scoring any hits. The 3rd Division only returned to the area after a few hours, to cover the search and rescue operation, during which the destroyer Libeccio was sunk by HMS Upholder and Trento was narrowly missed by a torpedo.|$|E
40|$|Several {{epidemiological}} {{studies show that}} fruits, vegetables and cereals can play a nutraceutical role for their content of many antioxidant phytochemicals such as carotenoids, ascorbic acid and phenolics. A commercial inoculant (MICOSAT F(®)) containing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could improve the nutritional value in crops.

The treatment increased the antioxidant activity in strawberries (37. 50 %), in giant lentils (29. 17 %) and in durum wheat (63. 63 %) but decreased it in kiwi (31. 81 %) and in grape (19. 81 %). Nitrate levels decreased significantly in strawberries (39. 78 %) and in tomato intended for transformation (37. 79 %). The application of MICOSAT F(®) enhanced the levels of several secondary metabolites. However, the amount of phytochemicals and respective by-products were reduced in some cases.

40|$|International audienceWater {{deficit and}} {{increasing}} salinization reduce productivity of wheat, the leading crop for human diet. While the complete genome sequence of this crop {{has not been}} deciphered, a BAC library screening allowed the isolation of TdERF 1, the first ethylene response factor gene from durum wheat. This gene is putatively involved in mediating salt stress tolerance and its characterization provides clues towards understanding the mechanisms underlyning the adaptation/tolerance of durum wheat to suboptimal growth conditions. TdERF 1 expression is differentially induced by high salt treatment in two durum wheat varieties, the salt-tolerant <b>Grecale</b> (GR) and the salt-sensitive Om Rabiaa (OR). To further extend these findings, we show here that the expression of this ERF is correlated with physiological parameters, such as the accumulation of osmo-regulators and membrane integrity, that discriminate between the two contrasted wheat genotypes. The data confirm that GR and OR are two contrasted wheat genotypes with regard to salt-stress and show that TdERF 1 is also induced by water stress with an expression pattern clearly discriminating between the twogenotypes. These findings suggest that TdERF 1 might be involved in responses to salt and water stress providing a potential genetic marker discriminating between tolerant and sensitive wheat varieties...|$|E
40|$|Five ancient shipwrecks {{have been}} found in the sea off Croton, in {{southern}} Italy, each carrying a marble cargo composed of massive blocks, column shafts, and smaller artifacts. Three of them were located while surveying the seafloor with a multibeam sonar, and the remaining two with the help of divers, in the summers of 2005 and 2006. Two of the marble carriers are located in the bay of Punta Scifo and, therefore, are identified as the Punta Scifo A and Punta Scifo B shipwrecks, the remaining three take their names from the closest promontories: Punta Cicala, Capo Cimiti, and Capo Bianco. The Punta Scifo A shipwreck was chosen as the main focus of this work because it contains a unique assemblage of marble artifacts; including 13 basins, 15 stands decorated with lions? paws, 16 column shafts, 14 blocks, 6 statue pedestals, and one statuette of Eros and Psyche. Moreover, because the original discovery dates back to 1908, and in 1915 salvors raised 150 tons of marble artifacts, much information was in danger of being lost. Consular inscriptions on the Punta Scifo A?s marble blocks and column shafts date the shipwreck to the early third century A. D. The merchantman was ca. 30 m long and 10 m wide, with a cargo of marble items weighting ca. 200 tons. The merchantman was loaded with its marble cargo in Asia Minor: all the items carried on board came from the quarries of Proconnesus and Docimium. The most likely point of departure was either Epheus or Miletus. While sailing toward the Strait of Messina, it is likely that a <b>Grecale</b> or Levante storm broke, and the helmsman was forced to look for shelter in the protected bay of Punta Scifo. Due to a change in wind direction a southerly Scirocco storm caused the ship to sink. Since the entire coastline south of Croton is totally unprotected to the south, there was no way for the crew to save their ship. Where the Punta Scifo A merchantman was destined remains unknown, although Rome appears to be a likely candidate...|$|E
