The Hong Kong government has been encouraging non-government secondary schools which have attained a sufficiently high educational standard to join the DSS by providing subsidies to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> private school education since the 1991–92 school year. In the 2000–01 school year, the DSS is extended to primary schools. In the 2001–02 school year, the terms of the DSS were significantly improved to attract more schools to join the scheme. Under the scheme, schools are free to decide on their curriculum, fees and entrance requirements.|$|E

25|$|Its {{four core}} {{principles}} are: {{that the quality}} of the child parent attachment plays {{a significant role in the}} life trajectory of the child; that lasting change results from parents changing their caregiving patterns rather than by learning techniques to manage their child's behaviors; that parents relationship capacities are best enhanced if they themselves are operating within a secure base relationship; and that interventions designed to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> child–parent attachments will be especially effective if they are focused on the caregiver and based on the strengths and difficulties of each caregiver/child dyad.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependence}} on human translators to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the translation {{is not free}} of problems. Besides syntactic and semantic factors there are factors of style and aesthetics of the target language. While many so-called professional translators could produce comprehensible text of higher quality than machine translation, {{the quality of the}} text in the target language is difficult to assess. Awkward or unfluent texts, when admitted in the system, may establish norms and frame of reference that don't serve the purpose of enhancing the overall quality of translation, and an example for translators, or aspiring translators to imitate. This, however, is arguably outside of the scope of the project.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the debates}} {{surrounding}} the United States federal budget center around competing macroeconomic schools of thought. In general, Democrats favor the principles of Keynesian economics to encourage economic growth via a mixed economy of {{both private and public}} enterprise, a welfare state, and strong regulatory oversight. Conversely, Republicans generally support applying the principles of either laissez-faire or supply-side economics to grow the economy via small government, low taxes, limited regulation, and free enterprise. Debates have surrounded the appropriate size and role of the federal government since the founding of the country. These debates also deal with questions of morality, income equality, and intergenerational equity. For example, Congress adding to the debt today may or may not <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life for future generations, who must also bear the additional interest and taxation burden.|$|E

He supports the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center, the David Foster Foundation, which helps families of children in need of organ transplants, and Musicians on Call, which brings music to hospital patients' bedsides. He also performs during dinners and auctions to benefit children with disabilities. Hill and McGraw gave the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society $375,000 (the entire gate receipts from one of their concerts) to assist the families of 17 sailors following the terrorist attack on USS Cole, the guided missile destroyer that suffered significant damage in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen on October 12, 2000.|$|E
25|$|An upper {{gastrointestinal}} series, {{also called}} an upper gastrointestinal study or contrast radiography {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, {{is a series of}} radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A contrast medium, usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, peristalsis, or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and enteroclysis (small bowel enema). To further <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas {{is referred to as the}} negative contrast medium. Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called CT enterography.|$|E

500|$|The {{recommended}} {{model of}} hospice for children {{differs from that}} of adults. In 2000, the committees on Bioethics and Hospital Care for the American Academy of Pediatrics jointly released a recommendation that palliative care for children should be provided for any life-threatening condition from the point of diagnosis, whether death is the prognosis or not, as the benefits of palliative care can be offered concurrently with curative treatment. The Virginia-based Children's Hospice International also recommends hospice services for all children with life-threatening conditions, even if seeking [...] "hopeful" [...] treatment, [...] "to <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life for the child and family". However, the federal standards set by Medicaid require the six-months terminal prognosis.
