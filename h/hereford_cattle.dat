5000|$|Probably Hereford's {{most famous}} export is its <b>Hereford</b> beef <b>cattle.</b> <b>Herefords</b> are docile but {{extremely}} hardy creatures and these attributes {{have led to}} their proliferation across the world, particularly the USA, South America and Australia. The breed is so gentle that a Hereford bull {{has been used as}} the mascot for Hereford United Football Club for many years, led around the club's Edgar Street ground before major matches.|$|R
50|$|Bennet {{continued}} {{working with}} cattle, and around 1898 began breeding <b>Hereford</b> stud <b>cattle,</b> {{and he won}} numerous prizes with bulls exhibited in Victoria and South Australia.

25|$|Lawrence Bixby: Preserver of the Old Spade Ranch {{written by}} Ruth Van Ackeren and Robert M. Howard, follows {{the story of}} Lawrence Bixby who picked up {{the pieces of the}} {{crumbling}} Spade Empire to form a second ranching dynasty that forged a path through twentieth century ranching by raising market topping <b>Hereford</b> <b>cattle,</b> award-winning Percheron and Belgian Workhorses and producing revered prize winning Calf Roping Quarterhorses, while doing all possible to protect and preserve the ranch he called home.|$|E
25|$|Richards {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on upgrading the breeding operation. He experimented with grain feeds {{to take care of}} calves and other special feeding problems, and he put windmills for adequate water. Richards and Comstock were the first cattlemen in the area to use chloro-naptholeum, a livestock dip that removed lice, mange, Texas itch, and other external parasites. The Spade Ranch was the agent for this patented product west of the Mississippi River. In 1903, the Spade's <b>Hereford</b> <b>cattle</b> won the Grand Prize at the American Royal Stock Show in Kansas City, Missouri for the best of any breed in both yearling and calf competition.|$|E

500|$|The {{color of}} Naturalean {{composites}} or crossbred cattle can be solid black or solid red with black or reddish pigmentation {{in the same}} areas as the pigmentation on fullbloods. They may be horned or polled, and homozygous (2 copy), or heterozygous (1 copy). Fullbloods and Naturalean bulls are often crossed with traditional beef breeds like Black Angus or <b>Hereford</b> <b>cattle</b> because of substantial benefits in the crossbred results, including a higher protein meat that is lower in saturated fat, improved tenderness, and an approximate 7% yield increase in salable carcass. [...] Calving problems are also reduced in the crossbreds.|$|E
500|$|Returning to home {{to work as}} a grazier, Bruxner {{eventually}} {{moved to}} Tenterfield and set up business as a Stock and station agent. He also purchased [...] "Roseneath", a grazing property near Tenterfield, where he bred <b>Hereford</b> <b>cattle.</b> On 17 June 1908 at Christ Church, Kiama, he married Winifred Catherine Hay Caird. Bruxner became vice-president of the local agricultural society and of the Cricket and Rugby clubs in Tenterfield.

40|$|Genomic {{selection}} (GS) {{has played}} an important role in cattle breeding programs. However, genotyping prices are still a challenge for implementation of GS in beef cattle and there is still a lack of information about the use of low-density Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) chip panels for genomic predictions in breeds such as Brazilian Braford and Hereford. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of using imputed genotypes in the accuracy of genomic predictions for twenty economically important traits in Brazilian Braford and <b>Hereford</b> beef <b>cattle.</b> Various scenarios composed by different percentages of animals with imputed genotypes and different sizes of the training population were compared.

500|$|Ruth {{continued}} with her studies at Harper Adams {{and she and}} David eventually established [...] "a good working relationship". Ruth was given the responsibility of looking after the dairy herd, before becoming {{a partner in the}} farm. Ruth and David's first child, Philippa Rose, or Pip (Helen Monks), was born in February 1993. Joanna Toye and Adrian Flynn, authors of The Archers Encyclopaedia, said Ruth took to motherhood well and did not let it stop her from playing an active part in Brookfield. The couple's second child, Joshua, was born in 1997. Ruth and David later purchased some <b>Hereford</b> <b>cattle</b> and began to establish themselves as suppliers of traditional beef. Toye and Flynn observed that Ruth and David's marriage had to be strong when the Archer siblings began arguing over who would inherit Brookfield Farm. Ruth told David that [...] "time was too precious to spend in argument" [...] and suggested they moved away. However, David's father, Phil, decided that the farm should go to the couple.|$|E

5000|$|The son of Gudbrandur [...] "Goodie" [...] Einarson and Maria Sigvaldason, both {{natives of}} Iceland, Einarson was educated at local schools, and later {{worked as a}} farmer. He enlisted in the army in 1939 and served until the {{beginning}} of January 1946. He was stationed in Holland artillery gun at the Chalet at Columbia Ice Fields on April 1944. When he and many others arrived home from overseas, there was a period of adjustment and when younger brother Lloyd decided {{he did not want to}} stay on the farm, Henry bought it and eventually expanded it to a larger acreage. Returning from the war, he went into farming in the Rock Lake area, raising first‑class <b>Hereford</b> beef <b>cattle</b> and, in latter years, poultry to a lesser degree.|$|R
2500|$|Hereford {{played at}} Edgar Street for their entire history. [...] They were nicknamed 'The Whites' or 'The Lilywhites', after their {{predominantly}} white kit, or 'The Bulls' after the <b>Hereford</b> <b>cattle</b> breed. The club's motto was [...] "Our greatest glory {{lies not in}} never having fallen, but in rising when we fall". The club was affiliated to the Herefordshire County FA.

After reaching the coastline of Port Phillip, Captain Coltish chose the area now known as Port Gellibrand, as a suitable place to unload his cargo. Within weeks of the first consignment, a stream of vessels began making their way across Bass Strait. Because of the sheltered harbour, many of these new arrivals decided to settle in the immediate area.|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Arthur Young {{stayed at}} Petworth House while {{conducting}} his surveys of English agriculture. The earl established a pedigree herd of Sussex cattle {{from the local}} breed which was commended by Young who wrote that they [...] "must be unquestionably ranked among {{the best of the}} kingdom". [...] A herd descended from these animals is maintained at Stag Park at the present day. Devon and <b>Hereford</b> <b>cattle</b> were also kept, together with crossbreds. Different breeds of sheep were tried and exotic Tibetan Shaul goats, which [...] produced fine wool for hatters.|$|E
50|$|Shelton {{purchased}} 211,000 {{acres in}} the Texas Panhandle, in Oldham County and Hartley County, Texas in 1914. A year later, in 1915, he purchased the Bravo Ranch, which spanned 111,000 acres in Hartley County, Texas, for US$540,000. The acreage came from the XIT Ranch. Shortly after {{the purchase of the}} ranch, he was the owner of 500,000 acres and 28,000 head of cattle in total. Shelton raised <b>Hereford</b> and Angus <b>cattle</b> on the Bravo Ranch.|$|R
60|$|Returning to {{the several}} British breeds, the {{conspicuous}} difference in general appearance between Shorthorns, Longhorns (now rarely seen), <b>Herefords,</b> Highland <b>cattle,</b> Alderneys, etc., must {{be familiar to}} every one. A part of this difference {{may be attributed to}} descent from primordially distinct species; but we may feel sure {{that there has been a}} considerable amount of variation. Even during the Neolithic period, the domestic cattle were to a certain extent variable. Within recent times most of the breeds have been modified by careful and methodical selection. How strongly the characters thus acquired are inherited, may be inferred from the prices realised by the improved breeds; even at the first sale of Colling's Shorthorns, eleven bulls reached an average of 214 pounds, and lately Shorthorn bulls have been sold for a thousand guineas, and have been exported to all quarters of the world.|$|R
2500|$|Following Lawrence Bixby's {{death in}} 1982 ranch {{operations}} were passed to son James D. Bixby. Jim {{who had won}} notoriety in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association Calf Roping circuit retained a very large quarterhorse remuda and maintained the Spade's tradition of using only horse and cowboy for daily ranch operations. During his ownership Bixby transitioned the cow herd from <b>Hereford</b> to Angus <b>Cattle</b> due to changing market demands. Jim was very active {{on and off the}} ranch until his death from cancer in 1990.|$|R

25|$|King Neptune {{was born}} in a litter of 12 on the Sherman Boner farm near West Frankfort, Illinois. Originally named Parker Neptune, in honor of his father Parker Sensation, he was raised by Boner's daughter, Patty, as a 4-H project. Neptune was donated by Sherman Boner on December 5, 1942 and was {{originally}} intended to be served at a fundraising pig roast until the local navy recruiter had another idea. Neptune was a Hereford swine, a breed characterized as mostly red, with a white face, ears and at least two white feet, {{similar to that of the}} <b>Hereford</b> breed of <b>cattle.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late 1977, David Templeton and {{two other}} former {{partners}} of Gold Creek Pty Ltd bought the Red Hill <b>Hereford</b> Stud, a <b>cattle</b> breeding business located near Finley in southern NSW. Established in 1966, Red Hill Stud's breeding stock was top notch. Initially the partners transported their prize bulls to Gold Creek {{to prepare them for}} show and eventual sale. The Red Hill Hereford Stud won a swag of blue ribbons at Agricultural Shows in Canberra, Sydney and regional NSW. Its success led to a series of cattle breeders’ field days at Gold Creek held in conjunction with the Australian Hereford Society that attracted society members from around Australia.|$|R
