40|$|The {{preliminary}} tests described here {{were made to}} determine the extent to which wing tip <b>floating</b> <b>ailerons</b> might be effective in reducing airplane spinning tendencies. The tests showed that initial spinning tendencies and rates of stable spinning could doubtless be reduced by the use of tip <b>floating</b> <b>ailerons</b> on an airplane. It also appears to be desirable to reduce to a minimum the interference between wing and aileron. This would serve to maintain uniformity of action at all angles of attack and enable calculation of the aileron characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Discussed {{here are}} a series of {{systematic}} tests being conducted to compare different lateral control devices with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack. The present tests were made with six different forms of <b>floating</b> tip <b>ailerons</b> of symmetrical section. The tests showed the effect of the various ailerons on the general performance characteristics of the wing, and on the lateral controllability and stability characteristics. In addition, the hinge moments were measured for the most interesting cases. The results are compared with those for a rectangular wing with ordinary ailerons and also with those for a rectangular wing having full-chord <b>floating</b> tip <b>ailerons.</b> Practically all the <b>floating</b> tip <b>ailerons</b> gave satisfactory rolling moments at all angles of attack {{and at the same time}} gave no adverse yawing moments of appreciable magnitude. The general performance characteristics with the <b>floating</b> tip <b>ailerons,</b> however, were relatively poor, especially the rate of climb. None of the <b>floating</b> tip <b>ailerons</b> entirely eliminated the auto rotational moments at angles of attack above the stall, but all of them gave lower moments than a plain wing. Some of the <b>floating</b> <b>ailerons</b> fluttered if given sufficiently large deflection, but this could have been eliminated by moving the hinge axis of the ailerons forward. Considering all points including hinge moments, the <b>floating</b> tip <b>ailerons</b> on the wing with 5 : 1 taper are probably the best of those which were tested...|$|R
5000|$|The {{airport was}} {{established}} by Richard A. Newhouse (original spelling Neuhaus). Among his other aviation-related projects, in 1911 he built a plane of his own design, featuring separate <b>floating</b> <b>ailerons</b> [...] - [...] a major innovation, as the planes of that time used wing warping for roll control.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{described in}} this report was made to determine the effectiveness of <b>floating</b> wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> as an airplane control in the spin. In these tests the ailerons, not being balanced, were set parallel to the axis of rotation, which is probably very nearly the attitude that balanced <b>floating</b> <b>ailerons</b> would assume in a spin. The tests were made with the spinning balance in the N. A. C. A. 5 -foot vertical tunnel. The model was tested with and without the ailerons in 12 spinning attitudes chosen to cover the probable spinning range. Rolling- and yawing-moment coefficients are given as measured for the model with and without the ailerons, and computed values are given for the ailerons alone. The addition of <b>floating</b> wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> to the model doubled the rolling-moment coefficient and increased the yawing-moment coefficient by 0. 05 and more. Both moments were in a sense to oppose the spin...|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of flight tests comparing the relative effectiveness of conventional ailerons of the same size on wings of rectangular and tapered plan forms made with a Fairchild 22 airplane. Information is included comparing conventional and <b>floating</b> wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> on a tapered wing. The results showed that the conventional ailerons were somewhat more effective on the tapered than on the rectangular wing. The difference, however, was so small as to be imperceptible to the pilots. The <b>floating</b> wing-tip <b>ailerons</b> were only half as effective as the conventional ailerons and, for this reason, were considered unsatisfactory...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of split flaps for the dual purpose of reducing the landing speed and shortening the landing glide of airplanes has established as acute the problem of obtaining satisfactory lateral control {{to be used in}} conjunction with the flaps with out the sacrifice of any of the effectiveness of the flaps. A large amount of work is being done on this problem by various organizations and individuals. Several of the devices developed seem usable, some of them unquestionably so. The present paper attempts to summarize the most promising results obtained to date. Topics covered include ordinary <b>ailerons,</b> external <b>ailerons,</b> <b>floating</b> <b>ailerons,</b> upper-surface ailerons, and spoilers. Although the external ailerons above the trailing edge of the wing and the spoilers {{at the rear of the}} wing appear quite promising, it would seem that probably the most satisfactory immediate solution of the problem, including the obtaining of light and smoothly graduated control forces, would in most cases be obtained by the use of the arrangement in which the flap is retracted ahead of ordinary narrow-chord ailerons and is deflected to the rear as well as downward when in use...|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 1 August 1943 U-383 was {{attacked}} west of Brittany, at position , by a Short Sunderland of No. 228 Squadron RAF. Responding with flak, the U-boat holed the fuselage and shot away the starboard <b>float</b> and <b>aileron</b> of the aircraft, which pressed home its attack and straddled the U-boat with depth charges before heading back to base. Kremser radioed for assistance, and though three U-boats and three torpedo boats searched during the night and the next day, they failed to locate the crippled U-383 and she was presumed lost.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the fourth of a series on {{systematic}} tests conducted which compares lateral control devices with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack. The present report covers tests with <b>floating</b> tip <b>ailerons</b> on rectangular Clark y wings. Ailerons of two profiles were tested - symmetrical and Clark y, both with adjustable trailing-edge flaps. Each form was tested at three hinge-axis locations, both with and without vertical end plates between the ailerons and the wing proper. The results from these tests are compared with the results from tests on a wing of the same over-all size equipped with average-sized ordinary ailerons...|$|R
50|$|In 1922 W.O. Manning led {{a team of}} {{designers}} to produce a coastal patrol and anti-submarine flying boat to meet Air Ministry Specification 23/23. They based the design on the Cork and the resulting aircraft looked similar but the hull was designed to the latest standard. The Kingston also had redesigned wingtip <b>floats,</b> extended upper-wing <b>ailerons,</b> and a larger fin and rudder than the Cork.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} made to {{demonstrate}} the particularity of employing fixed tabs {{in conjunction with a}} suitably designed differential linkage to reduce the force required to operate ailerons. The tests showed the system to be practicable with tabs of the inset type. The relative ineffectiveness of attached tabs for changing the <b>aileron</b> <b>floating</b> angle rendered them unsuitable. Experience gained in the investigation has indicated that the use of the system is limited to maximum deflections of one aileron relative to the other of less than 30 degrees and that the differential linkage should always be designed {{on the basis of the}} highest probable floating angle...|$|R
5000|$|Repairs {{actually}} took much longer and modifications {{to improve the}} craft's handling were also made including a deeper step further aft, cutting away the side windscreens and new centre-section tanks faired into the airfoil instead of above the wings. Just under five months later on 3 December 1925 the Widgeon successfully completed its first flight from Botany Bay piloted by Squadron Leader Wackett, lasting ten minutes and reaching a height of about 400 ft. Following a series of trials {{carried out by the}} Civil Aviation Branch, it was agreed that the Widgeon could be tested by the RAAF to assess its suitability as a training aircraft. Prior to its handover in June 1927 another series of modifications were carried out to convert the Widgeon for amphibious operation (able to land and take off from both water and land). These included the addition of retractable landing gear, tailskid, dual controls, extra fuel tanks, an increase in dihedral from 3.5° to 4.75°, new deeper <b>floats</b> with less <b>aileron</b> interference, a wider windscreen, a gun-mount above the rear cabin entry, cabin side windows below the wing and a more powerful [...] ADC Nimbus engine.|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in some American investigations that differential gearing, combined with adjustment of the <b>aileron</b> <b>floating</b> angle {{by means of a}} tab, may be a powerful method of balancing ailerons. This report sets out the theory of this method of balance and analysesit in relation to the most pressing problem of aileron design, which is to obtain close balance at high speed without overbalance in any part of the range, or uncomfortable lightness at slow speed. It is shown that this result can be achieved more directly by differential balance than by any other method if the differential and the tab setting are nicely adjusted to the natural floating properties of the aileron. Thus if the <b>aileron</b> tends to <b>float</b> up as incidence increases, a differential giving more downward than upward movement must be used, and this must be combined with an upward-set tab; while if the <b>aileron</b> tends to <b>float</b> down as the incidence increases, a differential giving more upward than downward movement must be used, combined with a downset tab. After examining the possible disadvantages of the downward differential, and the loads set up by the tab, it is concluded that there is a strong case for exploration in flight of differential gearing as a major means of aileron bMance. Some notes on the geometry of differential gearing are given in an Appendix. 1. Introduction. [...] In the past,. when ailerons have been moved differentially, it has always been with the object rather of improving the rolling moments than of lightening the stick force. -The potentiality of differential gearing as a major means of aileion balance has been broache...|$|R
