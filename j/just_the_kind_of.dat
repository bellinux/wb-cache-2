Working with James Sayers, Oliphant managed {{to produce an}} improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, John Randall and Harry Boot, worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> short wavelengths needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention {{was one of the}} key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U-boats, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.|$|E

It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed.

David Fear of Time Out New York called it [...] "the cinematic {{equivalent of an}} energy drink.

500|$|Chapman {{began the}} 1932 season in good form and {{appeared}} fitter {{than he had}} for many seasons. There were further calls in the press for him to captain England. Jardine's captaincy in 1931 left critics unimpressed and C. Stewart Caine, the editor of Wisden, wrote that [...] "the impression appears to be widely entertained that Chapman, were he in [...] form, would again be given charge of the [...] team." [...] Christopher Douglas believes {{that the difference between}} Jardine and Chapman in captaincy style made it harder for the press to accept Jardine. He writes: [...] "Chapman's was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> daredevil approach that is remembered with affection and, even though it was barely a year since he had lost the leadership, his reign was being regarded through rose-coloured specs." [...] However, {{it is unlikely that the}} selectors ever considered returning to him. During the season, Chapman scored 951 runs, averaged 29.71, and led Kent to third place in the County Championship for the second year in succession.|$|E

Killian Fox of The Observer writes that Nas' observations on his ex-wife's [...] "hefty childcare payments" [...] and his 18-year-old daughter [...] "dating unsuitable men" [...] are resonated by his [...] "recollections of his early years as a Queensbridge hustler – <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> unsuitable young man he's warning his daughter about these days". [...] "Reach Out" [...] features Mary J. Blige and incorporates the piano loop from Isaac Hayes' 1970 song [...] "Ike's Mood". Its lyrics address Nas' feeling displaced [...] "when you're too hood {{to be in the}} Hollywood circles, you're too rich to be in the hood that birthed you". [...] "You Wouldn't Understand" [...] addresses life struggles and features a mellow production and neo soul influences.

She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album. In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV. In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the United States, raising more than $750,000. In 2012, Swift supported Architecture for Humanity's Restore the Shore MTV telethon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.

500|$|Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan {{said that}} Deadpool [...] "gets {{off to a}} fun start but {{eventually}} wears out his welcome", noting that though the film has a complicated narrative, that is just masking a conventional Marvel origin story. Turan did highlight the film's romantic element and Baccarin's performance. Jonathon Pile of Empire gave the film three stars out of five, saying the number of jokes [...] "will soon numb you to their impact", but calling the film a fun alternative to other superhero films. Robbie Collin at The Daily Telegraph also gave the film three stars out of five, saying it is not [...] "the future of superhero movies, but it’s an enjoyably obnoxious detour." [...] He also felt {{that some of the}} film's jokes about superhero cliches were out of date by the time the film was released. The San Francisco Chronicles Mick LaSalle did not appreciate the humor, fourth wall breaking, or violence, and concluded that the film is [...] "bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it’s <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema’s future." ...|$|E

[...] The Evening Chronicles review said it [...] "conceals few narrative surprises" [...] but contended that [...] "when [...] does finally defy our expectations, it's to ensure his spellers learn a valuable lesson about integrity." [...] Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized that the film [...] "telegraphs its plot"; however, he praised it as [...] "genuinely sweet and determinedly inspirational." [...] PopMatterss Cynthia Fuchs stated it is formulaic as it has some [...] "conventions that make so many other genre films feel stale," [...] but that it [...] "torques them slightly", emphasizing the [...] "intellectual activities" [...] Akeelah gets involved with. Furthermore, the film was described as [...] "derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way" [...] by Rick Groen in an article for The Globe and Mail. Ingman of The Austin Chronicle {{described it as a}} typical sports film and felt it was heavy-handed at times. However, she praised it for its thems and called the film a [...] "houghtful, engaging," [...] one and said it has [...] "cross-gender appeal". Morris of The Boston Globe argued, [...] "If Akeelah and the Bee is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child." [...] Morris added, [...] "Obviously, it's emotional propaganda. But it's <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> propaganda our children need." ...|$|E

It is offensive to be boxed into a “civilization” and to be told that you are the same as the people confined to the same box, and that you are sufficiently different from the people confined to other boxes for there to be confrontations between you.
