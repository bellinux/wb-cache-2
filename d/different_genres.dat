5|$|As an {{independent}} company, Obsidian believes {{that they must}} act and react quickly to market changes and not stagnate on any certain point. While the core focus of Obsidian was still developing character-driven role-playing games, the team were willing to try out projects that are smaller and are in <b>different</b> <b>genres.</b> The decision to develop Armored Warfare is one result of this strategy.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{sporting}} uses, Anfield {{has been}} a venue for musicians of <b>different</b> <b>genres</b> as well as evangelical preachers.

A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics. Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.|$|E

Tanaka was {{a video game}} composer working for Nintendo who had previously composed for games such as Super Mario Land and Metroid, while Suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many <b>different</b> <b>genres.</b> The NES was only able to play three notes at a time, which Suzuki has noted greatly limited what {{he was able to}} produce, as he could not create some of the sounds he wanted.|$|E
5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a drum machine together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave.

5|$|Rumours {{garnered}} widespread critical acclaim. Praise {{centred on}} its production quality and harmonies, which frequently {{relied on the}} interplay among three vocalists.

In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued {{with the addition of}} an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.

5|$|The {{following}} year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, {{as well as}} Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into <b>different</b> <b>genres.</b> That same year {{he was on the}} panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{conceived}} by Yoshinori Kitase, the original game's director, and Tetsuya Nomura, {{the main character}} designer. Nomura would become the main designer for each entry in the Compilation. Other returning staff include writer Kazushige Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. The video games belong to <b>different</b> <b>genres,</b> with none of them being traditional role-playing games due to production pressures related to the genre. While the first title revealed was Advent Children, it ran into delays during post-production, so the first Compilation title to be released was the mobile game Before Crisis.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ <b>different</b> <b>genres,</b> styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of <b>different</b> <b>genres.</b> He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
5|$|On Late Registration, West drew {{inspiration}} from English trip hop band Portishead and collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion. The album's music blends West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, and experimentally delves into {{a wide array of}} <b>different</b> <b>genres,</b> including jazz, blues, rock, R, spoken word, funk, turntablism, western classical, and psychedelic soul. With the presence of Brion, who conducts a twenty-piece orchestra and plays instruments individually selected by West, the album is largely orchestral in nature, brandishing a euphony of string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. They also incorporated a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not typical in popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, harpsichord, Chamberlin, CS-80 analog synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba.|$|E
5|$|Writers {{have placed}} the story within several <b>different</b> <b>genres,</b> {{including}} science fiction, a subgenre {{of science fiction}} called recursive science fiction, and fantasy. Masters of the Occult author Daniel Cohen noted the book contributed to Hubbard's reception among influential science fiction authors of the 1940s. It is regarded as classic science fiction by The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography in its entry on Hubbard, {{as well as by}} writer James Gunn, and publications including the Daily News of Los Angeles, and Chicago Sun-Times. Writers have placed Typewriter in the Sky within the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Authors Mike Resnick and Robert J. Sawyer classed the story within the science fiction subgenre recursive science fiction, and writer Gary Westfahl wrote that Hubbard may have been influenced by the 1921 Luigi Pirandello play within the recursive fantasy subgenre, Six Characters in Search of an Author. The book is listed in Fantasy: The 100 Best Books, and Rivals of Weird Tales: 30 Great Fantasy and Horror Stories from the Weird Fiction Pulps placed it among the best quality fantasy writing of the 20th century. Writers characterized the overarching theme within the book as dealing with an individual caught between two different worlds.|$|E
