[...] This way, if a database of transactions is compromised, the CVV2 is not included, and the stolen card numbers are less useful.

50|$|At the <b>individual</b> <b>transaction</b> level, {{the removal}} of a higher {{overhead}} business intermediary (say a taxi company) with a lower cost technology platform helps {{reduce the cost of}} the transaction for the customer while also providing an opportunity for additional suppliers to compete for the business, further reducing costs. Consumers can then spend more on other goods and services, stimulating demand and production {{in other parts of the}} economy. Classical economics argues that innovation that lowers the cost of goods and services represents a net economic benefit overall. However, like many new technologies and business innovations, this trend is disruptive to existing business models and presents challenges for governments and regulators.|$|E

Entry visibility aims to ensure that all regulatory, compliance, and documentation requirements are met in a timely fashion along the way. When importing into the U.S., every <b>individual</b> <b>transaction</b> must be compliant with The Customs Modernization Act (Mod Act), and the Importer Security Filing (10+2). Under the Mod Act, importers are required to maintain and produce timely records at the time of entry. Furthermore, the Mod Act includes a [...] "Reasonable Care" [...] clause, which states that importers and brokers need a comprehensive audit process to ensure they have met all compliance requirements and provided the correct information on all entry filings.|$|E

Con-straints such as limited capacity and defective items render the problem a demand-ing challenge for most solvers. Metaheuristic algorithms have been considered as promising approaches for tackling problems of this type. The present work investi-gates the performance of the Unified Particle Swarm Optimization on this problem type. The employed model also assumes <b>individual</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and product-dependent holding cost. Different parametrizations of the algorithm are considered under various configurations.

These agreements deal with the efficiency and equity problems through a system of reciprocation over time. Nevertheless, the collective effect of the agreements, under certain common conditions, is to suppress further the flow of market information and seriously to impair product quality incentives and other measures of market performance. ...|$|E

The traditional pessimistic protocols are not suitable in mobile environments because of disconnections of mobile hosts for invariant time.

The Analytical approach is a variation of Timeout based commit protocols where a transaction is executed only if the expected time for execution is within the current timer value.

Central to this analysis is the automated classification of these transactions to hierarchical commodity coding systems. Spend classification is challenging due {{not only to the}} complexities of the commodity coding systems but also because of the sparseness and quality of each <b>individual</b> <b>transaction</b> text description and the volume of such transactions in an organization. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of off-the-shelf machine learning tools to address the challenges in spend classification.
