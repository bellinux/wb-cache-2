Similarly, the scheduling time function is t_l([...] f_l,v_l,r_l) and is expressed with the same variables. g_l([...] f_l,v_l,r_l) is a generalized emergency cost function on the line l. α_ 1 and α_ 2, respectively, represent the weights of the transportation and time costs in the emergency scheduling, while α_ 1 + α_ 2 = 1.

It may be assumed that, under physiological conditions, each cortical hormone is secreted independently, in amount governed by the physiological needs of the moment. Moreover, there is great variation in the relative content of the cortically active steroids in different preparations of cortical extracts obtained by the same method. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|To take {{advantage}} of line commutated converter (LCC) and voltage source converter high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) technologies a hybrid multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) is designed to exploit the power from renewable resources. A previous study showed that the voltage dependent current order limiter (VDCOL), an <b>emergency</b> <b>function</b> to reduce the current order of an HVDC converter station when voltage is depressed, should be installed {{in all of the}} LCC stations of the hybrid MTDC. This study presents a design for a master self-tuning VDCOL function implemented in a hybrid multi-terminal HVDC system. This controller aims to generate an adaptive current reference for each LCC station of the VDCOL in a low-voltage condition. The parameter of this adaptive VDCOL can be chosen according to the summary table of practical experiences; therefore, no tuning technique is required. The developed HVDC control algorithm is implemented on the simplified South East (SE) Australian 14 generator system using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control function in reducing the complexity of the control system and operation along with improving system transient stability...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The paper aims {{to provide}} the {{rationale}} underpinning this new journal in addressing the apparent gap and fragmented nature of the emergency services research, to introduce the papers in this inaugural issue and encourage readers and potential contributors to support the International Journal of Emergency Services (IJES). Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces the new journal to outline the current "silos approach" which isolates the academic and practitioner community. It also outlines the editorial intentions for the journal linking to the theme and selected papers for the inaugural issue and future direction of travel. Findings- <b>Emergency</b> <b>function</b> resides {{with a host of}} agencies including the three "blue light" services (police fire and ambulance). IJES is an opportunity to publish up-to-date and original research contributions for the benefit of scholars, policy makers and practitioners in these areas, including the interface happening at national, regional and global level. Originality/value - Articulating the IJES vision in addressing the apparent gaps in the emergency services research including the theory-practise divide, the paper provides useful knowledge to potential readers who are interested but may have insufficient knowledge in the emergency services research. It also highlights some potential areas for research...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{of urban}} {{disasters}} {{is no longer}} a phenomenon that we can stop, avoid or deter, but rather they are part of complex ecological processes from which we are inseparable and must design with, in preparation for the next imminent disaster. ” 								 Miho Mazereeuw 								 (Mazereeuw, 2011. Pg 85) Due to recent seismic activity across New Zealand, it has become widely speculated that Wellington is overdue for a major earthquake that could devastate the city. This has brought to light Wellington’s unique vulnerabilities and physical lack of preparedness to survive a significant natural disaster. Until recently, pre-disaster planning has looked towards both architectural and engineering solutions that focus on resisting or deterring the effects of a natural disaster, leaving landscape architecture as a post disaster clean up tool. This thesis aims to demonstrate the potential of landscape architecture within the field of pre-disaster planning, changing the way we adapt to natural disasters within the urban environment. This research will develop a preemptive strategy for Wellington’s Central Business District, or ‘CBD’ that utilises access ways and open space as emergency infrastructure to save lives {{in the event of a}} major earthquake, whilst enhancing the urban environment for day-to-day use. This research proposes that access ways and open space are the catalyst in which landscape architecture could make a significant contribution to the pre-disaster planning of cities. More specifically, it tests the combination of a latent emergency infrastructure with quality urban design through a series of landscape architecture experiments that focus on Wellington’s CBD as a site for design exploration. This exploration challenges the way in which we design our urban environments to allow a level of flexibility in times of distress or natural disaster. Overall this thesis will generate new ideas and creative solutions to the idea of urban resilience, indicating that, not only can landscape architecture make a significant contribution to pre-disaster planning, but that spaces designed for an <b>emergency</b> <b>function</b> can still enlighten our everyday experience of the city...|$|E

Therefore, it is a specific requirement of law to develop human resources, organization and operational procedures until appropriate medical personnel arrives {{in order to prevent}} worker's further complications. It is also necessary to train the personnel in an adequate way, especially for what concerns the Basic Life Support and Defibrillation (BLS-D) : standardized and organized interventions represent a valid response while waiting for medical assistance.
