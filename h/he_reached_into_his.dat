5000|$|In the Dirty Harry spoof, Harry was {{downgraded}} to a {{video store}} detective. After chasing a suspect all over San Francisco, Harry finally cornered {{him in an}} alley. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> jacket, and slowly pulls out a VHS movie, asking the suspect [...] "What I {{have here is a}} VHS video cassette, the most popular format in the world, and the question is, punk... did you rewind it?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{coat pocket}} and finds the ring, {{puts it on}} the bride's hand and takes off the veil. The bride proves to be a zombie, who lets out an earth-shattering scream. This is a {{possible}} reference to Bride of the Monster. Kihn screams in horror at the sight. The entire congregation turns into zombies possibly referencing Night of the Living Dead except for Kihn, who makes his first attempt at escaping.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I do?" [...] Thacher said. [...] "Well, if you like, I'll show you." [...] <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{coat and}} brought out {{something}}. Something that flashed and glinted, something slender. A rod of pale fire.|$|E
60|$|Slow and ox-like, on {{the face}} of the Swede dawned relief and comprehension. The pang over, the finger felt better. The pain was gone. He {{examined}} the finger curiously, with wondering eyes, slowly crooking it back and forth. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket and pulled out a gold-sack.|$|E

5000|$|Suppose a {{mathematician}} carries two matchboxes at all times: {{one in his}} left pocket and one in his right. Each time he needs a match, he is equally likely to take it from either pocket. Suppose <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket and discovers {{for the first time}} that the box picked is empty. If it is assumed that each of the matchboxes originally contained [...] matches, what is the probability that there are exactly [...] matches in the other box? ...|$|R
50|$|After the race, {{the scene}} changes back to Cassidy {{standing}} at the Southeastern track, walking through the last lap of a mile. Quenton reflects upon his running career, and realizes that while it is over for him, {{there is much to}} be left behind on the track. When <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> the end of the lap, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> bag and pulls out a box with a silver Olympic medal inside. Cassidy thinks to himself that he can live with leaving behind his old life, and with a bittersweet feeling walks off into the night.|$|R
50|$|Back {{home with}} 7 {{million in cash}} in his bag, he wakes {{up the next morning}} to usual morning routine of family nagging and {{complaining}} about money. Sick and tired of listening to their complaints <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> bag and starts throwing bills in the air. Then {{on the way to the}} bathroom he runs into Japanac who informs him that he married Suzana and moved into her room, as the house in which he met with Pantić was his friend's house. Japanac puts a bathroom schedule and enters the bathroom. After walking silently an angry Pantić screams, charges at the bathroom door and breaks it as the film ends.|$|R
5000|$|... "Using clay, Beauchamp modeled an adult-sized bust of a long-haired, gentle-eyed fellow — the Franklin of {{the history}} books, wise and timeless. Then <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> penny supply and covered the entire thing with coins, {{creating}} a sort of chain-mail effect. Beauchamp completed it with a quarter-inch coating of fiberglass." ...|$|E
50|$|In November 2011, Officer Michael Edwards {{was in a}} {{shopping}} mall when his handgun discharged, injuring a little girl nearby. Edwards pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct.

5000|$|He {{was better}} known to family by the {{nickname}} of [...] "Bockie" [...] - {{the name that}} his first grandchild, Susan, gave to him when <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket for a [...] "surprise."

50|$|Ethan {{learns that}} his son won a {{nationwide}} essay contest by plagiarizing classic American authors and orators, but when Ethan confronts him, the son denies having any guilty feelings, maintaining that everyone cheats and lies. Perhaps after seeing his own moral decay in his son's actions, and experiencing the guilt of Marullo's deportation {{and the death of}} Danny, Ethan resolves to commit suicide. His daughter, intuitively understanding his intent, slips a family talisman <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket during a long embrace. When Ethan decides to commit the act, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket to find razorblades and instead finds the talisman. As the tide comes into the alcove in which he has sequestered himself, he struggles to get out in order to return the talisman to his daughter.|$|R
50|$|As {{reported}} in a New York Times article, the town was named in 1860 by Dabnie Nunnally, the community's first postmaster. He had little faith in the legibility of his handwriting, and thought that using numbers would solve the problem. <b>He</b> then <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket {{and came up with}} 88 cents. Another explanation is that the hamlet is 8.8 miles from Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|Releasing Chris from interrogation, Detective Huggins (Kristin Lehman) {{tells him}} that Vincent has been arrested for murder; he is {{surprised}} as he thought Vincent would only be implicated in Sarah's suicide. The detective further states that the pills did not kill Sarah, that her wrist cuts were not self-inflicted, the prints on the knife were Vincent's and they didn't find a suicide note. The surprised Chris thanks Huggins and leaves. Outside of the police station, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> jacket pocket, {{only to find that}} the suicide note Luke gave to him is gone. He then walks to the loft and confronts Luke about the missing note. After initially denying that he had it, Luke leads Chris to the note, which was in the garbage. Chris looks at the note and wonders why Luke would get rid of the only evidence of the attempted suicide, speculating that Luke, not Sarah, was the author of the note. Luke then tells Chris everything; he framed Vincent, because he was attracted to Sarah himself, and felt that Vincent stood between him and Sarah.|$|R

50|$|When Xiang stopped {{shooting}} {{and moved to}} switch weapons, Lee Gordon-Brown, the injured lecturer, grabbed Xiang's hands as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> jacket.

50|$|Jong-nam joined Hee-dong and Young-min {{who were}} having {{lunch at the}} cafeteria. Fengguan came over to join the group and called out to Jong-nam. Hee-dong and Young-min called Fengguan to buy his own food as Fengguan {{expressed}} his desire to eat. As Fengguan dug into his pockets, {{he found out that}} he was out of money and borrowed some money from Hee-dong. Hee-dong reminded Fengguan to return the loan another day as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pockets.|$|E
5000|$|The play {{constantly}} blurs {{the boundary}} between what is seen on television and how it relates to, and even shapes, [...] "real life". Gwens fathers death is synchronised with a shoot out he is watching in a television Western: as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> dressing gown to clutch his chest, the cowboys on television believe their unseen assailant is reaching for a gun and fire — Gwens father dying instantly of heart failure. On occasion, dialogue from the television programmes the characters are watching is used {{to comment on the}} action of the play itself. When Gwen, Arthur and Tom are sat watching an American sitcom together {{at the end of the}} play, the characters in that programme fondly bid each other good night ("Good night, Tom! Good night Arthur!") much to the delight of The Foxtrots central protagonists. Canned laughter is also frequently heard in several instances throughout the play, most notably in the pre-title sequence where Tom addresses the camera to asks the viewer, [...] "You wouldnt believe Im 57, would you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|House snaps back {{to reality}} and tries to explain to Cuddy that that's not what {{actually}} happened, saying [...] "I told you I needed you, and you helped me." [...] <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket to remove the lipstick, but, to his shock, he discovers that it is actually a bottle of Oxycodone. He drops the bottle {{on the floor and}} gingerly backs away from it. Cuddy, now realizing House is not joking, rushes to him and asks if he is okay. He doesn't respond, but then has another flashback, and realizes what happened. The whole previous night was a complete hallucination, beginning from him telling Cuddy that he needed her to help him detox and her accompanying him home. His memory of Cuddy staying by his side at his apartment was not real, and, in fact, he spent the night popping pills by himself. Hallucinations of Amber and Kutner then appear and tell House that while the story he invented about himself is nice, it's not true. House finally looks at Cuddy and is able to fearfully tell her that he is not okay.|$|R
5000|$|But {{a chance}} {{meeting on the}} stairs outside Adélaïdes {{apartment}} is enough to dispel all Hippolytes suspicions. He decides that he was wrong to ignore the promptings of his heart. That evening he calls on the two women. Madame de Rouville suggests a game of cards. Hippolyte loses, and when <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket for some money, he finds before him a purse which Adélaïde has slipped {{in front of him}} without his noticing it: [...] "the poor child had the old one in her hand, and, to keep her countenance, was looking into it for the money to pay her mother. The blood rushed to Hippolytes heart with such force that he was near fainting. The new purse, substituted for his own, and which contained his fifteen Louis dor, was worked with gilt beads. The rings and tassels bore witness to Adélaïdes good taste, and she had no doubt spent all her little hoard in ornamenting this pretty piece of work. It was impossible to say with greater delicacy that the painters gift could only be repaid by some proof of affection." [...] There and then Hipployte asks for Adélaïdes hand in marriage.|$|R
5000|$|On November 22, 2014, Tamir Rice {{was shot}} at Cudell Recreation Center by a Cleveland Police officer {{responding}} to a report of someone pointing a gun ("possibly fake" [...] according to the 911 caller - a statement not relayed to the responding officers) at people. While the officer claimed that he had warned Rice {{to put down the}} gun, surveillance video showed Rice being shot as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> waistband pulling the [...] "gun" [...] out. This occurred within seconds of the police cars arrival on the scene.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{went inside}} and Preacher Dick {{made his way to}} the front of the crowd. The man in charge of the dance asked Preacher Dick if he played the fiddle. Preacher Dick replied he was [...] "about the best there is." [...] When it was Preacher Dick's turn to play, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{saddlebag}} and took out two books — his Bible and his hymnal. [...] "This is my fiddle," [...] he said, holding the Bible aloft, [...] "and this is my bow. But I fiddle for the Lord!" ...|$|E
50|$|Aaron {{auditioned for}} the role of Michael Oher after his mother found out about the casting call online. Chosen as a finalist, he was flown in to Los Angeles for the final audition. Unsure whether he had been successful, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket {{on his way to the}} door and pulled out a card, telling {{director}} John Lee Hancock that he knew that it was a long shot for him to get the part but that he did security work and would love to do those services should they be needed for the film. Director Hancock said that he would keep it in mind.|$|E
5000|$|Brisker {{received}} {{a reputation as}} one of the most volatile players in basketball. According to his Condors teammate Charlie Williams, [...] "He was an excellent player, but say something wrong to the guy and you had this feeling <b>he</b> would <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> bag, take out a gun and shoot you." [...] He was ejected so often for fighting that he was nicknamed [...] "the heavyweight champion of the ABA." [...] The Condors made much of Brisker's reputation as an enforcer; their media guide portrayed him wearing a pair of six-shooters.|$|R
5000|$|... "Whores" [...] is a {{nightmare}} from the vagina dentata school of folk tales. It is narrated by a soldier, recovering from a blast of [...] "the enemy's synaesthetic gas", who {{is sent to the}} Archipelago island of Winho to convalesce. There he hopes to find a young prostitute whom he had loved, Slenje, but she is dead. He is seduced by Elva, who has been [...] "experimented upon" [...] when Winho was occupied by enemy troops. According to her, their enemies are the real whores, not prostitutes like herself. He enjoys the sex, but several incidents disturb him beyond his momentary flashes of synesthesia: Elva's legs are bizarrely scarred, her teeth have been filed into points; when her year-old boy in the next room cries because he has hurt his hand, Elva soothes him by sucking <b>his</b> little hand <b>into</b> her mouth; while Elva pleasures the soldier, he [...] "visualized her as some monstrous animal, chewing into my gut. It was the most hideous image of woman." [...] The next day, boarding a ferry, the soldier realizes that Elva had teased his torso with her teeth; these are now becoming open wounds. When <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket to pay the ferryman, a tiny child's hand, severed at the wrist, seizes his fingers and will not let go. In his Introduction, Priest writes that he wrote the story at Christmas. [...] "There the resemblance to good cheer ends, as you will discover, and in retrospect think I must have eaten too much plum duff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{you could}} have knocked me down with a feather!" [...] she resumed. [...] "He {{telephones}} me awhile ago and says to be outside the back door at ten to-night, because he'd something {{he wanted to tell}} me. Of course he couldn't come in and tell it me here, because he'd been fired and everything. So I goes out, and there he is. 'Hello, kid!' he says to me. 'Fresh!' I says to him. 'Say, I got something to be fresh about!' he says to me. And then <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> jeans and hauls out the sparkler. 'What's that?' I says to him. 'It's an engagement ring,' he says to me. 'For you, if you'll wear it!' I came over so weak, I could have fell! And the next thing I know he's got it on my finger and--" [...] Celestine broke off modestly. [...] "Say, ain't it a beaut, honest!" [...] She gave herself over to contemplation once more. [...] "He says to me how he's on Easy Street now, or will be pretty soon. I says to him 'Have you got a job, then?' He says to me 'Now, I ain't got a job, but I'm going to pull off a stunt to-night that's going to mean enough to me to start that health-farm I've told you about.' Say, he's always had a line of talk about starting a health-farm down on Long Island, he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters. I asks him what the stunt is, but he won't tell me yet. He says he'll tell me after we're married, but he says it's sure-fire and he's going to buy the license tomorrow." ...|$|R
50|$|From 1986 until 1995, Burton {{was married}} to ABC 7 sports {{reporter}} Jim Rose. Rose, who had been dating Burton {{when she was a}} Chicago Bears cheerleader, surprised her with a diamond engagement ring on the Friday night before Super Bowl XX in New Orleans. Rose popped the question aboard the President riverboat, scene of a pep rally party for the Bears. Burton, who had finished a dance number with the Honey Bears, was sitting with Rose under the moonlight when <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket for the ring. Rose, quite the romantic, had timed the proposal to come a year after the couple's first date. That, coincidentally, happened to be at a Super Bowl XIX party in Chicago.|$|E
50|$|Two of her protegees, Albert Ives and Robert Sherrod, killed Leland Cash {{during a}} mugging (when <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket {{to turn up}} his hearing aid, Ives assumed he was {{reaching}} for a gun and shot Cash in the stomach). Fearing Sherrord would confess to the police, Spinelli gave him whiskey that she had laced with chloral hydrate. The gang then beat him up whilst he was unconscious. To make his death appear accidental, they threw him off a bridge wearing only swimming trunks. However, the autopsy showed there was no water in his lungs. Fearing for his own survival, Ives escaped and confessed to the police. Spinelli was consequently arrested. Her gang members testified against her at her trial.|$|E
50|$|Trenton {{was home}} to a Rock Island Railroad {{maintenance}} facility known as a roundhouse since 1900. The round house provided locomotive overhaul work for the Kansas City terminals and was a major employer for the Trenton area. A bitter strike in the 1940s pitted union workers against the railroad and scab labor who were still feeling {{the effects of the}} Great Depression. Strike breaking workers had to carry their tool boxes as they walked several miles to the round house. As a strike breaker named Hobbs walked across the bridge (now known as the Charlie Dye bridge) to Trenton in the early morning he encountered a group of striking union members drunk {{at the end of the}} bridge. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> tool box and picked an item that would resemble a pistol and put it into his pocket. When he reached the thugs they jeered him but did not touch him since they had seen him put something in his pocket and he still had his hand on it. The next strike breaker that walked across the bridge was beaten to death.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} the song opens with a man {{standing}} in front of a jukebox, his face unseen by the camera. He scrolls his finger up a list of songs and stops at [...] "Any Way You Want It". <b>He</b> then <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pocket and pulls out a coin which he inserts into the jukebox. He then selects the song and we see a record being flipped over and beginning to spin. This dissolves into a shot of a studio tape spinning which leads to the group performing the song in the studio. The band's performance comprises most of the video until the song ends. At this point the man at the jukebox is revealed to actually be lead singer Steve Perry who turns and smiles at the camera. Another video exists which is a live performance during the Departure Tour. Both videos were omitted from the band's Greatest Hits 1978-1997 DVD in favor of another live version of the song from the Escape Tour.|$|R
50|$|The gang then don their disguises {{and proceed}} to rob the bank. The robbery is {{successful}} {{in that they}} find a larger amount than expected, $5 million. They steal the cash and successfully {{get out of the}} bank, splitting up according to their plan, except Alec inadvertently knocks over a jar of pennies that he brought into the bank with him as a distraction for the bank manager and security guard. The jar shatters and its contents spill out all over the floor. Realizing he does not have time to recover the jar's contents, Alec leaves it behind. Casey and Sam meet up at a restaurant called The Outlaws, the agreed-upon meeting point. They are joined by Trevor, and the three wait nervously for Alec, who is late. A television news broadcast in the bar states that the police have recovered a very good lead. Stuffed among the jar of pennies that Alec unintentionally left behind at the bank was a Rennie's Landing badge that Trevor was playing with innocently earlier in the film. The badge has Trevor's full name on it. Using this lead, the police issue a broadcast alert for Trevor, who had just used his credit card at the restaurant to pay for their drinks. The bartender calls the police, who surround the bar. Casey is stopped leaving the bar. Sam goes to the ladies' room. Trevor comes outside to join Casey and sees that he is surrounded. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> back pocket for his keys, but the police (thinking <b>he</b> is <b>reaching</b> for a gun) fire on Trevor and Casey, instantly killing Trevor and mortally wounding Casey. Sam, hearing the commotion, exits the ladies' room using a back window. As she inches around the bar, she sees Trevor dead and Casey laying on the ground. He looks up at her and realizes she can still escape. When the police ask a dying Casey if anyone else is still inside, he says no, then dies.|$|R
500|$|Zack's role in Crisis Core has {{received}} a mainly positive reaction. IGN's Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack's relationships with the other main characters. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack's story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it [...] "the heart of the game." [...] Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot labelled Zack a [...] "likable and complex hero," [...] arguing that he [...] "transcends the usual spiky-haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues." [...] GameSpy's Gerald Villoria described Zack as [...] "King of the Nice Guys," [...] noting that even though {{he can be a}} [...] "pretty hate-worthy character if you're the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline," [...] players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an [...] "endearing main character" [...] by Game Revolution who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, RPGamer viewed him to have the [...] "full, soulful carriage of a Final Fantasy hero" [...] due to his personal conflicts, despite his [...] "artfully teased hair and devil-may-care grin." [...] Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found Zack's physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud's, he added that [...] "this fan service doesn't put a foot wrong until <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> [...] pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks." [...] He also praised Zack's English voice actor for doing a good job, noting [...] "his character's maturing and developing over the 15-hour storyline." [...] IGN AU's Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez's work as [...] "pretty likeable." [...] GamesRadar's AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword and the way he gives it to Cloud is the [...] "ultimate payoff" [...] of Crisis Core, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song [...] "Why" [...] for Crisis Core, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack's fate [...] "to the hearts of many people." [...] IGN UK's Dave McCarthy noted how Zack's role in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game.|$|R
