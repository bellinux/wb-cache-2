5|$|In North America and elsewhere, some Heathen {{communities}} have formalized such values into an ethical code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), {{which is based}} largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them {{as an attempt to}} imitate the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. The NNV are not universal among Heathens, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners.|$|E

25|$|The possessive {{of it was}} {{originally}} it’s, and many people continue to write it this way, though the apostrophe was dropped in the early 1800s and authorities are now unanimous that it’s can be only a contraction of it is or <b>it</b> <b>has.</b> <b>For</b> example, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson used it’s as a possessive in his instructions dated 20 June 1803 to Lewis for his preparations for his great expedition.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth in}} {{usage of the}} Panama Canal {{over the past few}} years has been almost entirely driven by {{increased}} US imports from China passing through the canal en route to ports on the US East and Gulf coasts. But it is increasingly recognized in both the US and China that this imbalance in trade is unsustainable and will be reduced via some sort of adjustment in the coming years (although such an imbalance need not be made up by physically shipped goods, but could be made by other trade such as intellectual property as China upgrades its intellectual property protection laws). The ACP, however, presumes that trade will continue to grow for a generation as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> the past several years.|$|E

He died at his museum home in Bucharest on May 17, 1952, and was incinerated at Cenușa crematorium that same day. The ceremony was attended by a delegation from Iași university, headed by Teofil Vescan, and by academicians Ștefan Vencov and Nicolae Sălăgeanu. His ashes were then deposited near the mausoleum in Carol Park. Among his papers was a short story, preserved by the Museum of Romanian Literature and only published in 2014 by Dacia Literară.

25|$|Now {{that the}} Schengen Agreement {{is part of}} the acquis communautaire, <b>it</b> <b>has,</b> <b>for</b> EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended {{according}} to its terms.

Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing {{some or all of the}} former Schengen acquis. Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the EU's legislative bodies. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.|$|E

25|$|China's chief {{interest}} {{in the region of}} the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade has been a very significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China. Chinese merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan – where the Mekong River, previously used for illegal migration, flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control – the region was the last stronghold of anti-communist forces. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{newspaper}} article by the Toronto Star states that everyone to sing, {{even if they}} are not musically talented, because of the benefits <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates {{the right side of the}} brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{industry}} {{is now part}} of Todmorden's history, not its present. The industrial chimneys have largely gone and the remaining mills have mostly been converted for other purposes. The town's industrial base is much reduced (at one time Todmorden had the largest weaving shed in the world). There has {{been a great deal of}} regeneration activity and Todmorden is now increasingly a commuter town for people working in Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and smaller towns. Todmorden also services the local rural area and attracts visitors through its market (indoor and outdoor), various events, heritage and the local Pennine countryside. Changing work patterns may have influenced the fact that the town was the first rural telephone exchange in Britain to be broadband-enabled through public demand. Rising house prices over recent years are a particular problem as there is limited land available in the valley for building affordable housing. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>for</b> centuries been considered the safest accessible route directly across the Pennines.|$|E
