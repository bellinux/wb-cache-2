50|$|Jaysh al-Rifi (Arabic for 'Army of the Rif', {{described}} in 18th century correspondence with the British as 'the Army {{of all the}} People of the Rif') {{was the name of}} an influential Moroccan army corps in the 17th and 18th centuries. The army was formed by Moulay Ismail out of Berber tribesmen from the eastern Rif. Their rise coincided with the formation of the Black Guard, also by Moulay Ismail. They came {{to play an important role}} in the 17th century Moroccan wars against Spanish colonization. Cities like Tangiers, Ksar el-Kebir, Mehdia, Asila were reconquered by the Jaysh al-Rifi. One of its generals was Ahmad al-Rifi, a native of Temsamane, who became <b>gouvernor</b> of Tangiers, Asila and Tetouan. His descendants, the Hamami al-Rifi family, would govern these towns, and most of the Gharb, with a large degree of autonomy until 1912.|$|E
50|$|In 1800, {{financial}} power in France {{was in the}} hands of about ten to fifteen banking houses whose founders, in most cases, came from Switzerland {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century. These bankers, mostly Protestant, were deeply involved in the agitations leading up to the French Revolution. When the revolutionary violence got out of hand, they orchestrated the rise of Napoleon, whom they regarded as the restorer of order. As a reward for their support, Napoleon, in 1800, gave the bankers a monopoly over French finance by giving them control of the new Bank of France. Banker Claude Périer redacted the first statutes and Emmanuel Crétet was the first <b>gouvernor.</b> For the first fifteen years it was the sole issuer of bank notes in Paris, and this privilege was extended to other financially important towns and the rest of the country by 1848.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the famous Moroccan sultan Moulay Ismail {{created a new}} elite army, {{consisting}} of over 100,000 Black African slaves. This Black Guard would come to dominate the Alaouite military and overall politics. Besides this strong standing army, the sultan made use of the jaysh. These consisted of soldiery recruited from tribal groups. These jaysh' were decentralized, and leadership was often tribal in nature. In the south en center of the country, these jaysh' were formed from rural Arabs, as well as Berber tribes of the plains of the Middle Atlas and the High Atlas. In the north, Berber Riffian jaysh came to dominate, with Riffian armies used against the Spanish-governed cities on the Moroccan coast. Riffian jaysh' came to be stationed across northern Morocco, from Tangiers to the Moulouya river. To strengthen his hold on the north-west, Ismail had appointed a general of the Jaysh {{to the position of}} <b>gouvernor</b> of Tangiers and its outskirts.|$|E
50|$|With {{the death}} of Moulay Ismail, the Black Army generals became the {{effective}} rulers of the state. Unlike Ismail, the new sultans were weak and incompetent, with different groups supporting different princes. In the north, the Jaysh al-Rifi generals consolidated their power and successfully fought {{an attempt by the}} Black Army to weaken their hold on Tangiers, which led to a situation where Tangiers (and neighbouring cities like Tetouan and Ksar el-Kebir) became virtually autonomous under Riffian gouvernors. Even though these Riffians had led the struggle against British Tangiers in 1680s, from the late 1690s onwards the Hamamis developed strong economic and diplomatic ties to British Gibraltar. In the 1740s, the family broke out in rebellion against the sultan, but they were decisively beaten in battle. By that time the family had such a strong power base in the north-west, that the makhzen was forced to appoint another member of the family to the position of <b>gouvernor.</b> The last of these Riffian gouvernors of Tangiers, a descendant of Ahmad al-Rifi, was deposed in 1912.|$|E

He remained in command in Brittany until he was made ambassador to Rome a third time in 1689 on the election of pope Alexander VIII.

40|$|Since {{his younger}} age, Sultan Hamengku Buwono II {{indicated}} that he always refused the Dutch intervention in the sultanate’s palace of Yogyakarta. He became rival of the Dutch governments because of his opinion that the Dutch had intervented {{too much in the}} cultural and noble life’s sultanate of Yogyakarta. After his coronation as a sultan in Yogyakarta in 1792, he kept his mind to guard the Java’s glorious tradition and the traditional power of the Sultan. This condition caused a great conflict between the Sultan and the Dutch government. Sultan HB II tried to refuse all the intervention of Dutch Government. As consequences of his character, the colonial government proposed to replace the Sultan with the crownprince. During his life, he accepted twice decoronation (in 1811 by <b>Gouvernor</b> General Daendels and in 1812 by Leutnant General Raflles) and he was exiled three times (Penang in 1812, Ambon in 1817 and Surabaya in 1825). Finally, the Dutch Government recalled him to be a sultan in Yogyakarta to persuade all princes who supported Prince Diponegoro’s revolt. Unfortunately, till his death, he still refused to cooperate with the colonial government. To the present, there are many works of this sultan as: literary works, philosophy, arts dan physical buildings, which describes his characters toward the colonial government...|$|E
40|$|The {{equipment}} of the Sala dei Cinquecento {{developed on}} behalf Cosimo Ith de' Medici {{in the medieval}} Palazzo Vecchio was the probably the most ambitious project of the Aretinian artist Giorgio Vasari. Full of pride he wrote this in a letter at its gentlemen of a work (opera), […] che superera ogni altra che sia maj fatta da e mortalj per grandezza e magnificentia, si per gli ornamenti dj pietre, statue di bronzi, marmj, fontana et per linuentione et storie dj picture, che sapparecchiano ora nel palco et nelle faccjate dj sotto. The allegorical historical cycle with glorifying elements, which extends over a timber beam ceiling a cassettoni and monumental frescoes at the two long walls of the Sala, places in its developing history, in which representation method of political structures, which kind of the self-representation {{of the government and}} the written description by the artist a singular ensemble, which was so far not examined appropriately in its multilayered meanings and functions. A goal of the thesis was it, to study the pictorial equipment program of the Sala by making an analysis of the program’s genesis to investigate for the alignment of the existing pictures and the descriptions by the artist and related contemporary orders for art and to extract its ikonographic content. First the program genesis could be examined and gradually made changes in it be reconstructed by the relatively good source situation. The sources, in particular three plans of the entire cover, a so-called cartone grande as well as different letters of Vasari, the duke and other involved persons, were compared with the implemented cycle, to work out the intentions of the duke regarding the equipment program. It could be shown that with the progressing of planning the three ceiling strips arise ever more as thematic units: the middle ceiling strip is finally dedicated to the duke and the older urban history, while the two outside ceiling strips - after the shift of administrative units, how the guilds and the Gonfaloni – show almost exclusively wars against Pisa and against Siena. For the first time the turn of the entire program, which was owed the admission of Michelangelo’s winner sculpture, could be proven {{on the basis of the}} planning designs. The investigation of the Ragionamenti led likewise to new realizations. So the dating of the writing between 1558 and 1564 could take place via the analysis from manuscript and postum printed expenditure as well as different letters. The adjustment of the text before completion of the pictorial equipment of the Sala dei Cinquecento - the ceiling was inaugurated on the occasion of a wedding in December 1565, the walls were only implemented in the 1570 ’s - was confirmed also in the alignment of the individual image fields with the text. That for the last part of the Ragionamenti was translated for the first time into German and connected in a catalog-like composition of the chapters each picture with the appropriate text passage. So partly engraving discrepancies between picture and text let themselves prove. Therefore it concerns with the text of the Ragionamenti not, as before always accepted, in order an explanation writing of the pictures, like it in the Œuvre Vasaris quite also occurs oneself (as during the description of the Farnese Justitia), but the written adjustment of a concept, which, similarly as the printed anniversary publications of this time, had the goal of spreading gloss and fame of the Florentine court at other courts of Europe. For Vasari meant this also the spreading of his own call. To understand equipment program and writing in their intentions, it was indispensable to work out the function of the Sala dei Cinquecento and their position in the total context of the ducal palace (Palazzo Vecchio). Despite difficult source situation and missing research in this field, it could be shown that the Sala was used as representative receipt and festival room. The antithetic confrontation of two wars, which were won on the one hand under the republican government and on the other hand under Cosimo, could be proven several times by different sources as contemporary intention. Thus the picture cycle of the Sala dei Cinquecento represents a perfectly new possibility of the glorification of a duke and the view of history. The republican past is not negated, but is not simply over-radiated by the gloss of the new system of government. Vasari speaks in the Ragionamenti of a scale, at whose point the duke stands. To which the republic used fourteen years, the duke creates in only fourteen months: To conquer an influential neighbourhood. This view of history and the antithetic confrontation of the two wars could be reconstructed also on the basis of the pictures. While the side of the Siena war shows proud army leaders, that follow well structured battle orders, incapable warriors in arms all’antica on the other side seem to be unable to battle. Like a catalogue Cosimo Ith de’Medici represents Tuscany (in the sixteen fields of the ceiling) and himself in the Sala dei Cinquecento as a good <b>gouvernor...</b>|$|E
