50|$|<b>Flashing</b> <b>LEDs</b> {{are used}} as {{attention}} seeking indicators without requiring external electronics. <b>Flashing</b> <b>LEDs</b> resemble standard LEDs but they contain an integrated multivibrator circuit that causes the <b>LED</b> to <b>flash</b> with a typical period of one second. In diffused lens LEDs, this circuit is visible as a small black dot. Most <b>flashing</b> <b>LEDs</b> emit light of one color, but more sophisticated devices can flash between multiple colors and even fade through a color sequence using RGB color mixing.|$|R

50|$|Another risk {{involves}} wrongly timed (or wrongly placed) events, {{which may}} actually be perceived to be against {{the interests of the}} consumer. For instance, in an ill-conceived promotion which took place on January 31, 2007, several magnetic circuit boards—each with an <b>flashing</b> <b>LED</b> cartoon figure—were attached to metal surfaces in and around Boston, Massachusetts to promote the animated series, Aqua Teen Hunger Force. The circuit boards were mistakenly taken for explosive devices. Several subway stations; bridges; and a portion of Interstate 93 were closed as police examined, removed, and (in some cases) destroyed the devices.|$|E
