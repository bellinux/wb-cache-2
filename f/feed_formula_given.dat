40|$|Background: Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) {{is a set}} of {{interventions}} that contribute in reducing the risk of HIV transmission from mother (parents) to the child. The infant feeding choice in the HIV context remains a key item of PMTCT. This study aimed at evaluating the nutritional status of children followed by the Mingha / PMTCT program in the Dschang Health District (DHD) during 09 years of activities. We used a descriptive study based on retrospective data from an intervention conducted at the DHD between 2003 and 2011 on a group of mother-child pairs in the PMTCT (Mingha/PMTCT) facilitation program. The intervention was the <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>given</b> to the children from birth till 18 months. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS Version 18 software. Results: Among 328 children accessed, we had a sex ratio of 0. 83 with more boys than girls. Severe wasting was found only within 11 boys (3. 26...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rare complication of enteral feeding, esophageal obstruction due to <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> bezoar, and reviews the published cases. An attempt to re-insert the nasogastric tube in a chronically ventilated 80 -year-old female fed via a nasogastric tube with Jevity® failed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an 18 cm-long concretion of the <b>feeding</b> <b>formula,</b> filling {{most of the}} esophageal lumen, which was removed endoscopically. Forty-two cases of <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> esophageal bezoars {{have been reported in}} the literature. The formation of <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> bezoars is triggered by acidic gastroesophageal reflux. The acidic pH in the esophagus causes clotting of the casein in the formula. Predisposing factors for bezoar formation are: mechanical ventilation, supine position, neurological diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, obesity and history of partial gastrectomy. Diagnosis and removal of the bezoar is done endoscopically. Feeding in a semi-recumbent position, administration of prokinetic agents and proton pump inhibitors may prevent this complication...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To propose an {{inexpensive}} blenderized tube <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> consisting of foods with standard nutritional composition {{that meets the}} nutritional requirements of individuals aged more than 51 years. Methods: The enteral diets were formulated mainly with fresh foods and tested for their physical (homogeneity, stability, osmolality, pH, and flow rate) and chemical (moisture, ash, protein, lipids, energy, crude fiber, vitamin C, calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc) characteristics. The cost was determined by surveying item prices in supermarkets and stores that specialize in nutritional support. Results: The blenderized tube <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> was stable and homogeneous, and had slightly acidic pH, hypertonic osmolality (603 mOsm/kg), and flow rate comparable with gravity drip (21 minutes). Proximate composition analysis indicated appropriate levels of proteins, lipids, vitamin C, and zinc. The mean cost of 2000 kcal of the standard blenderized tube <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> was R$ 12. 3 ± 1. 4, which is 70 % cheaper than the mean cost of similar commercial enteral formulas. Conclusion: The planned diet can be an excellent choice for patients using blenderized tube <b>feeding</b> <b>formulas</b> as it consisted of habitual food items, had physical and nutritional quality, and was inexpensive...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown the {{benefits}} of breastfeeding, however, the incidence and duration of breastfeeding in the UK is low and static, and breastfeeding rates in Liverpool in the North West of the UK are even lower. Breastfeeding is frequently promoted as being free yet {{little research has been}} carried out to substantiate this claim. Further, little is known about breastfeeding practices in Liverpool. Four inter-related studies were conducted to investigate the cost of infant feeding and associated practices. Initially a database was compiled of infant feeding products, this revealed a vast number of products marketed to both breast and <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted to identify all the items purchased for feeding infants up to the age of four months. The results of these interviews revealed that breastfeeding was more expensive than <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> but high and low cost models suggest that substantial savings could be made. Many mothers purchased items and subsequently did not use or need them. The suggestion that infant feeding and particularly breastfeeding has become unnecessarily commercialised was supported by content analysis {{of a wide range of}} UK pregnancy and baby magazines. These were consistent with parenthood being a consumer experience to be 'perfected', in addition to emphasising the need for 'expert' advice. Breastfeeding messages were undermined by formula company advertisements and breastfeeding was frequently presented as being painful and problematic. With these conflicting messages, it may not be surprising that many women initiated breastfeeding but ceased within three months. Those who did initiate breastfeeding frequently gave 'baby-centred' reasons such as breast is best whilst those who initiated <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>gave</b> 'mother-centred' reasons such as others could help with feeding. Many women who ceased breastfeeding would have liked to have continued, and cited reasons that could have been overcome with increased support and encouragement. The importance of being supported was further highlighted by the women who attended the infant feeding clinic. This study has demonstrated that the materials needed for breastfeeding are clearly identified and health professionals are trained to support parents. In addition, the media needs to be persuaded to help create and support a breastfeeding culture, with the risks of <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> clearly communicated...|$|R
40|$|As part {{of efforts}} to fight against food insecurity, poverty and {{biodiversity}} erosion, this project was elaborated to initiate the breeding and domestication of the palm weevil grubs (edible larvae of the African palm weevil: Rhynchophorus phoenicis Fabricius, 1801). The project was aimed at determining an appropriate technique and <b>feed</b> <b>formula</b> for the domestication of the larvae, as well as training local people on acquired multiplication and breeding techniques. In order to meet this objective, an experimental system {{was established in the}} village of Ntoung, Abong-Mbang Division, East Cameroon. The experimental system was made up of a hut and seven boxes in which the domestication attempts were made. Four <b>feed</b> <b>formulas</b> were introduced in the boxes as substrates to which adult palm weevils were added after being coupled. The <b>feed</b> <b>formulas</b> included: i) only fresh stems of raffia; ii) A mixture of fresh and decayed raffia tissues; iii) Only decayed raffia tissues; and iv) A mixture of decayed raffia tissues and chicken feed. Water was sprinkled on the substrate on a daily basis to maintain the humidity of the milieu. In total, 13 grown individuals of palm weevil grubs were harvested in the domestication attempt, with only two of the <b>feed</b> <b>formulas</b> being efficient for the production of the grubs. However, young maggots were noticed in all the three food formulas within {{the first two weeks of}} the experiment, most of which died within the third week. Introduced adult weevils remained alive throughout the experimental period in some of the food formulas, while the survival of these weevils in some <b>feed</b> <b>formulas</b> only lasted for two weeks. Local people were involved at all the stages of the establishment of the experimental dispositive, making the research very participative. Such participatory approach allows for the integration of local knowledge into the planned methodology, while transmitting directly the experimented farming techniques to local communities. Though the results of this experiment indicate that the domestication of these edible larvae is possible, it is important to determine suitable conditions that favor the development of young maggots after the hatching of eggs. Considering the nutrient content of this insect larva, it is important to develop the gotten breeding, so that these larvae may effectively constitute a cheaper source of essential nutrients in Cameroon and in Sub-Saharan Africa at large...|$|R

The causes are complex and multifactorial, yet enteral tube <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> {{is believed to be}} the perpetrator. Potential causes for diarrhea are discussed, and 3 case reports provide context to examine the treatment from a nutrition perspective. Each scenario is comprehensively addressed discussing potential causes and providing specific clinical strategies contributing to improved bowel function in this patient group. The approach used for diarrhea management is based on a complete understanding of enteral tube formula, their composition, and their impact in the presence of gut dysfunction. Choosing the right <b>feeding</b> <b>formula</b> may positively influence bowel function and contribute to improved nutrition. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
