5|$|The {{red panda}} {{is the only}} living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic {{analysis}} provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family, Ailuridae, {{which is part of}} the superfamily Musteloidea along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families. Two subspecies are recognized. It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a basal ursid.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, the patient <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were {{more prone to}} apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> {{indicated}} that nest mates may alarm {{the rest of the}} nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest. Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating that it is still in its “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response {{from the rest of the}} nest. However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E

25|$|Stump {{pyometra}} is {{a serious}} health condition that may occur in female dogs that underwent ovariohysterectomy (spaying), particularly if there is residual functional ovarian tissue. In this condition, the remaining stump of the resected uterus becomes infected and filled with a purulent fluid. The symptoms {{are similar to those}} of true pyometra. The risk of this condition is significantly reduced if no ovarian tissue remains from the original ovariohysterectomy. Diagnosis of a stump pyometra may be challenging as pyometra is often discounted as a possibility if the dog <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> spayed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{multiple}} reasons {{why some people}} suffer from more severe forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Different strains of viruses interacting with people with different immune backgrounds lead to a complex interaction. Among the possible causes are cross-serotypic immune response, through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement, which happens when a person who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> infected with dengue gets infected for the second, third or fourth time. The previous antibodies to the old strain of dengue virus now interfere with the immune response to the current strain, leading paradoxically to more virus entry and uptake.|$|E
25|$|Third {{generation}} sequencing {{technologies have}} demonstrated promising prospects {{in solving the}} problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation {{at the level of}} transcripts. While error rates remain high, third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce much longer read lengths. Pacific Bioscience has introduced the iso-seq platform, proposing to sequence mRNA molecules at their full lengths. It is anticipated that Oxford Nanopore will put forth similar technologies. The trouble with higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads. This approach <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> tested and reported to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds.|$|E
25|$|Although {{ranked second}} on the PGA Tour's all-time money list of tournament prize money won, Mickelson earns far more from {{endorsements}} than from prize money. According to one estimate of 2011 earnings (comprising salary, winnings, bonuses, endorsements and appearances) Mickelson was then the second-highest paid athlete in the United States, earning an income of over $62 million, $53 million of which came from endorsements. Major companies which Mickelson currently endorses are KPMG, ExxonMobil (Mickelson and wife Amy started a teacher sponsorship fund with the company), Rolex, Workday, Inc., and Callaway Golf. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> sponsored by Titleist, Bearing Point, Barclays, and Ford. After being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2010, Mickelson was treated with Enbrel and began endorsing the drug.|$|E

25|$|Research is {{currently}} ongoing {{in determining the}} physiological role of satellite glial cells. Current theories suggest that SGCs have {{a significant role in}} controlling the microenvironment of the sympathetic ganglia. This is based on the observation that SGCs almost completely envelop the neuron and can regulate the diffusion of molecules across the cell membrane. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> shown that when fluorescent protein tracers are injected into the cervical ganglion in order to bypass the circulatory system, they are not found on the neuron surface. This suggests that the SGCs can regulate the extracellular space of individual neurons. Some speculate that SGCs in the autonomic ganglia have a similar role to the blood–brain barrier as a functional barrier to large molecules.|$|E
25|$|All {{members of}} the family Sarcophagidae are larviparous or ovoviviparous. Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) gives live birth to larvae with the female {{retaining}} the egg case in her abdomen. Flesh flies are strongly attracted to carrion or dry flesh. The female has a strong desire to lay larvae on the flesh and have even been noted to larviposit on the sleeve of a garment that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> soiled with blood. Oldroyd states that the larvae of Sarcophaga spp are voracious and will take anything of animal origin be it alive or dead. A larva is forced out of the larvipositor usually head first and soon disappears into the food material. Once larvae are deposited as 1st stage instars, rapid development follows with 3rd instars usually being achieved by three to four days. Larviposition to adulthood generally takes around two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Rail {{transport}} {{returned to}} the Twin Cities {{with the construction of}} the Blue Line, which began operations in 2004. A proposal for a heritage streetcar line running east-west through the city, possibly including PCC cars once owned by TCRT, has been examined. A new Northstar commuter rail line, tracing U.S. Highway 10 northwest out of Minneapolis, opened in 2009. A connection between both of the twin cities, called the Green Line, opened on June 14, 2014. Light rail west from Minneapolis to the southwest suburbs is currently in the preliminary engineering phase of planning/construction. Other proposals have included adding both a commuter connection to the complete North and Southeast of downtown Saint Paul. A light rail alignment to the Southwest of downtown Saint Paul <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>previously</b> discussed, but dismissed due to the expectation of low ridership.|$|E
