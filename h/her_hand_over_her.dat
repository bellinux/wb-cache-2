5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
60|$|Patsy whistled, {{and then}} clapped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth and looked grave.|$|E
60|$|Lady Lundie {{emitted a}} faint scream, and put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|She would {{struggle}} into {{a sitting}} posture and put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> ears.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> ears.] Be quiet! I won't {{listen to}} you.|$|R
60|$|She {{attempted}} no words; she clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, {{and ran out}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|She passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{face and}} made {{an attempt to get}} up.|$|E
60|$|Widow passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow. It was a space {{before she}} {{answered}} him.|$|E
60|$|The saleslady clapped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{mouth and}} led the way to another model.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{could bear}} it no longer. She pressed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> burning ears, {{and the voices}} ceased to trouble her.|$|R
60|$|Her screams were so {{exactly like}} the whistle of a steam-engine, that Alice had to hold both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> ears.|$|R
60|$|She had turned, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast. Wolf {{spread his}} legs before her and {{crouched}} to spring, mane erect, jaws wide.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow {{to get rid}} of {{a feeling}} of unreality.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ellison {{fell back}} upon her sofa as if shot, and placed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{stared at}} him half frightened, and drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes with a gesture of bewilderment.|$|E
60|$|She clapped <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> {{and danced}} lightly {{back into the}} house. She {{subsided}} into his easy chair and clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|The girl clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow with {{a gesture}} of dismay, and cried, 'Oh! if you have only not touched your sword.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{took the}} pages, folded them and {{replaced}} them carefully in her pocket. She swept <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> skirts, {{and turned to}} Danton.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Stanhope passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow. Tom's blunt words {{did much}} to {{counteract}} Josiah Crabtree's strange influence over her.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} she {{controlled}} herself with difficulty. She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes, she seemed {{on the verge of}} bitter weeping....|$|E
6000|$|Her sister clapped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth [...] "Will you HUSH, you wretched thing?" [...] she whimpered. [...] "The {{whole house}} can hear you." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she pulled}} herself together. She {{looked at him}} with haggard eyes. She clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> heart as though its beating were intolerable.|$|R
6000|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, {{and looked}} up with the sweetest smile he had ever seen, and whispered, 'Now I can sing my Nunc dimittis.' ...|$|R
60|$|Pelagia put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{and burst}} into tears. Were they of pity or of joy?... She did not ask herself; {{and we will not}} ask her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--yes--no. I {{have not}} forgotten," [...] she said, passing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow; [...] "but, oh! {{let me go}} to her before I die!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{fortunately}} at {{this juncture}} Miss Trevor was captured again, and Miss Thorn put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth. Heaven only knows what she would have said! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where am I? Ah, I remember," [...] said Georgiana, faintly; and {{she placed}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> cheek {{to hide the}} terrible mark from her husband's eyes.|$|E
60|$|She locked <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes and}} groaned, swaying {{her body to}} and fro as one in mortal agony. Presently she looked out again with hard, dry eyes.|$|R
60|$|She hurried away, and I saw her {{afterwards}} seated {{amongst the}} bracken, her back turned towards the multitude, and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> ears, cowering and wincing in an agony of apprehension.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! sir; pardon me. I must to the kitchen," [...] said Christina, {{crossing}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast, {{to still}} her trembling heart, {{for she was}} very sorry for his grief, but moving resolutely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, hush, hush!" [...] said Rose, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> friend's mouth. [...] "Naughty one! you can bless me, if you will, {{only you}} are wayward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{good you}} are!" [...] cried Louise, in a {{grateful}} under-tone, {{as she came}} in. She kissed Grace, and choked down a cough with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gerald, come here, quick!" [...] {{presently}} called Bella, {{from the}} rustic seat {{where she stood}} beside her governess, who sat with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face as if in pain.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Clinton crossed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{stomach and}} looked at her husband with self-satisfaction. But Mr Clinton was awake, staring in front of him with wide-open, fixed eyes; various {{thoughts}} confusedly ran through his head.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bread stared solemnly {{and then}} {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> lustreless satin skirt, {{as if the}} perilous side of her situation were defining itself. [...] "Oh, sir, I am fond of my own clothes," [...] she murmured.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] murmured Betty, as she let {{the piece}} of bark fall {{on the table and}} clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes, [...] "he rose and tried to reach the water. Praise God that there is hope!" ...|$|R
