Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A <b>fisherman</b> caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The <b>fisherman</b> presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the <b>fisherman,</b> naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The <b>fisherman</b> raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The <b>fisherman</b> was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the <b>fisherman,</b> in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E

40|$|I studied migrant <b>fishermen</b> {{and their}} social life in Londji Plage in South of Cameroon. It was to analyze how migrant <b>fishermen</b> {{integrated}} the life, how {{the commercialization of}} fish is organized, the migrantâ€™s careers, the role of canoe ownerâ€™s wives and fishermenâ€™s wives {{in the economy and}} the relation between migrant and state bureaucracy. The fishing activity is completely modernized by Nigerian fishermen; they brought new canoes, nets and out board motors. Canoe owners and <b>fishermen</b> are always in conflict, canoe owners accuse <b>fishermen</b> to steal the catch as we see in the film and <b>fishermen</b> also are complaining about the relation between canoe owners and buyers. It is a personal conflict between them. There are differentiation between Nigerians and <b>fishermen</b> from the North in their careers. Nigerians <b>fishermen</b> have an advantage to be canoe owners by inheritance and replacement in the fishing activity. Fishing is a way of livelihood for Nigerian migrant <b>fishermen</b> and has being their occupation for generations. It is difficult for <b>fishermen</b> from the North to be canoe owners because most of them become <b>fishermen</b> in Londji Plage but Hassan is one of the migrants from the North who has a canoe. Northerners can be canoe owners by saving money and collecting the fishing equipment. To integrate the local community migrant <b>fishermen</b> also use interethnic marriage. The wives of canoe owners and <b>fishermen</b> are also involved in the commercialization of fish particularly smoked fish, roasted fish and fried fish. They contribute to the economy of the family and household. In spite of their integration in the life, migrant <b>fishermen</b> from Nigeria are threatened by the police and they have to pay the resident permit each year. But to get access to the fish resource they negotiate with the representative of Minepia and the transaction is beneficial to each other.
