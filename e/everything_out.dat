5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Ace Attorney Investigations 2, was {{released}} in Japan on February 3, 2011. There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally, but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet. In July 2013, Eshiro {{said that he and}} Yamazaki would like to make a third Investigations game, and that he intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> in the future, but that he could not make any promises.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't {{necessarily}} think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

500|$|In a BBC investigative {{documentary}} {{broadcast in}} December 2014, an antique firearms collector named Dennis Meighan {{claimed that he}} had been hired by an unidentified senior Liberal to kill Scott, for a fee of £13,500. Having initially agreed, [...] Meighan says, he [...] changed his mind, but provided Newton with the gun used in the shooting. After confessing to the police, he was asked to sign a prepared statement which, according to him, [...] "left <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> that was incriminating, {{but at the same time}} everything I said about the Liberal Party, Jeremy Thorpe, et cetera, was left out as well." [...] The [...] BBC's Tom Mangold said that Meighan's account, if true, indicated the existence of [...] "a conspiracy at the very highest level". [...] In 2016 the Avon and Somerset police passed their files to Gwent Police, for an independent review of the original investigation.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing at}} a few gigs with Deftones in California, United States, Korn {{went back to the}} studio to start {{recording}} Life Is Peachy in April 1996. Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success. Authors Jason Arnopp and Doug Small, insisted the album was rushed when it was put together. Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that moment. So it was probably about sixty percent knowing what I was going to play and forty percent just playing whatever came to mind at that moment, It ended up really good, and it has a kind of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> beforehand." [...] Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said, [...] "We wanted that same energy and inspiration we found up in the Malibu Hills." ...|$|E

The Boston Globe gave the film a negative review, referring to the Black Sabbath as [...] "three short films botched together".

500|$|In {{the opening}} lines, Kuti {{comments}} on his social reality: [...] "When we talk say confusion / <b>Everything</b> <b>out</b> of control". His lyrics decry what he {{viewed as the}} colonial mindset of some Africans and employ pidgin English, which was the lingua franca of most people in English-speaking West Africa; he sings the phrase [...] "pafuka", which means [...] "all over" [...] or [...] "finished", and the interjection [...] "o" [...] to add emphasis. Kuti makes reference to three dialects and currencies that make trading in urban Nigeria difficult: [...] "Dem be three men wey sell for roadside-o / Dem three speak different language-o / Dem speak Lagos, Accra, and Conakry / One white man come pay them money-o / He pay them for pounds, dollars and French money-o / For the thing wey he go buy from them / He remain for them to share am-o / Me I say, na confusion be that-o / He go say he pafuka o." [...] African Arts journalist E.J. Collins interpreted the latter verse as {{a reference to the}} protracted nature of transactions in Lagos.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E

500|$|... "Kingdom Come" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, calling it [...] "a particularly superficial addition to the series". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's lack of complexity was refreshing, but ultimately the [...] "awkward" [...] performances and [...] "cheesy" [...] approach to its subject matter detracted from it. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B, describing it as [...] "an episode {{about a man who}} finds himself trying to lose his faith but being unable to do so". VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from [...] "the typical Millennium problems", including [...] "an overreliance on trite philosophical dialogue"; however, he found that it contained [...] "something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely". The episode's thematic concern with {{the role of religion in}} society was noted as being [...] "the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Kingdom Come" [...] 5 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "classic Millennium". Gibron felt that the episode had [...] "an exceptional script that delightfully fails to spell <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> for us up front", and noted that it served as [...] "the blueprint for all better Millennium episodes to come".|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Keef first earned local {{attention}} from Chicago's South Side community with his mixtapes, The Glory Road and Bang. In December, Keef fired gunshots from a Pontiac Grand Prix in Chicago's Washington Park neighborhood. Police {{showed up at}} the scene and the incident resulted in Keef being arrested and charged with unlawful use of a weapon. Keef was consequently placed under house arrest at his grandmother's house for 30 days, followed by another 30 days of home confinement. It has been noted that by the time this incident occurred, Keef had already achieved local South Side popularity, and that much of his early fan base consisted of high school students in the area. While under house arrest, Keef posted several videos to his YouTube account. These videos were at the forefront of Chicago's hip hop subgenre, drill. The attention he received increased during the short time between the release of his mixtapes, Bang and Back From the Dead, and music videos, including [...] "Bang", [...] "3Hunna" [...] and [...] "I Don't Like". Once his house arrest ended, WorldStarHipHop released a video of a child hysterically celebrating Keef's release from house arrest, affording Keef further virality. Early in his music career, Keef's song [...] "I Don't Like" [...] became a local hit in Chicago, which was described by a local party promoter, as [...] "the perfect Chicago song because 'niggas just hate <b>everything</b> <b>out</b> here.'" [...] It also caught fellow Chicago rapper Kanye West's attention, and West created a remix of the song with rappers Pusha T, Jadakiss and Big Sean. In response to these events, David Drake of Spin writes that in 2012, Keef [...] "suddenly shot up out of obscurity." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} written in Nashville, Tennessee, where lead vocalist Wes Willis and guitarist Kevin Huguley were songwriting with producer, Scotty D.

2500|$|In 1937, at {{the height}} of the Purges, Stalin ordered an {{intensification}} of the hardships prisoners were forced to endure.

[...] The system of hard labor and minimal or no food reduced most prisoners to helpless [...] "goners" [...] (dokhodyaga, in Russian). Conditions varied depending on the state of the country.|$|E
