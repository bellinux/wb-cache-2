40|$|A {{method has}} been {{proposed}} to assess the reliability of aircraft structures subject to accidental damage using in-service damage data. The development of this method is motivated by {{the increasing use of}} composite materials in aircraft structures, which are particularly sensitive to impact damage. In addition, damage to composite structures may not be visible or may be difficult to detect. Based on the equivalent Level of Safety (LOS) concept, this method consists of two essential elements: a probabilistic assessment of detected damages and the probability of non-destructive inspection methods to detect such <b>damage.</b> Accidental <b>damage</b> <b>threats</b> are first characterized by identifying damage type, size, cause, and frequency for different aircraft models and structural components. The <b>damage</b> <b>threats</b> are then modeled by constructing histograms and detected damage probability distributions. Probability of detection models for various non-destructive inspection techniques are then used to calculate the equivalent Level of Safety. This approach can be used to design a new aircraft structure that is equivalently or more reliable as current designs. Furthermore, maintenance service guidelines and optimum inspection intervals may be estimated once design limit load is established. Engineers can use this methodology in the future as a guide to establish design and inspection criteria while considering safety risk and maintenance cost at the same time. The current reliability method relies on the completeness of the reported data on detected damage. Fleet service data currently available may not contain accurate information on damage size and the associated inspection method. In addition, damage reporting procedures vary from one operator to another, and damage data available for composite structures are limited. Therefore, sample representation of the extracted damage sizes and the probability of reporting are issues that must be addressed in order to apply the method to practical aircraft design. In this paper, 100 % reporting and 100 % sample representation is assumed. The results of the current reliability analysis method may give insight on general <b>damage</b> <b>threats</b> and future methods for designing and inspecting composite aircraft structures...|$|R

In many cases, projectiles can be treated as rigid bodies when their damage and erosion are not severe. Due to the intricacy of the local impact damages, investigations are generally based on experimental data. Conclusions of the experimental observations are then used to guide engineering models. Local damages studies normally fall into three categories, i. e. empirical formulae based on data fitting, idealised analytical models based on physic laws and numerical simulations based on computational mechanics and material models.

40|$|Abstract: Glaucoma {{management}} aims {{to preserve}} patients ’ {{quality of life}} by halting progressive visual loss. Intraocular pressure reduction is the pivotal strategy: we establish a “target ” pressure based on extent of visual <b>damage,</b> <b>threat</b> to visual performance, risk profile for further damage, pre-treatment pressure levels, family history and a patient’s life expectancy. Once an acceptable treatment regimen has been instituted, review ascertains whether damage has advanced and/or the risk of progressive damage has changed. Increased damage and/or increased risk of progressive damage suggest accelerated treatment, and lowered target pressures. When should management be stepped up? When a glaucoma patient, or a glaucoma suspect is getting worse and it matters, and when an individual is at increased risk of getting worse and it matters. At each review, the ophthalmologist seeks change in disease status: is it stable, uncertain {{whether or not it}} is stable, or progressing? Equally, the level of risk of further damage is assessed: is it unchanged, uncertain whether it is unchanged, or increased? If both disease status and risk are stable, the patient continues as is; if either or both have changed, treatment either can be initiated for suspects, or accelerated for patients. This means, intervene to reduce the perceived risk of further damage, and this means reducing or further reducing pressure. Management of glaucoma is an ongoing challenge: the disease is incurable. It is usually progressive and the damag...|$|E
40|$|Lightweight, high strength, high {{stiffness}} fiber reinforced polymer {{composite materials}} are leading contenders {{to improve the}} efficiency and sustainability of many forms of transport. They offer immense scope for incorporating multifunctionality due to their hierarchical internal architecture. One limiting factor in their wider exploitation is relatively poor performance under impact loading, a crucial aspect of any safety critical design, leading to {{a significant reduction in}} strength, stiffness and stability. This results in conservative design and higher mass structures. Self-healing has the potential to mitigate damage resulting from impact, thereby improving design allowables or offering other benefits such as reduced maintenance and inspection schedules. The work presented in this paper shows that either compartmentalised hollow-fiber or continuous vascular network self-healing approaches can be used for the repair of advanced composite structures. In the nearer term, the specific placement of self-healing plies or individual fibers to match a critical <b>damage</b> <b>threat</b> has been shown to repair internal matrix cracking and delaminations throughout the thickness of a laminate when assessed in both a flexural and compressive loading state. In the longer term, integration of a pervasive, circulatory vascular network within the foam core of a composite sandwich structure has also been shown to offer a marked benefit. The network has negligible influence on structural performance whilst being able to provide reattachment of the foam core and laminate skin after impact damage. In the case studied, a sizeable recovery in flexural and compression after impact strength, and restoration of primary failure mode was observed. Such systems offer significant potential for restoring structural integrity to a composite component during service and prolonging residual life after a damage event.

40|$|Abstract__ During {{the last}} century {{a large number of}} studies have {{demonstrated}} that complex interplay exists between the immune and the neuro-endocrine systems. This interplay, via shared cytokines, hormones and their respective receptors and nervous innervations, results in a highly organized integrated surveillance system capable of preserving homeostasis of the body to a large numbers of disturbances. Within this surveillance system the immune system recognizes external (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites) and internal (tissue <b>damage)</b> <b>threats</b> that might disturb homeostasis while the neuro-endocrine system recognizes internal threats (physical or emotional stress) that might disturb homeostasis. Ultimately, an integrated response of both systems will be initiated against both internal and external threats to preserve homeostasis of the body. As a result of this integration aberrations within the immune system will automatically affect the endocrine system, and vice versa. In addition, abnormalities in the crosstalk between the immune and the neuro-endocrine system might cause diseases. Despite the well-recognized neuro-endocrine-immune integration, more detailed understanding of the various interactions between the immune and the neuro-endocrine system is necessary. This will provide new insights in endocrine and immunological disorders and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for both endocrine and immune mediated disease...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the ability of}} a small kinetic {{impactor}} spacecraft to mitigate an Earth-threatening asteroid is assessed by means of a novel measure of efficiency. This measure estimates the probability of a space system to deflect a single randomly generated Earth-impacting object to a safe distance from the Earth. This represents a measure of efficiency that is not biased by the orbital parameters of a test-case object. A vast number of virtual Earth-impacting scenarios are investigated by homogenously distributing in orbital space a grid of 17, 518 Earth-impacting trajectories. The relative frequency of each trajectory is estimated by means Opik's theory and Bottke's near-Earth objects model. A design of the entire mitigation mission is performed and the largest deflected asteroid computed for each impacting trajectory. The minimum detectable asteroid can also be estimated by an asteroid survey model. The results show that current technology would likely suffice against discovered airburst and local <b>damage</b> <b>threats,</b> whereas larger space systems would be necessary to reliably tackle impact hazard from larger threats.
