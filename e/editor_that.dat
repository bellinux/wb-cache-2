5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
5|$|The actors {{selected}} {{to portray the}} protagonists invested much time and research into character development. Motion capture was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of licensed music tracks. The game {{is the first in}} its series to feature an original score, composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, sampling and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added a first-person view option along with the traditional third-person view. To accommodate first-person, the game received a fundamental visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a replay <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> lets players create gameplay videos.|$|E

25|$|Sivaram {{was also}} accused by {{human rights activists}} such as Rajan Hoole who was {{critical}} of Sivaram's role as the Tamilnet.com's <b>editor,</b> <b>that</b> {{he was involved in}} the murder of two PLOTE dissidents during his days as a Tamil militant. This report was denied by fellow journalist David Jeyaraj from Canada. However, some activists and writers associated with former PLOTE dissidents have disagreed with Jeyaraj's conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Crysis uses Microsoft's API, Direct3D for {{graphics}} rendering, {{and includes}} the same <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> {{was used by}} Crytek to create the game. The game runs on a new engine (CryEngine 2) that is the successor to Far Crys CryEngine. CryEngine 2 {{was among the first}} engines to use the Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) framework of Windows Vista, but was designed primarily to run using DirectX 9, both on Vista and Windows XP.|$|E

While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what {{many of us in}} the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.|$|E

Autocomplete suggestions appear in a modeless list box over the code editor window, in proximity of the editing cursor. In Visual Studio 2008 onwards, it can be made temporarily semi-transparent to see the code obstructed by it. The code editor is used for all supported languages.|$|E
25|$|Mario Artist: Polygon Studio, {{released}} on August 29, 2000, is a 3D computer graphics <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> lets the user design and render 3D polygon images {{with a simple}} level of detail. It was originally announced as Polygon Maker at Nintendo Space World '96 and renamed to Polygon Studio at Space World '99. The game {{was scheduled to be}} the final title in the original Starter Kit's mail order delivery of 64DD games, but it didn't arrive on time, leading IGN to assume it was canceled until it was later released. The Expansion Pak and the Nintendo 64 Mouse are supported peripherals.|$|E
25|$|Croteam {{developed}} their own level editor, Serious Editor 2, and used it {{for the development of}} Serious Sam 2. The editor has significantly more features than the original Serious <b>Editor</b> <b>that</b> was used for the previous Serious Sam games. Serious Editor 2 allows geometry to be imported and exported to and from third-party 3D programs, such as 3D Studio Max, via an intermediate file format, thus allowing for plugins to be easily created for any 3D modeling program. Two methods of creating particle systems exist in the editor, and they can be created either as procedural particle systems or emitter systems. The editor also features its own interpreted language, similar to C++, which allows for relatively simple mod programming, and a script editor and debugger, enabling the level designer to control gameplay events more directly.|$|E

Afshar's {{experimental}} {{work was done}} initially at the Institute for Radiation-Induced Mass Studies (IRIMS) in Boston in 2001 and later reproduced at Harvard University in 2003, {{while he was a}} research scholar there. The results were presented at a Harvard seminar in March 2004, and published as conference proceeding by the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE). The experiment was featured as the cover story in the July 24, 2004 edition of New Scientist. The New Scientist feature article itself generated many responses, including various letters to the <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> appeared in the August 7 and August 14, 2004 issues, arguing against the conclusions being drawn by Afshar, with John G. Cramer's response. Afshar presented his work also at the American Physical Society meeting in Los Angeles, in late March 2005. His peer-reviewed paper was published in Foundations of Physics in January 2007.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} into several languages. It was not published {{at the time in}} English: Random House bought the rights to the manuscript, but the publisher, in Bukovsky's words, tried to make the author [...] "rewrite the whole book from the liberal left political perspective." [...] Bukovsky resisted, explaining to the Random House <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> he was [...] "allergic to political censorship" [...] because of [...] "certain peculiarities of my biography". (The contract was subsequently cancelled.). The French edition appeared in 1995 as Jugement à Moscou. The book was also published in Russian (1996) and certain other Slavic languages, most notably the Polish edition which for a time became a bestseller. Only in 2016 did a full-length translation of the book, updated with material from the Stroilov archive, appear in English.|$|E
500|$|On 14 June 2010, Ubisoft {{announced}} {{the development of}} From Dust at E3, and the appointment of Éric Chahi as the Creative Designer. Codenamed Project Dust, it was marketed as a spiritual successor to Populous, a game developed by Peter Molyneux and Bullfrog Productions in 1989. Chahi described the game as playing like a sandcastle game, but with elements like lava. On 16 August 2010, during Gamescom and the European Game Developers Conference in Cologne, Ubisoft unveiled technical footage showing the game's physics engine in detail. In the technical sequence, a narrator explains the user's interactions with the environment, {{and the effects of}} each physical element upon the other. During the conference, Chahi presented a lecture entitled [...] "Creating a High-Performance Simulation: A Dynamic Natural World to Play With", demonstrating the world <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> underlies the environment simulation.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} a long history of {{tolerance}} of LGBT people in SF fandom. The presence of gay members was noted by attendees of early conventions, but generally not discussed — the idea that gay or lesbian members would seek recognition within the SF community was [...] "unthinkable," [...] and an accusation in the 1940s by a fanzine <b>editor</b> <b>that</b> the Los Angeles Science Fiction Association was [...] "full of gay members" [...] caused a scandal in fan circles. Prominent SF fan Forrest Ackerman is {{regarded as one of the}} first members of fandom to openly support the gay and lesbian movements. He was known for writing early lesbian fiction and aided in the publication of The Ladder, the journal of the recently formed lesbian group the Daughters of Bilitis. He claims the group named him an honorary lesbian for his support, and to have pseudonymously written the earliest work of [...] "lesbian SF" [...] in 1947 in Vice Versa, the lesbian fanzine edited by Lisa Ben.|$|E

[...] Amazing was very successful, quickly reaching a circulation over 100,000. [...] William Clayton, a successful and well-respected publisher of several pulp magazines, considered starting a competitive title in 1928; according to Harold Hersey, one of his editors at the time, Hersey had [...] "discussed plans with Clayton to launch a pseudo-science fantasy sheet". [...] Clayton was unconvinced, but the following year decided to launch a new magazine, mainly because the sheet on which the color covers of his magazines were printed had a space for one more cover. [...] He suggested to Harry Bates, a newly hired <b>editor,</b> <b>that</b> they start a magazine of historical adventure stories.
