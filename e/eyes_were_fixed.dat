500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{on the high seas}} in the Caribbean during the 17th century during a {{conflict}} among colonists. When a major event occurs, Mike hears the sound of a typewriter in the sky. Mike's reality literally changes each time the author makes a change to the story. Mike realizes that during times when he hears the audible sounds of the typewriter, his actions and words are not of his own volition, and when such sounds are absent he is able to make decisions for himself. Mike {{falls in love with a}} woman in the story, and grows frustrated after realizing that she is just another of Hackett's fictional creations. At the end of the work, Mike returns to New York, and is left with lingering doubts whether he is still a character in someone else's story. He muses whether a [...] "typewriter in the sky" [...] is creating the world. Mike looks up into the sky in search of this mystical device or its controller: [...] "Abruptly Mike de Wolfe stopped. His jaw slackened a trifle and his hand went up to his mouth to cover it. His <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> <b>fixed</b> upon the fleecy clouds which scurried across the moon. Up there– God? In a dirty bathrobe?" ...|$|E
