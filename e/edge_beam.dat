50|$|The deck, which curves {{from one}} end to the other, was {{reinforced}} by adding heavily confined edge beams encasing high strength steel along the inside face of the exterior longitudinal girders underneath. These rods extended {{from one end}} of the roadway to the other. The reinforced edge beams ensure continuity across the many expansion joints and help distribute the bending strains due to lateral flexure. In addition to the reinforced <b>edge</b> <b>beam,</b> four large prestressing tendons were installed the length of the bridge along the underside of the deck slab. These tendons are stressed to pre-compress the concrete deck to approximately 800 psi and also serve as flexural reinforcement along with the high strength rods. Finally, engineers found a way to reinforce the bent columns attached to the arch, which possess complex and varying geometric challenges. They encased the bent columns with thin, lightweight, composite carbon fiber jackets that provide the necessary degree of confinement to ensure ductile response and also mimic the original design.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> is to support the railing and the pavement, {{function}} {{as part of the}} drainage system and in the case it is integrated into the bridge deck it can serve to distribute concentrated loads. It is located in road environment and therefore exposed to water and salt with chlorides as well as subject to impacts during accidents. It deteriorates in a greater pace {{than the rest of the}} bridge and therefore has a shorter lifespan than the bridge in full. A deteriorated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> put the safety of the bridge users in jeopardize and increases the need of maintenance, repair and replacement work. These activities affect the surrounding traffic flow due to reduced speed limits as well as closure of traffic lanes. A literature study has been performed to get an understanding of how edge beams are designed and constructed. A great part of this was done by examining codes and regulations. By meeting engineers from different building companies it has been possible to obtain a picture of how it is done in real life and how the path to the final design looks like. Building site visits were carried out to see the process from design to construction i. e. how it is applied in real life. A design study was performed, including a check of crack width in an integrated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> over a support, height of bridge deck when a pre-fabricated (brokappa) is used and a comparison in the magnitude of the clamping moment in a steel-concrete bridge with and without an <b>edge</b> <b>beam.</b> All proposals are presented by the <b>Edge</b> <b>Beam</b> Group (EBG, in Swedish, Kantbalksgruppen), which is composed of experienced engineers that works within the frame of the project social optimal <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> systems governed by the Swedish Transport Administration. The literature research showed that even if the edge bean is prone to deteriorate its lifespan does not have to be governed by its condition. Planned expansion of bridge width and maintenance strategies including the replacement of waterproofing layer could also be a reason for replacement in some cases. A significant increase of reinforcement in the <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> and top part of the bridge deck over support is needed to obtain an acceptable crack width of 0. 15 mm. This would however aggravate the casting phase. The use of a pre-fabricated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> result in an increase of the bridge deck height. A solution could be to strengthen the anchoring capacity but this could in turn give an over reinforced structure. When it comes to the clamping moment in a steelconcrete composite bridge the integrated <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> leads to a better distribution of the traffic load. On the other hand, due to the higher dead weight, a bridge deck without an <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> would result in a lower total moment in the cantilever...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} gabled {{hyperbolic}} paraboloid shells (gabled hypar) revealed that shell loads are {{transferred to the}} supports mainly through diagonal arch action, and the contribution of <b>edge</b> <b>beams,</b> which have been traditionally included based on the assumptions of membrane theory, is actually very limited. This finding introduced a new shape of gabled hypars in which the <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> are removed. This paper investigated the behaviors of gabled hypars with and without <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> for various cases considering the effects of rise-to-span ratio (RSR) and lateral support movement. The FE analyses results indicated that, when the RSR was low, distribution of shell stress showed large variations. Lateral support movement caused an increase of tensile stresses, a decrease of compressive stresses, and intensified stress variation. When <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> were not used, deflections were increased substantially, and local fluctuation of stress {{in the vicinity of}} the supports was intensified. Such behaviors were aggravated when RSR was low and proper constraints against the lateral support movement were not provided, thus resulting in inefficient systems. As such, gabled hypars without <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> should be designed with caution...|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} square or rectangular slabs stiffened with <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> {{it sometimes}} becomes desirable that the <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> be tensioned {{to a higher}} pre-stress than the slab itself. This paper examines the variation of prestress throughout the slab corresponding to the application of known levels of prestress around the boundary. The method involves taking an imaginary cut so as to separate the slab from the <b>edge</b> <b>beams.</b> So far as the slab is concerned an Airy stress function is proposed, so that stresses throughout the slab may be obtained direct 1 y as derivatives of this function. The stress function is adjusted so that {{the movements of the}} slab and the <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> are the corners of the slab and at the mid points of its sides. A theory is developed for an ideal elastic material. The application of the theory is carried out on concrete slabs. Experimental and theoretical results are compared and a design procedure is proposed. However, the creep of concrete is important, the theory applies just after the prestress is transferred...|$|R
40|$|Bridge edge beams in Sweden {{may involve}} up to 60 % of the life-cyclemeasure costs {{incurred}} {{along the road}} bridge’s life span. Moreover, usercosts as means of traffic disturbances are caused. Consequently, the SwedishTransport Administration started a project to find better alternativeedge beam design proposals for the society. The goal of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} development of bridgeedge beam solutions that can result better for the society in terms of totalcost and still fulfill the functional requirements, through the evaluation ofnew concepts. A life-cycle cost analysis was carried out to assess the proposedalternatives. The results served as a guidance to identify alternativesthat could qualify for more detailed studies. One such proposal wasa solution without <b>edge</b> <b>beam.</b> Since the <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> is known to distributeconcentrated loads, the removal of such member could lead to loss ofrobustness of concrete bridge deck slabs. Thus, a structural analysis todetermine the influence of the <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> was performed through nonlinearfinite-element modelling validated from experimental evidenceavailable in the literature. An assessment of the existing calculationmethods for the overhang slab is also presented. The results show that the <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> behaves as a load-carrying memberwhich contributes to a wider distribution of shear forces. An increasedload resisting capacity for reinforced concrete bridge deck overhang slabswas documented.

This thesis follows theimplementation of this alternative in a bridge project. The goals of the thesis are to study {{the development of the}} U-shaped steel <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> solutionin the case study, and to identify the key factors behind it. The case study consists of a roadframe bridge where a heavily damaged bridge <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> system is going to be replaced.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the mechanical properties of naturally corroded bars, which were extracted from a real bridge more than 35  years old. This study is part of a larger experimental campaign comprising more than 20 reinforced concrete specimens obtained from the <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> of the Stallbacka bridge, which was built in 1981 in Sweden (Lundgren et al. 2015; Tahershamsi et al. 2014; Tahershamsi et al. 2017).

40|$|Previous {{accidental}} {{fires in}} multi-storey buildings and large scale fire tests have shown composite floors with unprotected steel beams had large deformations but collapse {{did not occur}} due to a mechanism known as tensile membrane action. The Slab Panel Method (SPM) was developed as a simplified performance-based design method including tensile membrane action for everyday design. As SPM has some provisions of <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> deformations in its analysis, this research was carried out to assess how realistic these provisions are. The study was performed on SPM and VUCLAN, which is a non-linear finite element program that includes both thermal and structural analysis. The effect of various edge continuity conditions on the basic slab panel was assessed by VULCAN models and compared with SPM. 9 m x 9 m slab panel were firstly investigated, then 9 m x 6 m and 9 m x 12 m slab panels were modelled to investigate the effect of aspect ratio on SPM’s provisions. The VULCAN analyses showed that the slab panels perform better with more internal edges and <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> deformations are always critical to the fire resistance of the slab panels. The SPM and VULCAN deflections were in good agreement in the 9 m x 9 m slab panel, but it underestimates the deflections of 9 m × 6 m slab panel and was slightly conservative on the 9 m × 12 m slab panel. It is concluded that slab continuity over the edge beams significantly enhanced the fire resistance of the slab panel. SPM provided good estimates on the fire resistance of slab panel when the edge beams {{are designed to be}} very strong or well protected, but underestimated the external <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> deformations.

Driven by that fact, a project was initiated to investigate the life of edge beams in more detail.   The main objective of the work was to determine and provide reliable input for establishment of investment cost of edge beams. The data was later utilized in an application of life-cycle cost analysis - created by a Ph. D student. Case studies - ongoing bridge construction projects in Askersund, Rotebro and Kallhäll - gave the basis for the research. Site visits were performed and engineers were consulted for data collection.   As an outcome of the project, costs for the edge beams in the case studies were calculated and comparative charts were presented that reveal the magnitude of cost contributors to the bridge <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> system.   The work illustrates that the construction of edge beams is a workforce demanding process.

40|$|Abstract: During an {{inspection}} of the roof of an indoor pool from 1971 in Potsdam (Germany) it was observed, that the roof and the column structures of the building are partially damaged by corrosion. The roof construction is a suspended simple-bent pre-stressed shell between two stiff <b>edge</b> <b>beams.</b> The span of the roof is 39. 5 m. The <b>edge</b> <b>beams</b> are supported by A-frames. After further investigation on the damaged areas (including tension tests, tension tests on notched tendons with different load cycles, tests of the bearing capacity of sleeve splices and screw nuts) the conclusion was that the joint of the tension rod and the concrete column had to be restored. This was accomplished through the attaching of a new supporting construction to the existing parts, which took over the load from the old connection. At {{both sides of the}} columns pre-stressed DYWIDAG-single-tendons (St 1080 / 1230, diameter of 36 mm) were used. They have to bear a maximal tension force of 835 kN.

The mystery and attractiveness of pyramidal shape have made pyramidal building undergo a renaissance in today’s architectural design. Pyramidal roof slab is not a common structure because of its typical formwork and expensiveness. In countries where there is heavy snowfall, pyramidal slab is adopted so that snow can slide easily due to its sloping pattern. But in India it is constructed rarely due to less snow fall, typical form work, requirement of skilled labor and its expensiveness. A roof/slab consisting of a plane surface triangular in shape and bounded on each side by a sloping ridge forming the intersection of adjacent planes and culminating in a common vertex is known as pyramidal roof. Triangular panels of pyramidal slabs make an angle with vertical axis. According to that angle effect of thrusts and moments is decided. There {{are two types of}} moments: i) Along the slope ii) Across the slope depending upon the boundary conditions. The primary aim of the work is to analyze and design the Pyramidal roof slab.

40|$|Recent {{earthquakes}} {{have shown}} the vulnerability of flat-slab structures to severe ground motion. The failure in such structures typically initiates at the slab-column connections {{in the form of}} a punching failure. This investigation was carried out to evaluate the adequacy of current procedures for the design of slab-column connections. The variables studied included the intensity of gravity loading, slab shear reinforcement at the column line, slab overhang and stiff <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> at exterior connections, and the indeterminacy of the connection subassembly. Nine half scale slab-column subassemblies were tested under simulated earthquake loading. Seven of the subassemblies simulated a single floor of a two-bay flat-plate structure. Each subassembly consisted of one interior and two exterior slab-column connections. The remaining two specimens were individual interior and exterior connections. All specimens were subjected to the same predefined displacement routine which consisted of twenty cycles of incremental displacements increasing to a maximum of seven percent drift. Increased slab gravity load significantly reduced the drift capacity of both interior and exterior connections. To achieve a lateral drift level of 1. 5 percent prior to failure, the ultimate direct shear on flat-plate connections must be limited to Vu≤ Cd√(fc') bod, where Cd = 2. 0 for exterior connections and Cd = 1. 4 for interior connections. The ACI code design approach for interior connections was unconservative for higher gravity load levels. For the range of shear stress levels studied in these tests, the ACI Committee 352 recommendations that moment and shear be treated independently for design of exterior connections appears reasonable. The ultimate direct shear capacity of the exterior connections in this study was Vu = 2 √(fc') bod. Closed hoop stirrups enclosing the slab flexural reinforcement passing through the interior connection prevented punching shear failure and increased the ductility of the connection. A stiff <b>edge</b> <b>beam</b> or slab overhang at the exterior connections increased both the strength and ductility of these connections.

A similar coupling of rotation and vertical movement occurs at the FPS bearings, due to their curved sliding interfaces.
