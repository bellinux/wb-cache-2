A high-angle shot (HA) is a shot in which the camera is physically higher than the subject and is looking down upon the subject. The <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> can make the subject look small or weak or vulnerable while a low-angle shot (LA) is taken from below the subject and has the power to make the subject look powerful or threatening. A neutral shot or eye-level (EL) shot has little to no psychological effect on the viewer. This shot is when the camera is level or looking straight on with the subject.|$|E
5000|$|Belarmino is {{then asked}} if he could still fight a man his own weight. We do not hear an answer to this question, but in the next scene, do see the boxer {{undergoing}} the sort of medical examination normally preliminary to a match. There is a cut to his arrival at the ring to fight a Spanish boxer, Toni Alonso. This is a carefully edited scene, in the same style as the opening scene in the gym. The montage accompanies the rhythm of the combat and the sequence is punctuated by stills. From the ringside there is a cut to a scene in the Hot Club of Portugal, a jazz venue. There is no tangible link to the ex-boxer’s story as he is not present. We then see Belarmino at another venue, the Ritz Clube. The fact that this is an entirely different location is not made explicit by the editing, which instead works to place the two in parallel. A strip tease is announced on stage at the Ritz Clube, followed by a shot of Fragoso staring intensely on (though we see none of the show). There is a cut to a long, <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> of the ex-boxer dancing with a woman and it is implied that she might be a prostitute, especially as Fragoso had just been quizzed upon rumours of his consorting with sex workers.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to identify the environmental problems and the struggles to save environment as reflected in a film Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax directed by Chris Renaud. The researcher applies Ecocriticism theory which concerns on Arne Naess’ basic principle of deep ecology. Then, to analyze the way the problems and struggles portrayed in this film, the researcher applies Gianneti’s film theory. This research was a qualitative research in nature. The content analysis is {{used to analyze the}} data. The main data of this research were words, phrases, sentences, dialogues, scenes, and soundtracks related to environmental problems and the struggles taken from the film. The key instrument of this research was the researcher herself. The researcher made some indicators of the environmental problems, the struggles and film elements as explained in the analytical construct. The indicators were made based on the theory to gain the data of this research. In addition, the researcher used peer debriefing method in order to obtain the trustworthiness. This research reveals that there are four indicators of environmental problems found in Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax: having no living trees and animals, consuming the factory made air product, enjoying to live in-inorganic environment and exploiting nature for business purpose. Next, the research also reveals that there are five indicators of the struggles to save the environment: keeping effort to seek the last seed, opposing in-organic industry, saving the last seed, raising the society’s environmental awareness and establishing a new green place. Two of the last indicators are determined as result of the struggles. The environmental problems and the struggles in Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax are portrayed by using the elements of film theory: the shot, the angles, color and music. The extreme long shot, long shot and medium shot are significant because they determine the entire mood of scene. The <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot,</b> eye level shot and low angle shot are mostly applied to convey a characterization in the film. The bright color, cool color and warm color are significant because they could build the emotion and atmosphere of the film. The music presented in the film to suggest mood or spirit of the film. This research concludes that Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax offers environmental awareness and the struggle to save nature to viewers in a good cinematography...|$|E

40|$|It’s almost cliché to {{say that}} Blanche is a living figure of division. The basic {{dichotomy}} between her lofty aspirations and debasing bodily drives finds its expression in heavily polarized spaces and bodily movements, as well as verbal sparring scenes and actual physical duels in both film and play.

40|$|Our {{primary goal}} was to develop an {{adaptive}} device to allow a user with limited upper body mobility to more effectively {{play a game of}} pool. Within this goal it was important to design around the concept of a least restrictive environment, in order to provide the user with as close to a standard pool playing experience as possible. The device was designed to specifically meet the needs of John Lee, an Assistive Technology Specialist at Cal Poly 2 ̆ 7 s Disability Resource Center. Mr. Lee has muscular dystrophy, which limits his upper and lower body mobility and currently requires his use of a wheelchair. Research into the specific needs of our customer, current products, and pool game elements was performed to better understanding of the project goals. From this research and discussion with John Lee, customer requirements and engineering specifications were developed. These were then used to guide the design development process. Several ideation techniques were used, and concepts for a bridge mechanism and supporting bases were created. A rough prototype was developed to test the concepts before our final design direction was decided. Our final design acts as a robust bridge device with a self-supporting base that constrains the path of the pool cue to a set path, allowing the user to focus their effort on providing power to the shot. The base can be rolled around the table, and stabilizing posts are lowered through a cable system when the shot is being made to prevent the base from sliding. The shooting mechanism features horizontal and vertical angle adjustment to allow for proper positioning of the cue, as well as a small cue stop to adjust the allowable travel of the pool cue. A vertical height adjustment is also present to allow the mechanism to reach {{over the edge of the}} pool table and for special <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> The shooting mechanism itself features fixed and sliding rollers that act as a modified pool bridge, limiting travel of the pool cue to one axis of motion. The top part of the device can be separated from the base and clamped to the upright post for easier transport. These design choices allow the device to be compatible with any size regulation pool cue. Engineering analysis was performed to select materials and size components for the final device. Parts were specified and costs recorded to keep within the program budget. The device was then manufactured to the specifications shown in the included technical drawings, and testing was performed to verify that the final product met the design requirements. The overall experience was successful, and the final product received strong approval from John Lee. Recommendations for potential future improvement of both manufacturing and design of the device are included, as are as tips for device operation...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{documentary}} filmmakers use <b>high</b> <b>angle</b> extreme long <b>shots,</b> including aerial {{shots and}} space photography, to present {{evidence for the}} considerable effects of centuries of agriculture and industry on the environment. The visibility of large-scale landscape interventions and atmospheric effects generates spectacular visual content to persuade audiences {{of the reality of}} the theoretical evidence for climate change. And yet two quite distinct and opposing directions can be discerned in twenty-first century attitudes towards aerial images. The first takes the optimistic view that the rhetoric of environmentalism, supported by still and moving images, particularly of the whole planet, is creating a growing active response from audiences. The second is a more pessimistic concern that still and moving image technologies, integral to the predominantly visual culture of modernity, and particularly significant in the development of remote control surveillance and weaponry, themselves contribute to the distortion of habitable space. Discussion of several films including Davis Guggenheim’s An inconvenient truth (2006), Daniel B. Gold and Judith Helfand’s Everything’s Cool (2007), John Lyde’s The 11 th Hour (2008), and Franny Armstrong’s The Age of Stupid (2009), illustrates the use of extreme long shots within the rhetoric of particular climate change documentaries...|$|R

50|$|Angled shotAs {{compared}} to the fast return that uses speed to catch the opponent off-guard, <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> {{are meant to be}} more subtle but are harder to pull off. However, if executed correctly, it is probably the most efficient way of hitting a passing shot. It involves hitting the ball at as acute an angle as possible, usually cross-court such that the ball falls {{right in front of the}} net, but bounces towards the side, making it impossible for the opponent to return the ball. To hit at such an angle, a lot of top-spin on the ball is usually required as well as a soft touch. Thus, players who can execute <b>angled</b> <b>shots</b> well are usually players who are familiar with using a lot of top-spin in their play, such as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, who is famous for hitting Half-volley <b>angled</b> passing <b>shots.</b> Chris Evert is usually considered to have had one of the best directed passing shots in the history of the game, hitting her shots with pinpoint precision against serve and volley players.|$|R
