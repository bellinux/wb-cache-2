5000|$|For an <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> in an AC circuit, the {{inhibitive}} {{effect on}} change in current flow {{results in a}} delay, or a phase shift, of the alternating current with respect to alternating voltage. Specifically, an <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> (with no resistance) will cause the current to lag the voltage by a quarter cycle, or 90Â°.|$|E
5000|$|When {{using the}} Laplace {{transform}} in circuit analysis, {{the impedance of}} an <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> with no initial current is represented in the s domain by: ...|$|E
5000|$|Mass (m) is {{analogous}} to inductance (L), since F = mdv/dt, while V = LdI/dt. Thus an <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> with inductance L {{is analogous}} to a rigid body with mass m.|$|E

50|$|Actual passive two-terminal {{components}} can {{be represented}} by some network of lumped and distributed <b>ideal</b> <b>inductors,</b> capacitors, and resistors, {{in the sense that}} the real component behaves as the network does. Some of the components of the equivalent circuit can vary with conditions, e.g., frequency and temperature.|$|R
5000|$|In phasor analysis, {{reactance}} is used {{to compute}} amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going through a circuit element. It is denoted by the symbol [...] An ideal resistor has zero reactance, whereas <b>ideal</b> <b>inductors</b> and capacitors have zero resistance [...] - [...] that is, respond to current only by reactance. The magnitude of the reactance of an inductor rises in proportion to a rise in frequency, while {{the magnitude of the}} reactance of a capacitor decreases in proportion to a rise in frequency. As frequency goes up, inductive reactance goes up and capacitive reactance goes down.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} an {{inductor}} in a circuit is to oppose changes in current through it {{by developing a}} voltage across it proportional to {{the rate of change}} of the current. An <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> would offer no resistance to a constant direct current; however, only superconducting inductors have truly zero electrical resistance.|$|E
50|$|Conceptually, {{the bias}} tee {{can be viewed}} as an ideal {{capacitor}} that allows AC through but blocks the DC bias and an <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> that blocks AC but allows DC. Although some bias tees can be made with a simple inductor and capacitor, wideband bias tees are considerably more complicated because practical components have parasitic elements.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the circuit}} shown, one port of the gyrator {{is between the}} input {{terminal}} and ground, while the other port is terminated with the capacitor. The circuit works by inverting and multiplying {{the effect of the}} capacitor in an RC differentiating circuit where the voltage across the resistor R behaves through time {{in the same manner as}} the voltage across an inductor. The op-amp follower buffers this voltage and applies it back to the input through the resistor RL. The desired effect is an impedance of the form of an <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> L with a series resistance RL: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} this work were to create an {{extendable}} library for electrical circuit simulation and a simple editor for interactive electrical circuit forming. The library was written in C++ language. It uses following methods. Trapezoidal method for solving ordinary differential equations for simulation time-dependable electrical elements. Newton method for solving nonlinear equations for simulation of electrical elements with nonlinear Volt-Ampere characteristics.

5000|$|A linear circuit is {{one that}} has no {{nonlinear}} electronic components in it. Examples of linear circuits are amplifiers, differentiators, and integrators, linear electronic filters, or any circuit composed exclusively of <b>ideal</b> resistors, capacitors, <b>inductors,</b> op-amps (in the [...] "non-saturated" [...] region), and other [...] "linear" [...] circuit elements.|$|R
50|$|An <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> {{would have}} no {{resistance}} or energy losses. However, real inductors have winding resistance from the metal wire forming the coils. Since the winding resistance appears as a resistance in series with the inductor, it is often called the series resistance. The inductor's series resistance converts electric current through the coils into heat, thus causing a loss of inductive quality. The quality factor (or Q) of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and {{is a measure of}} its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal, lossless, inductor. High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and receivers. The higher the Q is, the narrower the bandwidth of the resonant circuit.|$|E
40|$|In a {{simplified}} airplane-mission study for a Mach 2. 61 supersonic transport, dry turbojets {{with and without}} real suppressors and dry turbojets with ideal rotary flow inductors were studied for sideline noise levels as low as FAR 36 - 20. Compressor pressure ratio was varied from 5 to 30 and turbine temperature from 1800 to 3000 F. For no noise constraint and without a suppressor, the best dry turbojet gave a payload of 9. 0 percent of gross weight and a sideline noise of 126 effective perceived noise decibels. Payload dropped rapidly for lower noise goals, becoming 6. 3 percent of gross weight at FAR 36. At FAR 36, the turbojet with suppressor gave a payload of 8. 3 percent and the turbojet with ideal rotary flow inductor, 7. 3 percent. Below FAR 36, the <b>ideal</b> <b>inductor</b> was far superior to the real suppressor, giving payloads of 6. 6 percent at FAR 36 - 10 and 5. 7 percent at FAR 36 - 20...|$|E
50|$|Practical {{capacitors}} and inductors {{as used in}} electric circuits are {{not ideal}} components with only capacitance or inductance. However they can be treated, to a very good degree of approximation, as being <b>ideal</b> capacitors and <b>inductors</b> in series with a resistance; this resistance {{is defined as the}} equivalent series resistance (ESR). If not otherwise specified, the ESR is always an AC resistance measured with standardized frequencies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel noise {{optimization}} technique. The technique gives analytical formulae for the noise performance of inductively degenerated CMOS low noise amplifier (LNA) circuits with an <b>ideal</b> gate <b>inductor</b> for a fixed bias voltage and nonideal gate inductor for a fixed power dissipation, respectively, by mathematical analysis and reasonable approximation methods. LNA circuits with required noise figure {{can be designed}} effectively and rapidly just by using hand calculations of the proposed formulae. We design a 1. 8 GHz LNA in a TSMC 0. 25 pan CMOS process. The measured results show a noise figure of 1. 6 dB with a forward gain of 14. 4 dB at a power consumption of 5 mW, demonstrating that the designed LNA circuits can achieve low noise figure levels at low power dissipation. the National Natural Science Foundation of China,the State Key Development Program for Basic Research of Chin...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technology}} has emerged the last decade, {{based on a}} new group of materials; Soft Magnetic Composites (SMC), instead of laminated steel that facilitates production of products with more integrated, smaller, lighter, less costly and highly efficient electromagnetic machines. The application of this technology is a change of paradigm regarding integrated design and energy efficiency. This article describes {{a new group of}} SMCâs; Soft Magnetic Mouldable Composites (SM 2 C). With this material it is possible to produce electromagnetic components, using rotational- or gravital moulding technology, RotoCast. This new production method allows for integration of parts, coils etc, but also has a potential for automated low cost and high rate production. It is possible to reach impressive magnetic, mechanic and thermal properties in rotation moulded parts. High performance inductors and electrical motors has been produced by RotoCast and evaluated. The maximum permeability of SM 2 C is in the order of 30. This is <b>ideal</b> for <b>inductors,</b> since the storage of reactive energy is distributed uniformly. The total production cost of this type of inductors can be very low compared to conventional ferrite/litz solutions. Since the high frequency magnetization losses are low and the thermal conduction is considerable, there will be no hot-spots. For motors, the low permeability gives lower torque compared to conventional laminated motor structures. This is compensated by increasing the radius of the motor, and since the high-frequency magnetization losses are low the number of poles can be made very high, thus reducing the magnetic material giving the motor high torque-to-weight ratio...|$|R
