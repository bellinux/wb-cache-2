The Russian text of this book can be found at arXiv: 0803. 3769 [math. QA]. It is frustrating to observe that the above monograph has not been <b>finished</b> for <b>publication</b> purposes before L. Vaksman passed away so suddenly. Nevertheless, a great deal of the material is available in preprints and journal papers. Perhaps, the only essential exception here is the chapter on the canonical embedding (for a special case we refer to [36]), and so the principal motive of the people listed as participants was to fill this gap. The canonical embedding we are about to produce is a q-analog for a map of complex varieties which derives the Borel embedding of a bounded symmetric domain from the Harish-Chandra embedding. Additionally, we produce a quantum analog of the Harish-Chandra embedding of the associated real varieties, see (1. 2) below. The exposition is preceded with some background material as well as the simple example of the quantum disc. This section has been added recently for the convenience of the reader.

40|$|Introduction: Preoperative {{functional}} {{capacity is}} considered an important risk factor for cardiovascular and other complications of major non-cardiac surgery. Nonetheless, the usual approach for estimating preoperative functional capacity, namely doctors’ subjective assessment, may not accurately predict postoperative morbidity or mortality. 3 possible alternatives are cardiopulmonary exercise testing; the Duke Activity Status Index, a standardised questionnaire for estimating functional capacity; and the serum concentration of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), a biomarker for heart failure and cardiac ischaemia. Methods and analysis: The Measurement of Exercise Tolerance before Surgery (METS) Study is a multicentre prospective cohort study of patients undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery at 25 participating study sites in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. We aim to recruit 1723 participants. Prior to surgery, participants undergo symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer, complete the Duke Activity Status Index questionnaire, undergo blood sampling to measure serum NT pro-BNP concentration and have their functional capacity subjectively assessed by their responsible doctors. Participants are followed for 1 ?year after surgery to assess vital status, postoperative complications and general health utilities. The primary outcome is all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction within 30 ?days after surgery, and the secondary outcome is all-cause death within 1 ?year after surgery. Both receiver-operating-characteristic curve methods and risk reclassification table methods {{will be used to}} compare the prognostic accuracy of preoperative subjective assessment, peak oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Duke Activity Status Index scores and serum NT pro-BNP concentration.

40|$|K S Maniam is a {{prolific}} writer, with two novels, plays, and numerous short stories to his credit.

An intense, reserved, but courteous person, Maniam {{lives with his wife}} and two teenage children in a modest, two-storeyed, detached house in Subang, one of the dormitory suburbs of Kuala Lumpur. It was my privilege to visit him there last December, and engage in the discussions on which, together with his fictional works, this analysis is based. Despite his critically-acclaimed literary achievements, Maniam is denied official recognition and public acclaim in his country of birth because he chooses to write in English rather than the national language known as Bahasa Malaysia. Yet there are valid reasons for his choice of literary medium, reasons that are inherent in Malaysia's modern history as former British colony and now independent state to which immigrant communities have made a vital contribution. Nor does his use of English render him less authentic a Malaysian than his literary counterparts in that country. Reading Maniam’s stories makes readers aware of what Mohamad A Quayum has called “the presence of a local variety of English, infused with local colour and the tempo of local life. ” (1 Indeed, Maniam’s works are imbued with the vibrancy of the Malaysian landscape, both human and physical. Earlier studies of K S Maniam’s literary output have focussed on his novels and plays, and on the Malaysian landscapes in his work. (2) Maniam is first and always a story teller, however, and it is his short fiction and its salient characteristics which constitute the main focus of this paper on this occasion. With his concern to portray marginal experience, whether linguistic, immigrant, female, or dispossessed, Maniam helps give voice to another Malaysia and its sense of psychic and cultural deprivation. ...|$|R

ALTER-Net, a {{long-term}} biodiversity, ecosystem and awareness research network – Year 6. – NINA Report 569, 78 pp. During spring 2009, 22 of the 24 partner institutes decided {{to maintain and}} further develop the Network of Excellence on biodiversity research {{after the end of}} the European financial support in April 2009. With financial support from the Research Council of Norway and the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management, NINA hosts the ALTER-Net secretariat and two 0. 5 fte positions were filled (one coordinator and one deputy coordinator) to coordinate the network activities. Year six of ALTER-Net can been seen as a transition year in which our Network of Excellence had to find its way from having the financial luxury of EU funding to a new setting in which partner institutes contributed cash and in-kind person days themselves. It is clear that the Network has to prove its added value of maintaining the network and to prove the significance of the partner contributions that have been spent on our network activities (i. e. Common Research Programme, Communication & Knowledge Transfer, Common Training Programme, Data Sharing Policy, Long Term Ecological Research - LTER, LifeWatch, InterDisciplinary Research - IDR and Multi-Site Experiment). During year six of ALTER-Net the draft Common Research Programme was approved by the ALTER-Net council and will be worked out in more detail, elaborated upon and implemented in the year to come. A new version of News and Views ([URL] as communication tool on awareness, has been launched and a formal partnership between ALTER-Net and Ecsite, the European network of science centres and museums, has been established through the formation of a new Ecsite thematic group, the Nature Group. ALTER-Net is represented in Ecsite by CEH and also has a seat on the Steering Committee of the Nature Group. The ALTER-Net website (www. alter-net. info) has been transformed to the new situation showing our core activities and will replace the old version with all the work packages in April 2010. Work on Data Sharing Policy, LifeWatch and IDR are expected to come with visible outputs in the year to come. A Data Sharing Policy will be presented to the ALTER-Net council for approval and implementation and the case study on data exchange in the context of LifeWatch will be <b>finished</b> with <b>publications.</b> The IDR project on the Governance of Ecosystem Services will finish with an international workshop in 2010 and with publications. Although the work on LTER-Europe and ALTERNet’s support to the LTER-Europe secretariat is ongoing and has a maintenance structure the LTER activity has proven to be ALTER-Net’s key network driver.

40|$|Extract] This {{project was}} {{initiated}} to provide empirical data on water quality in streams of the Wet Tropics Biogeographical Region, on the benthic invertebrate {{communities of the}} streams, and the relationship, between the two. The proposal aimed to provide a classification of Wet Tropics streams {{on the basis of}} their invertebrate communities, and to explain community composition in terms of biogeographic, physical, chemical and biological properties. The main outcome was planned to be a manual for monitoring water quality using invertebrates. The approach was partly based on the classification of streams in Britain (e. g. Wright 1995). Subsequent to the commencement of this study, an Australia wide scheme, following similar principles, was established. This scheme, the Monitoring River Health Initiative (MRIIl) was established within the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation (L WRRDC). One of the main premises of the scheme is that stream invertebrate species respond differentially to different conditions of habitat, water quality and disturbance and so can give an integrated indication of the recent history of a particular site. There are many case studies that support this premise, including studies in the Wet Tropics (Pearson and Penridge 1987). However, there is little experimental evidence at the community level to back up monitoring schemes, by calibrating responses of invertebrate populations and communities to different levels of contamination or disturbance. Consequently, LWRRDC commissioned research to investigate and quantify experimentally the effects of selected impacts on stream communities, including a project based on tropical streams, JCUll, which ran in parallel with JCU 8. Certain studies were shared between the two projects, and will therefore be referred to here. The focus of JCU 8 on streams of the Wet Tropics arose from the following: 1. on the basis of detailed studies of two streams, it was known that Wet Tropics streams have very high biodiversity on national and world scales (Pearson et al. 1986, Lake et al. 1994); 2. the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area (WTWHA) was inscribed on the basis of several attributes, including biodiversity, ecological processes and evolutionary processes; 3. informed management of the WTWHA and contiguous catchments in the Wet Tropics bioregion was critical to sustaining these special values; 4. catchment use is a major threat to these values: in particular, agriculture, infrastructure development and tourism and recreation impact on catchments and directly on streams; 5. stream water quality reflects catchment integrity, and water quality may be best monitored using invertebrate communities, which integrate various and variable contaminants over time; 6. management agencies required better understanding of the biota of Wet Tropics streams, and of their utility in monitoring; there was thus a need to develop tools for assessment and monitoring. This report outlines the approach of this project, its results, and their application. The project could not be completed within the original time frame for several logistical reasons, but it is continuing so that the original goals are met. In particular, a monitoring manual is only partly <b>finished,</b> and scientific <b>publications</b> are only just beginning to appear. Nevertheless, the aims are being addressed in continuing work, with the manual expected to be completed early in 1999...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} dissertation examines Thackeray's working {{habits and}} methods {{in the composition}} of his six major novels; Vanity Fair. Pendennis. Esmond. the Wewcomes, the Virginians and Denis Duval* The method of the examination is not to attempt a comprehensive account of the production of these novels but to consider a par¬ ticular, illuminating aspect in each. The Introduction discusses Thackeray's notorious and selfconfessed 'carelessness. * His habitual indifference to narrative detail, accuracy and consistency has often pained those who admire his fiction and justified those who do not. Trollope, a noted disciple, is especially interesting for his attack on the pervasive 'touch of vagueness' in Thackeray's work. Even if his attack is wrong or overstressed Trollope helps us focus on the characteristic quality of Thackeray's writing, its unforced, opportunistic nature which can as easily produce 'touches of genius* as of 'vagueness. * The first chapter deals with Vanity Fair. The function of improvisation is examined at three ascending levels in Thackeray's novel; {{at the level of the}} scene, the monthly number and of the whole work. In the first the evolution on the MS. page of the •Iphigenia* scene is analysed. In the second some fragmentaryplans Thackeray made for the Waterloo number are compared with the very different published text. The third section follows the chronology of the story as a whole. At each of these levels one finds the same spontaneous adaptability to new narrative situations and possibilities. The second chapter traces the working compromise Thackeray made between his temperamental inclination towards autobiographical fiction and his disinclination to reveal too much of himself. The surviving fragment of the Pendennis MS♦(substantially chapter 41) is unusually instructive on this question of self-revelation. Moreover it offers a model example of the way in which Thackeray would work out problems in the very act of writing his novel. The third chapter takes up a long-standing controversy about the writing of Ssmond which is alone among Thackeray's major works in having been <b>finished</b> entirely before <b>publication</b> was begun. Was it composed 'carefully' or dashed off in the same way as the previous serial novels? Some alterations to the Rachel-Harry-Beatrix love-plot suggest the latter as does the haphazard emergence of the editorial apparatus in the second volume. The fourth chapter considers the prize item in the scanty catalogue of Thackeray's surviving working materials, an advance number plan for the last part of the Heweomes. fet how far this plan-making was Thackeray's normal practice or even how far it improved the novel in this particular instance, is doubtful. The MS. of the magnificent death-scene of Colonel Hewcome suggests that at the most important moments of composition Thackeray relied less on preparation thn on a more immediate power of inspired improvisation. The fifth chapter considers the Virginians in the light of its failure when judged by the standard of Thackeray's best fiction. This failure seems to stem from mixed causes among which the principal are: confusion of aims, undue deference to American sensitivities and a certain timidity when dealing with the inner lives of his characters. The last chapter considers whether or not serialism was injurious to Thackeray's fiction. Denis Duval, the novel whose composition we have most material on, would seem to show a happy collaboration between the serialist-Thackeray's need to write fast and the scholar- Thackeray's love of steeping himself in miscellaneous sources of information for the background to his historical fiction. The four appendices offer supporting evidence on Thackeray's ways of writing his fiction. The first gives some of the working plans made for Duval. The second follows the process of revision(and the muddle it causes) in a chapter of Esmond. The third gives a brief account of Thackeray's use of secretarial assistance in writing his fiction. The fourth contradicts, on the evidence of the MS., the received idea of the six-paragraph interpolation at the end of the eighth chapter of Vanity Fair...|$|R
