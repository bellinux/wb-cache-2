The horizontal stress, vertical stress, shearing stress, horizontal displacement, vertical displacement, and plastic zone distribution of mined floor are all simulated in both the advanced direction and the tilted <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> face. Along the advanced <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> face, the region of floor strata come into being a compression region, an expansion region, and a recompression region; their displacement decrease {{with the increase of}} floor depth. While along the tilted direction, the rock mass under the upper and lower two-side coal mass is in a compressive state, resulting in a vertical compressive displacement and forming a plastic zone of 12. 3 m in depth. Considering the failure depth of floor, the working face water-inrush coefficient of Taoyuan Coal Mines is 0. 082, which is 1. 4 times of the critical value. Therefore, effective measures must be taken to prevent water-inrush from floor aquifer and to ensure the safe mining of working face...|$|E

In order to achieve this goal a new structure of the working body and methods of mathematical and computer modelling are offered, aimed to determine the working body design factors and visualize the process. Mathematical models of the dependency of dough viscosity from working body structural features and the frequency of its rotation are made. The obtained models are used to determine rational values of controlled parameters. It has been found that for wheat dough mixing the use of equipment with pin working bodies is more preferable.

Methodology. The survey is based on the use of general scientific research methods, methods of analysis and synthesis, method of abstraction. Results. Research of state sales of agricultural products in agrarian enterprises helped us to identify and organize the following disadvantages: intermediary structures that are engaged in marketing of agricultural products significantly increase their costs that excess in 2 - 4 times the original price of agricultural products; inadequacy of agricultural market infrastructure and lack of wholesale and retail markets for agricultural products; low level of development of information electronic communications; backwardness of transport infrastructure and poor quality of roads, particularly in rural areas; high level of physical and moral deterioration of transport; low level of development of industrial and technological base of agricultural enterprises warehousing. Practical implications. We systemized and proposed indicators of evaluation of marketing logistics at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex based on the Balanced Scorecard in key areas: financial and cost-effectiveness indicators; indicators of internal logistics business processes; quality and development staff; indicators in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> with clients. To the financial indicators and indicators of economic efficiency we included such as sales per 1 employer at marketing department (Qs/employer), proportion of logistics cost of marketing in the total cost of the enterprise (%), coefficient of the implementation of marketing plan (Cm), ROI in logistics marketing (%), profitability of marketing channels (%). Internal logistics business processes in enterprises of the agro-industrial complex represented by such indicators as the share of orders that executed late, including objective reasons (%), share of reject (fault of the manufacturer) (%), share of violating the terms of delivery, including objective reasons (%), speed of loading-unloading works (Sp). Indicators of evaluation of marketing logistics in the direction of quality and staff development at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex are characterized by such indicators as share of qualified personnel in marketing department (%), coefficient of employee turnover (Ce), share of expenditure on staff training in marketing department (%), level of investment return of staff training in marketing department (L). As the indicators of evaluation of marketing logistics at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> with clients, we proposed such as the share of stable clients (%), reliability of supply (Csr), speed of customer and clients service (Csp), share of complaints on supply (%).

The overlying strata caving form in goaf under the retained roadway was similar to that of open-off cut on the goaf side.

Roof on the goaf side under the retained roadway broke in the form of “cantilever” and layered caving. The cantilever breaking point acted as a rotation axis of the overlying strata. Due to differences in the physical, mechanical and geometric parameters, the breaking period of the overlying strata varies, resulting in the formation of a stable structure of fracture development, and this structure can’t be compacted because of lateral stability region balanced action. The fracture closure zone exists in the middle of goaf. The fracture stable development zone {{is on the side of}} retained roadway.

40|$|In axial fan, {{the static}} {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} suction and the pressure side of the impeller produces a leakage flow through the blade and the casing.

In a first case, the air is ejected from the fixed casing and in a second case the air exit from the rotating shrouds. In both configurations, the ejected air has a direction to counter the leakage flow. To realize the second configuration, a new method to build fan with hollow blades was developed.
