40|$|AbstractBased on the {{platform}} ABAQUS, a 3 -D FEM model of conical ring with outer steps ring rolling process has been developed to investigate the ring's deformation behavior and the equivalent plastic strain PEEQ distribution. During the ring rolling, the average equivalent plastic stain (PEEQa) is increasing with bigger <b>idle</b> <b>roll</b> speed and lower drive roll rotational velocity. And {{the changing of the}} standard error criterion of the equivalent plastic strain (SDP) is similar to the equivalent plastic strain PEEQ. So the bigger <b>idle</b> <b>roll</b> speed and lower drive roll rotation velocity can help to improve the mechanical property...|$|E
40|$|Ring Rolling is {{a complex}} hot forming process where {{different}} rolls {{are involved in the}} production of seamless rings characterized by extreme dimensions (i. e. external diameter higher more than 1 m). Since each roll must be independently controlled, different speed laws must be set; usually, in the industrial environment, a milling curve is introduced to monitor the shape of the workpiece during the deformation in order to ensure the correct ring production. In former works the authors focused their attention on the influence of different milling curves, in an industrial case, and the results underlined that a ring produced with a good quality and lower loads and energy could be obtained imposing a linearly descending trend to the <b>Idle</b> <b>roll</b> speed law. However, different approaches could be used in order to identify the mentioned speed law. In this work the authors enhanced the knowledge about the optimization of the <b>Idle</b> <b>roll</b> speed law: different <b>Idle</b> <b>roll</b> speed laws were designed and simulated and the results were compared in order to identify the best speed law guaranteeing a good quality ring minimizing loads and energy required for manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|As-received {{hot-rolled}} 5. 6 mm thick IF {{steel sheet}} was symmetrically/ asymmetrically cold rolled {{at room temperature}} down to 1. 9 mm. The asymmetric rolling {{was carried out in}} monotonic (an <b>idle</b> <b>roll</b> is always {{on the same side of}} the sheet) and reversal (the sheet was turned 180 ° around the rolling direction between passes) modes. Microstructure, texture and mechanical properties were analysed. The observed differences in structure and mechanical properties were modest, and therefore further investigation of the effects of other kinds of asymmetry is suggested...|$|E
25|$|Roller die Drawing (also {{referred}} as Roll drawing): roller dies are {{used instead of}} fixed dies to convert shear friction to rolling friction with dramatic reduction in the drawing forces as reported by Lambiase. When roller dies are adopted, the drawing stages are composed by 2-4 <b>idle</b> <b>rolls</b> and the wire is pulled within the rolls clearance. This type of solution can be easily adopted also to produce flat or profiled drawn wires.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The metal {{processing}} system usually consists of various components such like motors, work <b>rolls,</b> backup <b>rolls,</b> <b>idle</b> <b>rolls,</b> sensors, etc. Even a simple fault {{in a single}} component in the system may cause a serious damage on the final product. It is therefore necessary to diagnose the faults of the components to detect and prevent system failure. Especially, the defects in a work roll are critical {{to the quality of}} strip. It is especially difficult to detect faults of a roll by using the existing frequency analysis method if the speed of the roll is changing. In this study, a new diagnosis method for roll eccentricity under the roll speed changes was developed. The new method was induced from analyzing the rolling mechanism by using rolling force models, radius-speed relationship, and measured rolling force, etc. Simulation results by using the field data show that the proposed method is very useful.

40|$|For {{effective}} manufacturing of a doubly curved {{sheet metal}}, a novel {{sheet metal forming}} process is proposed. The suggested process uses a Line Array Roll Set (LARS) composed {{of a pair of}} upper and lower roll assemblies in a symmetric manner. The process offers flexibility as compared with the conventional manufacturing processes, because it does not require any complex-shaped die and loss of material by blank-holding is minimized. LARS allows flexibility of the incremental forming process and adopts the principle of bending deformation, resulting in a slight deformation in thickness. Rolls composed of line array roll sets are divided into a driving roll row and two <b>idle</b> <b>roll</b> rows. The arrayed rolls in the central lines of the upper and lower roll assemblies are motor-driven so that they deform and transfer the sheet metal using friction between the rolls and the sheet metal. The remaining rolls are idle rolls, generating bending deformation with driving rolls. Furthermore, all the rolls are movable in any direction so that they are adaptable to any size or shape of the desired three-dimensional configuration. In the process, the sheet is deformed incrementally as deformation proceeds simultaneously in rolling and transverse directions step by step. Consequently, it {{can be applied to the}} fabrication of doubly curved ship hull plates by undergoing several passes. In this work, FEM simulations are carried out for verification of the proposed incremental forming system using the chosen design parameters. Based on the results of the simulation, the relationship between the roll set configuration and the curvature of a sheet metal is determined. The process information such as the forming loads and torques acting on every roll is analyzed as important data for the design and development of the manufacturing system...|$|E
40|$|In Ring Rolling process, to {{generate}} a seamless and axis symmetrical ring, two independent deformation processes simultaneously occur to reduce the starting ring cross section shape (width and height) {{in order to increase}} the diameter. How this shape changes during the whole deformation process greatly affects the produced ring quality and the loads and energy needed. The main problem is that the shape change is due to two deformation processes that occur in two different ring sections. The ring width reduction is realized in the cross section between the Idle and the Driver roll while the cross section deformed by the Axial rolls movement regulates the ring height. The main problem is that each roll speed law could be set independently from the others. In the industrial environment, a milling curve is introduced to correlate them to the ring section shape. In order to enhance the knowledge on how the <b>Idle</b> and Axial <b>roll</b> speed laws affect the Ring Rolling process, in this work an industrial case study was modeled by a numerical approach. Different <b>Idle</b> and Axial <b>roll</b> speed laws (linearly decreasing, constant, linearly increasing), were designed and simulated. The results were analyzed in order to understand how each speed law trend affects the produced ring quality (higher diameter, lower fishtail) and the process performance (lower loads and energy required for manufacturing) ...|$|R

40|$|Ring Rolling is an {{advanced}} local incremental forming technology to fabricate directly precise seamless ring-shape parts with various dimensions and materials. To produce a high-quality ring different speed laws should be defined: the speed {{laws of the}} <b>Idle</b> and Axial <b>rolls</b> must be set to control the ring cross section and the Driver roll angular velocity must be chosen to avoid too high localized deformation on the ring cross section. Usually, in industrial environment, a constant rotation is set for the Driver roll, but this approach does not guarantee a constant ring angular velocity because of its diameter expansion. In particular, the higher is the ring diameter the lower is its angular velocity. The main risk due to this constrain is the generation of a non-uniform ring geometry. An innovative approach is to design a Driver Roll speed law to obtain a constant ring angular velocity. In this paper a FEM approach was followed to investigate the Driver roll speed influence on the Ring Rolling process. Different Driver roll speed laws were tested starting from a model defined in an industrial plant. Results will be analyzed by a geometrical and physical point of view...|$|R
