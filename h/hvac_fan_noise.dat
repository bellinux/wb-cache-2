40|$|The <b>Fan</b> <b>Noise</b> Module of ANOPP is used {{to predict}} the {{broadband}} noise and pure tones for axial flow compressors or fans. The module, based on the method developed by M. F. Heidmann, uses empirical functions to predict <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> spectra {{as a function of}} frequency and polar directivity. Previous studies have determined the need to modify the module to better correlate measurements of <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> from engines in the 3000 - to 6000 -pound thrust class. Additional measurements made by AlliedSignal have confirmed the need to revise the ANOPP <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> method for smaller engines.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} turbulence {{involved in the}} <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> generation is evaluated with an existing model for the {{atmospheric turbulence}} and an extended version of an existing model concerned {{with the effects of}} a flow contraction on convected turbulence. <b>Fan</b> tone <b>noise</b> due to ingested atmospheric turbulence is evaluated with existing <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> models. The results indicate that the difference in <b>fan</b> narrowband <b>noise</b> due to atmospheric turbulence between static and flight landing approach conditions is in the order of 30 dB. It is concluded that <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> due to atmospheric turbulence is insignificant in flight conditions for the fans used in the current high bypass ratio engines. The difference in <b>fan</b> narrowband <b>noise</b> between the two conditions is primarily due to the low intensity of the turbulence involved in <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> generation in flight conditions. <b>Fan</b> <b>noise</b> due to atmospheric turbulence in static conditions should be reduced below the flight <b>fan</b> broadband <b>noise</b> levels which is best achieved with a reduction in the intensity of the fan inflow turbulence. Such a reduction can be obtained with the use of an inflow control device, low wind velocities, small surface roughness in the test stand environment, and large engine axis height above the ground. Peak sound power levels for <b>fan</b> tone <b>noise</b> due to ingested turbulence occur for transverse integral scales in the order of 25 % of the rotor blade spacing in the fan tip region...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>noise</b> is a {{significant}} contributor to the total noise signature of a modern high bypass ratio aircraft engine and {{with the advent of}} ultra high bypass ratio engines like the geared turbofan, it is likely to remain so in the future. As such, accurate modeling and prediction of the basic characteristics of <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> are necessary ingredients in designing quieter aircraft engines in order to ensure compliance with ever more stringent aviation noise regulations. In this paper, results from a comprehensive study aimed at establishing the utility of current tools for modeling and predicting <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> will be summarized.

In <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> generation, results from engine and fan experiments, using inflow control measures to suppress noise sources related to inflow distortion and turbulence, are described. The suppression of sources related to inflow allows the experiments {{to focus on}} the fan or engine internal sources. Some of the experiments incorporated pressure sensors on the fan blades to sample the flow disturbances encountered by the blades. From these data some inferences can be drawn about the origins of the disturbances. Also, hot wire measurements of a fan rotor wake field are presented and related to the fan's noise signature. The radiation and the suppression of <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> are dependent on the acoustic modes generated by the <b>fan.</b> <b>Fan</b> <b>noise</b> suppression and radiation is described by relating these phenomena to the mode cutoff ratio parameter.

Also measured were the static to flight {{effects on the}} <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> of canting the baseline inlet 4 deg downward to simulate typical wing mounted turbofan engines. The CTOL hybrid inlet suppressed the high tip speed <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> as much as 18 PNdB on a 61 m (200 ft) sideline scaled to a CF 6 size engine while the STOL hybrid inlet suppressed the low tip speed <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> as much as 13 PNdB on a 61 m (200 ft) sideline scaled to a OCSEE size engine.

A methodology was therefore developed to improve the data quality for the 9 x 15 Low Speed Wind Tunnel (LSWT) at the NASA Glenn Research Center that identifies three <b>noise</b> sources: <b>fan</b> <b>noise,</b> jet noise, and rig noise. The jet noise and rig noise was then measured by mounting a scale model of the 9 x 15 LSWT setup in a jet rig to simulate everything except the rotating machinery that characterizes <b>fan</b> <b>noise.</b> The data showed that the spectra measured in the LSWT has a strong rig noise component at frequencies as high as 3 kHz depending on the fan and speed. The jet noise was determined to be significantly lower than the rig noise. A mathematical model for the rig noise was then developed using a multi-dimensional least squares fit to the rig noise data. This allows the rig noise to be subtracted or removed, depending on the amplitude of the rig noise relative to the <b>fan</b> <b>noise,</b> at any given frequency, observer angle, or nozzle pressure ratio.

40|$|The <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> {{consists}} of the turbulent noise and the discrete frequency noise. On the multi-blades centrifugal fan, the spectral form is relatively smooth {{over a wide range}} of frequency without distinct discrete peak.
