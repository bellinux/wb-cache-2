Franken objects to efforts to privatize Social Security or cut benefits. He favors raising the cap on wages to which Social Security taxes apply. On his 2008 campaign website, he voiced support for cutting subsidies for oil companies, increasing money available for college students, and cutting interest rates on student loans.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, {{schooling}} in England {{was provided}} either on a fee-paying basis or by the Church. To ensure that all children had access to elementary education, the Forster Act 1870 set up Local School Boards to provide elementary schools for all children aged 5 to 10. From 1880, schooling became compulsory for that age group. The Education Act 1902 consolidated these boards into local education authorities and allowed them to subsidise schools with money raised from local rate-payers. Alongside a grammar school for boys, a private school for girls and a mixed National School, Sleaford had four elementary schools in 1905: two Wesleyan (one was for infants), one Catholic and one other infants school. The construction of the Bass maltings (1901–06) and the Rauceby Asylum (1897–1902) led {{to an increase in}} the town's population and school inspectors found that the four schools could not accommodate <b>every</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> the town. The indebted Wesleyan schools could not afford any enlargements so the town's elementary school managers opted for Kesteven County Council to take responsibility under the 1902 Act. The Council built a schoolhouse on Church Lane at the cost of £11,500, which opened as Sleaford Council School on 4 May 1908. The staff and pupils at the Wesleyan schools were transferred there; its first headmaster was H. H. Godfrey, who had been master at the Wesleyan school. Built with a capacity of 600 pupils, 280 were on roll when teaching commenced.|$|E

Fiona Nicholson of Education Otherwise, a home-education support group, agreed with this assessment and said that 'frontline staff working to protect vulnerable children have also expressed disbelief that investing hundreds of millions in IT can {{be the best way}} to safeguard children'. Laming, however, said that Davies' assertion was a 'gross distortion of what is an intelligent application of technology aimed at ensuring every child benefits from the universal services'.

Dalrymple questions {{whether there is a}} link between improving educational standards and increasing economic growth in the continent, and cites the experience of Tanzania under Julius Nyerere, Equatorial Guinea under Macias Nguema, and Sierra Leone's fate after a [...] "long history of historical effort and achievement" [...] as evidence that this may not be so, and argues that Africa's priority is access to markets.

500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that <b>every</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E
500|$|The 1601 Act {{stated that}} {{charities}} {{for the benefit}} of the [...] "aged, impotent and poor people" [...] had an appropriate purpose; it is accepted that these may appear individually. A charity does not have to be {{for the benefit of}} people who are both poor, impotent and aged to be valid, only one of them. [...] "Poverty" [...] is a subjective term, and in Re Coulthurst, Sir Raymond Evershed indicated that it should be treated as such; [...] "poverty, of course, does not mean destitution... it [...] persons who have to 'go short'... due regard being had to their status in life and so forth". This appears to indicate that a millionaire who loses half of his income may be considered [...] "poor", in that he is unable to have the lifestyle he is accustomed to. Some limits were set to this provision by Lord Simonds in IRC v Baddeley, where he wrote that: [...] The gift that creates the charitable trust, whatever the definition of poverty accepted by the courts, must be for the poor and nobody else. In Re Gwyon, money was left to provide short trousers to children in Farnham. While this was a necessity under the standard definition of poverty, the gift was not limited to the poor, and instead went to <b>every</b> <b>child</b> <b>in</b> the area. As a result, the trust failed.|$|E
