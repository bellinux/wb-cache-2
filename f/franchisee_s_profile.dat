40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} technologies (e. g. 16 <b>S</b> <b>profiling)</b> {{are increasingly}} used to investigate complex bacterial communities. They have advantages over classical methods, {{as a significant}} proportion of bacteria are ‘non-culturable’. However, they do not distinguish ‘viable’ and ‘non-viable’ populations, which may skew results, particularly following antibiotic exposure. Here we report culture and 16 S data from a clinically reflective human gut model, describing changes in the gut microbiota following exposure to multiple antibiotics. A triple-stage chemostat model was inoculated with pooled human faeces from healthy volunteers to establish gut microbiota populations. The model was sequentially exposed to clindamycin (33. 9 mg/L, QDS, 7 days), vancomycin (125 mg/L, QDS, 7 days) and fidaxomicin (200 mg/L, BD, 7 days). Specific bacterial populations were enumerated daily on selective agars. Periodically, 16 S proling of gut model samples was performed; DNA was extracted on a QIAXtractor, 16 S V 4 PCR products were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq, and resulting data were analysed using QIIME. Both culture and 16 <b>S</b> <b>profiling</b> demonstrated marked alterations in gut microbiota populations following antibiotic exposure. For many populations, notably bifidobacteria and enterobacteria, changes seen by culture correlated with 16 <b>S</b> <b>profiling.</b> However, as culture describes numerical changes in populations, and 16 <b>S</b> <b>profiling</b> describes proportional changes, results are not always directly comparable. 16 S proling greatly increased microbiome coverage, particularly for clostridia. Population diversity (number of observed species and Shannon index) decreased with sequential antibiotic exposure. Use of culture and molecular methods in tandem can greatly increase understanding of changes occurring in complex microbial populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{seismic hazard}} and risk {{analysis}} for the onshore Groningen gas field requires information about local soil properties, in particular shear-wave velocity (V S). A fieldwork campaign was conducted at 18 surface accelerograph stations of the monitoring network. The subsurface in the region consists of unconsolidated sediments and is heterogeneous in composition and properties. A range of different methods was applied to acquire in situ V S values to a target depth of at least 30 m. The techniques include seismic cone penetration tests (SCPT) with varying source offsets, multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) on Rayleigh waves with different processing approaches, microtremor array, cross-hole tomography and suspension P-S logging. The offset SCPT, cross-hole tomography and common midpoint cross-correlation (CMPcc) processing of MASW data all revealed lateral variations on length scales of several to tens of metres in this geological setting. SCPTs resulted in very detailed V <b>S</b> <b>profiles</b> with depth, but represent point measurements in a heterogeneous environment. The MASW results represent V S information on a larger spatial scale and smooth some of the heterogeneity encountered at the sites. The combination of MASW and SCPT {{proved to be a}} powerful and cost-effective approach in determining representative V <b>S</b> <b>profiles</b> at the accelerograph station sites. The measured V <b>S</b> <b>profiles</b> correspond well with the modelled profiles and they significantly enhance the ground motion model derivation. The similarity between the theoretical transfer function from the V <b>S</b> <b>profile</b> and the observed amplification from vertical array stations is also excellent...|$|R

In the present paper we will use the results of the depth-recursive tomography applied to the crossing <b>S</b> 04 <b>profile</b> to derive a 3 -D picture of structures near the S 04 and S 01 intersection. &# 060;br&# 062;The NW-SE trending <b>S</b> 04 <b>profile</b> starts in the Saxonian Granulite Massif and intersects the Eger Graben in the region of Altenberg-Teplice Caldera.
