50|$|Koki period soba-choko {{spanned the}} final 78 years of Edo (1789-1867). The period {{is the easiest}} to identify. The {{underside}} base featured an 'eyeball' style circle (Janome kodai), used <b>kiln</b> <b>marks,</b> had decorative inner borders and also featured at time decorative top rims.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} Lime <b>kilns</b> are <b>marked</b> on 1860 OS, the nearest being at Holme and West Gatehead farms.|$|R
50|$|Chuki period soba-choko (1720-1788) saw a rapid {{progression}} of designs and intricate patterns. Kiln stamps appeared {{and the quality}} of glazes and porcelain bodies improved. These early to mid era choko featured thin bases and rims, no kiln/era marks (Mikomi-moyo) and no top inner border markings (Renzoku mon). It was only {{in the last few years}} of Chuki leading into the Koki period did <b>kiln</b> <b>marks</b> and seals, top inner border patterns start to evolve.|$|R
50|$|Shoki period kodai, in {{the earlier}} stages, were {{unrefined}} and robust. The actual edge or rim was thick and formed a clear base either raised or flat. As time progressed the base design became thinner and less weighty. Chuki period bases were characterised by simple clean white bases, refined, with occasional <b>kiln</b> <b>marking</b> stamp - pictagram (mikomi moyo). In the Koki period the base featured a clear eye like centre. The wider the eye the earlier the production.|$|R

50|$|Towerhouse Wood (ST475719) is {{a site of}} {{semi-natural}} ancient woodland about 1 km to {{the north}} of Nailsea owned by The Woodland Trust which is famous for its Bluebells, veteran Oaks and for its pond, which is constantly producing bubbles of gas. Unfortunately, the Wood is being invaded by alien trees and shrubs that could overwhelm our native plants if they are not controlled. A large variety of wild animals are found in the Wood, now including Dormice, Rabbits, Roe Deer, Badgers, Grey Squirrels, and five species of bat. A lime <b>kiln</b> <b>marked</b> on a map dated 1769 is found on private land in the NW corner of the wood. To the south of the Wood there is a Mesolithic site first studied in 1956 which yielded many worked flints.|$|R

50|$|Ann Ashmead is a {{classical}} Greek vase painting expert, the leading authority on depictions of cats, particularly the Cheetah, on 5th Century Red-Figured Greek Vases. Ashmead has also introduced technical sections in her catalogues, {{through the use}} of x-rays, including references to <b>kiln</b> stacking <b>marks,</b> under-painting and preliminary sketches, fingerprints, and fuller inscriptions, and details garnered through technological examination, before it became a more commonly accepted practice in writing about Greek Vases.|$|R
5000|$|Austerson {{derives from}} the Saxon Essetune, meaning [...] "Aelfstan's Farm". The civil parish was {{originally}} a township in the ancient parish of Acton in the Nantwich Hundred; it was served by St Mary's Church, Acton. Major early landowners include the families of Bulkeley, Wettenhall, Praers and Bromley. In the late 15th century the land was acquired by Sir William Needham of Shavington. Part of Austerson and the adjacent parish of Baddington was forest until at least the mid-17th century, with wood being used as fuel for salt production in nearby Nantwich. A <b>kiln</b> field <b>marked</b> on tithe maps suggests that the parish formerly had a brick kiln. A small council estate was built between 1953 and 1965.|$|R
2500|$|The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again {{verified}} {{the great}} pottery {{tradition of the}} Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting {{question is whether or}} not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply [...] "made in Luzon." [...] In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified [...] "Imbe" [...] jars, meant jars coming from Bizen <b>kiln,</b> and <b>mark</b> three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ("Chinese Pottery," [...] Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture: ...|$|R
5000|$|Many of the {{important}} pottery traditions that spread into the Oceania region had {{their counterparts in the}} Philippines including the well-known Lapita culture. This quote from American anthropologist Wilhelm Solheim illustrates the matter: I hypothesize that the Sa-huynh Kalanay and Lapita pottery traditions had a common origin somewhere in the Palawan-Sarawak-Sulu Sea-Sulawesi area and that it was {{at this point in time}} and space that a second and main stage in the spread of the Austronesian languages began.
