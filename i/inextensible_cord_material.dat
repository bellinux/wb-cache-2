40|$|Packers, i. e. {{inflatable}} balloons {{made from}} elastomere, reinforced with cords, {{are used by}} the oil industry for sealing an interval along the wellbore, for open - hole stress tests to be performed. Thiercelin et al. {{have shown that the}} packer behaviour is {{critical to the success of}} such tests. In particular, the pressure exerted by the packer on the formation needs to be as close as possible to the pressure in the interval, to avoid fracture initiation or fracture growth along the packers. Moreover, axial tension in the rock needs to be kept to a minimum to avoid initiation of transverse fractures at the packer level that would be detrimental to the test. In this paper the theory of membranes, reinforced with <b>inextensible</b> <b>cords,</b> developed by Kydoniefs and its implementation for packers done by Atkinson and Peltier, is used to gain insight into the stresses which are generated in the rock, due to packer inflation. The shape of the packer is first computed for a given net pressure across the packer, via the solution of a nonlinear integral equation. Then the pressure acting on the formation, along the packer/rock contact zone, is found. Results show that the pressure applied by the packer on the rock during stress testing, is almost uniform and close to packer inflation pressure. The formation is afterwards considered loaded with the latter pressure and the stresses in the rock are found by either a finite-element or a semi-analytic method. Axial stresses develop at packer ends but are much smaller than the pressure applied to the formation. Tangential stresses develop at the wellbore wall and are higher at packer level than at interval level...|$|R

Analyses of these distinct molecular species were performed using microarrays and high resolution two-dimensional gels, respectively. Comparison of standard homogenization with automated frozen disruption (AFD) identified negligible differences in the relative abundance of genes (44) with all genes identified by either process. Analysis on either the Affymetrix or Applied Biosystems Inc. gene array platforms provided good correlations between the extraction techniques. In contrast, the AFD technique enabled identification of more unique proteins from spinal cord tissue than did standard homogenization. Furthermore use of an optimized CHAPS/ urea extraction provided better protein recovery, as shown by quantitative two-dimensional gel analyses, than did solvent precipitation during TRIzol-based RNA extraction.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} {{antibiotic}} treatment in pregnant women {{is to treat}} the mother and/or the fetus since {{it is known that}} antibiotics administered to the mother cross the placenta and reach the fetus. A comparison of the drug concentration in maternal and fetal plasma gives an indication of the exposure of the fetus to the maternally administered antibiotics. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} review the literature pertaining to the placental transfer of antibiotics in mail and to classify the antibiotics according to the type of transfer involved. A table has been developed for use by physicians that lists the name of the antibiotic, the drug concentration in the <b>cord</b> and <b>material</b> plasma at delivery and the type of transfer involved. Methods: An initial medline search was performed with the key words "placental transfer of antibiotics" with the limit of "human". A second medline search was performed with the key words "placental transfer of [...] . " followed by the class names of the antibiotic such as penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and macrolides. The bibliographic search on the placental transfer of antibiotics covered the period up to July 2005. Results: 3 types of placental transfers were identified. A few antibiotics cross the placenta rapidly and equilibrate in the maternal and cord plasma; this type of transfer is termed "complete" and include the antibiotics ampicillin, methicillin, cefmenoxime and cefotiam. Antibiotics which show incomplete transfer to the placenta where concentrations are lower in the <b>cord</b> than <b>material</b> plasma are said to have "incomplete" transfer and these include azlocillin, dicloxacillin, piperacillin, sulbenicillin, cefoxitin, amikacin, gentamicin, kanatnycin, streptomycin, fosfornycin, thiamphenicol, griseofulvin, vancomycin and colistimethate. Ceftizoxime is the only antibiotic so far known whose concentrations are higher in the <b>cord</b> than <b>material</b> plasma. This type of transfer is called "exceeding" transfer.

In order to study the effect of manganese on tolerancedevelopment; we injected manganese alone or in combination with morphine. Theanalgesic effect of morphine was assessed by using the tail flick test. Semi-quantitativereverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess the expressionlevels of β 1 and β 2 integrins. Results: As assessed on day 6, five days administration of morphine significantly increasedthe expression levels of integrins β 1 and β 2. Combined administration of morphineand manganese, which inhibited morphine tolerance, prevented the effect of morphineon integrins’ expression. Conclusion: Increased expression of integrins may be due to direct effect of chronic morphineor a negative feedback that resulted from the potent {{inhibitory effect}} of morphine onintegrins’ activity.

The FAAH inhibitor oleoyl ethyl amide (3 to 300 nmol) was administered intrathecally (subarachnoidally) or intravenously. The expression of FAAH and CB 1 /CB 2 receptors was determined by Western blot. Results: Oleoyl ethyl amide given intrathecally affected micturition in normal rats and rats with bladder overactivity but effects were more pronounced in the latter. In normal rats oleoyl ethyl amide only decreased micturition frequency, while it decreased frequency and bladder pressures in rats with bladder overactivity. Intravenous oleoyl ethyl amide (3 to 300 nmol) had no urodynamic effect. FAAH and CB 1 /CB 2 receptors were expressed in the rat sacral spinal cord. The expression of CB 1 /CB 2 receptors but not FAAH was higher in obstructed than in normal rats.

40|$|Background: The {{degree of}} canal {{stenosis}} following a thoracolumbar burst fracture is sometimes {{used as an}} indica-tion for decompressive surgery. This study was performed {{to test the hypothesis}} that the final resting positions of the bone fragments seen on computed tomography imaging are not representative of the dynamic canal occlusion and associated neurological damage that occurs during the fracture event. Methods: A drop-weight method was used to create burst fractures in bovine spinal segments devoid of a spinal cord. During impact, dynamic measurements were made with use of transducers to measure pressure in a synthetic spinal <b>cord</b> <b>material,</b> and a high-speed video camera filmed the inside of the spinal canal. A corresponding finite ele-ment model was created to determine the effect of the spinal cord on the dynamics of the bone fragment. Results: The high-speed video clearly showed the fragments of bone being projected from the vertebral body into the spinal canal before being recoiled, by the action of the posterior longitudinal ligament and intervertebral disc attach-ments, to their final resting position. The pressure measurements in the synthetic spinal cord showed a peak in ca-nal pressure during impact. There was poor concordance between the extent of postimpact occlusion of the canal as seen on the computed tomography images and the maximum amount of occlusion that occurred at the moment of im-pact. The finite element model showed that the presence of the cord would reduce the maximum dynamic level of ca-nal occlusion at high fragment velocities.

The presence or absence of the cord in the inguinal canal was recorded. The visualized spermatic cord was tracked down to the testis in extra-abdominal location. If spermatic cord was not visualized, the USG was extended up to look for intra-abdominal testis. The location and size of the testis were recorded, and the findings were compared with those seen at surgery. Results: The status of NPT was predicted by sonography in 191 instances. The testis was canalicular in position in 53, abdominal in 76, ascending in 5, ectopic in 8, and moving in 5 cases. There were three instances of tumor in the NPT and one case of torsion. The testes were atrophic in 36 instances. The testis was not visualized by USG in 10 instances. In four of them, spermatic cord was seen in inguinal canal, indicating vanished testes. In one patient, there was an atrophic testis with inguinal hernia. Diagnostic laparoscopy was necessary in only five cases and showed abdominal testes in two cases and the cord entering the internal ring in three cases.

Eighty-two healthy subjects, 10 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 10 with spinal muscular atrophy and 10 with spinal cord injuries were studied. DTbM was compared with active surface method (ASM), threshold-based method (TbM) and manual outlining (ground truth). Accuracy of segmentations was scored visually by a radiologist in cervical and thoracic cord regions. Accuracy was also quantified at the cervical and thoracic levels {{as well as at}} C 2 vertebral level. To construct a cervical template from healthy subjects’ images (n= 59), a standardization pipeline was designed leading to well-centered straight spinal cord images and accurate probability tissue map.

Since time [1], {{our group}} studies through {{immunohistochemistry}} and RT-PCR analysis {{the expression of}} many genes and the localization of the corresponding proteins in the human umbilical cord [2], with the aim to create {{a map of the}} presence of the different molecules in the different territories of this organ. In this work we investigate the expression and localization of several cell differentiation markers in the different territories of the human umbilical <b>cord.</b> <b>Materials</b> and methods. The presence of E-Cadherin, CD 31, CD 68, AE 1 -AE 3, Desmin, Actin ML, HHF 35 and MIB- 1 was studied through immunohistochemistry. Results. The expression of E-Cadherin (epithelial cell marker) has been identified in the amniotic epithelium of the human umbilical cord, while CD 31 (endothelial cell marker) is present in the endothelia of all the three umbilical vessels. CD 68 (macrophages marker) is expressed by some cells within the Wharton’s jelly and the vessels intima. AE 1 -AE 3 (pankeratin) is present in the amniotic epithelium and in few cells of the Wharton’s jelly. Desmin and Actin ML (smooth muscle markers) are expressed in the vessels musculature and in the fibroblasts of the Wharton’s jelly while Actin 35 (HHF 35) is present both in vessels musculature and in the intima. MIB- 1 (cell proliferation index) expression was not identified in any of the territories of the umbilical cord. Conclusions. From this immunohistochemical data we realize that some of these cell differentiation markers (i. e. desmin and actin ML) are expressed not only in the territories where they perform their typical function (epithelia, endothelia, muscle) but also by other districts where their molecular role could contribute to address the differentiation of some cells towards other phenotypical conditions...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement {{of rubber}} by cords {{is crucial for}} many {{applications}} such as high-pressure hoses and conveyor belts. However, the largest application of cord-rubber composites is the tyre. The carcass of the tyre contains a network of cords that gives the tyre its strength. Not only the type of <b>cord</b> <b>material</b> that is used determines the performance, but also the way the cords are positioned in the carcass, as described in Chapter 1. Since the cords absorb most of the forces where the tyre is subjected to, a good adhesion between cord and rubber is an absolute requirement. The coating which the cords need to obtain sufficient adhesion to rubber compounds is called the Resorcinol Formaldehyde Latex (RFL) treatment. Despite the importance of good adhesion {{and the fact that}} this RFL-treatment has been widely applied since the Second World War, and no better alternative has been found till today, the mechanism by which the adhesion is obtained has remained unclear. The relatively few publications on this technique are described in Chapter 2. Most of the research described was rather empirical: the many factors involved when dipping the cords in a RFL-dip and curing it to rubber were varied and their influence on the adhesion was described. However, most of the publications lack a mechanistic approach to obtain more fundamental knowledge about this technique. With new fibre materials introduced in recent years, in particular aramid fibres, there is a renewed interest in the mechanism of adhesion of RFL-treated cords to rubber in order to utilise the properties of these high-performance fibres to their full extent in rubber compounds. In this thesis, an attempt is made to elucidate the adhesion between RFL-treated cords and rubber using a more systematic approach to obtain a mechanistic view on the chemical and physical processes involved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} {{that it is}} possible to acquire accurate functional magnetic resonance images from thoracic spinal <b>cord</b> neurons. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: The lower thoracic spinal dermatomes (T 72 ̆ 013 T 11) on the right side of the body were mechanically stimulated by vibration for 15 participants. Neuronal responses to vibration sensation were measured in the thoracic spinal cord using a HASTE sequence on a 3 Tesla MRI system. Results: Signal increases were observed in the corresponding lower thoracic spinal cord segments ipsilateral to the side of stimulation in the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. Conclusion: This is the 01 rst study to provide proof of principle that functional imaging of the entire thoracic spinal cord is possible, by detecting neuronal activity in the thoracic spinal cord during sensory stimulation using spinal fMRI.

5000|$|Galilee: Collections {{reveal that}} there was a {{distinct}} Galilee women's style from at least the middle of the 19th century. The standard form was a coat (Jillayeh), tunic and trousers. Cross-stitch was not used much, the women preferring patchwork patterns of diamond and rectangular shapes, as well as other embroidery techniques. In the 1860s, H.B. Tristram described costumes in the villages of El Bussah and Isfia as being either [...] "plain, patched or embroidered in the most fantastic and grotesque shapes". Towards the beginning of the 20th century Turkish/Ottoman fashions began to dominate: such as baggy trousers and <b>cord</b> edging. <b>Materials,</b> particularly silks, were brought from Damascus. Before the arrival of European colour-fast dyes the Galilee was an important area for the growing of indago and sumac which were used for creating blue and red dyes.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors were {{recently}} introduced {{as a new}} treatment option for men with lower urinary tract symptoms. Safety and clinical effectiveness are well documented but the mode of action is still unclear. We determined and compared the expression of phosphodiesterase type 5 in the spinal cord of normal (sham operated) rats and rats with partial urethral obstruction induced bladder overactivity. We also assessed the urodynamic effects of intravenously and intrathecally administered sildenafil in the rats to determine whether phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors exert effects on the sacral spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: A total of 65 male Sprague-Dawley (R) rats were used for molecular/morphological and functional experiments. Bladder overactivity was induced via surgical partial urethral obstruction in 39 of 65 rats. Spinal phosphodiesterase type 5 expression was assessed by histology and polymerase chain reaction. the effects of sildenafil administered intravenously or intrathecally were studied urodynamically. Results: Phosphodiesterase type 5 was expressed in various regions of the lumbosacral spinal cord, including the sacral regions of micturition control. Expression was similar in normal rats and rats with partial urethral obstruction/bladder overactivity. in normal rats intravenous and intrathecal sildenafil had no urodynamic effect. When administered intravenously and intrathecally to rats with partial urethral obstruction/bladder overactivity, sildenafil decreased micturition frequency and bladder pressure. Doses tested intrathecally had no effect when given intravenously. Conclusions: Phosphodiesterase type 5 is expressed in the rat spinal cord. Intravenous sildenafil may exert part of its urodynamic effect in rats with partial urethral obstruction/bladder overactivity via {{an effect on the}} sacral spinal cord.
