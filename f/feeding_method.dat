5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common <b>feeding</b> <b>method</b> is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{offshore}} process front end engineering design (<b>FEED)</b> <b>method</b> is systematically introduced and reviewed to enable efficient offshore {{oil and gas}} production plant engineering. An integrated process engineering environment is also presented for the topside systems of a liquefied natural gas floating production, storage, and offloading (LNG FPSO) unit, based on the concepts and procedures for the process FEED of general offshore production plants. Various activities of the general process FEED scheme are first summarized, and then the offshore process <b>FEED</b> <b>method,</b> which is applicable to all types of offshore {{oil and gas production}} plants, is presented. The integrated process engineering environment is presented according to the aforementioned <b>FEED</b> <b>method.</b> Finally, the offshore process <b>FEED</b> <b>method</b> is applied to the topside systems of an LNG FPSO in order to verify the validity and applicability of the <b>FEED</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R

25|$|The <b>feeding</b> <b>method</b> of tadpole shrimps {{is similar}} to that {{proposed}} for the ancestral crustacean. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The gnathobases (inward-facing lobes {{at the base of the}} leg) guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end of the leg) stir and lift the sediments. Fine silt particles and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called endopods at the end of the leg.|$|E

Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding. Some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking {{them out of the}} water.|$|E
25|$|Mothers express {{milk for}} {{multiple}} reasons. Expressing breast milk can maintain a mother's milk supply {{when she and}} her child are apart. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Some babies are unable or unwilling to nurse. Expressed milk is the <b>feeding</b> <b>method</b> of choice for premature babies. Viral disease transmission can be prevented by expressing breast milk and subjecting it to Holder pasteurisation. Some women donate expressed breast milk (EBM) to others, either directly or through a milk bank. This allows mothers who cannot breastfeed to give their baby the benefits of breast milk.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{most other}} bee species {{which have a}} short {{proboscis}} to consume nectar with a lapping motion of their hair-covered tongues, the long-tongued Euglossini bees utilize a purely suction <b>feeding</b> <b>method</b> to ingest nectar from deep flowers, such as flowering orchid plants. However, because of the dilemma the euglossine bees face—in which energy content rises linearly with nectar sugar concentration, whereas viscosity rises exponentially—, E. imperialis collect more dilute nectars, relative to their lapping bee counterparts, with sucrose concentrations between approximately 30 to 40%. During the actual ingestion, the glossa of E. imperialis is generally fully extended and stationary, stretching 6mm beyond the apical end of the feeding tube formed by the galeae and the labial palps. Therefore, the shift in capillary-based lapping to suction feeding for E. imperialis, although decreasing nectar sugar concentration, maximizes the rate of energy intake for each individual bee.|$|E
25|$|All {{whales are}} {{carnivorous}} and predatory. Odontocetes, as a whole, mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, and then followed by crustaceans and bivalves. All species are generalist and opportunistic feeders. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common <b>feeding</b> <b>method</b> is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball.

Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding. The shape of the snout may correlate with tooth number and thus feeding mechanisms. The narwhal, with its blunt snout and reduced dentition, relies on suction feeding.|$|E
25|$|The {{habitat of}} the green heron is small {{wetlands}} in low-lying areas. The species is most conspicuous during dusk and dawn, and if anything these birds are nocturnal rather than diurnal, preferring to retreat to sheltered areas in daytime. They feed actively during the day, however, if hungry or provisioning young. Shore-living individuals adapt {{to the rhythm of}} the tides. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic arthropods, but may take any invertebrate or vertebrate prey they can catch, including such animals like leeches and mice. Green herons are intolerant of other birds – including conspecifics – when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. Sometimes they drop food, insects, or other small objects on the water's surface to attract fish, making them one of the few known tool-using species. This <b>feeding</b> <b>method</b> has led some to title the green and closely related striated heron as among the world's most intelligent birds. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the onset of full {{breastfeeding}} in preterm infants and with the possible influence of alternative <b>feeding</b> <b>methods</b> on breastfeeding in immature newborns. Based on the study of literature, research questions were identified to find out in which gestation week full breastfeeding is taking place in premature babies and to what extent alternative <b>feeding</b> <b>methods</b> affect the onset of full breastfeeding in premature babies. They also had to find out whether feeding the infant bottles actually leads to unsuccessful breastfeeding. Three objectives were set for the diploma thesis. The first was to find out in which gestational week full breastfeeding is taking place in premature babies, provided the mother has enough breast milk. The second goal investigated the extent to which alternative <b>feeding</b> <b>methods</b> affect early pregnancy, provided the mother has enough breast milk. The third objective was to find out whether feeding a baby bottle actually leads to unsuccessful breastfeeding. To achieve the objectives of my thesis, I chose qualitative research, which was done in two groups of respondents, namely preterm newborns and their mothers. For each group of respondents, I chose different research techniques. For research on premature newborns, I chose structured observation. In a research survey among mothers of preterm babies, I chose a semi-standardized interview...|$|R

50|$|Since {{breastfeeding}} studies are, {{for ethical}} reasons, never conducted as randomized controlled trials, critics have repeatedly suspected that studies may have produced {{the superiority of}} breastfeeding as an artifact. Both the physical, emotional and mental development of children and the preferences of women for a <b>feeding</b> <b>method</b> are strongly determined by socioeconomical {{factors such as the}} mother’s ethnicity, social class, and education.

A loophole from this problem was first presented by Cynthia G.
