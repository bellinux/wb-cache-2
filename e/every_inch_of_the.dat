The previous commander for the Iraq Area Command, Colonel Süleyman Askeri Bey, after the defeats of Qurna and Shaiba, had killed himself while recuperating from wounds. His successor was Colonel Nureddin. A veteran of the Balkan Wars, Nureddin was charged by Envers Pasha with defending <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baghdad vilayet with an eye towards to recapturing Basra.|$|E

Initially the transformations were made to follow the laws of physics, {{but it did not}} look {{exciting}} enough and was changed to be more fluid. Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters' faces, instead going for a [...] "Rubik's Cube" [...] style of modeling. He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather than like lumbering beasts. One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed. Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful.|$|E
500|$|California Chrome had {{a tumultuous}} four-year-old season. The horse began 2015 at Santa Anita in the San Antonio Stakes on February 7, a return matchup with Shared Belief, whose traffic {{problems}} in the Classic prevented a true match against California Chrome. Art Sherman and Shared Belief's trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, were longtime friends and rivals from the Northern California racing circuit, and each anticipated the rivalry between their two horses. Sherman said, [...] "I just want both of us {{to be at the}} head of the stretch with no excuses and then it's who gets to the wire first." [...] Shared Belief went off as the favorite, and although California Chrome took the lead by the [...] pole, Shared Belief edged him in the final sixteenth and won, with California Chrome second by a length and a half. [...] California Chrome next shipped to Meydan Racecourse for the Dubai World Cup on March 28, where he needed to run at night, under artificial lighting, and without Lasix. He went off as the favorite but finished second to the Irish-bred longshot Prince Bishop, owned by Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum of Godolphin Racing. Sherman noted that his horse ran wide on the turns but said, [...] "He tried <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. There's nothing wrong with finishing second in this type of a race." ...|$|E

Theoretically, <b>the</b> TF104 is an evolutionary step up from the TF103, but in fact, the TF104 shares not a single part that we used with the TF103.

500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{stage for}} the tour was {{described}} by Brian Levine, senior project manager from Tait Towers, as [...] "a game-changer for what can be achieved in a stadium touring environment. The entire collaboration from scenic, to structure, to mechanics was custom-made to create an epic experience for both Beyoncé and her fans". Designed by Es Devlin and engineered and built collaboratively by Stageco and Tait Towers, the tour's stage features a centrepiece of a revolving 60 foot tall box, made with video screen walls. Known as the 'Monolith', Devlin spoke on <b>the</b> box stating <b>of</b> [...] "wanting {{this to be the}} tallest object in the stadium, a piece of kinetic stadium architecture <b>the</b> equivalent <b>of</b> a seven-story, revolving LED building".

2500|$|Throughout the negotiations, {{it became}} clear that it was {{necessary}} for the current senior employees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles City Water Company to keep their jobs {{in order to ensure that}} the water system could continue to operate.

40|$|Abstract—In today’s {{competitive}} environment, {{the security}} concerns have grown tremendously. In the modern world, possession {{is known to}} be 9 / 10 ’ths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. Hence, it is imperative for one to be able to safeguard one’s property from worldly harms such as thefts, destruction of property, people with malicious intent etc. Due to <b>the</b> advent <b>of</b> technology in <b>the</b> modern world, the methodologies used by thieves and robbers for stealing have been improving exponentially. Therefore, it is necessary for the surveillance techniques to also improve with the changing world. With the improvement in mass media and various forms of communication, it is now possible to monitor and control the environment to <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. The latest technologies used in the fight against thefts and destruction are the video surveillance and monitoring. By using the technologies, it is possible to monitor and capture <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> and second <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area in interest. However, so far the technologies used are passive in nature, i. e., the monitoring systems only help in detecting the crime but do not actively participate in stopping or curbing the crime while it takes place. Therefore, we have developed a methodology to detect the motion in a video stream environment and this is an idea to ensure that the monitoring systems not only actively participate in stopping the crime, but do so while the crime is taking place. Hence, a system is used to detect any motion in a live streaming video and once motion has been detected in the live stream, the software will activate a warning system and capture the live streaming video...|$|R

2500|$|Davis and Wyler {{frequently}} fought during filming, {{about everything}} from her appearance (Wyler thought {{she looked like a}} Kabuki performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. [...] "It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun," [...] she later recalled. [...] "I was a nervous wreck {{due to the fact that}} my favorite and most admired director was fighting me <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the entire cost of the production." [...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Davis {{became the}} second woman to free climb El Capitan in one day. One year later, in October 2005, {{she became the}} first woman to free climb the Salathé Wall, on El Capitan, The route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and {{approximately}} [...] long. The difficulty of the climb can be described as [...] "spidering up the side of a skyscraper, climbing to [...] no bigger than lentils". What makes Davis' achievement even more impressive is that she free climbed the route, meaning that she used only her hands and feet to climb the rock; she did not hang off the rope or any other mechanical aids. Davis worked on the route throughout September, learning <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> climb and meeting Cybele Blood, who became her belayer. Davis had initially planned for the climb to take five days and had cached water and food along the route for that length of the time, but poor weather, high numbers of climbers on the route and difficult climbing made the climb take eleven days. In fact, Davis wore only light climbing shoes, climbing tights, long underwear, and a light wind jacket. The only other gear she had was climbing gear, a lightweight sleeping bag, a portable espresso maker, water and food. When the two ran low on food and water, Blood went looking for the cached supplies but couldn't find them, so Davis [...] "jugged" [...] to the top to get some water and then returned to the route to continue the free climb. This climb was Davis' [...] "dream come true" [...] and afterwards she said [...] "I don't have to prove anything to myself anymore, or to anyone else." ...|$|E
