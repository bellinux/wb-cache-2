5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{had four}} Curtiss-AEG main and two {{auxiliary}} turbo generators with each driving two <b>dynamos,</b> one each {{for alternating current}} and direct current. Each main generator was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had a capacity of 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system that combined alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.|$|E

5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven <b>dynamos</b> were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E

5000|$|The SV <b>Dynamo</b> {{was divided}} into fifteen {{regional}} units, corresponding to the fifteen districts of the German Democratic Republic.

5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of <b>dynamos,</b> depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on <b>dynamos,</b> and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E

The hotel was self-powered, generating its own electricity from <b>dynamos.</b> It was bought by Frederick Gordon in 1893, giving him a monopoly on all hotels on Northumberland Avenue.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>dynamo</b> {{mechanism}} {{driven by}} weak plasma turbulence, called the p-ω <b>dynamo,</b> is studied. Under {{the assumption of}} the uniform rotation of a celestial body, a <b>dynamo</b> equation {{is derived from the}} magnetic induction equation based on mean field electrodynamics. It is well known that differential rotation is indispensable for an α-ω <b>dynamo</b> to be operative. In contrast to the α-ω <b>dynamo</b> model, no matter if the rotation angular velocity is uniform or not, no matter in the absence or the presence of the convection, the p-ω <b>dynamo</b> is operative. The coupling between uniform rotation and plasma turbulence waves can also produce source terms in the <b>dynamo</b> equation which lead to the generation of a poloidal and toroidal field. The existence of differential rotation will evidently enhance the action of the p-ω <b>dynamo.</b> We present a complete uniformrotational solution of the <b>dynamo</b> equation here, and <b>dynamo</b> solutions for several types of differential rotation are given. Finally, we discuss the physical nature of these <b>dynamo</b> solutions in Sect. 5. Key words: magnetic fields – turbulence – plasmas – MH...|$|R
