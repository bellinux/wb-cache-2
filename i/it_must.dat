5|$|If the Community Committee {{accepts a}} {{community}} declaration, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> then refer the declaration {{to the appropriate}} Community Sub-Committee for consideration. If the Community Sub-Committee concludes that the declarant belongs to that community, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> issue a community certificate to the applicant. Otherwise, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> inform the declarant in writing that the application has been rejected. The decision must be communicated to the declarant no later than the eve of nomination day. All decisions of the Community Committee and its Sub-Committees are final, and a community certificate is conclusive of the matters it certifies– they {{are not subject to}} appeal or review in any court.|$|E

5|$|Since each prime p divides L by assumption, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> also divide {{one of the}} q factors; {{since each}} q is prime as well, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be that p=q. Iteratively {{dividing}} by the p factors shows that each p has an equal counterpart q; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order. The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs, as shown below.|$|E

5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the {{right-hand}} side, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> also divide the left-hand side, v. This result is known as Euclid's lemma. Specifically, if a prime number divides L, then <b>it</b> <b>must</b> divide at least one factor of L. Conversely, if a number w is coprime to each {{of a series of}} numbers a1, a2, …, a'n, then w is also coprime to their product, a1×a2×…×a'n.|$|E

5|$|When the Indian flag is {{displayed}} with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state {{that if the}} flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India {{should be in the}} middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be {{in front of the other}} poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be carried to the marching right of the procession.|$|E

Finally, when the flag is hung, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be hung against a vertical wall or other vertical flat surface, with the crescent and stars on the top left position as seen by any spectator facing the flag and the wall or surface.|$|E
5|$|While he was {{instrumental}} in the academic exploration of his techniques (he compiled two treatises: the later one in five volumes was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously), and was himself a master of music analysis, he considered the development and study of techniques a means to intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional ends. Thus Messiaen maintained that a musical composition must be measured against three separate criteria: <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be interesting, beautiful to listen to, and <b>it</b> <b>must</b> touch the listener.|$|E
5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: <b>It</b> <b>must</b> be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E

5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E
5|$|Although {{potentially}} fatal if eaten raw, Gyromitra esculenta {{is a popular}} delicacy in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the upper Great Lakes region of North America.
