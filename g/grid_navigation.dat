The algorithm benefits from searching in graphs with a much smaller number of cells, thus performing up to 7. 7 times faster than traditional A¿ over the initial NavMesh.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{reinforcement}} learning solutions to many problems artificially constrain the action set available to an agent, {{in order to}} limit the exploration/sample complexity. While exploring, if an agent can discover new actions that can break through the constraints of its basic/atomic action set, then {{the quality of the}} learned decision policy could improve. On the flipside, considering all possible non-atomic actions might explode the exploration complexity. We present a novel heuristic solution to this dilemma, and empirically evaluate it in <b>grid</b> <b>navigation</b> tasks. In particular, we show that both the solution quality and the sample complexity improve significantly when basic reinforcement learning is coupled with action discovery. Our approach relies on reducing the number of decision points, which is particularly suited for multiagent coordination learning, since agents tend to learn more easily with fewer coordination problems (CPs). To demonstrate this we extend action discovery to multi-agent reinforcement learning. We show that Joint Action Learners (JALs) indeed learn coordination policies of higher quality with lower sample complexity when coupled with action discovery, in a multi-agent box-pushing task.

The vector transformation hypothesis assumes that visuospatial transformation deficits in PD are a result of impairments in calculating vectors or co-ordinate remapping with a reference frame. These vector transformation processes were investigated in spatial normalisation during mental rotation and showed that PD patients demonstrate slower image normalisation rates indicative of a deficit compares with controls. It was then investigated how far these deficits extend to other vector transformation tasks such as abstract <b>grid</b> <b>navigation.</b> PD patients were less accurate than controls and these deficits were independent of spatial short term memory and serial processing suggesting that PD is associated with spatial transformation deficits. Comparisons of visual vector transformation and auditory vector transformation showed that PD patients were less accurate at visual vector transformation than auditory vector transformation suggesting that vector transformation processes may be more sensitive to the visual domain. The final study was a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of using a cognitive vector transformation task to remediate symptoms of bradykinesia in PD.

The aim {{of this study is to}} graft MSCs after a spinal cord compression injury in adult rat to assess their effect on functional recovery and to highlight their mechanisms of action.

40|$|Machine {{intelligence}} techniques {{contribute to}} solving real-world problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) {{is one of}} the machine intelligence techniques with several characteristics that make it suitable for the applications, for which the model of the environment is not available to the agent. In real-world applications, intelligent agents generally face a very large state space which limits the usability of reinforcement learning. The condition for convergence of reinforcement learning implies that each state-action pair must be visited infinite times, a condition which can be considered impossible to be satisfied in many practical situations. The goal of this work is to propose a class of new techniques to overcome this problem for off-policy, step-by-step (incremental) and model-free reinforcement learning with discrete state and action space. The focus of this research is using the design characteristics of RL agent to improve its performance regarding the running time while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy. One way of improving the performance of the intelligent agents is using the model of environment. In this work, a special type of knowledge about the agent actions is employed to improve its performance because in many applications the model of environment may only be known partially or not at all. The concept of opposition is employed in the framework of reinforcement learning to achieve this goal. One of the components of RL agent is the action. For each action we define its associate opposite action. The actions and opposite actions are implemented in the framework of reinforcement learning to update the value function resulting in a faster convergence. At the beginning of this research the concept of opposition is incorporated in the components of reinforcement learning, states, actions, and reinforcement signal which results in introduction of the oppositional target domain estimation algorithm, OTE. OTE reduces the search and navigation area and accelerates the speed of search for a target. The OTE algorithm is limited to the applications, in which the model of the environment is provided for the agent. Hence, further investigation is conducted to extend the concept of opposition to the model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. This extension contributes to the generating of several algorithms based on using the concept of opposition for Q(lambda) technique. The design of reinforcement learning agent depends on the application. The emphasize of this research is on the characteristics of the actions. Hence, the primary challenge of this work is design and incorporation of the opposite actions in the framework of RL agents. In this research, three different applications, namely <b>grid</b> <b>navigation,</b> elevator control problem, and image thresholding are implemented to address this challenge in context of different applications. The design challenges and some solutions to overcome the problems and improve the algorithms are also investigated. The opposition-based Q(lambda) algorithms are tested for the applications mentioned earlier. The general idea behind the opposition-based Q(lambda) algorithms is that in Q-value updating, the agent updates the value of an action in a given state. Hence, if the agent knows the value of opposite action then instead of one value, the agent can update two Q-values at the same time without taking its corresponding opposite action causing an explicit transition to opposite state. If the agent knows both values of action and its opposite action for a given state, then it can update two Q-values. This accelerates the learning process in general and the exploration phase in particular. Several algorithms are outlined in this work. The OQ(lambda) will be introduced to accelerate Q(lambda) algorithm in discrete state spaces. The NOQ(lambda) method is an extension of OQ(lambda) to operate in a broader range of non-deterministic environments. The update of the opposition trace in OQ(lambda) depends on the next state of the opposite action (which generally is not taken by the agent). This limits the usability of this technique to the deterministic environments because the next state should be known to the agent. NOQ(lambda) will be presented to update the opposition trace independent of knowing the next state for the opposite action. The results show the improvement of the performance in terms of running time for the proposed algorithms comparing to the standard Q(lambda) technique...|$|E

As a consequence, extreme space weather {{has been added}} to the UK and other national risk registers. By their very nature, extreme space weather events occur rarely and, therefore, statistical methods are required to determine the probability of their occurrence. Space weather events can be characterised by a number of natural phenomena such as X-ray (solar) flares, solar energetic particle (SEP) fluxes, coronal mass ejections and various geophysical indices (Dst, Kp, F 10. 7). In this paper extreme value theory (EVT) is used to investigate the probability of extreme solar flares. Previous work has assumed that the distribution of solar flares follows a power law. However such an approach can lead to a poor estimation of the return times of such events due to uncertainties in the tails of the probability distribution function. Using EVT and GOES X-ray flux data it is shown that the expected 150 -year return level is approximately an X 60 flare whilst a Carrington-like flare is a one in a 100 -year event.

One measure provided an index of transfer (i. e., better performance at test than at training when test and training involved different conditions), and the other provided an index of specificity (i. e., better performance at test when training and test conditions were the same than when training and test conditions were different). By and large, these two indices were complementary, so there was evidence of either transfer or specificity but not both. For one dimension transfer but no specificity was evident, and for another dimension specificity but no transfer was evident.
