500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worried</b> because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. I think at some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worried</b> that on virtually every topic he touches, he reaches conclusions {{radically different from}} almost everybody else. That {{seems to suggest that}} most scientists are wrong, short-sighted, naïve, interested only in securing research funds, or deliberately dancing to the campaigners' tune. Most I know are honest, intelligent and competent. So it beggars belief to suppose that Professor Lomborg is the only one in step, every single time." ...|$|E

60|$|But, Sir, I labour under a {{much greater}} difficulty, upon which I should be glad to hear your advice. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worried</b> on one side by the Whigs for being too severe, and by the Tories on the other for being too gentle. I have {{formerly}} hinted a complaint of this; but having lately received two peculiar letters, among many others, I thought nothing could better represent my condition, or the opinion which the warm men of both sides have of my conduct, than {{to send you a}} transcript of each. The former is exactly in these words.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} mercy," [...] said Mr. Vincy, testily. [...] "I know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worried</b> more than I like with my family. I {{was a good}} brother to you, Harriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn't always show that {{friendly}} spirit towards your family {{that might have been}} expected of him." [...] Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no accomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly. Harriet had to defend her husband instead of blaming her brother, and the conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent sparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worried</b> {{about this}} thing because, to confess the horrid truth, I wear a made-up tie myself. On foggy afternoons I steal {{out of the house}} disguised. They ask me where I am going in a hat that comes down over my ears, and why I am wearing blue {{spectacles}} and a false beard, but I will not tell them. I creep along the wall till I find a common hosier's shop, and then, in an assumed voice, I tell the man what it is I want. They come to fourpence halfpenny each; by taking the half-dozen I get them for a trifle less. They are put on in a moment, and, to my vulgar eye, look neat and tasteful.|$|E
50|$|It was scary. At one point, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the only}} rider on the team. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried.</b> <b>I</b> {{had lost a}} sponsor before and knew how it felt, but this time was different: it wasn’t about getting kicked off—it was that the company might fall apart.|$|R

2500|$|Campese further wrote that, [...] "In the World Cup {{match against}} South Africa, I kicked the ball {{three or four}} times when I could have run.

You see more of Mr. Weatherley now than any one of us. For that reason I was anxious to make a confidant of you. I tell you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>worried</b> about Mr. Weatherley. He is a rich man and a prosperous man. There is no reason why he should sit in his office and gaze into the fire and look out of the window as though the place were full of shadows and he hated the sight of them. Yet that is what he does nowadays, Chetwode. What does it mean? I ask you frankly. Haven't you noticed yourself that his behavior is peculiar?" ...|$|E
