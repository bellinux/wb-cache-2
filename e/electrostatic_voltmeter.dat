Results show that samples under a positive potential accumulate excess negative charges, which are dissipated when the potential is brought down to zero. Rates of charge accumulation and dissipation over the samples are equal under constant RH and both rates decrease markedly at lower RH values.

40|$|Charge {{build-up}} {{on walking}} Musca domestica was monitored {{in real time}} using an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>voltmeter</b> attached to an individual fly by a fine copper wire. Simultaneous video recording of behavioural movement was analysed by Inchworm (c). Charge accumulation by the fly moving on PVC was positive and directly proportional to distance walked; as a consequence the rate of charge accumulation was {{directly related to the}} walking speed. Plateauing (saturation) of charge was prevented from occurring due to the increased capacitance caused by the large amounts of conductive material attached to the flies and the short distances travelled. This technique also allowed the effect of small surface charges to be observed; a positively charged acetal surface caused a rapid positive charge increase relative to distance walked, while negative charges acted against the tribocharging and reduced rate of positive charge accumulation. This work provides important information about the relationship between insect behaviour and charge accumulation with implications for the development and design of novel control strategies utilising electrostatic powders to adhere to the charged surfaces of insects or other organisms...|$|E
40|$|Single Point Diamond Turning (SPDT) is a {{technology}} widely {{applied for the}} fabrication of contact lenses. One of the limiting factors in polymer machining is wear of the diamond tool due to electrostatic discharge resulting in poor surface quality of the machined products. The research work presented in this dissertation highlights the electrostatic properties of contact lenses during machining operations and the effects these properties have on the surface quality of the work piece materials. Two contact lens samples were experimented on, Definitive 74 (Silicone Hydrogel) and Tyro 97 (Rigid Gas Permeable).

40|$|With the {{continuous}} growth of non-linear power electronic components {{and the increasing}} penetration of the distributed generation (DG), the potential for degradation in the power quality of the existing grid exists. There are concerns that the total harmonic distortion (THD) could reach unacceptable levels of 5 % or higher. Moreover, there is additional potential {{of the presence of}} amplified harmonic components in the power network grid when the harmonic frequencies align with the resonant frequencies that are being injected by power electronic components of the DG. The above conditions could increase the electrical stresses on the insulation system of the power system components, and in particular, cable terminations are a concern. Standard cable terminations are designed to operate under power frequency in the power system network and their service life is considered accordingly. The research work aims to provide an understanding of the performance of the stress grading (SG) system of a commercial cable termination when the voltage waveform is distorted due to the presence of harmonics and when the high frequency and high dV/dt voltage waveforms are present from a typical power electronic drive. An aging experiment was performed for over a 600 hour time period using the pulse width modulated (PWM) high-voltage generator to quantify the impact of high frequency stress on SG system of cable termination. Furthermore, the cable termination was tested under power frequency, distorted voltage waveforms composed of fundamental and low order harmonics using an experiment setup that generate distorted voltage waveforms. Diagnostic techniques such as surface potential distribution measurements and surface temperature monitoring are used to analyze the termination performance. The surface tangential field is calculated based on the gradient of the termination surface potential as measured with an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>voltmeter.</b> The study shows that distorted voltage waveforms with high frequency and high dV/dt components, increase the electric field, resistive heating, and surface temperature rise in the terminations that use the field-dependent SG materials. The rise of electric field by as high as 27. 1 % and surface temperature rise of as high as 17 C demonstrates the severity on the cable terminations. Such electric field enhancements {{for a period of time}} have a potential to initiate partial discharge that could lead to degradation of the termination. Moreover, surface temperature rise of 17 deg C could reduce the allowable ampacity of the cable conductor, reduce the short circuit levels, and reduce the feeder loading limits. The field-dependent electrical conductivity (σ(E,T)), permittivity (ε), and the temperature dependencies of (σ(E,T) and ε) have strong impact to degrade the electrical and thermal properties of the termination due to stress from the non-sinusoidal distorted voltage waveform. In order to minimize the surface temperature rise from the hotspot and electrical stress enhancement that eventually lead to insulation degradation and failure, the following recommendations are made for a suitable SG design for a termination to handle the severe voltage stress: Apply the capacitively graded termination in the grid where the distortion levels are low. Under the increased total harmonic distortion levels and HF components, resistively grading with higher degree of nonlinearity (achieved through the use of ZnO filler) is beneficial. The utilities could take preventive maintenance on medium voltage power cable accessories to prevent the termination failure before it actually occurs. Researchers could focus to resolve and minimize the rising power quality issues when the distribution generations are operated, improve the power electronic converters, and provide cost-effective harmonic filter solutions for harmonic mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Trace {{explosive}} detection is {{the primary}} way for quick and easy sampling of various surfaces in a check-point environment, e. g. an airport. The swabs used for commercial explosive detectors, such as ion mobility spectrometers, are made of various materials. The difficulty in collection and analysis of explosive traces is that the swabs must be effective at adsorbing as well as desorbing materials, i. e. pickup from the surface and release into the detection device. This dichotomy results in a tradeoff for development of new swabs. Generally, desorption {{is considered to be}} the more desirable property; therefore, Teflon is one choice for commercial swabs. It would be ideal to develop a swab with both enhanced adsorption and desorption. One way to accomplish this is to apply an electrostatic charge to commercial swabs. This enhances their attraction to explosive particles, but once the swab is placed in the inlet of commercial detection instrument, the charge is dissipated, and desorption of the particles into the instrument proceeds as usual. ^ Methods of generating electrostatically charge swabs was determined; triboelectric charging vs corona charging was compared examining magnitude of the charge, reproducibility and stability, and effects of humidity. The magnitude of charge necessary for enhanced collection of particles was evaluated using an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>voltmeter</b> to measure charge and various means to measure particle pickup. Corona charging was determined to be more effective. Enhancement of collection was judged by comparing results of corona charging swabs to those achieved by contact swabbing. Two variables were examined: the analyte and the substrate from which the analyte is removed. The swab material was Nomex. In each case but three, collection of an analyte by an electrostatically enhanced swab outperformed the traditional contact swabbing. Evaluation was determined by a rigorous quantification by mass spectrometry of the analyte picked up by the swab and the analyte remaining on the substrate after swabbing. When analytical protocol was not amenable to a particular analyte or substrate a commercial explosive trace detection instrument was used. It was found that the substrate morphology played a bigger role in pickup of analyte than the particular analyte. ^ In order to eliminate biological warfare agents, both heat and halides are used. Ideally, these agents would be destroyed without dispersing them. The approach to create a polymeric-sprayable matrix would allow dispersion of an iodine-producing pyrotechnic, without dispersing the biological weapon, and when initiated would produce both heat and iodine gas. This matrix will provide iodine vapor and a long-lasting flame, not an explosion, to control dispersion of the threat. ^ A two-part foam was formulated based on polyurethane chemistry, i. e. a diisocyanate combined with polyol to produce a urethane linkage. Each component of the foam (e. g. isocyanate, polyol, catalyst, blowing agent, surfactant) was experimentally adjusted to achieve the best foam based on expansion, structural integrity, and cell uniformity. Since the polyol is the most adjustable component in the foam, an investigation of commercial and synthesized energetic polyols was performed. The structures of the energetic polyols were verified by LC-MS and FTIR and characterized for heat flow by DSC. Once the structures of the energetic polyols had been proven, it was formulated into a polyurethane foam which was characterized for heat of decomposition, by SDT, for heat of combustion by bomb calorimetry, and structurally by FTIR. Documenting heat flow with SDT helped to determine that the structural modification increased heat release and lowered ignition temperature compared to the standard polyurethane foam. The formulated polyurethane foam was then tested for expansion against increased solids loading. When optimal solids loading was determined (3 ̆e 70...|$|E
40|$|Pulse width {{modulation}} (PWM) {{voltage source}} converters (VSC) are {{one type of}} motor drives that have become popular because they enable precise control of speed and torque in medium voltage motors. However, these drives {{are known to have}} adverse effects on the insulation system particularly on conductive armour tape (CAT) and semi-conductive stress grading tape (SGT). These tapes, which are crucial components of the insulation system, control the surface electrical stresses in the stator slot and in the end portion of the form-wound coils outside the grounded stator. The material properties of CAT and SGT and the methods by which they are applied on form-wound motor coils are traditionally designed for power frequency, or a 60 Hz sinusoidal voltage. However, because of the high frequencies associated with the repetition rate and the fast rise time of the PWM pulses, elevated electrical and thermal stresses develop in these tapes, which can lead to premature insulation failure. Little research has been conducted with respect to understanding the mechanism of dielectric heating as a function of frequency and repetitive pulse characteristics. The material characterization of CAT and SGT is a vital part of an investigation of the performance of the stress relief system at high frequencies. In this study, the anisotropic dielectric properties of CAT and SGT have been measured in dc and ac and in low and high electric fields. The laboratory experiments for determining the material characteristics are discussed and the results analyzed. According to the ac space charge limited field (SCLF) theory, the maximum ac tangential component of the electric field in a nonlinear resistive SGT on medium voltage form-wound motor coils can be predicted from the field dependent electrical conductivity and the frequency. However, the SCLF theory cannot predict the total electric field (vector sum of the tangential and normal components) in the air adjacent {{to the surface of the}} tapes. Simulations of the electric field using a finite element method (FEM), is one of the best ways of finding the resultant electric field distribution in the air space adjacent to the SGT. However, prior to this study, researchers simplified the modelling of the stress relief system to avoid the convergence problems that develop due to the nonlinearity of the SGT conductivity as a function of the electric field, and also because of the geometry and dimensions of the tapes when their depths are orders of magnitude smaller than the other dimensions associated with form-wound coils. For modelling the stress grading (SG) system at power frequency and at the rated voltage, the dc isotropic conductivity of the SGT and CAT has also been extensively investigated. However, relatively little work has been done with respect to the ac electrical behaviour of these materials and dc modelling cannot reflect the effects of high-frequency stresses on the machine insulation. In this study, comprehensive transient FEM modelling has been developed in order to simulate the insulation system with nonlinear field dependent materials. The actual dimensions of the components are applied in the model, and the appropriate material parameters for the FEM simulations are extracted from the experimental test results. One crucial point that has not been considered in previous studies is the effect of the component of the electric field that is normal to the surface of the coil. In most studies, only the tangential component of the electric field is considered; however, in this study, both components and the resultant electric field are computed. The surface tangential field is calculated with reference to the gradient of the surface potential as measured with an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>voltmeter.</b> It is shown that this technique can provide a reasonable estimate for the tangential field along the SG system, but not without limitations, which are discussed in detail. Based on laboratory work and analytical analysis, this research has successfully determined the relationship between the thermal effect of the PWM voltage and the other repetitive fast pulses, such as square wave and impulse voltages. The influence of the pulse characteristics on the development of stresses has also thoroughly investigated, and the results are presented. A coupled electric and thermal model that incorporates the finite element method (FEM) is used as a means of studying thermal stresses and determining appropriate remedies. However, using transient analysis as an approach for finding the temperature profile associated with high repetitive impulses (1 - 10 kHz) and fast rise times (~ 200 ns) is both difficult and impractical. According to these considerations, an alternative method has been developed from stationary analyses based on two sinusoidal voltages of different frequencies. The frequency and amplitude of these sinusoids are measured relative to the switching frequency, signal power, and nonlinearity of the system, and the results of the simulation are then verified experimentally, thus showing the efficacy of this method. This research also concluded that a capacitive SG system with conductive foil embedded in the groundwall insulation can be a practical alternative to a conventional SGT of form-wound coils in inverter fed motors. The performance of the capacitive SG scheme is independent of frequency and can therefore provide the required mitigation of the stress caused by repetitive fast pulses. The results of the evaluation of this system with respect to qualification tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the system...|$|E
