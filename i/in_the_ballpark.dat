25|$|In 1908, due to {{the large}} amounts of people that {{attended}} Pirates games, team owner Barney Dreyfuss began looking for a location to construct a new Pirates stadium. The final Pirates game at Exposition Park was played against the Chicago Cubs on June 24, 1909. The Pirates won the game 8–1 in front of 5,545people, with George Gibson achieving the final National League hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> The very next day, the Pirates once again played the Cubs as the team opened Forbes Field.|$|E

25|$|On April 26, 2007, Sosa {{made history}} by hitting {{a home run}} in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ballpark</b> at Disney's Wide World of Sports, near Orlando, Florida, a usually minor-league and Spring {{training}} park that hosted a regular season series between the Rangers and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in May 2007, {{although he did not}} hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets.|$|E
25|$|But as the Phillies {{improved}} {{the quality of}} baseball life in Philadelphia, there was a simultaneous decline in {{the fortunes of the}} A's – in the team, in the owner, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> Mack had alienated many fans in 1915 and again in 1932 when he sold off his pennant-winning teams for cash, and his clashes with his neighbors over the spite fence, the night games and the 20th Street overhang sparked ill-will between the team and its most important asset: its fan base. The Phillies began to outdraw the A's, whose bottom-feeder status in the American League contributed to the vicious circle of bad teams and empty seats.|$|E
25|$|In baseball, a Chinese home run, also a Chinese homer, Harlem home run, or Pekinese poke, is a {{derogatory}} and archaic {{term for}} a hit that just barely clears the outfield fence at its closest distance to home plate, essentially the shortest home run possible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> in question, particularly if the park {{is known to have}} an atypically short fence to begin with. The term was most commonly used in reference to home runs hit along the right field foul line at the Polo Grounds, home of the New York Giants, where that distance was short even by contemporary standards. When the Giants moved to San Francisco in 1958, the Los Angeles Coliseum, temporary home of the newly relocated Los Angeles Dodgers, took over the reputation for four seasons until the team took up residence in its permanent home at Dodger Stadium in 1962. Following two seasons of use by the expansion New York Mets in the early 1960s, the Polo Grounds were demolished, and the term gradually dropped out of use.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the uniforms}} were {{supposed}} to debut {{with the opening of}} Miller Park, the Big Blue crane collapse in July 1999, which cost the lives of three workers and caused damage to the first base side of the stadium, delayed the opening of Miller Park for one year, so the uniforms actually debuted at Milwaukee County Stadium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark's</b> final year.|$|R
25|$|After {{stumbling}} out of {{the gates}} with a sub-.500 start in April, the Rangers took the division lead with a franchise-best month of June, going 21–6. The Rangers would never relinquish first place after an 11-game winning streak. On July 9, the club dealt one of its top prospects, Justin Smoak, with two other minor leaguers to the Seattle Mariners for former Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee and Mark Lowe. The Rangers also made moves to acquire veterans Bengie Molina, Jorge Cantú, Cristian Guzmán, and Jeff Francoeur. In the 2010 All-Star Game, the team was represented by Cliff Lee, Vladimir Guerrero, Ian Kinsler, Josh Hamilton, Elvis Andrus, and Neftalí Feliz. After the All-Star Game, came the debut of the claw and antler hand gestures, which gained much popularity, especially {{after the release of}} various apparel and souvenir options for the fans. Foam claws and helmets with deer antlers became quite commonplace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> as the Rangers played further into the fall. The Rangers won the A.L. West on September 25, advancing to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1999.|$|E
500|$|Clyde's {{unsuccessful}} career {{made him}} the [...] "poster-boy" [...] for bringing up young players. In his autobiography White Rat his first big league manager, future Baseball Hall of Famer [...] Whitey Herzog stated that he was often forced to leave Clyde in the game much longer than usual because fans {{wanted to see the}} 18-year-old [...] "phenom" [...] pitch. It led to Clyde's arm burning out at an early age, Herzog argued. In a 2003 interview with The New York Times, Herzog criticized Bob Short, stating that [...] "(Short) sure wasn't going to send him down without getting some people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> to see him. The kid should have gone to the minors after two starts." [...] He also said that Clyde [...] "was one of the best young left-handed pitchers I've ever seen." [...] Former teammate Tom Grieve said that keeping Clyde in the roster was the [...] "dumbest thing you could ever do to a high school pitcher." ...|$|E
500|$|In what {{proved to}} be one of the {{tightest}} ever pitching duels in a perfect game, Joss took the mound for the Naps, while the White Sox pitcher was future Hall of Famer Ed Walsh. Neither pitcher would give up an earned run in the 1–0 game. Walsh, blistering through his own 39 win season, struck out 15 batters, gave up only one base on balls and allowed only four scattered hits by the Naps. The Naps' Joe Birmingham scored the team's only run, which came in the third inningthe lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch. The tension <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> was described by one writer as [...] "a mouse working his way along the grandstand floor would have sounded like a shovel scraping over concrete." [...] Joss, having faced the minimum 24 batters in the first eight inning, retired the first two batters in the bottom of the ninth. [...] Joss then faced White Sox pinch hitter John Anderson. Anderson hit a line drive that could have resulted in a double had it not gone foul. He then hit a ball to Naps third baseman Bill Bradley, which Bradley bobbled before throwing to first baseman George Stovall. Stovall dug the ball out of the dirt to achieve the final out. With the win, Joss recorded the second ever perfect game in MLB's modern era. He accomplished the feat with just 74 pitches, the lowest known pitch count ever achieved in a perfect game. Fans swarmed the field. After the game, Joss said, [...] "I never could have done it without Larry Lajoie's and Stovall's fielding and without Birmingham's base running. Walsh was marvelous with his splitter, and we needed two lucky strikes to win." ...|$|E

25|$|The stadium, First Tennessee Park, {{was built}} on the former site of Sulphur Dell and {{replaced}} Herschel Greer Stadium, <b>the</b> Sounds' home <b>ballpark</b> since 1978. <b>The</b> stadium holds up to 10,000people, with 8,500 of that in fixed seating and <b>the</b> rest <b>in</b> open areas, such as a grass berm.

2500|$|Although Yankee Stadium {{has been}} praised for its amenities, {{it also has}} been widely criticized for high ticket prices. Seats within the first eight rows in the lower bowl, called the [...] "Legends Suite", are among the highest-priced tickets in {{professional}} sports. Tickets cost $510 on average; the most expensive tickets cost $2,600 each. Legends Suite Seats have been regularly empty, with many ticket holders in this section having given up their tickets, and others remaining unsold, despite most other seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> selling out. This has created an embarrassing image on television of the seats behind home plate being almost completely vacant. Consequently, a surplus of tickets for Legends Seats have emerged in the secondary market, and with supply exceeding demand, resale prices have dropped. Empty seats in the Legends Suite could even be seen during the 2009 playoffs, including World Series games. Even though all playoff games were sellouts, Legends Suite ticket holders were in the lounges and the restaurant underneath instead of their seats. Overall, the average ticket price is $63, the highest in baseball.|$|E

The upgrades were mainly based around increasing fan experience and comfort. The upgrades included an enlarged canopy soffit (the largest in baseball), protecting fans further from the elements despite the stadium not having a roof. The Twins also upgraded the scoreboard – the fourth-largest in Major League Baseball – from standard definition to a high definition display from Daktronics measuring [...] long and [...] high. [...] Other upgrades included warming shelters, changing [...] of the exterior surface to Kasota stone, and {{increasing the number of}} restrooms and concessions areas. The park features a modernized version of the original [...] "Minnie and Paul Shaking Hands" [...] logo used on the team's original uniforms from 1961 until 1986 (the logo has also been on the home uniforms since 2001). When a Twins player hits a home run, the Minnie and Paul sign lights up with strobe lights surrounding the Minnesota state outline and Minnie and Paul shake hands, akin to the Liberty Bell used at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. The original flagpole from Metropolitan Stadium – completely restored – is located on the right field plaza. The flagpole was located at the American Legion post in Richfield after the Metropolitan Stadium's closing, and was donated back to the Twins by the Legion as a gesture of goodwill.|$|E
