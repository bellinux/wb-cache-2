5000|$|The <b>forewaters</b> are {{released}} when the amnion ruptures. This is {{commonly known as}} the time when a woman's [...] "water breaks". When this occurs during labour at term, it is known as [...] "spontaneous rupture of membranes". If the rupture precedes labour at term, however, it is referred to as [...] "premature rupture of membranes". The majority of the hindwaters remain inside the womb until the baby is born. Artificial rupture of membrane (ARM), a manual rupture of the amniotic sac, can also be performed to release the fluid if the amnion has not spontaneously ruptured.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Predicting {{maturity}} of the foetal lung {{is extremely important}} in many obstetric situations as respiratory distress syndrome caused by surfactant deficiency {{remains one of the}} leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The need for predicting the foetal lung maturity by means of an accurate test which is done rapidly and available in majority of centres was the objective for this study. AIM To find out the optimum lamellar body count which correlates with foetal lung maturity and to compare the lamellar body count with shake bubble test. MATERIAL AND METHODS This prospective study was designed to evaluate the lamellar body count by standard haematology cell counter that is coulter counter and compare it with shake bubble test. Both the tests were done on 100 amniotic fluid samples in women with gestational age more than 28 weeks. Patients recruited were those who were sure of their last menstrual period (LMP), who were in active labour, and likely to deliver within 72 hours of collection of sample. Amniotic fluid samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis or by aspirating the <b>forewaters</b> per vaginum. Both shake bubble test and lamellar body count were done on the sample. RESULTS Lamellar body counts ranged from 10, 000 - 2, 43, 000 /microlitre and had a linear relationship with gestational age. The cut-off level of 30, 000 /microlitre was considered to be optimum to predict foetal lung maturity. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of lamellar body count at 30, 000 /microlitre and shake bubble test were comparable at 91. 7...|$|E
60|$|It was a Venetian scene. A splendid marble palazzio (so it {{said on the}} picture) {{stood in}} the foreground--or rather <b>forewater.</b> For the rest there were gondolas (with the lady {{trailing}} {{her hand in the}} water), clouds, sky, and chiaro-oscuro in plenty. No artist could fail to notice it.|$|R
40|$|In a {{group of}} 20 matched primigravid {{patients}} labour was induced by <b>forewater</b> amniotomy followed by intravenous oxytocin (Syntocinon) administered in escalating doses. Ten of these patients, in a double-blind trial, also received prostaglandin E 2 infused simultaneously with the oxytocin. In the combined prostaglandin-oxytocin group there was a noticeable reduction in the dosage of oxytocin required to produce effective uterine action, and the duration of labour was also reduced. No side effects were observed...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral pulses became impalpable {{following}} {{the administration of}} ergometrine during Caesarean section. The subsequent clinical course suggested sensitivity to ergometrine in a patient with Raynaud's disease. CASE REPORT A female Caucasian patient in her third pregnancy was booked, at 9 weeks of gestation, for hospital confinement. Her previous confinements were un-remarkable. Asthma, which had responded to desensitizing agents, wasnoted in her previous medical history. Her sensitivity to oxytocic drugs was not known. Pre-eclamptic toxaemia, noted at 34 weeks of gestation, responded to bed rest until 39 weeks of gestation when oedema precipitated a bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Antenatal glycosuria was present {{as a result of}} a reduced renal threshold. At 39 weeks of gestation, labour was induced by <b>forewater</b> amniotomy, and oxytocin (Syntocinon) was given to augment labour. Four hours following induction of labour, foetal bradycardia (40 beat/min) occurred. A prolapsed cord was confirmed and a Caesarean section was performed. Anaesthesia was induced with methohexitone 80 mg followed by suxamethonium 75 mg. Following endotracheal intubation, pancuronium 5 mg was given. Trichloroethylene 0. 4 % decreasing to 0. 2 % in 60 % nitrous oxide in oxygen was delivered from a Manley ventilator for the maintenance of anaesthesia. No narcotic analgesic was administered. At the commencement of anaesthesia the arterial pressure was 125 / 80 mm Hg and it settled at 110 / 75 mm Hg {{following the}} induction of anaesthesia. Ergometrine 0. 5 mg was administered i. v. following delivery of the child. Shortly afterwards, the peripheral arterial pulses were noted to be absent, although the carotid pulse remained palpable at 80 beat/min an...|$|R
