60|$|The {{suit was}} that of James, Fanny, Robert, and Thomas Harris, devisees of Thomas Harris, v. Mary Harris, relict and administratrix of James Harris, brother of Thomas, {{aforesaid}} (1798-99). Thomas Harris had four illegitimate children. He held, as he supposed, {{a piece of land}} in fee, but, in fact, he was only seized in tail. Thus he could not sell or devise it, and his brother James was <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail,</b> the children being bastards. These legal facts were unknown both to James and Thomas. Thomas made a will, leaving James his executor, and directing that the land should be sold, and the money divided among his own children. James, when Thomas died, sold the land, and, in drawing the conveyance, it was discovered that he had no right to do so for Thomas, as it was held by Thomas in tail. James then conveyed his right to the purchaser, and kept the money as legal heir. Why James could sell, if Thomas could not, the present writer is unable to explain. In two years, James died intestate, and the children of Thomas brought a suit against James's widow. Before James's death, the ghost of Thomas had appeared frequently to one Briggs, an old soldier in the Colonial Revolt, bidding James 'return the proceeds of the sale to the orphans' court, and when James heard of this from Briggs he did go to the orphans' court, and returned himself to the estate of his brother, to the amount of the purchase money of the land'.|$|E
50|$|He {{had married}} Margaret Dick, the <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> general to James Crichton, Viscount Frendraught, of Clan Crichton, {{who in turn}} was heir to Clan Makgill of Rankeilour. Through her the family came into the {{possession}} of the estates of Nether-Rankeillor. They {{had a number of}} children. The eldest son, Charles went on to inherit the estates on his father's death and assumed the surname Makgill. He married a woman named Mary Johnston and the union produced a son, David Maitland-Makgill-Crichton (1801-1851). This son had assumed the name Crichton in 1837, in recognition of his ancestor, James Crichton. He became a lawyer, and was called to the Scottish bar in 1822. He eventually played an important part {{in the formation of the}} Free Church of Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next-to-last}} <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> of Nieśwież and Ołyka was Karol Stanisław [...] "Panie Kochanku" [...] Radziwiłł, Voivode of Vilnius, son of Michał Kazimierz [...] "Rybeńko" [...] Radziwiłł. He {{had inherited}} huge estates {{from his father}} and uncle which made him the wealthiest magnate in Poland {{in the second half}} of the 18th century, and one of the richest men in Europe. He leased out the palace to Franciszek Ryx to house a theater which staged plays and threw masked balls. During the Four-Year Sejm of 1788-1792, he invited all the members of the four deliberating estates to dine there daily. Two meals were served every day: breakfast before the day's session, for 300 people, and dinner after the session. One of the most impressive feasts given by him was on St. Catherine's Day, November 25, 1789, the 25th anniversary of King Stanisław August's coronation, and commemorating the Union of Lithuania with the Polish Crown. Four thousand guests were invited, and the feast cost over 2 million złotys.|$|E

Dominik, {{who had been}} wounded at the Battle of Hanau, died heirless on November 11, 1813. The line of the Nieśwież-Ołyka <b>heirs</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> died out with him.|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of adopting adults, {{even if one}} has biological children, makes Japanese family firms unusually competitive. Our nearly population-wide panel of postwar listed nonfinancial firms shows inherited family firms more important in postwar Japan than generally realized, and also performing well – an unusual finding for a developed economy. Adopted heirs’ firms outperform blood heirs’ firms, and match or nearly match founder-run listed firms. Both adopted and blood heirs’ firms outperform non-family firms. Using family structure variables as instruments, we find adopted heirs “causing” elevated performance. These {{findings are consistent with}} adult adoptees displacing blood <b>heirs</b> <b>in</b> the left <b>tail</b> of the talent distribution, with the “adopted son” job motivating star managers, and with the threat of displacement inducing blood <b>heirs</b> to invest <b>in</b> human capital, mitigating the so-called “Carnegie conjecture” that inherited wealth deadens talent. ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the {{strategic}} importance of his lands, and their extensiveness, he was sought out by the Castle Administration in Dublin, who hoped to make him abandon the Gaelic Brehon laws and become a loyal subject of the crown. In an effort to secure his lands from other Ó Cellaighs, and to optain the protection of the crown, Seán made a submission of Surrender and regrant in 1578, acknowledging the rule of Elizabeth I. For this he was rewarded with the legal title to his impressive list of property. The Fiants list them as:all the manors and lands in Towyn alias Twunsrwra, Creagh, killynmalron, Behagh, Downe(lowe), Garwalle, Clonekyn, Balledonyllan, Tolrose, Keil, Garraf, Cowllery, Colleghcally, Cornesharrog, Lurce, Cillalachdan, Parklosnisker, Ballylough, and Belligh, Cos.

"in {{the reign}} of Ed. 4 ... the judges ... determined, that even a nominal and fictitious recompense, {{descending}} to the issue in tail, should be an effectual bar, {{not only to the}} issue in tail, but also to the persons entitled in remainder and reversion. This, though not expressly so decided, is the inference drawn from the determination of the judges in the celebrated case 12 Ed. 4, known as Taltarum's case. The case was thus:— J. S. being seised in fee of the lands in question, gave them to one William Smith, to hold to him, and the heirs of his body, by force of which he was seised. William Smith died, leaving Humphrey, his eldest son, on whom these lands descended, who entered and was seised [...] "per formam doni". Humphrey enfeoffed one Tregos of the said lands in fee, who rendered them to the said Humphrey and Jane, his wife, and to the heirs of their two bodies, remainder in fee to the said Humphrey, by force of which they were seised. Some time afterwards Jane died, on which Humphrey became sole seised of the lands in tail, and, being thus seised, one Taltarum brought a writ of right against Humphrey, and counted of his possession against him. Humphrey made defence, and vouched to warranty one R. King, who entered into the warranty, and joined the demise on the mere right. Afterwards R. King, the vouchee, made default, and departed in contempt of the court, in consequence of which final judgment was given, that the demandant, Taltarum, should recover the lands in question against Humphrey, and that Humphrey should recover lands of equal value of R. King, the vouchee. Humphrey afterwards died, without leaving heirs of his body; and the question was, whether Richard, the brother of Humphrey, who was <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> to those lands, should be barred by this recovery? It was determined by all the judges, that the estate tail was not barred by this recovery, because the tenant in tail was not seised of the estate tail {{at the time of the}} recovery, but of another estate; and as the recovery value goes according to the estate whereof the tenant was seised at the time of the recovery, and not in recompense of the estate he had not, the issue in tail could have no recompense in this case, and, therefore, was not barred by the recovery. It follows, therefore, that, if Humphrey had been seised of the estate tail of the gift of J. S. at the time of the recovery, Richard, who, be it observed, was tenant in tail in remainder, would have been barred" ...|$|E
