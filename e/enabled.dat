40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} on counterfactual thoughts about prevention suggests that {{people tend to}} focus on <b>enabling</b> rather than causing agents. However, research has also demonstrated that people have a preference for mutating controllable events. We explore whether counterfactual thinking about enablers is distinct from ‘undoing’ controllable events. We presented participants with scenarios in which a cause and an <b>enabler</b> contribute to a negative outcome. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups in which we systematically manipulated the controllability of the cause and the <b>enabler.</b> Participants generated counterfactuals which focused on the cause or the <b>enabler</b> and completed blame ratings for the cause and the <b>enabler.</b> The results indicate that participants had a preference for mutating the <b>enabling</b> relation, apart from in one condition where the cause was controllable and the <b>enabler</b> was uncontrollable. Participants tended to assign more blame to the cause than the <b>enabler,</b> regardless of controllability. The findings are discussed in the context of previous {{research on}} causal and counterfactual thinking. Ye...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} an <b>enabling</b> ideal is {{introduced}} so that an ideal I is strongly lifting {{if and only if}} it is lifting and <b>enabling.</b> These ideals are studied and their properties are described. It is shown that a left duo ring is an exchange ring if and only if every ideal is <b>enabling,</b> that Zhou’s δ-ideal is always <b>enabling,</b> and that the right singular ideal is <b>enabling</b> if and only if it is contained in the Jacobson radical. The notion of a weakly <b>enabling</b> left ideal is defined, and it is shown that a ring is an exchange ring if and only if every left ideal is weakly <b>enabling.</b> Two related conditions, interesting in themselves, are investigated: the first gives a new characterization of δ-small left ideals, and the second characterizes weakly <b>enabling</b> left ideals. As an application (which motivated the paper), let M be an I-semiregular left module where I is an <b>enabling</b> ideal. It is shown that m∈M is I-semiregular if and only if m−q∈IM for some regular element q of M and, as a consequence, that if M is countably generated and IM is δ-small in M, then M≅⊕i= 1 ∞Rei where ei 2 =ei∈R for each i...|$|R
