40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway tread braking is {{developed}} {{for use in}} routine calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Two-dimensional finite-element models of block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model {{can be used to}} efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can <b>handle</b> <b>stop</b> braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can be calculated. The inclusion of heat transfer from wheel to rail means that the model is useful for comparing brake rig tests, where normally the chilling influence from the rail is not included, with in-field tests. Two companion papers with experimental results supplement the present numerical modelling. A brief numerical example demonstrates the heat partitioning and the influence of rail chill (about 30 per cent) for two braking configurations...|$|E
40|$|Block braking is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several brake blocks are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of block braking has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with block braked wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the brake block material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used brake block material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of wheel roughness. The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an inertia dynamometer are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between brake block and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented. The tendency of cast iron brake blocks to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. Brake rig tests have been performed for drag braking at constant brake power for blocks made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials. Results on the influence of block configuration, brake power and brake speed on wheel and block temperatures are reported. Rolling contact heat transfer from wheel to rail is studied in the brake rig using a so-called rail-wheel in contact with the braked wheel, along with results from field tests. The model has been calibrated by using data from the experiments and can be employed to calculate temperatures and the heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperature for long brake cycles. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can <b>handle</b> <b>stop</b> braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can thus be calculated...|$|E

50|$|In 1931 {{a further}} {{down-grading}} of the MVR took place when the track at Butts Junction (the approach to Alton station) was re-laid. The signal box was removed and the MVR's direct {{connection with the}} Alton Line to London was removed, meaning that MVR trains now ran direct to a bay platform at Alton station. It also meant that trains could not run direct from the Alton Line to the Meon Valley {{as they had been}} able to- if this was required trains had to shunt from one line to the other. This change spelt the end of the MVR as an integrated part of the railway network- it was now simply <b>handling</b> <b>stopping</b> local traffic with none of the fast inter-city express traffic that the line was built to handle and that used the line in its early days.|$|R

Brembo calipers with six pistons per wheel in front and four pistons per wheel in back <b>handle</b> <b>stopping.</b> A duct system delivers air from the grille to the hard-working rotors. The 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels are fitted with second-generation Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar radials (285/35ZR-20 in front, 305/35ZR-20 in back). Damping is provided by Magnetic Ride Control units {{similar to those that}} Cadillac and Corvette have long used. This system can sense the need for a damping correction 1000 times per second and make that change in only five milliseconds. The Performance Traction Management (PTM) system was originally engineered for the Corvette C6 ZR1. In addition to modulating engine torque for optimum launch performance in manual-equipped ZL1s, PTM also varies the traction control and suspension damping as needed. The five available modes are for wet, dry, sport with or without stability control, and race-driving conditions.|$|R

5000|$|The clutch {{experiences}} {{most of its}} wear {{in first}} gear because moving the car from a standstill involves {{a great deal of}} friction at the clutch. When accelerating from a standstill on an incline, this problem is made worse because the amount of work needed to overcome the acceleration of gravity causes the clutch to heat up considerably more. For this reason, stop-and-go driving and hills tend to {{have an effect on the}} clutches to a certain degree.Automatic transmissions are better suited for these applications because they have a hydraulic torque converter which is externally cooled, unlike a clutch. Torque converters also do not have a friction material that rubs off over time like a clutch. Some automatics even lock the output shaft so that the car cannot roll backwards when beginning to accelerate up an incline. To reduce wear in these applications, some manual transmissions will have a very low, [...] "granny" [...] gear which provides the leverage to move the vehicle easily at very low speeds. This reduces wear at the clutch because the transmission requires less input torque. However, the issue of <b>handling</b> <b>stops</b> on hills is easy to learn.|$|R
