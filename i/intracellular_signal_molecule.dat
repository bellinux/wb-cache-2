Alarmones are produced in high concentrations when harsh environmental factors occur in bacteria and plants, such {{as lack of}} amino acids, to produce proteins. Stringent factors take uncharged tRNA and convert it to an alarmone. Guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) is then converted to 5´-diphosphate 3´-diphosphate guanosine (ppGpp), the archetypical alarmone. ppGpp will bind to RNA polymerase β and β´subunits, changing promoter preference. It will decrease rRNA and other genes transcription but will increase transcription of genes involved in amino acid biosyntheses and metabolisms involved in famine.|$|E

However, the degree of up-regulation observed was variable, which may reflect variable levels of daily physical activities among the mice. To investigate whether or not exercise affects dystrophic features and activates <b>intracellular</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>molecules</b> in mdx hearts, we subjected mdx and C 57 BL/ 10 mice to treadmill exercise and examined <b>intracellular</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>molecules</b> in cardiac muscles, at the protein level.

Histopathology in exercised mdx hearts showed extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells, together with increases in interstitial fibrosis and adipose tissues, all of which were not observed either in exercised C 57 BL/ 10 or non-exercised mdx hearts. Phosphorylated p 38 MAPK, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 and calcineurin, but not phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, were up-regulated in exercised mdx hearts compared to exercised C 57 BL/ 10 or non-exercised mdx hearts.

Here, we performed high-speed imaging of flagellar motor rotation and show that the switching of two different motors on a cell is controlled coordinatedly by an intracellular signal protein, phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P). The switching is highly coordinated with a subsecond delay between motors in clear correlation with the distance of each motor from the chemoreceptor patch localized at a cell pole, which would be explained by the diffusive motion of CheY-P molecules in the cell. The coordinated switching becomes disordered by the expression of a constitutively active CheY mutant that mimics the CW-rotation stimulating function. The coordinated switching requires CheZ, which is the phosphatase for CheY-P. Our results suggest that a transient increase and decrease in the concentration of CheY-P caused by a spontaneous burst of its production by the chemoreceptor patch followed by its dephosphorylation by CheZ, which is probably a wavelike propagation in a subsecond timescale, triggers and regulates the coordinated switching of flagellar motors...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} and {{the expression of}} differentiated functions are {{generally considered to be}} mutually exclusive states of the cell. Thyrotrophin activates the expression of differentiated functions in dog thyroid cells by means of cyclic AMP. We have recently shown that thyrotrophin also acts through the same <b>intracellular</b> <b>signal</b> <b>molecule</b> to enhance proliferation of dog thyroid cells in primary cultures. In this work we showed that such primary cultures exhibit three successive phases: a latency period during which the expression of differentiated functions (iodide trapping and organification) declined, the cells still being associated with structures derived from the seeded follicles; a cell-proliferation phase with little expression of these functions, the cells being spread in a monolayer; a stationary phase with cell density reaching a plateau but no re-expression of the functions. Thyrotrophin promoted proliferation during the multiplication phase, but induced redifferentiation during the stationary phase. These effects were mimicked by cholera toxin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which suggested that they were mediated by cyclic AMP. Iodide uptake was also stimulated by cortisol. Thyrotrophin therefore has a different action in dog thyroid cells depending {{on the state of the}} cells. The spontaneous arrest of multiplication appears to make the cells competent to respond to thyrotrophin by the induction of redifferentiation. Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

We have recently cloned the cDNA coding for a highly specific mammalian 25 -kDa thiamine triphosphatase. The enzyme was active in all mammalian species studied except pig, although the corresponding mRNA was present. In order {{to determine whether the}} very low ThTPase activity in pig tissues is due to the absence of the protein or to a lack of catalytic efficiency, we expressed human and pig ThTPase in E. coli as GST fusion proteins. The purified recombinant pig GST-ThTPase was found to be 2 - 3 orders of magnitude less active than human GST-ThTPase. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that, in particular, the change of Glu 85 to lysine is responsible for decreased solubility and catalytic activity of the pig enzyme. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a distribution of the protein in pig brain very similar to the one reported in rodent brain. Thus, our results suggest that a 25 -kDa protein homologous to hThTPase but practically devoid of enzyme activity is expressed in pig tissues. This raises the possibility that this protein may play a physiological role other than ThTP hydrolysis. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Cell surface receptors use {{a variety}} of {{membrane}} signalling mechanisms to translate information encoded in neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors into cellular responses. Collectively these mechanisms are refered to as transmembrane signalling or signal transduction. In the simplest example,the process involves a receptor protein-encompassed ion channel whose conductance is regulated by receptor activation. A second type of transmembrane signalling system involves the coupling of at least three separate components, a receptor protein, a guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), and an effector mechanism. In some receptor&quot; effector systems the signal transduction pathways is entirely confined to the membrane, in which no intracellular messenger is involved. Alternatively, the activity of an enzyme may be changed to generate a specific <b>intracellular</b> <b>signal</b> <b>molecule</b> or second messenger. Receptors in this latter category may regulate the activity of adenylyl cyclase in a positive manner through a stimulatory G protein(G) or in a negative manner through an inhibitory G protein(G.) thereby controlling the intracellular level of cAMP. Another membrane- associated enzyme, similar to adenylate cyclase, is phospholipase C which catalizes the hydrolysis of PIP 2 into IP 3 and DAG. Phospholipase C coupled receptors are physiologically very important because both products of the reaction act as a second messenger; diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C and IP 3 stimulates calcium release from Intracellular stores...|$|E

Mood stabilisers offer patients both {{acute and}} prophylactic treatment, and experimentally, they provide a means to probe the underlying biology of the disorder. Lithium and other mood stabilisers deplete intracellular inositol {{and it has been}} proposed that bipolar mood disorder arises from aberrant inositol (1, 4, 5) -trisphosphate [IP 3, also known as Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3] signalling. However, there is no definitive evidence to support this or any other proposed target; a problem exacerbated by a lack of good cellular models. Phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) -trisphosphate [PIP 3, also known as PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3] is a prominent <b>intracellular</b> <b>signal</b> <b>molecule</b> within the central nervous system (CNS) that regulates neuronal survival, connectivity and synaptic function. By using the genetically tractable organism Dictyostelium, we show that lithium suppresses PIP 3 -mediated signalling. These effects extend to the human neutrophil cell line HL 60. Mechanistically, we show that lithium attenuates phosphoinositide synthesis and that its effects can be reversed by overexpression of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), consistent with the inositol-depletion hypothesis. These results demonstrate a lithium target that is compatible with our current knowledge of the genetic predisposition for bipolar disorder. They also suggest that lithium therapy might be beneficial for other diseases caused by elevated PIP 3 signalling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{intention}} {{of this study}} was to identify and characterize signal pathways of the mesenchymal stem cell line hMSC-TERT which are being influenced by different mediators of inflammation. The purpose was also to characterize the effect of such pathways on the wnt-pathway. The wnt-pathway seems to be central in the understanding of regulated differentiation and proliferation in stem cells. The primary goal was to investigate and establish molecular biological methods that could be used in the study of these pathways in hMSC-TERT. Transient transfection of plasmids overexpressing selected mutants and constructs was one of the considered methods. The second method investigated was targeted gene silencing of signal proteins by the use of RNAi and siRNA. It was obtained an increased expression of the signal protein Raf- 1 and the mutant Raf- 1 S 43 A as a result of electroporation by use of a commercial kit delivered by Amaxa Biosystems (USA). An optimized siRNA-transfection method with use of the cationic lipid DOTAP was established. By use of this method it was obtained a reduced synthesis of the signal proteins Akt 1 /PKBá, Raf- 1 and the PKA catalytic units á and â. hMSC-TERT transfected with Raf- 1 siRNA or PKA catalytic unit á and â (PKAc siRNA), where stimulated by the two inflammatory substances PGE 2 and adenosin. PGE 2 and adenosin affects G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). As a result of these affections there have been obtained an increased intracellular cyclic AMP synthesis level in hMSC-TERT. Less synthesis of cAMP was obtained in cells stimulated with adenosin than cells stimulated with PGE 2. cAMP is an <b>intracellular</b> <b>signal</b> <b>molecule</b> that activates PKA. It was obtained a reduced phosphorylation of an inhibitory phosphorylation site of the wnt-pathway signal protein GSK 3 â in PKAc siRNA knockdown cells. This result insinuates that GSK 3 â is being negatively regulated by an active PKA. No altered phosphorylation patterns where obtained of a presumed activating phosphorylation site of the signal protein Akt/PKB in PKAc siRNA knockdown cells. This result implies that PKA is not activating Akt/PKB. PKA is inhibiting the MAP 3 -kinase Raf- 1 by phosphorylating an inhibitory phosphorylation site and activated Raf- 1 leads to phosphorylation of the further downstream MAP-kinase ERK 1 / 2. Both adenosin and PGE 2 resulted in dephosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 among cells not transfected with siRNA. These forthcoming results appeared when Raf- 1 or PKAc siRNA transfected cells where stimulated with adenosin or PGE 2. In general, adenosin seems to be mediating its effect on ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation through PKA. PGE 2 may mediate two parallel inhibitory mechanisms that results in dephosphorylated ERK 1 / 2, through PKA and maybe by an unknown mechanism. During the work with the PKA catalytic unit á siRNA it was obtained reduced expression of a protein that could be a new isoform of PKAc á with the molecular weight ~ 37 kD.

40|$|Calcium is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} <b>intracellular</b> <b>signal</b> <b>molecule</b> that can regulate numerous different cellular functions. In filamentous fungi there is evidence for it being involved in regulating various processes, including spore germination, hyphal tip growth, hyphal branching and conidiation. During colony initiation in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, conidia form germ tubes which are involved in colony establishment, and conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs) which are involved in generating fused networks of conidial germlings. The primary research aim of this thesis was to analyze the role of Ca 2 +-signalling and homeostasis during colony initiation in N. crassa. Removal of Ca 2 + from the growth medium showed that external Ca 2 + was necessary for CAT fusion and, more specifically, was required for CAT chemoattraction. Two L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) with different modes of action were found to inhibit both conidial germination and CAT fusion in wild type strains and CAT fusion was shown {{to be more sensitive}} to these two drugs. These channel blockers were additionally found to inhibit Ca 2 + uptake by conidial germlings of the wild type expressing the aequorin Ca 2 + reporter. However, the channel blockers also, unexpectedly, raised the cytosolic free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]c) resting level in these germlings suggesting that they did not just inhibit L-type Ca 2 + activity. The morphological phenotypes (conidial germination, hyphal extension rate, conidiation and hyphal branching) of 22 mutants defective in different components of their Ca 2 +-signalling and homeostasis machinery were characterized in order to identify their possible roles of Ca 2 + during colony initiation and development. The ∆cch- 1 mutant lacking the CCH- 1 L-type Ca 2 + channel gene exhibited a reduction in CAT fusion. CAT fusion was decreased even further in a double mutant (∆cch- 1 ∆mid- 1) suggesting that that the CCH- 1 and MID- 1 proteins operate in combination during this process. Increased extracellular Ca 2 + partially restored the phenotypes of the ∆cch- 1, ∆mid- 1 smco- 1 and ∆cch- 1 ∆mid- 1 mutants which is consistent with CCH- 1 and MID- 1 being involved in Ca 2 + uptake from the external medium. Calcium signatures following mechanical perturbation were successfully measured in populations of conidial germlings using aequorin expressed in the wild type and in deletion mutants (∆cch- 1, ∆yvc- 1, ∆fig- 1) lacking different Ca 2 + channels. The removal of external Ca 2 + completely abolished the [Ca 2 +]c increase in response to mechanical perturbation and CCH- 1 was found to partly contribute to this increase in [Ca 2 +]c. Various Ca 2 +-sensitive dyes (Oregon green 488, Fluo- 4 and Calcium Green- 1) were also tested to determine if they can be used to image [Ca 2 +]c at the single cell and subcellular levels. Only Fluo- 4 allowed the measurement of [Ca 2 +]c in individual cells but the changes in dye fluorescence in response to changes in [Ca 2 +]c were too small to be useful for imaging [Ca 2 +]c dynamics at the subcellular level. The other two dyes underwent rapid compartmentalization in organelles when loaded into germlings. The plant antifungal proteins (defensins), MsDef 1, MtDef 4 and PAF were all found to disrupt Ca 2 + signaling/homeostasis in conidial germlings of N. crassa. They all inhibited the [Ca 2 +]c increase and raised the resting level of [Ca 2 +]c in response to mechanical perturbation. Analysis of an aequorin expressing mutant that was defective in glucosylceramide synthase (∆gcs) showed that the effects of MsDef 1 (but not MtDef 4) on [Ca 2 +]c were mediated by the sphingolipid glucosylceramide. All of the defensins tested were found to exhibit different potencies with regard to their inhibitory effects on conidial germination and CAT fusion...|$|E
