Potential concepts, including Tension Leg Platform (TLP), Spar and semi-submersible can be selected as the FCFs. This paper discusses the philosophy of concept selection for FCFs. Two basic considerations for concept selection for FCFs are functional requirements and costs. Different structure types are first to be sized to meet the functional requirements for given water depths, environmental conditions and soil conditions. Then the costs for the procurement, construction, installation, hook up and commissioning for different concepts are estimated based on the sizes. Finally, the most cost-effective concept is chosen for further study to confirm the feasibilities of the concept by detailed analyses. Global sizing tools assisting concept selection have been developed by Ocean Dynamics LLC (Limited Liability Company) (ODL) over the past years. For a given concept, these sizing tools can find the optimized size based on costs to meet the functional requirements. Capabilities of the sizing tools cover the general layout, weight estimate (hull and deck), riser weight and stiffness estimate, loading conditions (transportation, normal operating, extreme, survival), <b>hydrostatics</b> and <b>stability,</b> natural periods, motions, air gap, environmental loads (wind, current, and mean wave forces), mooring sizing, cost estimate, and optimization based on the total costs.

40|$|In fish, the {{relative}} amount of tissues of different densities changes significantly over short periods throughout the year, {{depending on the}} availability of food, nutrition and their developmental status, such as sexual maturation. If a land-living animal accumulates fat it influences not only its general state of health, but also markedly increases its energy expenditure for locomotion owing to the force of gravity. On a body submerged in water, this force, which acts on the centre of gravity (COG), is counterbalanced by a lifting force that is negligible in air and which acts on the centre of buoyancy (COB). Any difference in the longitudinal positions of the two centres will therefore result in pitching moments that must be counteracted by body or fin movements. The displacement of the COG away from the COB is a result of tissues of different density (e. g. bones and fat) not being distributed homogeneously along the body axis. Moreover, the proportions of tissues of different densities change significantly with feeding status. It is still unknown whether these changes produce a displacement of the COG and thus affect the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stability</b> of fish. Analysis of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging images of Atlantic herring, Atlantic salmon and Atlantic mackerel reveals that the COG is fairly constant in each species, although we recorded major interspecies differences in {{the relative}} amount of fat, muscle and bone. We conclude that the distribution of different tissues along the body axis is very closely adjusted to the swimming mode of the fish by keeping the COG constant, independent of the body fat status, and that fish can cope with large variations in energy intake without jeopardizing their COG and thus their swimming performance...|$|E
40|$|Ship's {{lines are}} {{designed}} {{such that they}} are fair. To the naval architect, fairness means that the lines exhibit a continuous second derivative. This {{is the definition of}} a spline. Before the advent of digital computers, naval architects checked every line on a lines plan for fairness by bending a thin stick of wood, called a batten, on the line. If the line followed the natural bend of the batten, the line was fair. This phenomenon follows from the beam equation, which shows that the minimum energy in the beam occurs when the beam has a continuous second derivative of position. Hydrostatics {{lies at the heart of}} naval architecture. The hydrostatic properties of a hull are determined by the lines and their interpretation using rules of integration. The resulting analysis is presented in the form of graphs, termed the "curves of form" or "displacement and other curves. " An intact stability analysis follows naturally from the hydrostatic analysis. Hydrostatics (determination of KM) coupled with a KG value can be used to predict initial stability. This intact stability analysis evaluates the range of stability at both small and large angles of inclination. The responses of the hull to static and dynamic loading situations can be inferred from the curves of form. Their most basic use is to determine the static waterline in various loading scenarios. A more subtle use is to determine the correct placement of the vertical center of gravity to ensure a sea kindly roll period, stability in beam winds, and stability in high speed turns.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the interaction of}} mass loss and rotation during core hydrogen burning in massive stars. We compute their main sequence evolution assuming rigid rotation, and carry angular momentum as a passive quantity in the stellar interior but incorporate {{its effect on the}} stellar mass loss rate. We consider the example of a 60 M ⊙ star assuming various initial rotation rates. We show that rotation may substantially enhance the total main sequence mass loss of massive stars. Furthermore, we argue that the surface layers of rotating massive main sequence stars may reach the limit of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stability</b> (“Ω-limit”) by achieving a considerable fraction of their Eddington luminosity. We show that this process is not catastrophic for the star, but rather that the coupling of mass and angular momentum loss limits the mass loss rate ˙MΩ of main sequence stars at the Ω-limit. ˙MΩ is determined through the angular momentum loss imposed by the Ω-limit rather than by atomic physics. For our 60 M ⊙ sequences, it is ˙MΩ ≃ 10 − 5 M ⊙ yr− 1. We find a convergence of the rotational velocities of main sequence stars of a given initial mass at the Ω-limit, but a strong dependance of their mass at core hydrogen exhaustion from the initial rotation rate. Since then also the post-main sequence evolution depends on the initial amount of angular momentum, we argue that this is a third independent initial parameter for the evolution of massive stars, as important as initial mass and metallicity. We briefly discuss observable consequences of the coupling of mass and angular momentum loss, e. g. a significant decline of the projected rotational velocity v sin i towards the cool end of the main sequence, a period of strongly enhanced and aspherical mass loss, disks or rings in the equatorial plane of the star reminiscent of B[e]-stars, and highly bipolar circumstellar structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{shipping}} industry constantly {{strives to}} improve – allowing productivity and sustainability to be tapped {{in the best}} possible way. The concept of sail-assisted propulsion of modern ships is a major step in that direction. It basically adds the natural advantage of direction-dependent wind force to the conventional primary drive {{in the form of a}} diesel engine. The idea of using sails and natural wind as a means of transport is richly derived from maritime history. An effective combination with modern technology would massively help in economic ship transportation with largely reduced carbon footprints. This thesis is a step closer to that goal. The focus here is to describe the added wave resistance acting on a sail-assisted ship model, Ecoliner. There are two major technical aspects to this general situation: 1) description of the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stability</b> and response of sails to winds 2) the hydrodynamic investigation of loads effects on the hull Point 2 is the obvious focus of attention in this work. This thesis is a follow-up of an experiment done at TU Delft, November 2013 to determine the influence of heel and leeway on added wave resistance on the said ship model. Diffraction method based numerical analyses have been carried out to establish the added resistance for three different ship heel angles and three leeway angles over two different sailing speeds. Validation of the performed experiment is done as well as new findings regarding the sensitivity of the model variables are reported. The highest leeway angle of 9 degrees, in particular, is seen to have a significant effect in the increasing the added resistance. This effect was previously not captured by experiments and helps give an overview on which parameters the Ecoliner ship’s performance is more sensitive to. Effect of constraining or allowing roll is also found to be an especially important parameter. The margin of difference between analysis and experiment results improves by about 20 to 25 % after a proper analysis of roll hydrodynamics and putting that factor in. This work will hopefully be a stepping stone in further research endeavours in this field concerning optimizing Ecoliner as an end market product. Recommendations are given in this report for specific follow-up work in both the analytical as well as the experimental domain for the hull-related study...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} idea of flying {{machines}} that could land and take off from water (seaplanes) was invented in 1910, {{a huge amount of}} research was poured into it until it stagnated in 1950. Their performance did not grow according to current aircraft requirements. The idea of designing advance seaplane concepts stopped, and most seaplanes existing these days are approaching their final operating life. The purpose of this research project was to introduce a new seaplane concept design methodology that will suffice the necessities of actual aircraft designers. This concept design replaces old sizing methods proposed with a more efficient methodology based on modern aircraft design methods. The sizing method developed gives the designer a “freedom” in creating an “out of the box” seaplane concept. The optimization method was elaborated in such a manner that the designer can use certain types of aircraft configuration (Conventional, Blended Wing Body, and Flying Wing). The sizing method simplified the design by calculating the most advanced floating device for this seaplane concept. Old seaplane information was blended with modern aircraft and modern ship design information, creating a new preliminary seaplane concept design. Another advantage of this design method is the idea to convert existing landplane into a seaplane by adding the floating device that meets the necessary requirements of the seaplane conversion. The second part of the research was to address technical solutions to the actual seaplane design. For example, adding a trimaran configuration that increased the hydrodynamic performance and the use of a retractable float system that reduced aerodynamic drag during flight. Final results were elaborated to compare the use of trimaran with other types of floating devices. The final results showed the trimaran concept gave an excellent <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>stability,</b> a greater water speed, and retracting the floats decreased the aerodynamic drag, hence better flight performance. Aircraft design has been affected by actual economical difficulties showing no radical progress in this field of study. The next purpose of the research was to explore more radical, environmentally efficient, and innovative technologies. With the aid of the proposed sizing methodology for a modern and futuristic seaplane, a new vision was created called: 2050 Visionary Aeronautical Design Concept. Based on this vision the creation of an advance “out of the box” amphibian aircraft was elaborated. The project analyzed technical solutions, and a conceptual design concept for the creation of this 2050 amphibian aircraft. The preliminary design development leads to the creation of an Advance Amphibian Blended Body Wing Aircraft (AABWBA). AABWBA excels in air performance due to the high results generated by the Blended Wing Body (BWB) Aircraft. Adopting modern turbofan engines instead of turboprop engines gave the AABWBA better water takeoff capability, as well as air performance. Modern ideas for 2050 vision are the creation of futuristic seaports in order to increase seaplane traffic, public and commercial awareness, and expand market schemes. A design analysis was performed to show a model representation of this advance seaplane design. A Computer Aided Design (CAD) model was elaborated to calculate the dimensions, observe the mechanism of the retractable floats, and show the location of the boat hull. With the aid of this CAD model, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed to show the structural strength and impact of the hull and floats when landing on water. Finally, with the aid of this model, a hydrostatic analysis of the seaplane was conducted to show the water stability, and heel turns to observe the performance of the trimaran and the retractable floats when the seaplane is being operated in water. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a column {{stabilized}} semi-submersible drilling platform is analyzed. The {{purpose is to}} improve the column design of a generic 4 -column semi-submersible with regard to the outer shape, including the general arrangement and layout of the compartments. The aim of this thesis is to decrease the unit’s complexity, increase the draught flexibility and reduce the total weight of the column. The report takes into account the multiple functions and features of a column design including establishing of the governing design factors. Based on these criteria and together with the rules and regulations relating to offshore operations, a design concept is selected for further evaluation. During the work frequent interaction with the affected design disciplines is carried out involving structural analysis, stability, weight management and systems and arrangement. Through this it can be verified whether the concept design was complying with the criteria requirements. Compartment volumes, system capacities and stability calculations are carried out using excel spread sheets. Structural strength assessment is carried out by using DNV PULS and GVA in-house created spreadsheet and input to this assessment is obtained by using a FE-model created in Genie. The investigation led to the choice of a circular & flat sided column shell with benefits to the structural integrity and hydrodynamic properties. A new larger trunk was established containing staircase, lift, routings, reserve/storage tanks and all equipment. In addition, the new compartment arrangement enables the catering for two horizontal cross bracings, transverse between the columns. The amount of compartments in need of regular personnel access was decreased which resulted in less watertight closures and dedicated supply ducts, thus reducing the inner column complexity. The new column design indicated an improvement to the unit’s draught flexibility, however not all stability requirement were met. In order to verify this it is suggested that a more detailed analysis is carried out involving the use of commercial <b>hydrostatic</b> and <b>stability</b> software. The changes in general arrangement and structural design led to an estimated total weight reduction between 6. 2 % and 8. 3 % with regard to the reference design. The results from the structural analysis indicated that further investigation can lead to more weight reduction, with regard to the safety factors against buckling and yield. However some assumptions regarding the input data involving the global stresses may turn out to increase the structural weight, once more accurate data is obtained...|$|R
