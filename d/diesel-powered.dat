5|$|This Peugeot-developed {{turbodiesel}} {{was primarily}} {{used in the}} Peugeot 505 and 604. The <b>diesel-powered</b> version of the Tagora was designated DT.|$|E
5|$|Il-6 – bomber with M-90 engines - {{projected}} variant with M-90 engines, production drawings {{were issued}} but nothing further was heard of it, presumably as all effort {{was focused on}} the <b>diesel-powered</b> version.|$|E
5|$|Metrolink has one Special Purpose Vehicle from 1991. Numbered 1027 {{with its}} support wagon 1028, it is a bespoke <b>diesel-powered</b> vehicle with a crane, {{inspection}} platform, mobile workshop, and capacity for a driver and three passengers. It {{was designed to}} assist with vehicle recovery and track and line repairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{the city}} council changed their {{decision}} to close down the tramway. The main reason was the 1973 oil crisis, which had made it cheaper to run hydroelectric-powered trams than <b>diesel-powered</b> buses. After no investment on the tramway for seventeen years, new stock had to be bought, and Oslo Sporveier opted to buy seven used M-23 units from the Gothenburg Tramway in Sweden. In addition, twenty-five SL79 articulated trams were delivered in 1982 and 1983, followed by a further fifteen in 1989 and 1990. Oslo Sporveier merged with Holmenkolbanen in 1991, and with Ekebergbanen in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (RTA) {{operates}} public bus {{routes in}} the Dayton metro area. In addition to routes covered by traditional <b>diesel-powered</b> buses, RTA {{has a number}} of electric trolley bus routes. The Dayton trolleybus system is the second longest-running of the six remaining trolleybus systems in the U.S., having entered service in 1933. It is the present manifestation of an electric transit service that has operated continuously in Dayton since 1888.|$|E
5|$|The Pioneer Zephyr is a <b>diesel-powered</b> {{railroad}} train formed {{of railroad}} cars permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies, {{built by the}} Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB), {{commonly known as the}} Burlington. The train featured extensive use of stainless steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included innovations such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} sustainability fact about bismuth is its byproduct status, which can either improve sustainability (i.e., vanadium or manganese nodules) or, for bismuth from lead ore, constrain it; bismuth is constrained. The {{extent to which}} the constraint on bismuth can be relieved is going to be tested by the future of the lead storage battery, since 90% of the world market for lead is currently in storage batteries for gasoline or <b>diesel-powered</b> motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Registrations {{achieved}} a {{market share of}} 29.1% of all new passenger cars registered in 2016, with the all-electric car segment reaching 15.7%, down from 17.1% in 2015, and the plug-in hybrid segment climbed to 13.4%, up from 5.3% in 2015. The Outlander PHEV ended 2016 listed as the best selling plug-in car in Norway with 5,136 units sold, {{the first time ever}} a plug-in hybrid topped the Norwegian list of top selling plug-in electric cars. Ranking next were the Volkswagen e-Golf (4,705), Volkswagen Golf GTE (4,337), and Nissan Leaf (4,162). When new car sales in 2016 are breakdown by powertrain or fuel, nine of the top ten best-selling models were electric-drive models, of which three models were plug-in hybrids, three were battery electric cars, three were conventional hybrids, and one was a <b>diesel-powered</b> car.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Government manages {{those parts}} of the British railway network within Wales. Cardiff Central is Wales' busiest railway station, with over four times as much {{passenger}} traffic as any other station in Wales. The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network. Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line. All trains in Wales are <b>diesel-powered,</b> since no lines have been electrified. However, the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff and Swansea, is undergoing electrification.|$|E
5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as <b>diesel-powered</b> trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are <b>diesel-powered.</b> Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|The LNER did {{not want}} to take full {{responsibility}} for the line, and although they provided the services, ownership remained with the LPTB. In 1935 the LPTB, seeking to abandon steam power as much as possible, drew up a scheme to include electrification of the Amersham line as part of the New Works Programme. It was not planned to electrify the Chesham branch; instead, a <b>diesel-powered</b> GWR railcar was borrowed from the GWR for trials on the branch. Although the railcar performed well on the curves and slopes of the branch, the railcar had a capacity for only 70 passengers and was only able to haul light amounts of goods. The LPTB commissioned its own, larger, railcar design, {{but by the end of}} 1936, it decided instead to electrify the Chesham branch, and the railcar schemes were abandoned. The LPTB's plan envisaged electric trains splitting at Chalfont& Latimer, with half of each train continuing to Amersham and half to Chesham.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a <b>diesel-powered</b> barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million pounds of wool, 316,610 pounds of hides and skins, 1.3 million pounds of tanning materials, 4 million pounds of copra, 544,660 pounds of crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of electrolytic copper. The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E

25|$|Diesel fuel {{is widely}} used in most types of transportation. Trucks and buses, which were often {{gasoline-powered}} in the 1920s through 1950s, are now almost exclusively <b>diesel-powered.</b> The gasoline-powered passenger automobile is the major exception; diesel cars are less numerous worldwide.|$|E
25|$|However, some <b>diesel-powered</b> transit is {{designated}} light rail, {{such as the}} O-Train Trillium Line in Ottawa, Canada, the River Line in New Jersey, United States, and the Sprinter in California, United States, {{which use}} diesel multiple unit (DMU) cars.|$|E
25|$|Dieselpunk {{takes over}} where Steampunk leaves off. These are stories that {{take over as}} we usher in the machine-heavy eras of WWI and WWII. The use of <b>diesel-powered</b> {{machines}} plays heavily. In this (like its steam counterpart), {{the focus is on}} the technology.|$|E
25|$|Many {{authorities}} have excluded steam powered, electric motorcycles or <b>diesel-powered</b> two-wheelers from {{the definition of}} a 'motorcycle', and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as the world's first motorcycle. Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles worldwide, defining only internal-combustion powered two-wheelers as 'motorcycles' is increasingly problematic.|$|E
25|$|Peirce carried two 29-foot (8.8-meter) aluminum-hulled <b>diesel-powered</b> Jensen survey launches, each {{equipped}} with the same Hydrochart system as aboard Peirce. For utility and rescue purposes, she also carried two open boats with gasoline-powered outboard motors, a 16-foot (4.9-meter) Boston Whaler fiberglass-hulled boat and 17-foot (5.2-meter) Monark aluminum-hulled boat.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel {{can be used}} as a {{fuel for}} {{vehicles}} in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from <b>diesel-powered</b> vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diesel-powered</b> motorships {{do not use}} steam boilers as part {{of their}} main {{propulsion}} system and so may not have steam supplies available to drive evaporators. Some do, as they use auxiliary boilers for non-propulsion tasks such as this. Such boilers may even be heat-recovery boilers that are heated by the engine exhaust.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 165,915 hybrid cars have been {{registered}} in France between 2007 and 2014, including 33,547 <b>diesel-powered</b> hybrids.
