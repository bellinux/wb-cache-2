40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Protein {{solubility}} of Pacific whiting muscle with {{isoelectric point}} at pH 5. 5 was significantly affected by pH. The highest breaking force was measured from <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> treated at pH 11, while high deformation values were obtained at pH 2 and 11. Texture of gels made using the conventional method were quite inferior to gels made using <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> treated at pH 2 or 11, while color of conventional gels was {{significantly better than}} the other treatments. SDS-PAGE revealed that <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> were highly denatured during acid or alkali treatment. High cathepsin B-like activity was detected from acid-aided <b>fish</b> <b>proteins.</b> Strong cathepsin L-like activity was found in <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> treated at pH 10. 5, which corresponded with the lower breaking force and deformation obtained from those samples. Disulfide bonds contributed to high texture value in <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> treated at pH 11. Physicochemical characteristics of sarcoplasmic proteins (SP) from rockfish and their interaction with Alaska pollock surimi (myofibrillar proteins) were investigated. Solubility of SP was significantly suppressed at acidic pH (2 - 4) plus high salt concentration (0. 5 M NaCl). This was also supported by SDS-PAGE results (extensively degraded SP). DSC results revealed SP gave three endothermic transitions. The least amount ofproteins was lost when treated at pH 2 or 3 followed by precipitation at pH 5. 5. SP did not enhance the gelation properties of myofibrillar proteins, but positively contributed to gelation with myofibrillar proteins when compared to sucrose. Myofibrillar proteins were primary components contributing to heat-induced gelation. Salt effect on acid- or alkali-treated surimi gel was investigated. Good gels were obtained without salt using acid- and alkali-treated <b>fish</b> <b>proteins.</b> Their texture properties decreased as NaCl content increased, unlike conventional surimi gels. Consequently, NaCl did not solubilize myofibrillar <b>proteins</b> once the <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> were treated by acid or alkali. Solubility was apparently not a key factor for the texture properties of acid- or alkali-treated surimi. Transglutaminase-mediated setting reaction was partially inactivated during acid or alkaline treatment. Acid-treated surimi gel gave the best color properties...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fish</b> muscle <b>proteins</b> undergo complex {{physicochemical}} {{changes during}} frozen storage which {{result in the}} toughening of muscle and unpalatability. The aim of this thesis {{was to examine the}} aggregation of <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> as a result of frozen storage, in particular the effect of formaldehyde on proteins. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Namibian hake (Merluccius capensis and Merluccius paradoxus) muscle proteins were characterised and differentiated by electrophoretic and immunological approaches. The nature of the chemical bonds involved was elucidated by the use of reagents capable of breaking the non-covalent and covalent bonds. Conformational changes of the protein were investigated by both immunological and chemical techniques. Structural and textural changes on frozen storage in the presence of formaldehyde were examined by microscopic, deformation-compression analysis and dynamic mechanical testing. In addition, a lysosomal enzyme (Trimethylamine oxidase) which is responsible for the toughening of gadoid fish muscle during storage was characterised. Electrophoretic separation of the sarcoplasmic proteins from Merluccius capensis and Merluccius paradoxus confirmed the biological closeness of the two species. A 19 kD protein band from M. capensis, excised from the SDS gel, was used for the production of polyclonal antibodies as analysed by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Formaldehyde and frozen storage augmented the extent of protein insolubilisation. The results of this study showed conclusively that formaldehyde {{is only one of many}} factors involved in the denaturation of <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> during frozen storage. List of objectives of the project. The objectives were: to characterise the <b>fish</b> muscle <b>proteins</b> and differentiate between the Namibian hake species Merluccius capensis and Merluccius paradoxus; to elucidate the chemical aspects related to solubility and foaming of <b>fish</b> muscle <b>proteins</b> in the presence of formaldehyde; to assess structural and textural changes in frozen and formaldehyde treated <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> by microscopy and viscoelastic measurements; to examine the changes in sulphydryl, disulphide and hydrophobic groups during frozen storage; to examine the changes in sulphydryl, disulphide and hydrophobic groups in the presence of formaldehyde; to monitor the degradation of trimethylamine oxide, formaldehyde and trimethylamine during frozen, storage of fish; and to characterise the enzyme TMAOase and to assess the effect of inhibitors.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{in this project}} is to find an {{economic}} and profitable technology for production of '"tasteless·· <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> from salmon backbones. Two possible sources/technologies for {{the isolation of the}} proteins are evaluated in the project: the solid phase from salmon oil production and a process with cooking of salmon backbones before bone separation. The process where the salmon backbones were cooked before separation (the continuous cooker process) gave the highest product yield. In {{order to be able to}} produce tasteless <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> with a low amount of lipids, the applied shear forces should be reduced to a minimum throughout the process, as this will make the removal of lipid more efficient. Preliminary sensory analyses show that the produced <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> powders taste intensity is in the same range as that of soya isolates, a common commercial product, sold in large volumes. However, taste panellists usually recognize <b>Fish</b> <b>proteins</b> to be <b>fish.</b> Therefore, the use of masking taste compounds could be evaluated. Preliminary sensory results also indicated that taste of the protein powders was not affected by the amount of lipids in the studied samples. This is an important finding, since it opens the door for a simpler, more cost effective process. The type of meat, red or whole meat, used for isolation of proteins could not be distinguished by sensory panellists. Further work should clarify the importance of the lipid content and the stability of these protein powders. A preliminary economic analysis of the two processes shows that the band cooking process has the highest potential to succeed due to higher yield of protein from the back bones. Based on a raw material price on 2 NOK/kg, crude marine oil NOK 4 /kg and on 80 NOK/kg for produced protein powder ethanol extracted protein powder give a net cash flow of 0. 78 mill NDK for a process based on roughly 2000 tons/year of salmon backbones. If ethanol extraction can be omitted the net cash flow is 12 mill NOK. A further stability test on the produced protein powders with accompanying sensory tests are recommended, such study could indicate the potential marked segments for these products...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{provides}} {{a major source}} of proteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids which are known to prevent coronary heart diseases. However, inherent characteristics such as colour and texture prevent the effective utilisation of some fish, especially fatty pelagics for human consumption. Instead, they are used for fish oil and fish meal production. For this reason and for enhancing the utilisation of valuable resources, the physico-chemical properties, which may be species specific, were investigated in relation to two Namibian species, namely, horse mackerel (Trachurus capensis) and snoek (Thyrsites atun). The results showed that horse mackerel (Trachurus capensis) and snoek (Thyrsites atun) contain high contents of palmitic acids (29 %), oleic acids (25 %), and the omega- 3 -polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) (15 %) and eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) (9 %). The studies also showed that optimum protein extractability was obtained with 5 % NaCl at pH 7. 2 and the highest gel strength at pH 6. 5 - 7. 0. CaCO 3 had detrimental effect on the water-holding capacity when used above 50 mg. l- 1 in washing water. Agar and sodium alginate extracted from Namibian Gracilaria verrucosa (red seaweed) and Laminaria schinzii (brown seaweed) respectively, were also characterised for their physico-chemical properties. Both the nontreated and treated agars were observed by colorimetric method to contain low levels of sulphate, an observation also confirmed by NMR and Raman FTIR spectroscopy. Sodium alginate was found to contain high content of guluronic acid (75 %) by NMR, a good index of strong gelling ability. The good functionalities obtained as a result of optimising the physicochemical properties of <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> and seaweed polysaccharides enabled an investigation of the interactions of the two components. Studies on the interactions of the both horse mackerel and snoek with either sodium alginate or agar were undertaken by rheology, differential scanning calorimetry and phase contrast microscopy. Large deformation and small deformation rheological studies showed a decrease in the gel strength of <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> with the addition of either polysaccharide at all combinations. The DSC results indicated a lowering of the denaturation temperature with the addition ratios of increasing amounts of sodium alginate to <b>fish</b> <b>proteins.</b> Although the mixture of <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> and agar resulted in the lowering of the denaturation temperature, the shift; was not as pronounced as that obtained with sodium alginate. The reason for the lowering of gel strength and G' values was attributed to phase separation of <b>fish</b> <b>proteins</b> and polysaccharides which was reflected by phase contrast microscopy studies. This investigation has resulted in the characterisation of valuable fish and seaweed polysaccharide resources from Namibia which could be used in combination for the development of new food products...|$|R

As consumption of fish is the main route of exposure to pollutants in humans, it is the main interest of this study to determine the concentrations of metals (with special interest in mercury) in commonly consumed fish in West Peninsular Malaysia. Due to the toxicity of mercury which depends on its bioavailability and chemical form, it is insufficient to measure only total concentrations of mercury.
