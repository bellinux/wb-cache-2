To overcome the higher path loss observed at mmWave bands, most prior work focused on the design of directional beamforming using analog and/or hybrid beamforming techniques in large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Ob-taining potential gains from highly directional beamform-ing in practical systems hinges on sufficient levels of channel estimation accuracy, where the problem of channel estimation becomes more challenging due to the substantial training overhead needed to sound all directions using a high-resolution narrow beam.

Relying on an original dataset of Italian manufacturing firms, a distinction is drawn between international outsourcing and foreign direct investments, and between offshoring destinations in Northern versus Southern regions. Our estimates show that a stricter environmental regulation is related to a higher probability of production being outsourced to foreign suppliers in the South, but not to foreign direct investments. The magnitude of this effect is very low, however. Offshoring decisions are mainly affected by firms’ ICT endowment, marketing and internationalization strategies, and adoption of environmental product innovations and standards.

In this paper, we present results of calculations of the Monte-Carlo parton distribution functions in terms of the commonly used MS parton distribution functions. At small x the differences are large, which demonstrates the importance of using the correct parton distribution functions in an event generator rather than MS parton distribution functions.
