50|$|Cambria County Jail is a {{historic}} jail located at Ebensburg, Cambria County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1872, and is a Gothic Revival style sandstone building measuring 56 feet wide, 100 feet deep, and 60 feet tall. An addition was built in 1910. The front facade features pointed <b>drop</b> <b>arch</b> windows and a pointed arch portal. The building has a tower.|$|E
50|$|At the {{north-east}} of {{the nave}} is a late 15th-century three-light {{window with a}} four-centred head and modern tracery, and further west are the doorway and window mentioned above, the former being completely blocked. The window, which is a tall single light, {{appears to have been}} considerably heightened about 1700. Opposite to this on the south is another tall single-light window which has been similarly treated, but was originally of two lights and probably dates from a century later. The south doorway has a two-centred <b>drop</b> <b>arch,</b> and is of about 1400. Opening to the aisle at the south-east is a late 15th-century arcade of two pointed arches with an octagonal pillar and responds of the same details as the arch {{on the south side of}} the chancel. The pointed tower arch on the west, which is pierced through a wall of considerable thickness, is of four moulded orders supported by responds composed of three flat segmental shafts divided by fillets, these shafts having coarsely moulded capitals and plain bases. The chancel has a segmental plastered ceiling, and the nave a low-pitched open-timber roof of the late 15th century.|$|E

40|$|Background Various {{different}} {{clinical and}} radiographic measures of foot posture {{have been reported}} in the literature. Two of the more widely used clinical measures are the navicular <b>drop</b> and the <b>arch</b> index. Despite their common use, there is little in the way of research assessing the degree of correlation between them. Aim of the Study To determine the degree of correlation between the arch index and the navicular drop. Method A total of 14 school children from a single primary school were recruited for this study. Navicular <b>drop</b> and <b>arch</b> index measures were taken from each participant in one single session. Ten of 14 participants (average age of 10. 4 years) were used for statistical analysis. Both the traditional measures of arch index and navicular drop were calculated along with a novel method of calculating the navicular drop as a percentage change. Data Analysis All data was analysed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) software. Pearson’s correlation was used to assess the degree of correlation between the arch index and the navicular drop (mm and percentage change) in both feet. Kappa analysis was performed for secondary analysis to see if these two measures agreed once the numerical data was transformed into its categorical form. Results Strong correlation was noted between the right foot navicular drop (percentage change) and arch index (r= 0. 971) but poor in the left foot (r= 0. 429). There was poor correlation between the traditional measure of navicular <b>drop</b> and <b>arch</b> index for both feet (left foot, r= 0. 496, right foot, r= - 0. 541). Kappa analysis showed poor agreement between the two measures of navicular <b>drop</b> (mm) and <b>arch</b> index (right foot 0. 23, left foot 0. 166) Conclusion The results of this study are inconclusive. In the right foot, strong correlation was noted between the arch index and the navicular drop (percentage change). In the left foot, correlation was poor. Kappa analysis demonstrated the 2 measures do not agree. Further research of good methodological quality is needed to assess the degree of correlation between measures of foot posture...|$|R

Tannis liked poetry; she had studied it at school, and understood it fairly well. But once she told Carey that she thought it a long, round-about way of saying what you could say just as well in about a dozen plain words. Carey laughed. He liked to evoke those little speeches of hers. They sounded very clever, <b>dropping</b> from such <b>arched,</b> ripely-tinted lips.|$|R

40|$|Background: Energy cost {{of walking}} is two times higher in {{children}} with cerebral palsy when compared with normal children; {{this may be due}} to gait abnormalities. There is a negative influence on physical activity and early onsets of fatigue in activities of daily living are evident in cerebral palsy children and the reason for this is increase in energy cost of walking. Therefore, the treatment techniques which targets on correction of gait abnormalities and Energy conservation during walking are important to maintain orimprove independent functioning. The aim is to find out the effects of using Supra Malleolar Orthosis (SMO) along with co-activation exercise in the increase of gait endurance and also to encourage independent skills and abilities in cerebral palsy child. Methods: A 14 years child with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy was treated with custom made supra malleolar orthotic which was designed with an orthotic support followed with specific exercises, co-activating dorsiflexors and plantar flexors actively and with assistance. The subject was made to do the co-activation exercises 3 days per week for 8 weeks. Step length, stride length, cadence, navicular <b>drop</b> test, medial <b>arch</b> height and calcaneal eversion were measured before starting the treatment and at the end of 8 th week. Results: the results of treatment shows that there is an improvement in 2 minutes’ walk test from 7 (pre-test) to 13, step length from 22 (pre-test) to 32,stride length from 36 (pre-test) to 47,cadence from 39 (pretest) to 37 after the use of Supra Malleolar Orthosis (SMO) and a co-activation exercises intervention. There was a clear and significant improvement noted in navicular <b>drop</b> test, medial <b>arch</b> height and calcaneal eversion after a period of 8 weeks use of orthosis and exercise intervention when compared with pre-test value. Conclusion: Orthotic subtalar alignment with co-acticvation exercises for alteration in gait endurance in a child is showing significantly good results in this case study of a child with cerebral palsy. The Co-activation exercise with Supra Malleolar Orthotic support reduces the intensity of symptoms and improved gait parameters in cerebral palsy child...|$|R
50|$|In 1874 it was {{discovered}} that the keystones had <b>dropped</b> and the <b>arches</b> were propped up with timbers. The steady increase in horse and cart traffic led to complaints that Temple Bar was becoming a bottleneck, holding back the City trade. In 1878 the City of London Corporation, eager to widen the road but unwilling to destroy so historic a monument, dismantled it piece-by-piece over an 11-day period and stored its 2,700 stones carefully. In 1880 the brewer Henry Meux, at the instigation of his wife Valerie Susan Meux, bought the stones and re-erected the arch as the facade of a new gatehouse in the park of his mansion house Theobalds Park in Hertfordshire, the site of a former hunting lodge of James VI and I There it remained, positioned in a woodland clearing, from 1878 to 2003. A plaque marks the site where Temple Bar once stood.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose. Evaluating foot {{biomechanics}} is {{an essential}} part of effective treatment of patients with a variety of injuries ranging from low back pain to plantar fasciitis. Many clinicians continue to use static foot assessments to evaluate injuries that result from dynamic foot motion during gait, despite the lack of research supporting the validity of such static measures. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between four static foot measurements and dynamic rearfoot motion during walking and running. Methods. The right feet of thirty-three subjects were assessed for navicular <b>drop,</b> navicular drift, <b>arch</b> angle, and calcaneal angle while standing on both legs with their right feet positioned in subtalar neutral. These static measures were performed again while each subject maintained one-legged standing on the right leg with their right foot relaxed. Peak calcaneal eversion was measured while subjects walked and ran using the two-dimensional Peak Motion Analysis System. Results. The coefficients of determination between all four static measures and peak calcaneal eversion angle during walking and running were poor (~ Conclusion and Discussion. Static foot assessment may not be a valid method of determining peak calcaneal angle during gait. A valid, reliable dynamic assessment method needs to be developed to use clinically to assess dynamic foot biomechanics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Foot posture {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{to contribute to the}} development of lower limb musculoskeletal conditions as it may alter the mechanical alignment and dynamic function of the lower limb. This study compared foot posture in people with and without medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA) using a range of clinical foot measures. The reliability of the foot measures was also assessed. Methods The foot posture of 32 patients with clinically and radiographically-confirmed OA predominantly in the medial compartment of the knee and 28 asymptomatic age-matched healthy controls was investigated using the foot posture index (FPI), vertical navicular height and <b>drop,</b> and the <b>arch</b> index. Independent t tests and effect size (Cohen's d) were used to investigate the differences between the groups in the foot posture measurements. Results Significant differences were found between the control and the knee OA groups in relation to the FPI (1. 35 ± 1. 43 vs. 2. 46 ± 2. 18, p = 0. 02; d = 0. 61, medium effect size), navicular drop (0. 02 ± 0. 01 vs. 0. 03 ± 0. 01, p = 0. 01; d = 1. 02, large effect size) and the arch index (0. 22 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 26 ± 0. 04, p = 0. 04; d = 1. 02, large effect size). No significant difference was found for vertical navicular height (0. 24 ± 0. 03 vs. 0. 23 ± 0. 03, p = 0. 54; d = 0. 04, negligible effect size). Conclusion People with medial compartment knee OA exhibit a more pronated foot type compared to controls. It is therefore recommended that the assessment of patients with knee OA in clinical practice should include simple foot measures, and that the potential influence of foot structure and function on the efficacy of foot orthoses in the management of medial compartment knee OA be further investigated. </p...|$|R
