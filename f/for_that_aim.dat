The intersection property is verified in probability theory when the global probability distribution is positive in all the values.

An asymmetrical D-separation principle is also presented, by which this type of independence relationships can be represented in directed acyclic graphs...|$|E

In this section, we resort to Graph Theory [24] to propose a solution <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>aim.</b> We demonstrate that in a cluster-tree topology, the best connectivity of anchor nodes is held by those nodes being cluster heads. Also, we propose that our algorithm controls the maximum number of anchor nodes in the clusters.|$|E

These irregular agents may use all of the system’s resources and thus take over the system. To optimize system longevity, we identify protocols for killing these irregular agents. Our primary contribution is a double communication protocol of alert and death signals among the agents, making the multi-agent system robust to failures and attacks. 1...|$|E
