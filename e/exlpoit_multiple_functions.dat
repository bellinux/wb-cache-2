40|$|AbstractWe {{show the}} modular {{properties}} of the <b>multiple</b> “elliptic” gamma <b>functions,</b> which are an extension of those of the theta function and the elliptic gamma function. The modular property of the theta function is known as Jacobi's transformation, {{and that of the}} elliptic gamma function was provided by Felder and Varchenko. In this paper, we deal with the <b>multiple</b> sine <b>functions,</b> since the modular {{properties of the}} <b>multiple</b> elliptic gamma <b>functions</b> result from the equivalence between two ways to represent the <b>multiple</b> sine <b>functions</b> as infinite products. We also derive integral representations of the <b>multiple</b> sine <b>functions</b> and the <b>multiple</b> elliptic gamma <b>functions.</b> We introduce correspondences between the <b>multiple</b> elliptic gamma <b>functions</b> and the <b>multiple</b> sine <b>functions...</b>|$|R

The <b>multiple</b> <b>functions</b> of the nanoparticle iron oxide are characterized in a flow tube reactor and the working mechanisms of these <b>multiple</b> <b>functions</b> for CO and NO removal in a burning cigarette are explained. The effect of smoke condensate on the catalyst are examined and discussed. The advantage of in situ generation of the catalyst during the cigarette burning process is illustrated.
