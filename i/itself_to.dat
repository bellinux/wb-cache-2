The {{government}} pledged <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E

5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported.

5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period. The early history of Calakmul is obscure, {{although}} a dynastic list has been pieced together that extends back into an ancestral past. This dynasty has been reconstructed in part from Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E

Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment <b>itself,</b> <b>to</b> emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E

The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E

5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime.

Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
