If the DCOF falls within the 0.30-0.42 range, then the test method states that the flooring is [...] "acceptable, with an increased probability of slipping," [...] and values below 0.30 are categorized as “low slip resistance" [...] and a [...] "higher probability of slipping". The standard also specifies a minimum DCOF of 0.46 for ramps. With an official test method and a safety criterion, this test is useful in determining the anti-slip properties of flooring, helping building owners and managers to avoid future slip and fall accidents (by taking remedial steps to remedy slippery flooring), or help avoid losing a lawsuit based on a fraudulent accident.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{methods for}} the {{performance}} testing of corrugated fibreboard boxes use some static or quasi-static characteristic of the box as the performance indicator. The aim of this project {{was to develop a}} performance-based test method for corrugated boxes for fresh horticultural produce, using a dynamic fatigue-type approach. It was hypothesised that a dynamic test is more appropriate for produce packaging due to the relatively dynamic nature of the produce distribution environment. Measurements were made of vibration, shock, temperature, relative humidity, and handling impacts in a typical produce distribution environment, and a dynamic performance test method was developed. It was concluded that this <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is more sensitive to performance differences between boxes than standard quasi-static methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In 1998, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{took steps}} to develop a {{scientific}} test methodology to measure and to control baseball bat performance. The resulting standard uses a hitting machine that pitches a ball at a moving bat to measure the BESR (Ball Exit Speed Ratio). Concurrently, the governing body for amateur baseball in Japan developed a test protocol for controlling bat performance. In contrast to the NCAA test methodology, the Japanese protocol uses a series of static tests. This paper compares the two protocol philosophies and presents experimental data highlighting the respective criteria of each approach and discusses how successful each approach has been in controlling nonwood baseball bat performance. Comparison data and analysis showed that some Japanese bats marginally outperformed U. S. bats with respect to batted-ball speed.

40|$|Earthquake {{resisting}} frame {{systems with}} stepping columns {{have been developed}} in the US and Japan. The key components of the system are rigid braced-frames, vertical post-tensioning strands, and replaceable dampers. Uplift behaviors of base-column depend on vertical forces such as the self-weight, the live load, and the post-tensioning. Total weight of a building is supported by earthquake-resisting components and leaning-columns (gravity-columns). Therefore, in order to realize uplift behavior of columns in small residential buildings by conducting experiments, earthquake-resisting components have to support actual weight. In addition to this, vibration characteristic of test specimens can be realized {{by the addition of}} inertial mass supported by leaning-columns. In this paper, new <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> to realize uplift behavior of earthquake resisting frame system has been developed.

However, care {{needs to be taken}} to ensure that the mix of existing Australian child restraint systems and any proposed lower anchorage system does not pose safety risks for children. In addition, it is desirable to avoid unique requirements for an Australian lower anchorage system and hence an assessment of UNECE ISOFIX and US FMVSS LATCH requirements was undertaken. A series of 28 frontal impact sled tests were conducted based on the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3629 child restraint <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method.</b> A further series of 15 tests were conducted in a vehicle body mounted on an impact sled with an acceleration-time history representative of a 56 km/h full frontal rigid barrier crash. Three different models of forward-facing child restraint were tested, with varying anchorage configurations including rigid ISOFIX, flexible LATCH strap and 3 -point seatbelt. Top tethers were evaluated with anchorages directly behind the child restraint (0 °) and offset at an angle of 20 °. P 3 and Hybrid III 3 year old dummies were used. Anchorage loads and safety performance of the restraint system were assessed. In tests in the vehicle body, maximum dynamic top tether loads were in the range of 7 - 8 kN and maximum dynamic lower anchorage loads are estimated to be in the range 13 - 14 kN. Tests using rigid ISOFIX anchorages generally produced lower head acceleration and forward excursion than other tested anchorage types. However, this was accompanied by increased chest deflections and neck flexion moments. These data suggest that lower anchorage systems may be acceptable in Australia, but that modifications to the UNECE and LATCH requirements may be required to ensure compatibility with existing Australian child restraint systems without a degradation of child safety...|$|E

Findings: Experimental results showed that the surface moisture presented a trapezoidal moisture liberation curve, it increased at first, then kept stable for a while, and decreased finally with the increase of time. It took longer time for the fabric to complete the liberation process when the moisture regain of the fabric increased or the simulated wind speed decreased.

40|$|The {{ignition}} {{of metals}} and alloys have been investigated by rotating {{the end of a}} hollow cylinder against an identical stationary cylinder on a common axis (frictional heating) in gaseous oxygen. A ranking criterion that measures the resistance of {{metals and alloys}} to ignition is discussed. It consists of the power per unit area required for ignition conveniently expressed as the product of contact pressure P and average linear velocity ALV. Data are presented that demonstrate that materials that are high in nickel and copper require greater P-ALV products for ignition (more resistant to ignition) than materials that are high in iron. Aluminum and titanium alloys are shown to require the lowest P-ALV products for ignition. The effects of varying surface velocity, contact pressure, coefficient of friction, and oxygen pressure on P-ALV products required for ignition are discussed. The results indicate that P-ALV product required for ignition increases as surface velocity increases, as contact pressure decreases, and as the coefficient of friction decreases. Increasing oxygen pressure will cause the P-ALV product required for ignition to decrease at low pressures and increase at high pressures. In some cases, the relative ranking of materials based on P-ALV products will also change as conditions are varied. The data presented in this paper are from a development program to determine the merits of using such a <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> for ranking materials for oxygen service. The results to date have indicated that more testing is required before this method can be made into a standard test.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The research contained within this thesis formed part of an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded project based at Loughborough University, which aimed to investigate the use of additive manufacturing (AM), and in particular sintering technologies, {{for the production of}} running footwear sole units. Laser sintering (LS) is an AM process which produces parts directly from a computer aided design (CAD) file by selectively fusing successive layers of powdered material using a CO 2 laser. LS imparts significant advantages over traditional manufacturing techniques including extensive design freedom, the ability to manipulate the local properties of a single material part as well as economical manufacture of bespoke items due to the elimination of tooling. Modifying the mechanical properties and/or geometry of sole units has been shown to provide benefits in the areas of performance, injury risk reduction and comfort, especially when considering elite athletes on a subject specific basis. Given the attributes of LS outlined above, the technology offers significant potential to produce sole units offering high added-value compared to conventional counterparts which are limited by the constraints of traditional processing techniques such as injection moulding. However, the mechanical capacity of LS polymers in context of such application was unknown. Accordingly, this research investigated the suitability of a laser sintered elastomer (LSE) material, in view of key selected mechanical properties, for the manufacture of running shoe midsoles. The midsole is the primary functional component in the sole unit of a running shoe used for distance running on hard surfaces. Following a preliminary assessment of the selected LSE (TPE 210 -S), a new <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> was designed to assess the compressive, fatigue and time dependent recovery properties of midsole material specimens under loading conditions representative of in-service use. The method was successfully implemented on an electro-mechanical test apparatus (previously unreported upon in literature) and used firstly, to benchmark the aforementioned properties of a range of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyurethane (PU) midsole foams representative of the range currently used in production, and secondly, to establish the same property set for TPE 210 -S specimens produced across a range of laser powers (LP's). Initial cycle operating ranges in terms of key compressive properties were established for EVA and PU materials. All conventional variants showed considerable deterioration from these initial values over the 125, 000 cycle test regime, but subsequently demonstrated partial recovery when left unloaded post-test. PU grades generally exhibited better fatigue performance and findings were consistent with those of previous studies. Whilst variation in LP facilitated linear variation in displacement and stiffness properties for TPE 210 -S, all specimens yielded a stiffer and more elastic response than that of conventional foams at the outset; initial compressive operating ranges, whilst within close proximity, did not overlap. However, fatigue performance was found to be superior with only relatively small property changes occurring over the test regime regardless of LP. Furthermore, no signs of catastrophic specimen failure (e. g. cracking) were visually apparent. In this respect the material showed good suitability for midsole applications, but further work is required to address increasing the available compressive property range which fell outside the scope of this work...|$|E
40|$|Due to high {{installation}} costs and relatively low output, the active use of solar energy is limited. The output from a collector {{can be improved}} e. g. by using a selective absorber, AR-treated cover glass or transparent insulation. The output/cost ratio can also be improved {{by the use of}} reflectors. The performance of a collector depends highly on the incidence angle dependent optical efficiency. In this report, detailed methods for measuring the optical efficiency is developed. In order to evaluate the performance of a collector, measurements are needed. For the evaluations in this work, a <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> has been used. The collector output is modelled as: = h 0 bKta(Q) Ib + h 0 dId – kDT - (mC) e(dTf/dtð) where h 0 is the optical efficiency, I the irradiance, k the heat loss factor, DT the temperature difference between collector and ambient air, and (mC) e the effective collector thermal capacitance. Kta(Q) is a modifier accounting for the dependence of varying incidence angles during the day. It is often modelled as: Kta(Q) = 1 - b 0 (1 /cos(Q) - 1) where b 0 is the “incidence angle modifier coefficient”. In order to evaluate the energy output from different collector types, measurements were made on a number of collector prototypes. In the analysis, the collector parameters were identified by MLR on the measured data. In order to verify the determined parameters, the modelled output was compared with the measured output. The annual energy output was then estimated by using the collector parameters in the simulation program MINSUN. In one study in the work, the incidence angle dependence of the absorptance was investigated by outdoor testing. The tested absorbers had coatings of nickel-pigmented aluminum oxide (Ni-Al 2 O 3), and sputtered nickel/nickel oxide (Ni-NiOx). The results showed that the Ni-Al 2 O 3 absorber has a slightly better performance than the Ni-NiOx absorber at high incidence angles. In another study, detailed comparative tests were made on different glazings in order to study the influence of AR treatment on the collector output. The tests indicated that the AR treatment can increase the annual output by 9 % (at Top = 50 °C). Usually a structured glass is installed with the structures facing the absorber. The evaluation indicates, however, that facing the structure outwards can increase the annual performance by 4 %. A detailed study showed that the b 0 factor generally depends on the incidence angle. MaReCo collectors are studied in the work. This is a reflector collector, specially designed for northern latitudes. The MaReCo principally consists of an asymmetric reflector trough with a single, double-sided selective, absorber that runs along the trough. The purpose of the MaReCo is to replace the collector box, insulation, and some of the absorber material by a reflector. The standard MaReCo has an acceptance angle interval of 20 ° - 65 °, outside which the reflector is not active and the absorber only works with radiation direct from the sun. The MaReCo concept is flexible and can be used for stand-alone as well as building integrated applications. Several MaReCo prototypes have been tested in the work. The estimated yearly energy output at 50 °C from a stand-alone MaReCo with Teflon and from a Roof-MaReCo, both at a tilt of 30 °, were 282 and 336 kWh/m² respectively. The Spring/Fall-MaReCo is a special version that has a low optical efficiency during the summer. In this way, a larger collector area can be installed for increasing the solar fraction of the system without increasing the risk of overheating. The test results estimate a yearly energy output of 222 kWh/m² from this collector. For an asymmetric collector (e. g. the MaReCo), the incidence angle dependence will be different in different directions. The angular analysis then has to be made in two perpendicular planes (longitudinal and transverse) of the collector. In the transverse plane, not only the properties of glass and absorber affect the output, but also the reflectivity and shape of the reflector. In order to handle this, a biaxial incidence angle modifier should be used. One example is the common “product model”: Kta(Q) = KL(QL, 0) KT(0,QT). Shortcomings of this model are that it is not correct for plane collectors and that it is not defined for concentrators where normal incidence is outside the acceptance interval. In this work, a new expression for a biaxial incidence angle modifier is suggested: Kta = fL(Q) gTL(QT). The factor fL(Q) gives information about the influence of the glazing and gTL(QT) accounts for the influence of the reflector. This expression differs in principle from the product model, since QL is not used. In order to study the suggested model, measurements were made on MaReCo collectors. The “no-loss efficiency” was determined by eliminating the effect of heat losses from the measured output. The factor fL(Q) was decided from measurements in the L direction made around the equinox (when QT is constant). The factor FT(QT) was determined from measurements in the T direction for constant QL. In order to keep QL constant, the collector was rotated to a north/south direction. The results were then used to calculate the reflector factor, gTL(QT), as the ratio FT(QT) /fL(QT). The parameters were then used to model the energy output. The analyses indicate that the new suggested biaxial expression can be used to model the collector output for asymmetric collectors where the standard model does not work. One drawback of the method is, however, that it requires measurements to be made around either spring or autumn equinox. The new suggested model has also been tested for modelling the angular performance of PV modules with concentrators...|$|E

Among the ten participants of the survey were project partners of relevant industry and research institutions within the European project STAGE-STE (Work package 11 - Linear focusing STE technologies). The survey addressed general aspects of the systems under test, as well as required process conditions and detailed characteristics of the evaluation procedures. In congruence with the literature review, the survey shows a similar tendency: the quasi-dynamic <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> according ISO 9806 : 2013 presents the most common and advanced evaluation procedure mainly used in the context of tracking concentrating collectors for the performance assessment of parabolic trough collectors operating with thermal oil or pressurized water. These common solar systems can be evaluated with minor adaptions to the testing standard. Evaluation procedures focused on in-situ measurements in solar fields or collectors are scarce and complex as well as an evaluation of linear Fresnel collectors or other systems operating with non-common heat transfer media like molten salt and direct steam. As those are still presenting niche products and testing wise challenging systems under real test conditions a more sophisticated evaluation procedure such as the <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> is expected to be better suited...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{small-scale}} Linear Fresnel Collector (LFC) for {{the generation}} of process heat has been tested by Fraunhofer ISE;its performance was evaluated by means of two different methods. The first is a quasi-dynamic <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> performed according to the testing standard ISO 9806 : 2013, with modificationsin the model to accurately describe LFCs. Due to the two-dimensional Incidence Angle Modifier (IAM) of an LFC, an iterative multi-linear regression (MLR) approach has been developed {{to be able to}} comprehensively evaluate the optical performance. The second <b>method</b> is a <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> based on a parameter identification incorporating a multi-node/plug-flow collector model without strict restraints on mass flow and inlet temperature stability. Both methods are briefly described in their conceptual design and theirbasic requirements, revealing their similarities and differences. Each method is then applied to real measurement datafrom an LFC, assessing practicability and identification accuracy. For both methods, the mean absolutedifferencebetween identifiedIAM values and results from ray tracing fell in a range of 0. 013 - 0. 017, leading toa similar accuracy inLFC performance evaluation. Differences in optical efficiency between the two methodsare smaller,with anaverage absolutedifferencebelow 0. 0098, even whenusing different measurement data and simulation models. Thus the dynamic methodrepresents a good starting point for the further development of an alternative <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> and evaluation <b>method</b> with more flexibility than the current testing standard. This will be significantwhenevaluating large-scale concentrating collectors and collectors with direct steam generation...|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} {{presents a}} critical evaluation of nine <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> for solar flat-plate collectors. The theoretical basis, {{the technique of}} parameter estimation and the test procedure of each method have been reviewed and compared. Extensive experimental studies {{have been carried out}} under a wide range of weather and operating conditions. Two commercially available collectors (from two different manufacturers) have been used in the investigation. The tests were carried out at the same location using a common test-rig, measuring transducers and controlling and data-acquiring facilities. The characteristic parameters of the collectors have been obtained on the basis of each procedure and compared with those based on the steady-state ASHRAE 93 - 86 standard. Further, for the methods which prescribe similar test sequences, the collector parameters have been extracted from the same data sets according to their procedures for providing a direct and very clear comparison between the methods. A sensitivity study has also been carried out in order to examine the effect of uncertainties in measurements on the values of the estimated parameters from different methods. Also investigated is the error propagation wherever applicable. Among the methods evaluated, the new dynamic method (NDM) seems to be quite reliable. The quick <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> (QDT) <b>method</b> is the most simple method and could be adopted by manufacturers as an effective tool for the purpose of quality control of their products. From {{the point of view of}} theoretical completeness, Perers' method accounts for almost all effects. (. ...|$|R
