Shallow impurity-exciton states are working as antennas borrowing their giant oscillator strength from vast areas of the crystal around them.

The silica transmission window extends to only 2 µm making silica fibres unsuitable for such applications. Mid infra-red transmitting fibres are currently either fluorozirconate based, with the disadvantages of being hygroscopic, and {{a relatively small}} transmission window (~ 1 - 3 µm), or As 2 X 3 (X = S, Se) based with the disadvantage of toxicity should the fibre burn or degrade. Gallium lanthanum sulphide based glasses are proposed as high quality alternatives as they have a high glass transition temperature which results in increased stability, are non toxic, and have a wide transmission window of 1 - 8 µm [1]. One limiting factors {{in the performance of}} a fibre for the passive applications listed above is the optical loss of the fibre. This has three main physical causes: The electronic edge at the UV end of the spectrum is from electrons excited from the valence band across the bandgap of the material or to defect states in the bandgap, the <b>fundamental</b> glass <b>absorption</b> in the IR is from the multiphonon edge by excitation of optic phonon modes in the glass with phonon generation and subsequent photon absorption, and Rayleigh scattering caused by fluctuations in the refractive index of the glass caused by density and compositional fluctuations on a scale much smaller than the wavelength of light.

The near coincidence of Earth Observing System (EOS)/Terra and Earth Observing One (EO- 1) platforms allows acquiring ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion imagery of the same ground areas, resulting accurate information for geological mapping applications especially in the reconnaissance stages of hydrothermal copper and gold exploration, chromite, magnetite, massive sulfide and uranium ore deposits, mineral components of soils and structural interpretation at both regional and district scales. Shortwave length infrared and thermal infrared bands of ASTER have sufficient spectral resolution to map <b>fundamental</b> <b>absorptions</b> of hydroxyl mineral groups and silica and carbonate minerals for regional mapping purposes.

Hyperion visible and near infrared bands (0.4 to 1.0 μm) and shortwave infrared bands (0.9 to 2.5 μm) allowed to produce image maps of iron oxide minerals, hydroxyl-bearing minerals, sulfates and carbonates in association with hydrothermal alteration assemblages, respectively. The techniques and achievements reviewed in the present paper can further introduce the efficacy of ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion data for future mineral and lithological mapping and exploration of the porphyry copper, epithermal gold, chromite, magnetite, massive sulfide and uranium ore deposits especially in arid and semi-arid territory.|$|R
