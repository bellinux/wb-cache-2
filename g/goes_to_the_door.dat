500|$|Michael {{leaves the}} prison and calls Mayhew, and offers {{to come over}} for a beer. However, once Michael comes over, he reminds Mayhew that Bell had a million dollars but only $100,000 ever turned up. He figures that Mayhew killed Bell, took the money, and planted the gun in Cooper's house. When Michael demands {{his share of the}} stolen money, he kept stating that there was no money. However, as Michael leaves, [...] Mayhew says that he has the {{remaining}} money for him. Michael leaves, Mayhew <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and finds out that the police are there. They arrest him. Michael's partner in the [...] "red reality", Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) admits to Michael that he wasn't sure if his partner had dreamed up the entire thing. Later in the [...] "green reality", Michael and the team head to the shed to get Rex, and take him to the hospital. In the shed, Rex had left a video message, which Michael had watched. Rex had said that he loved him. Michael wakes up in the [...] "red reality", and speaks to Hannah about their experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, {{praying that}} Amahl {{not become a}} beggar ("Don't Cry Mother Dear"). After bedtime ("From Far Away We Come"), {{there is a knock}} at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is ("Amahl ... Yes Mother!"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; [...] "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is [...] "a cold {{fireplace}} and a bed of straw". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy ("Are You A Real King?"; [...] "This is My Box"). The mother returns ("Amahl, I Told You Not To Be A Nuisance!"). He defends himself, saying [...] "They kept asking me questions," [...] when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors ("All These Beautiful Things"; [...] "Have You Seen a Child?") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly ("Shepherds! Shepherds!"; [...] "Emily! Emily"; [...] "Olives and Quinces"; [...] "Dance of the Shepherds").|$|E
