40|$|During severe impact conditions, {{brain tissue}} {{experiences}} a rapid and complex deformation, {{which can be}} seen as a mixture of compression, tension and shear. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) occurs in animals and humans when both the strains and strain rates exceed 10 % and 10 /s, respectively. Knowing the mechanical properties of brain tissue in shear at these strains and strain rates is thus of particular importance, as they can be used in finite element simulations to predict the occurrence of brain injuries under different impact conditions. However, very few studies in the literature provide this information. In this research, an experimental setup was developed to perform simple shear tests on porcine brain tissue at strain ratesThis work was supported for the first author by a Postgraduate Research Scholarship awarded in 2009 by the <b>Irish</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET), Ireland, and for the second author, by a New Foundations award from the <b>Irish</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Council</b> (IRC) ...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic routes for the {{formation}} of opal assemblies as templates for the inverted opal vanadium oxide electrodes are presented. A method for {{the formation}} of monolayer opal templates on gold substrates is discussed and the formation of multilayer opal templates on conductive substrates by electrophoretic deposition is also described, with order defined by angle resolved light scattering measurements. Inverted opals are formed from a diluted solution of IPA and vanadium alkoxide precursor, infiltrated into the templates by several methods. The effect of different heat treatments and method of polymer template removal on the resulting inverse opal morphology and structure is investigated.
