40|$|Inadequate {{sleep is}} known to impair a variety of {{cognitive}} capacities, including attention, vigilance, concentration. memory encoding, and some aspects of higher order reasoning and judgment. The ability to unobtrusively measure fatigue and predict its effects on cognitive performance is vital to successful military operations. Wrist actigraphy is one such method, but its ability to accurately measure and predict performance in militarily relevant activities is not well validated. Healthy military volunteers (N = 108) were fitted with wrist actigraphs (Actiwatch; Minimitter Inc.) while undergoing one ofsix military education programs lasting between 4 to 6 weeks. Sixty-four Actiwatches were worn consistently and yielded valid data. Actigraphic sleep data were analyzed with Actiware 3. 41 using automated scoring algorithms. Indices ofsleep duration, latency, and quality were used to predict academic success in these courses. Averaging across all courses and volunteers, Soldiers obtained 5. 8 hours of sleep per night (SD = 0. 5). Sleep duration was typically reduced to 4. 6 (SD = 1. 5) hours the night preceding an exam. Regardless of course type or test content, academic performance was significantly predicted by total sleep time (48 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =. 60, p <. 00 I; 24 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =. 54, P <. 00 I), sleep latency (48 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =-. 46, p =. 002; 24 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =-. 46, p =. 002), number of immobile minutes (48 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r=. 58, p <. 00 I; 24 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =. 52, p =. 00 I), and fragmentation index (48 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =. 29, p =. 05; 24 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =. 28, p =. 05), but not total activity level (48 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =. 06, ns; 24 <b>hours</b> <b>before,</b> r =. 07, ns). Regardless ofcourse or exam content, academic performance {{was significantly related to}} the amount and quality of sleep obtained within the 48 -hour period preceding the exams. Actigraphy appears to be a valid and unobtrusive method for predicting academic performance in military courses, although issues of participant compliance and detection of off-wrist periods need to be improved. 1...|$|R

The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation.
