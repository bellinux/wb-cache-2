Sir William Osler, Wilder Penfield, Donald Hebb, Brenda Milner, and others made significant <b>discoveries</b> <b>in</b> medicine, neuroscience and psychology while working at McGill, many at the University's Montreal Neurological Institute. The first hormone governing the Immune System (later christened the Cytokine 'Interleukin-2') was discovered at McGill in 1965 by Gordon & McLean.|$|E

With fruitful research results on knowledge <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> relational databases and the emerging trend {{in the development of}} object-oriented and active database systems, it is natural to investigate knowledge <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> object-oriented and active databases. This paper overviews the mechanisms for knowledge <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> object-oriented and active database systems, with an emphasis on the techniques for generalization of complex data objects, methods, class hierarchies and dynamically evolving data, and on the integration of knowledge discovery mechanisms with production control processes. 1 Introduction With rapid growth in the amount of information stored in databases, the development of effective and efficient tools for knowledge <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> databases (KDD, or data/knowledge mining) [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Tactical {{internet}} {{is one of}} top priorities of army in digitizing the battlespace. There are more different architectures of tactical internet because of more different network equipments which {{bring a lot of}} difficult to <b>discovery</b> topology <b>in</b> tactical internet. To realize topology discovery on tactical internet which own special architecture and communication model because of the router-switch which was the unique key equipment of tactical internet made by special institute, a distributed topology discovery method was proposed based on Agent. It depended on cooperation of two topology discoveries: topology <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> management domain and topology <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> whole network. Through rational assigning tasks of the two topology discoveries, occupation of radio bandwidth on topology discovery would be reduced more largely. Collecting topology data in time and using radio bandwidth more rational would be realized by adjusting process priority of topology <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> whole network with manual regulation and self-adaptation regulation. Then two algorithms of topology <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> management domain and in whole network firstly were presented. The data saving structure of topology <b>discovery</b> <b>in</b> management domain was designed in detail and these data would be sent to network management centre from Agent...|$|R

Ralph von Koenigswald and Franz Weidenreich compared the fossils from Java and Zhoukoudian and concluded that Java Man and Peking Man were closely related. Dubois died in 1940, still refusing to recognize their conclusion, and official reports remain critical of the Sangiran site's poor presentation and interpretation.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent <b>discoveries</b> <b>in</b> the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E

Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new <b>discoveries</b> <b>in</b> Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.|$|E
