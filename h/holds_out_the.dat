5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
2500|$|The {{depiction}} in the 12th-century English Eadwine Psalter has a naked female swimmer in the water, {{holding the}} empty ark with one hand, while a clothed female {{with her feet}} in the water <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> baby to the princess, who reclines on a bed or litter. [...] This is part of some 11 scenes {{of the life of}} Moses. [...] This may relate to the Jewish visual traditions covered below.|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{possible}} that plate b1 served as a divider between the two series, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi believe it was a tailpiece to the overall work. In that position it would mirror the only other full plate design (the frontispiece). Also the graphical content would suggest it as a tailpiece, as it returns to the gothic architecture of the title page. It also serves as an illustration of plate b12 ('Therefore') insofar as it depicts a resurrection where we become as God is; [...] "the work therefore ends with its most hopeful and religious concept, the restoration of humanity to spiritual life" [...] insofar as [...] "the plate <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> promise of a resurrection from the 'death' of Lockean philosophy and into the life of the spirit." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{painting}} at least depicts an actress playing {{the part of}} Circe. This is Franz von Stuck’s striking portrait of [...] " [...] as Circe” (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon’s play in 1912 {{and there is a}} publicity still of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown. Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck’s enchantress as she <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme Geneviève Vix as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical. A later example is the still of Silvana Mangano in her part as Circe in the 1954 film “Ulysses”, which is as cunningly posed for effect.|$|E

Detroit's general manager Jack Zeller refused, and Gentry opted to <b>hold</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> lasted <b>the</b> entire 1945 season. Gentry reportedly offered to sign in August, but Zeller felt Gentry was out of shape {{and told him to}} stay home.|$|R

6000|$|Stella writes kindly enough. Not {{a line in}} her letter, however, invites me, or <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} of inviting me, to St. Germain. She refers to her mother very briefly, merely informing me that Mrs. Eyrecourt is well, and is already enjoying the gayeties of Paris. Three-fourths of the letter are occupied with the baby. When I wrote to her I signed myself [...] "yours affectionately." [...] Stella signs [...] "yours sincerely." [...] It is a trifle, I daresay--but I feel it, for all that.|$|E

You may be sure that they would lose no time in mounting guns from the ships on the forts, and render themselves perfectly safe from attack. They say that Bonaparte is in command of the French. He is their ablest general, and very active and enterprising. I should not be surprised if he captures the place before sunset to-morrow." ...|$|E

60|$|There is {{likewise}} another diversion, {{which is only}} shown before the emperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions. The emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long; one is blue, the other red, and the third green. These threads are proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour. The ceremony is performed in his majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to undergo a trial of dexterity {{very different from the}} former, and such as I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the new or old world. The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends parallel to the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one, sometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backward and forward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister the other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever performs his part with most agility, and <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> longest in leaping and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk; the red is given to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this court who are not adorned with one of these girdles.|$|E
60|$|The truly active citizens, that is, {{the above}} descriptions, are all {{concerned}} in intrigue respecting the various objects {{in their local}} or their general government. The rota, which the French have established for their National Assembly, <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> highest objects of ambition to such vast multitudes as in an unexampled measure to widen {{the bottom of a}} new species of interest merely political, and wholly unconnected with birth or property. This scheme of a rota, though it enfeebles the state, considered as one solid body, and indeed wholly disables it from acting as such, gives a great, an equal, and a diffusive strength to the democratic scheme. Seven hundred and fifty people, every two years raised to the supreme power, has already produced at least fifteen hundred bold, acting politicians: a great number for even so great a country as France. These men never will quietly settle in ordinary occupations, nor submit to any scheme which must reduce them to an entirely private condition, or to the exercise of a steady, peaceful, but obscure and unimportant industry. Whilst they sit in the Assembly, they are denied offices of trust and profit,--but their short duration makes this no restraint: during their probation and apprenticeship they are all salaried with an income to the greatest part of them immense; and after they have passed the novitiate, those who take any sort of lead are placed in very lucrative offices, according to their influence and credit, or appoint those who divide their profits with them.|$|E
60|$|The {{present system}} of {{constraint}} does no more, {{in the majority}} of instances, than make hypocrites or open enemies. Persons of delicacy and virtue, unhappily united to one whom they find it impossible to love, spend the loveliest season of their life in unproductive efforts to appear otherwise than they are, {{for the sake of the}} feelings of their partner or the welfare of their mutual offspring: those of less generosity and refinement openly avow their disappointment, and linger out the remnant of that union, which only death can dissolve, in a state of incurable bickering and hostility. The early education of their children takes its colour from the squabbles of the parents; they are nursed in a systematic school of ill-humour, violence, and falsehood. Had they been suffered to part at the moment when indifference rendered their union irksome, they would have been spared many years of misery: they would have connected themselves more suitably, and would have found that happiness in the society of more congenial partners which is for ever denied them by the despotism of marriage. They would have been separately useful and happy members of society, who, whilst united, were miserable and rendered misanthropical by misery. The conviction that wedlock is indissoluble <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> strongest of all temptations to the perverse: they indulge without restraint in acrimony, and all the little tyrannies of domestic life, when they know that their victim is without appeal. If this connection were put on a rational basis, each would be assured that habitual ill-temper would terminate in separation, and would check this vicious and dangerous propensity.|$|E
