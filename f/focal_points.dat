5|$|The {{second season}} further {{developed}} into {{the plot of}} the fear of company downsizing, along with the introduction of new characters and developing some of the minor ones—especially that of Dwight. As Michael starts a relationship with his boss Jan Levenson (Melora Hardin), Pam and Jim’s relationship become one of the <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> of the season. Their compatibility becomes more obvious as Jim’s feelings for Pam continue to grow, while she struggles with her relationship with the warehouse worker Roy Anderson (David Denman).|$|E
5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series. She would question the setting from the audience's point of view and have it explained to them. She was written as the heroine, who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, Shogo Makishima, and see their conflict from her own viewpoint. One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane appears {{at the start of the}} first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese. Hanazawa said one of the <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> of the series after the third episode was the changes Akane would undergo; she would be influenced by many unfamiliar, traumatic experience she must endure as part of her policing role.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul {{is famous}} for its nightlife, as well as its {{historic}} taverns, a signature characteristic of the city for centuries if not millennia. Along the İstiklal Avenue is the Çiçek Pasajı, now home to winehouses (known as meyhanes), pubs, and restaurants. İstiklal Avenue, originally famous for its taverns, has shifted toward shopping, but the nearby Nevizade Street is still lined with winehouses and pubs. Some other neighborhoods around İstiklal Avenue have recently been revamped to cater to Beyoğlu's nightlife, with formerly commercial streets now lined with pubs, cafes, and restaurants playing live music. Other <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> for Istanbul's nightlife include Nişantaşı, Ortaköy, Bebek, and Kadıköy.|$|E

5|$|The {{third season}} of the American {{television}} medical drama Grey's Anatomy, commenced airing on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on September 21, 2006, and concluded on May 17, 2007. The season was produced by Touchstone Television, in association with Shondaland Production Company and The Mark Gordon Company, the showrunner being Shonda Rhimes. Actors Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, and T.R. Knight reprised their roles as surgical interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Izzie Stevens, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley, respectively, continuing their expansive storylines as <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> throughout the season. Previous main cast members Chandra Wilson, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh, Isaiah Washington, and Patrick Dempsey also returned, while previous guest stars Sara Ramirez and Eric Dane were promoted to series regulars, following the extension of their contracts.|$|E
5|$|As {{there were}} only six seismometers {{operating}} in Washington state and western British Columbia even as late as 1969, there are insufficient instrumental records for older events in the region. Focal depths are unknown for shocks that occurred before that time, but seismologists Bakun et al. concluded that the event occurred on a shallow fault {{on the east side}} of the Cascade Range. They employed a method that was developed by W. H. Bakun and C. M. Wentworth for using earthquake intensity information that could be mapped to a corresponding moment magnitude. The intensities for twelve 20th-century Pacific Northwest earthquakes were used for calibration before analyzing the known intensities for the 1872 event in an attempt to resolve the location and magnitude. The reports were interpreted in a way that placed the epicenter near the south end of Lake Chelan, but other considerations left other plausible <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> both north and northeast of the lake. The magnitude was estimated to be 6.5–7.0 with 95% confidence.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of David I (r. 1124–53), there is {{evidence}} of burghs, particularly on the east coast, which are the first identifiable towns in Scotland. Probably based on existing settlements, they grew in number and significance through the Medieval period. More than 50 royal burghs are known to have been established {{by the end of the}} thirteenth century and a similar number of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs were created between 1450 and 1516, acting as <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> for administration, as well as local and international trade. In the early Middle Ages the country was divided between speakers of Gaelic, Pictish, Cumbric and English. Over the next few centuries Cumbric and Pictish were gradually overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, English and Norse. From at least {{the reign of}} David I, Gaelic was replaced by French as the language of the court and nobility. In the late Middle Ages Scots, derived mainly from Old English, became the dominant language.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} that an outside option, when offered to one of the two players who later participate in a battle-of-the-sexes game, facilitates coordination by making the equilibrium that favors the same player focal. Since the other player’s payoff in the outside option was lower than that in the <b>focal</b> <b>point,</b> {{it is possible that the}}re was a reciprocal motive of the other player to coordinate on the <b>focal</b> <b>point.</b> Then it is possible that the actual power of the outside option to generate the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> was either lower or non-existent. The current paper reports results of an experiment designed to test for the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> effect of the outside option by controlling for the reciprocal motive of the other player. The results confirm that the outside option can generate the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> even when the reciprocal motive is absent. In fact, the saliency of the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> is higher after controlling for reciprocity. ...|$|R

5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of performers. Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, contemporary life.|$|E
5|$|The Palazzo Zacco {{is one of}} {{the more}} notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. The palazzo was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The balconies, a feature of the palazzo, are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> of the principal façade are the three central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|E
5|$|The Xá Lợi Pagoda raids were {{a series}} of {{synchronized}} attacks on various Buddhist pagodas in the major cities of South Vietnam shortly after midnight on 21 August 1963. The raids were executed by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces under Colonel Lê Quang Tung, and combat police, both of which took their orders directly from Ngô Đình Nhu, younger brother of the Roman Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm. Xá Lợi Pagoda, the largest pagoda in the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon, was {{the most prominent of}} the raided temples. Over 1,400Buddhists were arrested, and estimates of the death toll and missing ranged up to the hundreds. In response to the Huế Vesak shootings and a ban on the Buddhist flag in early May, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority rose in widespread civil disobedience and protest against the religious bias and discrimination of the Catholic-dominated Diệm government. Buddhist temples in major cities, most prominently the Xá Lợi pagoda, became <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> for protesters and assembly points for Buddhist monks from rural areas.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a focus+context {{information}} visualization approach for multi-dimensional functions. We introduce a new interaction metaphor {{for this type of}} data, which we call <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> with a view: a user chosen <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> presents a view of the function with respect to this <b>focal</b> <b>point.</b> The data is viewed from this <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> to see patterns along rays that proceed directly away from the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> in all directions. The rays can be re-ordered to prioritize on a particular dimension and view the data accordingly. Hence, the behavior of the function can be visualized in a single view not only with respect to a specific point in its domain but also with respect to a specific dimension. While the approach can scale to many dimensions, the current implemented tool is best at about 7 dimensions. Keywords Information visualization, multi-dimensional visualization, focus+context...|$|R
5|$|The former Augustinian church, {{built at}} the {{beginning}} of the 17th century in the baroque style, was the only remaining part of a convent destroyed in 1796 by French revolutionaries. After having been used as a Protestant church from 1815 to 1830, it subsequently saw use as a concert hall, a commercial exchange, and a post office. At the center of de Brouckère square, the church’s façade was intended by Léon Suys to be one of the <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> of the new boulevards. The work to cover the river, which nearly surrounded the church, preserved the integrity of the building at great trouble and expense, but the church was finally demolished in 1893, its style no longer popular with the people and its presence unsuitable for the area. The church was replaced by a fountain dedicated to the memory of Jules Anspach. The facade of the church, however, was preserved, being disassembled and moved to serve as the façade for the St. Trinity Church in the suburb of Ixelles.|$|E
5|$|A major {{earthquake}} {{occurs in}} Los Angeles, caused by terrorists detonating explosives at <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> (places where fault lines intersect). Kate Warner is also kidnapped by the terrorist cell, along with Governor James Radford who is kidnapped for assassination but is then rescued by the CTU. A conspiracy involving Radford in the day's attacks is uncovered by the CTU and Radford is {{killed by the}} terrorist cell because he attempts to back out. Fort Lesker, U.S. Military base and {{the epicenter of the}} earthquakes, is attacked and taken over by terrorists, who then begin stealing weapons-grade plutonium before attempting to smuggle the weapons out of the U.S. to the Middle East. Kate Warner's father is forced to aid the terrorists by helping them smuggle the weapons with his customs passes. Jack finally kills Madsen when he tries to escape by shooting his speedboat with an M-80 assault rifle, causing it to explode. He also shoots and kills Max, the man behind the events of Season 2 and The Game, who was holding Kate Warner hostage, saving her life but in doing so Max manages to shoot Jack once in the stomach before dying. As a result, Chase Edmunds takes Jack to the hospital via helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} after myth, most gods {{were said to}} be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they {{inhabited}} the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence.|$|E

40|$|Problems: (1) Sound travels {{very quick}} around {{the curve of}} the wall {{creating}} a disproportional amount of sound on the opposite ends of the arc. (2) Sounds that start in front of the curve gets reflected back to a <b>focal</b> <b>point.</b> The location of that <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> moves depending on where the sound is located. As a result, loud refocused echoes are created at the <b>focal</b> <b>point.</b> When heard, the sounds seem to come from a mysterious place.

5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
