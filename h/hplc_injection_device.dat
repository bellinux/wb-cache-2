30|$|The {{diabetes}} <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> questionnaires (DID-EQ and DID-PQ) {{were developed}} to assess patients’ experiences with diabetes injection delivery systems. The draft versions of the questionnaires administered {{in the current study}} each had 20 items with parallel content assessing <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> experience and preference. The DID-EQ was designed to assess patients’ experiences with a single <b>injection</b> <b>device.</b> For each item, respondents report perceptions of their <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> by selecting a choice from a 4 -point Likert response scale (ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree,” “not at all confident” to “completely confident,” “very dissatisfied” to “very satisfied,” or “very difficult” to “very easy”). Participants are instructed to select an answer based on how they “currently” feel about their <b>injection</b> <b>device.</b>|$|R

30|$|In step 2, six {{experts were}} interviewed about {{diabetes}} <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> by telephone or in person. These experts included three clinicians {{who had worked}} with patients treated with non-insulin injectable medication (MD, MBBS, and RN) and three diabetes <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> engineers. These interviews focused on factors differentiating among diabetes injections devices; strengths and inconveniences of non-insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> that were available at the time; ways that <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> may influence treatment decisions; device attributes clinicians consider when selecting a device; and execution for development of non-insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> in the future. Key factors said to differentiate among devices included device preparation requirements, reconstitution, adjustable dose selection (compared to fixed dose devices), patient confidence in using the device, needle handling requirements, needle visibility, needle safety, capping, disposal, overall ease of use, and single-use versus multiple-use devices. The results of steps 1 and 2 were used to develop a concept elicitation interview guide designed to elicit patient experiences with diabetes <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
30|$|Previous {{research}} has examined patient perceptions of insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b> However, injectable medications other than insulin are increasingly {{used to treat}} type 2 diabetes, including GLP- 1 receptor agonists.

30|$|Despite these {{similarities}} in efficacy and safety, GLP- 1 RAs {{vary in their}} <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> and related treatment administration attributes. For example, the <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> differ in size, requirements for needle handling, and multiple versus single use [22 – 28]. In addition, some GLP- 1 RAs require the patient to reconstitute and/or mix the medication in the <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> prior to <b>injection</b> [23, 25] while others do not have these requirements [22, 24, 26 – 28]. Furthermore, the frequency varies widely as some GLP- 1 RAs are injected every day [22, 26, 27] while others are injected once weekly [23 – 25, 28]. These differences in the <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> and <b>injection</b> process could impact patients’ {{quality of life and}} preference among treatments. Although these differences among treatments could be important to patients, there are no previously available questionnaires designed to assess patient experience or preference among these new <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R

30|$|This psychometric {{evaluation}} {{supports the}} use of the DID-EQ for assessing patient perceptions of non-insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b> Item reduction resulted in the final 10 -item DID-EQ, including three global items and the seven-item Device Characteristics scale assessing specific characteristics of the <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> and <b>injection</b> experience. The three global items quantify overall satisfaction, ease of use, and convenience of the <b>injection</b> <b>devices,</b> while the Device Characteristics scale provides an indication of specific <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> features that may contribute to these overall perceptions. Measurement properties of the questionnaire were supported with results suggesting good test-retest reliability, internal consistency reliability (of the multi-item Device Characteristics scale), convergent validity, and known-groups validity. Furthermore, minimal missing data in this validation study add to qualitative results from previously reported cognitive interviews supporting the instrument’s ease-of-use and comprehensibility. Overall, these results suggest that the DID-EQ would be a useful tool in studies examining the patient experience with non-insulin injectable medications for type 2 diabetes.|$|R
30|$|The first {{questionnaire}} {{was designed to}} assess perceptions of a single <b>injection</b> <b>device,</b> while the second asks patients to report preferences between two devices. Despite some content overlap with previously developed PRO measures, these two new instruments diverge from the insulin-focused measures in several ways. The two new instruments omit concepts that would be irrelevant to patients receiving many of the non-insulin medications (e.g., small dose adjustments, using the device in public). In addition, they include concepts that are specifically relevant to non-insulin injectable devices (e.g., variations in dose frequency, flexibility with regard to dose timing, requirements for needle handling). The {{primary purpose of the}} current study was to perform item reduction followed by the first psychometric evaluation of the Diabetes <b>Injection</b> <b>Device</b> Experience Questionnaire (DID-EQ). The secondary purpose was to begin examining the Diabetes <b>Injection</b> <b>Device</b> Preference Questionnaire (DID-PQ) in the subgroup of patients who had been treated with multiple non-insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> and were therefore able to report preferences between two devices.|$|R

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in needle-free <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> in farm animal production systems due to two main factors: 1) immunology research indicates that targeting dendritic cells in the skin and the subcutaneous tissues results in improved immune response with minimal antigen doses and 2) implementation of meat quality assurance standards to minimize needle site lesions that are the result of broken needles and/or bacterial contamination. In this paper we review the literature, both peer and non-peer reviewed, on the use of needle-free <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b> These devices offer at least an equivalent and often improved immune response to needle-syringe injection without the carcass defects and needle stick worker safety issues associated with conventional injection techniques...|$|R
30|$|In sum, this psychometric {{evaluation}} study adds to previous qualitative research [19, 20] supporting {{the use of}} the DID-EQ for assessing patient perceptions of non-insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> and the <b>injection</b> process. In addition, the DID-PQ may also be useful in situations when patients can compare two non-insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b> In clinical and observational studies, these brief questionnaires can complement measures of treatment efficacy and provide a more thorough picture of patients’ experiences with non-insulin injectable treatments for type 2 diabetes.|$|R
30|$|When {{comparing}} two injectable {{treatments that}} both have positive {{scores on the}} DID-EQ, one way to determine if one <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> is truly preferable over the other from the patient perspective would be to administer the DID-PQ. This questionnaire allows patients to directly compare two <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> and indicate whether they have a strong preference, a preference, or no preference between the two devices {{on a range of}} characteristics. It is possible that patients could believe that two devices are acceptable (which could yield similarly high scores on the DID-EQ), but strongly prefer one over the other (which would be reflected on the DID-PQ). Therefore, the DID-PQ could be useful in head-to-head comparisons between treatments, particularly when the goal is to differentiate between <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> that are both likely to be perceived as acceptable by patients.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The common {{failure of}} health systems to ensure {{adequate}} and sufficient supplies of <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> {{may have a}} negative impact on injection safety. We conducted an assessment in April 2001 to determine to which extent an increase in safe injection practices between 1995 and 2000 was related to the increased access to <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> because of a new essential medicine policy in Burkina Faso. Methods We reviewed outcomes of the new medicine policy implemented in 1995. In April 2001, a retrospective programme review assessed the situation between 1995 and 2000. We visited 52 health care facilities where injections had been observed during a 2000 injection safety assessment and their adjacent operational public pharmaceutical depots. Data collection included structured observations of available <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> and an estimation of the proportion of prescriptions including at least one injection. We interviewed wholesaler managers at national and regional levels on supply of <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> to public health facilities. Results Fifty of 52 (96 %) health care facilities were equipped with a pharmaceutical depot selling syringes and needles, 37 (74 %) of which had been established between 1995 and 2000. Of 50 pharmaceutical depots, 96 % had single-use 5 ml syringes available. At all facilities, patients were buying syringes and needles out of the depot for their injections prescribed at the dispensary. While <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> were available in greater quantities, the proportion of prescriptions including at least one injection remained stable between 1995 (26. 5 %) and 2000 (23. 8 %). Conclusion The implementation of pharmaceutical depots next to public health care facilities increased geographical access to essential medicines and basic supplies, among which syringes and needles, contributing substantially to safer injection practices in the absence of increased use of therapeutic injections. </p...|$|R
30|$|It {{must also}} be {{emphasized}} that these 20 -item questionnaires are draft versions, prior to psychometric validation. A follow-up study, to be reported in a subsequent article, focuses on item reduction in a larger sample, along with {{reliability and validity of}} the streamlined instruments, which are called the Diabetes <b>Injection</b> <b>Device</b> Experience Questionnaire (DID-EQ) and the Diabetes <b>Injection</b> <b>Device</b> Preference Questionnaire (DID-PQ). The qualitative research conducted in the current study {{is the first step toward}} improving measurement of patients’ experiences with devices and treatment administration approaches associated with the newer injectable medications for type 2 diabetes.|$|R
30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{of the current study}} is that data were not collected on detailed clinical characteristics of the sample, such as diabetic complications, experience with disease self-management, detailed treatment history, and glycemic control. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} know the extent to which this sample represents the broad range of diabetes severity. In addition, some clinical characteristics (e.g., peripheral neuropathy and loss of sensation in the fingers) could have a direct impact on one’s ability to use and prepare an <b>injection</b> <b>device.</b> The current results cannot provide insight into the impact of these clinical variables on perceptions of <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
30|$|In step 3, concept {{elicitation}} {{interviews were}} conducted with patients in the US, UK, and Germany.

Qualitative information gathered during these interviews was used to generate the initial item pools: one set of items for evaluating patient perceptions of a single <b>injection</b> <b>device</b> (“single device questionnaire”) and a parallel set of items for assessing preference between two <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> (“preference questionnaire”). In step 4, the draft item pools were evaluated in a preliminary translatability assessment (performed {{by a member of the}} Leadership Team of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research [ISPOR] Patient-Reported Outcomes [PRO] Task Force for Translation and Linguistic Validation), and edits were made to the word choice and item structure.|$|R

30|$|Qualitative studies such as {{this one}} have several {{limitations}} that should be acknowledged. Items for the two new questionnaires were developed primarily based on the relatively small sample of 32 patients, and generalizability to other samples is not known. Although an effort was made to recruit a diverse group of patients from three countries, these 32 patients should not be considered completely representative of the broader population of individuals with type 2 diabetes. No cultural or geographic differences in perceptions of <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> were apparent in the current sample. However, it is possible that samples with different demographic or clinical characteristics (e.g., age, geographic region, race/ethnicity, diabetes treatment history, symptom severity) could have different opinions and priorities relating to <b>injection</b> <b>devices.</b> For example, only two {{participants in this study were}} Asian (one in the concept elicitation and one in the cognitive interviews), and it is not known whether perceptions of non-insulin <b>injection</b> <b>devices</b> would be different in an Asian population.
