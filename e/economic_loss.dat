5|$|Many unwelcome animals visit or {{make their}} home in {{residential}} buildings, industrial sites and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers, chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great <b>economic</b> <b>loss,</b> others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, and some are just a nuisance. Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control, modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{numerous}} studies have estimated the economic impacts {{of a variety of}} disruptions. Most of these studies are based on macroeconomic models that quantify the direct and indirect <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from a disruption. Direct <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> occur due to damaged facilities or when consumers change their purchasing behavior because of the disruption. Indirect <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> occur when directly impacted businesses consequently reduce their orders to their suppliers. Indirect <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> are often larger than direct <b>economic</b> <b>losses.</b> This paper compiles the results from these economic models in order to compare the costs of different disruptions and help decision makers prioritize among disruptions. We compare the direct and indirect <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from a variety of disruptions, including earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, pandemic diseases, and port closures. Some studies model hypothetical scenarios, but other studies quantify the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from historical events such as the September 11 attacks and the 2011 Japanese tsunami. This paper provides a useful benchmark to understand the consequences from disruptions and highlight areas that public officials could address in planning for future disruptions...|$|R
40|$|A {{model to}} {{calculate}} the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis on an average Dutch dairy farm was developed and used as base for a tool for farmers and advisors to calculate farm-specific <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis. The <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of a clinical case in a default situation were calculated as ¿ 210, varying from ¿ 164 to ¿ 235 depending on the month of lactation. The total <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis (subclinical and clinical) per cow present in a default situation varied between ¿ 65 and ¿ 182 /cow per year depending on the bulk tank somatic cell count. The tool {{was used to measure}} perception of the total <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis on the farm and the farmers' assessment of the cost factors of mastitis on 78 dairy farms, of which 64 were used for further analyses. Most farmers (72 %) expected their <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> to be lower than those revealed by our calculation made with their farm information. Underestimating the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis can be regarded as a general problem in the dairy sector. The average <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> assessed by the farmers were ¿ 78 /cow per year, but a large variation was given, ¿ 17 ¿ 198 /cow per year. Although the average assessment of the farmers of the different cost factors is close to the default value, there is much variation. To improve the adoption rate of advice and lower the incidence of mastitis, it is important to show the farmers the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis on their farm. The tool described in this paper can play a role in that process...|$|R

These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E

5|$|In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued standby signal No. 1 as Soudelor {{neared the}} region on July11.

The signal was lowered back to No. 1 later that day before they were all canceled early on July12. The emergency response system was put at level four water-disaster in preparation for torrential rainfall from Soudelor. A red alert was also declared for the affected regions. Torrential rains in Hainan caused significant flooding that killed 15 hikers and left several others missing. Numerous roads were also cut off or destroyed by landslides and 30 villages were inundated with flood waters. In Hong Kong, outer bands of Soudelor produced squally rain showers on July11. About 20 trees reportedly fell within Hong Kong, one of which struck a mini bus terminal.

A multiple regression prediction model of the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> educed by typhoon disaster in coastal areas of southeastern china was proposed. The principles of multivariate regression analysis were introduced firstly and the Typhoon disaster data over the east coast of China were analyzed.

40|$|World {{oil supply}} {{disruptions}} lead to U. S. <b>economic</b> <b>losses.</b> Because oil is fungible {{in an integrated}} world oil market, increased oil consumption, whether from domestic or imported sources, increases the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> associated with oil supply disruptions. Nevertheless, increased U. S. oil production expands stable supplies and dampens oil price shocks, whereas increased U. S. oil imports boosts the share of world oil supply that comes from unstable producers and exacerbates oil price shocks. Some of the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> associated with oil supply disruptions—gross domestic product losses and some transfers abroad—are externalities that can be quantified as oil security premiums. To estimate such premiums for domestic and imported oil, we take into account projected world oil market conditions, probable oil supply disruptions, the market response to oil supply disruptions, and the resulting U. S. <b>economic</b> <b>losses.</b> Our estimates quantify the security externalities associated with increased oil use, which derive from the expected U.

5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E
