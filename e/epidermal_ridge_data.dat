40|$|Regeneration was {{studied in}} the Ambystoma annulatum by the {{amputation}} of the right forearm of twenty-four adults, over a twelve month period. At the termination of the experiment the limbs were reamputated 1 - 2 mm proximal to the original amputation site. The regenerated portions were staged, examined at the gross morphological level, and prepared for histological examination. Gross examination revealed a thickened, ridge-like projection along the distal edge of all regenerating forelimbs at the Early Bud through Middle Palette Stages. Histological examination confirmed {{the existence of this}} structure as early as Wound Healing and continuing through Middle Palette to a pseudo-epidermal ridge in the Late Palette Stage. This <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> is continuous with the adjacent epidermis, but the <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> extends only along the dorsal distal edge of the regenerate. The epidermis proximal to the original amputation site was, at the maximum, 4 - 5 cells thick, whereas the <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> proved to be 60 - 65 cells at its maximum thickness. It is significant that an <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> appears on the distal tip of a regenerating adult forelimb in the stages Wound Healing through Middle Palette. A comparable structure, the apical ectodermal ridge, occurs during similar stages in embryonic chick limb development and embryonic amphibian limb development and has been considered a unique, embryonic feature.

40|$|The {{configurations}} of <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridges</b> that comprise dermatoglyphic traits are, in many respects, {{a history of}} the developmental period during which the ridges form. In 1892 Sir Francis Galton [l] demon-strated that <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge</b> configurations did not change throughout postnatal life. The fact that ridge configurations were not affected by environment or by age has been an important framework in genetic studies. In 1936, Cummins [2] reported the association of unusual der-matoglyphics with Down syndrome. Confirmation of his findings [3 -_ 51 demonstrated the potential value of dermatoglyphics in clinical med-icine. While not diagnostic alone, dermatoglyphics have been a valuable aid when clinical diagnosis was in doubt. Unusual dermatoglyphics now have been associated with congenital defects of both genetic and en-vironmental origin [6]. Schaumann and Johnson [7] have noted that dermatoglyphics associated with congenital defects are significant mark-ers of prenatal events. Yet, at present {{little is known about the}} atypical developmental processes that have produced these associations. The precise configuration of <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridges</b> and minutiae is determined at a very early embryonic age, around 10 weeks postfertilization. Ac-cordingly, an understanding of the prenatal morphogenesis of derma-toglyphic traits is fundamental to our interpretation of their variation and their relationship to birth defects. The developmental history of dermatoglyphic traits requires first a background in the normal developmental chronology of prenatal hand.

A clinical diagnosis should not be based on dermatoglyphic features alone because of the great natural variation found in print patterns, no single feature being specific to a particular disease.

Epidermal patterns start to develop during the sixth and seventh weeks of intrauterine life, and are fully formed {{by the end of the}} second trimester (Blackwell 1994). These anatomical structures have been used widely in the field of anthropology (Meier 1980) in addition to also being used in medicine and genetics as a valuable diagnostic tool (Holt 1973; Reed and Opitz 1981; Shiono 1986). There is a popularity of using dermatoglyphics as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to detect and predict different medical conditions that occur in early life (Kumar and Manou 2003; Fuller 1973; Cvjeticanin et al. 2009; Pakhale et al. 2012; Gupta and Karjodkar 2013), especially in clinical settings with minimal high tech diagnostic capabilities.

Aims: This study aims to assess the relationship between finger prints and chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Two hundred patients were equally divided into chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy group. The fingerprint patterns of the participants were recorded with a rolling impression technique using duplicating ink on executive bond paper.

40|$|Perception {{mechanisms}} of fine gratings still remain very obscure. Among their determinants, {{the knowledge of}} the fingerprint role could be a central issue: <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridges</b> are already known to be responsible for detection of small features on a surface, slippage and anisotropies in the perception of gaps or gratings. It is the reason why it appears essential to better characterize their “psychotribologic ” role in the dynamic contact of lateral touch. The first experiment shows that roughness perception depends on the commensurability and conformance between ridges of the epidermis and gratings. Then, a vibroacoustic experiment is proposed. It is splitted into three phases to better understand {{mechanisms of}} vibration emergence. Contrary to previous approach on the topic that are mainly centred on the vibration on the finger, the attention is focused on the consequences of the excitation of the finger on the texture. Spectrograms and scalograms illustrate that deformable bodies at contact generate inertial force on each other. Systematic relationships between the intensive or frequency parameters of the vibration at contact and perception of gratings were absent. However, the influence of the relative orientation between ridges of the texture and fingerprint on the vibratory mechanisms showed the importance of spatial determinants. The more textures fit together at the scale of the <b>epidermal</b> <b>ridge,</b> the more the average intensity in shear force, part of friction, and resulting vibration at contact increases. This suggests that a roughness code could be initiated spatially, even at small scales. The reliability of a non spatial roughness code with only intensive and temporal cues is finally checked. Vibration recorded with a vibrometer and played back on the skin with an electromagnetic shaker were barely sensed, and at best, as a flutter of negligible amplitude when amplified and applied tangentially to the skin. ...|$|R

The study involved 102 cases of CHD and 100 cases of normal individuals. It was observed that percent frequency of ulnar loops significantly increased in CHD group as compared to control group. Mean 'atd' angle was also increased in CHD group as compared to control group indicating distal displacement of palmar axial triradius (t). Thus, rise in frequency of ulnar loops and increase in 'atd' angle can be considered as one of the diagnostic criteria for CHD. ...|$|R

In natural exploratory conditions, this frequency matches the best frequency of one type of mechanoreceptors, namely the Pacinian corpuscles, which are speciﬁcally involved in the tactile coding of ﬁne textures.
