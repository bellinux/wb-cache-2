He takes Michael to Harper still in cuffs but they both tell her what they have learned. Harper approves Bird's plan to send a team to the storage container but sends Michael to a cell, saying that if they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> any evidence of his accusations, he'll go to jail for killing Hawkins.|$|E

For chronic resistance exercise studies, 67 % reported a reduction of expression and 33 % <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> differences. Studies of both types reported reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines. In acute aerobic exercise studies, 40 % revealed {{a decline in the}} expression of the receptors, 7 % reported no significant difference, 40 % showed an increase, and 13 % <b>did</b> <b>not</b> evaluate their expression. Fifty-eight percent of studies of chronic aerobic exercise revealed a reduction in expression, 17 % <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> a difference, and 25 % reported increases; they also suggested that the expression of the receptors might be correlated with that of inflammatory cytokines. In studies on combined exercise, 50 % reported a decline in receptors expression and 50 % <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> a difference.|$|R
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find {{the wreck of the}} Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|The clip commences with {{a police}} car {{arriving}} at the heating power plant, followed by Stan lying on a bed surrounded by surveillance cameras, sporting black lingerie. She is then introduced wearing a black hat and white shirt with a tie, while a crowd {{of male and female}} dancers perform a synchronized choreography. Following this, Stan makes an appearance wearing a white dress, and {{a police car}} is shown arriving. Subsequently, two policemen {{get out of the car}} in order to search for Stan. However, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> her in the bed and the video ends with Stan leaving the building and the men watching material recorded by the surveillance cameras.|$|E
5|$|Mark's ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has {{a picnic}} with her fiancé at the secluded {{place in the}} mountains, where they {{discover}} Mr. Griffin's medicine bottle. The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin's body buried nearby. However, police <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses {{to give it back}} to him, believing the ring to be that of David's father who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.|$|E

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard their mates carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E
5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, {{go to see}} a {{scientist}} at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He teaches the protagonists about mitochondria, but they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> his information useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable {{to pass through the}} entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses.|$|E
5|$|They {{climb up}} and {{eventually}} reach a small abandoned house. While there, {{the man is}} attacked by a big cat, which the woman strikes away {{with a piece of}} wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> people.|$|E

Dick delivers the drugs, and Logan learns that Hector is now the prime suspect in Felix's death. Two FBI agents talk to Sheriff Lamb, intent on getting the baby back. Veronica shows some information about Duncan’s computer. Weevil talks to Hector, who denies the accusation. The FBI agents and Sheriff Lamb learn that Duncan stole a boat. However, when the boat is searched they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> anyone—just evidence that people were there. Veronica thinks that Duncan has been picked up by someone. Veronica asks Vinnie Van Lowe to give a letter to Duncan. Weevil talks to Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan), a drug dealer, but learns that he wasn’t working for the Fitzpatricks. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who says that a teammate crashed his car into a man and drove away {{while he was in}} it. He felt incredibly guilty and decided to come back.|$|E

25|$|In September it was {{announced}} that an 18-year-old male patient in France with beta-thalassemia major had been successfully treated. Beta-thalassemia major is an inherited blood disease in which beta haemoglobin is missing and patients are dependent on regular lifelong blood transfusions. The technique used a lentiviral vector to transduce the human ß-globin gene into purified blood and marrow cells obtained from the patient in June 2007. The patient's haemoglobin levels were stable at 9 to 10 g/dL. About a third of the hemoglobin contained the form introduced by the viral vector and blood transfusions were not needed. Further clinical trials were planned. Bone marrow transplants are the only cure for thalassemia, but 75% of patients <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> a matching donor.|$|E
25|$|Peucestas (in Greek Πευκέστας; lived 4th century BC) was {{a native}} of the town of Mieza, in Macedonia, and a {{distinguished}} officer in the service of Alexander the Great. His name is first mentioned as one of those appointed to command a trireme on the Hydaspes. Previous to this we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> him holding any command of importance; but it is evident that he must have distinguished himself for his personal valour and prowess, as he was the person selected by Alexander to carry before him in battle the sacred shield, which he had taken down from the temple of Athena at Troy. In this capacity he was in close attendance upon the king's person in the assault on the capital city of the Malavas (325 BC); and all authors agreed in attributing the chief share in saving the life of Alexander upon that occasion to Peucestas, while they differed as to almost all the other circumstances and persons concerned.|$|E

We <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> {{a statistically}} significant difference between the exhaustive framework analyzed and the mutations (0.01, 0.033 and 0.1). The mutation with the best performance was 0.033.

The crossovers with the best performance were 0.6 and 0.7. This mean that our genetic approach is stable between different configurations and we can make the model’s predictions use less computational resources.|$|R
