50|$|Lutjanus johnii, {{commonly}} known as John's snapper or golden snapper, is a marine fish native to the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, from East Africa to Fiji and Australia. In Queensland, Northern Territory {{and other parts of}} Australia it is perhaps known more commonly as <b>Fingermark</b> bream, and is arguably one of the best estuary eating fish. The former name ('Golden snapper') is generally used when the fish is in much larger sizes, with juveniles and young adults usually referred to as the latter ('Fingermark'). It has a remarkably slow growth rate, so release is encouraged and bag limits apply. It can grow to approximately 8 kg in weight although 10 kg fish have been recorded off the coast of Cairns, though even a small individual will provide a substantial fight. They are not recommended to be targeted for catch and release when fishing in depths of 10 m or over, as the species is highly susceptible to barotrauma. <b>Fingermark</b> encounters often occur when targeting other species such as barramundi, and can be distinguished by their golden-brown to reddish skin tint and dark 'fingermark' beneath the dorsal fin - colourations both lost as the species dies once taken from the water or grows in size. Colourations are extremely prominent in juvenile fish. They are members of the Lutjanus genus of snappers, which also includes mangrove jack and other well-known table species.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the search}} for better or new methods/techniques to visualise <b>fingermarks</b> or to analyse them {{exploiting}} their chemical content, <b>fingermarks</b> inter-variability may hinder {{the assessment of the}} method effectiveness. Variability is due to changes in the chemical composition of the <b>fingermarks</b> between different donors and within the same donor, as well as to differential contact time, pressure and angle. When validating a method or comparing it with existing ones, it is not always possible to account for this type of variability. One way to compensate for these issues is to employ, {{in the early stages of}} the method development, a device generating reproducible <b>fingermarks.</b> Here the authors present their take on such device, as well as quantitatively describing its performance and benefits against the manual production of marks. Finally a short application is illustrated for the use of this device, at the method developmental stages, in an emerging area of fingerprinting research concerning the retrieval of chemical intelligence from <b>fingermarks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Identification of {{suspects}} via <b>fingermark</b> analysis {{is one of}} the mainstays of forensic science. The success in matching fingermarks, using conventional <b>fingermark</b> scanning and database searching, strongly relies on the enhancement method adopted for <b>fingermark</b> recovery; this in turn depends on the components present in the fingermarks, which will change over time. This work aims to develop a robust methodology for improved analytical detection of the <b>fingermark</b> components. For the first time, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) has been used to image endogenous lipids from fresh and aged, groomed and ungroomed fingermarks. The methodology was initially developed using oleic acid which was detected along with its degradation products over a 7 -day period, at three different temperatures in a time-course experiment. The optimised methodology was then transferred to the imaging analysis of real <b>fingermark</b> samples. <b>Fingermark</b> patterns were reconstructed by retrieving the m/z values of oleic acid and its degradation products. This allowed the three aged fingermarks to be distinguished. In order to prove that MALDIMSI {{can be used in a}} non-destructive way, a simple washing protocol was adopted which returned a <b>fingermark</b> that could be further investigated with classical forensic approaches. The work reported here proves the potential and the feasibility of MALDI-MSI for the forensic analysis of fingermarks, thus making it competitive with other MSI techniques such as desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI) -MS. The feasibility of using MALDI-MSI in <b>fingermark</b> ageing studies is also demonstrated along with the potential to be integrated into routine <b>fingermark</b> forensic analysis...|$|E
30|$|It was {{observed}} that relative humidity {{and long term}} storage of latent <b>fingermarks</b> prior to processing had negligible effect {{on the quality of}} cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints on polypropylene foils (Schwarz and Hermanowski 2012). In contrast to this, other authors observed that relative humidity during cyanoacrylate fuming effects the quality of developed prints and microstructure of the polycyanoacrylate. However, relative humidity has less influence on sebaceous marks (Paine et al. 2011). Kendall observed that several hours to several days may take place to develop latent <b>fingermarks</b> using super glue fuming (Kendall 1982). However, heating of cyanoacrylate reduces the time required to develop latent <b>fingermarks</b> (Olenik 1984). Overheating of cyanoacrylate ester should be avoided as it produces toxic hydrogen cyanide, if heated above approximately 220  °C (Mock 1985; Masters 2002). Kendall and Rehn (1983) observed that polymerization of cyanoacrylate reduces the time required to develop latent <b>fingermarks.</b> Pires and Springer (2016) observed that aluminum did not retard the polymerization of cyanoacrylate prior to vaporization. However, in contrast to this, some studies reported that aluminum acts as a polymerization retardant in developing latent <b>fingermarks</b> using cyanoacrylate fuming method (Olenik 1984; Olenik 1983; Lewis et al. 2001; Tuthill 1982).|$|R
40|$|<b>Fingermarks</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} types of forensic evidence found at crime scenes or on items submitted in relation to a crime. However, the majority of these <b>fingermarks</b> are latent and cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is because of the commonality of these invisible marks that there is an increasing need for the development of sensitive and reliable techniques to view them. As well as development of new techniques, there also needs to be continuous evaluation of current development methods as well as comparisons with emerging methods. This study looked at two sequences that have been proposed as being optimal for the development of latent <b>fingermarks</b> on paper substrates. Sequence 1 : Indanedione-Zinc  Ninhydrin  Physical Developer  Nile Red Sequence 2 : DFO  Ninhydrin  Physical Developer  Nile Red At this time, it is widely viewed in Australia that the sequence containing indanedione-zinc as the first reagent is the superior sequence for the development of latent <b>fingermarks</b> on porous substrates. This was questioned at the International Fingerprint Research Group (IFRG) forum in 2011, where scientists from the UK claimed that the reagent sequence containing DFO developed a greater number of viable prints when compared to the indanedione-zinc sequence. It is due to these conflicting views that these two sequences needed to be evaluated to find the most effective detection sequence for latent <b>fingermarks</b> on porous substrates under Australian conditions. The results of this study indicated that, as a whole sequence, there is a negligible difference between the results obtained from Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 across all paper types as well as all time periods evaluated. When looking at individual reagents, indanedione-zinc appeared to develop better quality <b>fingermarks</b> compared to DFO, although, this evened out with ninhydrin having a greater enhancement effect on DFO developed marks. Indanedione-zinc on its own developed a similar number of <b>fingermarks</b> as the sequence DFO followed by ninhydrin. Nile red, for the substrates tested and the <b>fingermarks</b> donors employed, did not develop any additional marks at the end of each sequence...|$|R
