The <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> were classified into 5 patterns (Type A : normal homogenous distribution; Type B : mildly unhomogenous distribution; Type C : severely unhomogenous distribution mingled with hot spots; Type D : non-hilar hot spots; and Type E : hilar hot spots).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes experiments which {{explore the}} structure and dynamics in two classes of soft materials: lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals and colloidal glasses and super-cooled liquids. ^ The first experiments found that the achiral LCLCs, sunset yellow FCF (SSY) and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) both exhibit spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking in the nematic phase driven by a giant elastic anisotropy of their twist modulus compared to their splay and bend moduli. Resulting structures of the confined LCLCs display interesting director configurations due to interplay of topologically required defects and twisted director fields. At higher concentrations, the LCLC compounds form columnar phases. We studied the columnar phase confined within spherical drops and discovered and understood configurations of the LC that sometimes led to non-spherical droplet shapes. The second experiments with SSY LCLCs confined in hollow cylinders uncovered director configurations which were driven in large measure by an exotic elastic modulus known as saddle-splay. We measured this saddle-splay modulus in a LCLC {{for the first time}} and found it to be more than 50 times greater than the twist elastic modulus. This large relative value of the saddle-splay modulus violates a theoretical result/assumption known as the Ericksen inequality. ^ A third group of experiments on LCLCs explored the drying process of sessile drops containing SSY solutions, including evaporation dynamics, morphology, and <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns.</b> These <b>drops</b> differ from typical, well-studied evaporating colloidal drops primarily due to the LCLC 2 ̆ 7 s concentration-dependent isotropic, nematic, and columnar phases. Phase separation occurs during evaporation, creating surface tension gradients and significant density and viscosity variation within the droplet. Thus, the drying multiphase drops exhibit new convective currents, <b>drop</b> morphologies, <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns,</b> as well as a novel ordered crystalline phase. ^ Finally, experiments in colloidal glasses and super-cooled liquids were initiated to probe the relationship between structure and dynamics in their constituent particles. The displacements of individual particles in the colloids can be decomposed into small cage fluctuations and large rearrangements into new cages. We found a correlation between the rate of rearrangement and the local cage structure associated with each particle. Particle trajectories of a two-dimensional binary mixture of soft colloids are captured by video microscopy. We use a machine learning method to calculate particle 2 ̆ 2 softness 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7, which indicates the likelihood of rearrangement based on many radial structural features for each particle. We measured the residence time between consecutive rearrangements and related probability distribution functions (PDFs). The softness-dependent conditional PDF is well fit by an exponential with decay time decreasing monotonically with increasing softness. Using these data and a simple thermal activation model, we determined activation energies for rearrangements. ...|$|R
40|$|Natural seed <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> {{and their}} effects on post-dispersal seed fate are {{critical}} in tropical tree recruitment. Previous research showed that the key dispersal agent of the neotropical tree, Virola calophylla, is the spider monkey (Ateles paniscus). Spider monkeys generate a heterogeneous seed <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> because they scatter-disperse seeds diurnally, whereas they clump-disperse seeds at their sleeping sites. The recruitment consequences of this pattern were investigated using manipulative experiments and observations. Scatter-hoarding by spiny rats (Proechimys spp.) caused little rearrangement of the initial seed <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> because they moved seeds only short distances. Seed survival to the seedling stage depended negatively on conspecific seed density and positively on {{the distance from the}} nearest adult V. calophylla female. These effects were likely mediated by two important seed predators, spiny rats and beetles (Scolytidae). Furthermore, spider monkeys 2 ̆ 7 seed <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> influenced seed survival. Scatter-dispersed and experimentally dispersed seeds had the highest survival. Conversely, clump-dispersed seeds at sleeping sites, which are far from V. calophylla females, and non-dispersed seeds had equally low survival, suggesting that conspecific density- and distance-dependence acted independently and did not explain all variation in seed survival. Instead, other characteristics of the seed <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern,</b> such as the multi-specific assemblage of seeds at sleeping sites, also affected post-dispersal seed fates...|$|R

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{estimation of}} individuals’ age {{is helpful to}} conduct demographic studies on wildlife populations. In tortoises, many studies have estimated individuals’ age by counting growth rings on their scutes, assuming one ring per year (1 : 1 ratio). However, the accuracy of this method is controversial. The ring <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> can vary depending on species, or even populations, and should be studied comprehensively. We studied the ring <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> of Testudo graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula, using recaptures of 156 individuals between 2004 and 2010. We used a novel approach to explore the ring <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> and to test possible differences between localities and individuals. Our results revealed that most analysed individuals (57. 4 %) showed a 1 : 1 ratio, in which rings were deposited during months of activity (spring to autumn). However, we found a trend to count less rings than years, which underestimated 1 year every 3 or 4 years. No differences in the <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> were found among sites, sizes or sexes because the halt in growth during hibernation equally affects all tortoises in all sites. Our results support that the assumed 1 : 1 ratio in the assignment of individuals’ age is too simplistic. Since ring <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> are complex, the use of statistical approaches capable of handling deviations from the assumed deposition ratios can help to better depict population age structures. </p...|$|R

These experimental developments are needed to assess and validate the computational works employed to quantify diphasic flows features in complex realistic geometries with high spatio-temporal resolutions. So far, most in vitro {{studies have focused on}} airflow dynamics characterization. Previous aerosol deposition experiments have mainly provided total or regional deposition efficiency in human or animal models. Yet, the individual particle trajectories and local <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> have been barely investigated, and tracking particle dynamics together with local flow structures still represents a challenging task. The objective of the present work is to characterize unsteady local <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> of aerosols within in vitro simple geometries, as a function of airflow properties. The instantaneous flow velocity fields are obtained using 2 D Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV). The measurement of aerosol concentration fields on the wall is achieved using Rhodamine water solution to provide tracer particles and the Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) technique. Two experimental phases will be presented. The first phase will be dedicated to the case of a round turbulent diphasic jet impinging on a plate under steady flow conditions.

This new method uses an apparatus coupled with a metered dose inhaler to reproducibly deposit spores onto various surfaces. A metered dose inhaler was loaded with Bacillus subtilis spores, a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis.

Also, the rate and extent of absorption from lung after inhalation was shown to be well predicted by <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> {{in combination with the}} expected rate of mucociliary clearance and rate of dissolution in situ as simulated by a computer based mechanistic model. Taken together these observations indicate: (i) that the bioavailability of this compound depends on intra pulmonary <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> and; (ii) that dissolution is the rate limiting step governing the systemic absorption rate for this lipophilic drug. Given that solubility of inhaled glucocorticoids is related to mean absorption time in man (May et al. 2014), this observation can probably be generalized to all inhaled drugs with low water solubility, as discussed above. Hence, it is concluded that rate of dissolution is an important predictor of clinical performance for this class of compounds and that a BCS type of classification could provide an important aid to both compound and product design, if qualified by dose and regional <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|R

At jet Reynolds number Re = 1132, a tapered nozzle deposits particles to form a pattern with a high density ring toward the deposition spot edge, especially for particle Stokes number St > St_ 50, which is absent with a straight nozzle. Increasing the jet-to-plate distance tends to reduce the value of particle density peak near deposition spot edge. Reducing Re to 283 (e. g., for 300 ccm flow through a 1. 5 mm diameter jet nozzle) yields particle <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> without the high density ring at the deposition spot edge when the same tapered nozzle is used. The particle <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> with the straight nozzle at Re = 283 exhibit further reduced particle density around the spot edge such that the particle density profile appears more or less like a Gaussian function. In general, the effect of reducing Re on particle <b>deposition</b> <b>pattern</b> seems to be similar to increasing the jet-to-plate distance. The computed particle deposition efficiency η shows the fact that very fine particles with extremely small values of St near the jet axis always impact the center of plate, indicating that the value of η does not approach zero with a substantial reduction of St. Such a "small particle contamination" typically amounts to ∼ 10 % of small particles (with √(St) < 0. 1) at Re ∼ 1000 and ∼ 5 % at Re ∼ 300, which may not be negligible in data analysis with inertial impactor measurement.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computer {{modelling}} techniques, employing computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) and a finite area element model (FAE), were used to predict snowdrift <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> around a new building at the South Pole Station, Antarctica. Through interpretation of the wind flow field predicted through CFD, snowdrift prone areas around an existing building, that is raised above the snow surface, were identified. The wind flow field, generated by CFD, was subsequently used as input to an FAE computer snowdrift prediction model. The characteristics of the drift <b>deposition</b> <b>patterns</b> predicted by the computer simulation techniques were in satisfactory agreement with snowdrift patterns measured around the existing reference building at the South Pole. It was concluded that the FAE model predicted realistic snowdrift accumulation patterns when CFD-predicted local wind velocity fields were combined with local meteorological data. ...|$|R
