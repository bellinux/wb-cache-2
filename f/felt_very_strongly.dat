5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} {{of art as}} a formative model was something about which Bournonville <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly.</b> In his choreographic credo he writes: It is the mission of art in general, and the theatre in particular, to intensify thought, to elevate the mind, and to refresh the senses. Music and dance elevate the mind and refresh the senses, but it is when the story comes into play that thought is intensified.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Americanism is <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> in Jordan and {{has been}} on the rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East and the Government of Jordan is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of Jordanians is {{among the highest in the}} world. Anti-Americanism rose {{dramatically}} after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and many other allies, invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although negative attitudes have gone down to 85%, anti-Americanism is still amongst the most widespread in Jordan than any other country in the world.|$|E

I am bound {{to say that}} I <b>felt</b> them <b>very</b> <b>strongly.</b> Mr Indefer Jones remarked {{that it was not}} my {{business}} to lecture him on a matter in which his conscience was concerned. In this he was undoubtedly right; but still I thought I had done no more than my duty, and could only be sorry that he was angry with me. I can assure you that I never for a moment entertained a feeling of anger against him. He was altogether in his right, and was actuated simply by a sense of duty." ...|$|R

Yet I wish I could have seen her first, Angel, or have known a little more about her. We sent her no present of our own, not knowing what would best give her pleasure, but you must suppose it only delayed. Angel, there is no irritation in my mind or your father's against you for this marriage; but we have thought it much better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her. And now you have not brought her. It seems strange. What has happened?" ...|$|R
25|$|Lastly, the British felt {{disenchanted with}} Indian {{reaction}} to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like {{the ban on}} sati by Lord William Bentinck. It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows). This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion. The proclamation stated that 'We disclaim alike our Right and Desire to impose Our Convictions on any of Our Subjects'; demonstrating official British commitment to abstaining from social intervention in India.|$|E

Dmowski <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that Poles should abandon {{what he considered}} to be foolish romantic nationalism and useless gestures of defiance and should instead work hard at becoming businessmen and scientists.

60|$|A {{dozen times}} during the night Linda had remembered that her old friend Fanny Heisse, now the wife of Max Bogen, lived at Augsburg, and as she remembered it, she had asked herself {{what she would do}} were she to meet Fanny in the streets. Would Fanny condescend to speak to her, or would Fanny's husband allow his wife to hold any communion with such a castaway? How might she dare to hope that her old friend would do other than shun her, or, at the very least, scorn her, and pass her as a thing unseen? And yet, through all the days of their life, there had been in Linda's world a {{supposition}} that Linda was the good young woman, and that Fanny Heisse was, if not a castaway, one who had made the frivolities of the world so dear to her that she could be accounted as little better than a castaway. Linda's conclusion, as she thought of all this, had been, {{that it would be better}} that she should keep out of the way of the wife of an honest man who knew her. All fellowship hereafter with the wives and daughters of honest men must be denied to her. She had <b>felt</b> this <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> when she had first seen herself in the dawn of the morning.|$|R

Despite their long experience with Wood Badge, they saw the benefit of adding leadership skills development to its requirements. William [...] "Green Bar" [...] Hillcourt, Scoutmaster of the first U.S. Wood Badge course in 1948, <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that the traditional teaching of Scoutcraft skills should be retained. Hillcourt had recently formally retired, but his opinion held considerable weight. Chief Scout Joseph Brunton approved the changes.|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} and critics challenge {{the validity of}} Pinter's critiques of what he terms [...] "the modes of thinking of those in power" [...] or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work. In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being [...] "terribly disturbed {{as a young man}} by the Cold War. And McCarthyism... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> then and feel as strongly now that {{we have an obligation to}} subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny." [...] Scholars agree that Pinter's dramatic rendering of power relations results from this scrutiny.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{was never}} fully {{released}} as a single, Carey <b>felt</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> about {{the song and}} therefore promoted it through several live television and award show appearances. Carey's first live performance of the song was on The Today Show {{as part of a}} mini-concert which aired live on November 2, 1999, from Rockefeller Center in New York. Following the concert on The Today Show, Carey performed the song live at the 2000 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, where she was presented as a featured performer. After the release of [...] "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)", the album's final single, Carey sang them both live on The View in mid-2000. On October 30, 1999, Carey filmed a private concert held at her old high school in Huntington, Long Island, where she taped a special for the Fox Broadcasting Company titled Mariah Carey Homecoming Special, which aired in December of that year. Aside from television performances, the song was part of the set-list on both the Rainbow World Tour, which coincided with the release and promotion of Rainbow, as well as the [...] in 2002–03.

2500|$|After the American Revolutionary War, Quaker and Moravian advocates helped persuade {{numerous}} slaveholders in the Upper South to free their slaves.

The following year Weld encouraged {{a group of students}} at Lane Theological Seminary to form an anti-slavery society. After the president, Lyman Beecher, attempted to suppress it, the students moved to Oberlin College. Due to the students' anti-slavery position, Oberlin soon {{became one of the most}} liberal colleges and accepted African American students. Along with Garrison, were Northcutt and Collins as proponents of immediate abolition.

This can be observed on the loading screens that appear in many PlayStation games but are typically nonexistent in Nintendo 64 games. ROM cartridges are so much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges {{as if they are}} additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM.

2500|$|Other journalistic {{media are}} satirized as well. [...] "Homer Badman" [...] is a satire of shows like Hard Copy.

The talk show [...] "Ben" [...] reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience.
