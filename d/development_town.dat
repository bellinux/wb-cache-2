25|$|After Israel's Declaration of Independence in May 1948, during intense {{shelling}} by Syrian border units, {{followed by}} the recapture of the valley by the Haganah, the Arab inhabitants fled across the Jordan River. The property and buildings abandoned after the conflict were then held {{by the state of}} Israel. Most Arab Christians relocated to Nazareth. A ma'abarah (refugee camp) inhabited mainly by North African Jewish refugees was erected in Beit She'an, and it later became a <b>development</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Rebbe's {{decision}} {{to move to the}} United States was not a permanent one. Throughout his travails in the Holocaust, he always had in mind the goal of settling in Israel. Toward that end, he established the Kiryat Sanz neighborhood in the beachside city of Netanya in 1958. In so doing, he was the first Rebbe to establish a Haredi neighborhood in an Israeli <b>development</b> <b>town.</b> Over the next few years, he raised money for the establishment of key neighborhood institutions, including girls' and boys' schools and yeshivas, an orphanage, and an old-age home.|$|E
25|$|Acre was {{captured}} by Israel on 17 May 1948, displacing about three-quarters of the Arab population of the city (13,510 of 17,395). Throughout the 1950s, many Jewish neighbourhoods were established at the northern and eastern parts of the city, as it became a <b>development</b> <b>town,</b> designated to absorb numerous Jewish immigrants, largely Jews from Morocco. The old city of Akko remained largely Arab Muslim (including several Bedouin families), with an Arab Christian neighbourhood in close proximity. The city also attracted Bahá'í worshippers, some of whom became permanent residents in the city, where the Bahá'í Mansion of Bahjí is located. Acre has {{also served as a}} base for important events in Baha'i history, including being the birthplace of Shoghi Effendi, and the short-lived schism between Baha'is initiated by the attacks by Mírzá Muhammad `Alí against `Abdu'l-Bahá. Baha'is have since commemorated various events that have occurred in the city, including the imprisonment of Bahá'u'lláh.|$|E

40|$|This paper characterizes {{families}} that changed their locality of residence within Israel – internal migration. The analysis draws on a nation-wide sample of households in 1983 and 1995, combining {{the characteristics of}} the migrants with those of the localities of origin and destination. The findings indicate that: internal migration is of significant scope with 17 percent of the families examined changing their locality; the likelihood of migrating rises with income and educational attainment, and declines with age up to a certain point, after which the latter trend is reversed; localities differ substantially in their balance of migration and {{the characteristics of the}} migrants. We further analyze two important processes that have attracted considerable public attention: the rise of the suburbs, and the weakening of the <b>development</b> <b>towns.</b> We find that strong populations leave the metropolitan areas – in particular, the strongest move to affluent suburbs and rural communities. We also document a significant net flow out of the <b>development</b> <b>towns,</b> especially among young well-educated couples. Those who leave the <b>development</b> <b>towns</b> differ in their destination: Many of those leaving the <b>development</b> <b>towns</b> in the north stay in the region – the strongest of whom move to rural communities there – while among those leaving the towns in the south, a larger fraction moves {{to the center of the}} country. The net negative migration balance in the <b>development</b> <b>towns</b> is all the more noteworthy considering the longstanding policy to strengthen these towns and the periphery in general. The flow of strong families – from the metropolitan areas as well as from the <b>development</b> <b>towns</b> – to smaller and more homogeneous localities has important policy implications regarding the rise in disparities among localities. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{framework}} {{for studying the}} ownership structure of industry in Israel's <b>development</b> <b>towns</b> is outlined, putting special emphasis on defining factors influencing entrepreneurship among residents of these towns, and relating these factors to theories of entrepreneurship in space, and to those of entrepreneurship among immigrant groups. Factors affecting external ownership of single-plant firms and location decisions of multiplant firms are considered in light of theories of industrial organization. Firms of different types are shown to react differently to the incentives of the Israeli spatial economic policy. Thus, whereas residents of the <b>development</b> <b>towns</b> benefit little from these capital incentives, nonlocally owned single-plant firms are most attracted by them. However, externally owned small single-plant firms {{have been shown to}} suffer from the greatest instability and to form very few local linkages. Another policy failure was the inability to attract government-owned military industries to the <b>development</b> <b>towns.</b> ...|$|R
