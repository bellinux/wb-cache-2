500|$|On June 15, 1953, Houtteman {{was traded}} by the Tigers, along with Owen Friend, Joe Ginsberg and Bill Wight, to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Boone, Al Aber, Steve Gromek and Dick Weik. In July 1953, he {{returned}} to Detroit to pitch against the Tigers. At the time, Houtteman admitted {{he wanted to be}} traded. [...] He said, [...] "The fans are <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> and I'd do everybody a lot more good by being traded". He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when it seemed he [...] "couldn't wait to peel off his uniform after a game". As a result of Indians' pitching coach Mel Harder doing a [...] "complete" [...] overhaul, Houtteman was moved into the starting rotation, to replace Bob Feller. Houtteman finished the season in Cleveland with a 7–7 record, six complete games, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA.|$|E

2500|$|Rodger {{wrote in}} his {{manifesto}} of his plan to invade a sorority house, which he concluded symbolized the world that tortured him, beautiful women who he believed would have rejected him. He wrote, [...] "I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up, blond slut I see inside there. All those girls I've desired so much. They have all rejected me and looked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> as an inferior man." [...] When Rodger was unable {{to gain access to}} the sorority house after [...] "vigorous knocking" [...] on the sorority house door, he improvised, opening fire on nearby women students.|$|E
2500|$|His last public {{appearance}} came in 1936, {{when he was}} invited to be a guest of honour by the organizers of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. After bearing the standard of the Greek team during the opening ceremonies, he was received by Adolf Hitler and offered him an olive branch from Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, as a symbol of peace. Louis recalled the moments after his victory: [...] "That hour was something unimaginable and it still appears to me in my memory like a dream … Twigs and flowers were raining <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> Everybody was calling out my name and throwing their hats in the air …" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Beat Fleet, a Croatian hip hop band, wrote a {{song called}} [...] "Data" [...] for their album Galerija Tutnplok {{dedicated}} to Data. The release of this album coincided with reruns of Star Trek: The Next Generation being shown on Croatian Radiotelevision. In 2005, the nerdcore group The Futuristic Sex Robotz released a song about Data entitled [...] "The Positronic Pimp." [...] Cuban-American musician Aurelio Voltaire has also performed a song about Data entitled [...] "The Sexy Data Tango" [...] on his LP Banned on Vulcan and later his album BiTrektual. [...] Punk rock group Warp 11 also has a song, [...] "My Electric Man", from their album Boldly Go <b>Down</b> <b>on</b> <b>Me,</b> as well as numerous other references in other songs.|$|E

2500|$|Several of Károlyi's {{athletes from}} the [...] "six-pack" [...] era have criticized his {{training}} methods. Some {{of his former}} athletes, including Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, and Erica Stokes, have stated publicly that Károlyi was verbally and psychologically abusive during workouts. Károlyi's constant critical remarks about weight and body type were said to drive some gymnasts to develop eating disorders and low self-esteem. Some gymnasts, such as Phillips, Moceanu, and 1988 Olympian Chelle Stack, have also said they were compelled to continue training and competing even when coping with serious injuries such as broken bones. In one interview, Moceanu, {{who was one of}} Károlyi's final protégés, said: [...] "I'm sure Bela saw injuries, but if you were injured, Bela didn't want to see it. ... You had to deal with it. I was intimidated. He looked <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> He was six-feet something, and I was four-foot nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Livni {{noted in}} a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin's policies at the time. [...] "The dispute is around {{the question of whether}} you can have it both ways—maintaining Israel as a Jewish state and keeping the entire Land of Israel," [...] she said. Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> because of what happened to us, to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|T.I. {{was also}} {{able to work with}} fellow Atlanta rapper, Outkast's André 3000 for the first time after years of trying to collaborate: [...] "We've been trying to put this {{particular}} collaboration together since the King album. Every album since King I've called Andre and been like 'Hey, I'm working on an album, let's get together.' And he'd say 'Okay, let's see what we got that makes sense.' And we've met a handful of times. This {{is the first time that}} it ... came together. I'm extremely proud, honored, and privileged." [...] And while T.I. admits that André 3000 out shined on [...] "Sorry," [...] he’s not mad: [...] "He did get <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> on my record, I can’t front," [...] laughs Tip. [...] "But to me I’m honored and it’s a pleasure that he would even choose my record to do that on." [...] The song was co-produced by former Grand Hustle intern Sir Clef alongside Jazze Pha, the latter of whom has helmed tracks for T.I. such as [...] "Chooz You" [...] and [...] "Let's Get Away".|$|E

2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure here was to discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I am grateful for the tidal wave that came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> The activism that goes on online is [...] important." ...|$|E
2500|$|Outside the {{critical}} reevaluation of local literature, Gârbea's work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post-1989 society and modern Romanian culture. One such chapter {{is built around}} the polemic between Gârbea and writer Gheorghe Grigurcu, {{over the issue of}} what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged. Another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of instant messaging on the Romanian lexis, with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as sal (for salut, [...] "hello"), vb (vorbim, [...] "we'll talk") and ms (mersi, [...] "thanks"). Gârbea also pokes fun at the babytalk-based jargon of parenting magazines, and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son Tudor. It reads: [...] " [...] does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness, but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of The Unknown. When I call him using his human name, he smiles <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> with devastating irony, so that I may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability. No matter what will happen in the future, these winter days [...] shall always remain for me under the sign of having met, {{for the first time in}} life, an inexplicable creature." ...|$|E
