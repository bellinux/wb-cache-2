50|$|Newman {{has very}} strong and {{sometimes}} controversial views {{on a variety of}} subjects, and these are reflected in his choice of subjects for writing. He has little faith in conventional medicine, believing that alternative therapy is far more effective. He claims that doctors are not interested in prevention, and are too close to the interests of the major pharmaceutical companies in just releasing ever more powerful drugs. He does acknowledge the benefits of nursing though, and in The Nation's Health, a newly qualified doctor goes to work at an NHS hospital- with her training taking her through the hospital's various departments, her idealistic aspirations come under threat. He is also not impressed by the police service. He joked that he would rather see community members wearing pink uniforms working to prevent disturbances in their own areas. He is also a devout vegan, and when producing or directing television programmes insists that no meat at all is consumed on the sets. He says he has no problem with the act of eating flesh in itself, but it is the attitude that because one species is stronger or more sophisticated than another it has the right to kill it which he is strongly against. Therefore, if an animal died of natural causes and someone wanted to eat it he would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Having no political allegiance to either left or right wings, he once considered starting his own party on his passionate issues, but realized that getting over 600 strong candidates who completely agreed with all his views would be too tough.|$|E
40|$|Knowing {{where and}} when to sell Cue: For farmers, knowing {{where and when}} to sell their crops {{is one of the}} most {{difficult}} challenges. If they have no knowledge of current market prices, they can easily be exploited. But gathering information about markets may not be easy, especially for people living in very remote areas. So is there anywhere they can get help? According to Fred Frimpong, agricultural coordinator for the Millennium Villages project in Ghana, one answer may lie in teaming up with other farmers. In an interview with Kofi Adu Domfeh, Mr Frimpong began by explaining why having information about market prices is so important. IN:	?The whole idea is about knowing ? OUT:	? which they will get more. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 49 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Fred Frimpong of the Millennium Villages Project in Ghana. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Frimpong	The whole idea is about knowing where you get the right prices for your produce and selling at the right time. So there should be a means of basing your decisions on certain bits of information. What is the price on the market like? How much is it being sold for, per mini-bag, per maxi-bag? Is that the price I want? Looking at the investment I made, will I make any profits if I sell at that rate? You know farmers should be able to make all these decisions and it is based on the market research information that is available to them, that they can make these decisions. So that we look at agriculture from a more business angle, rather than as something we are just doing to occupy ourselves. Domfeh	In general terms, how important is market research to cash crop farmers? Frimpong	In fact, if we were able to take care of marketing of foodstuffs, and undertake the right market research in the country, I guess half of the problems of farmers would be solved. The problem is not increasing production. Even with our subsistence tools, like the hoes and cutlasses, farmers are willing to go all out, till the land and get a lot of output. They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Their problem is what to do with their produce. So there is no way any of us can underestimate the important role that market research plays in this direction, because if we are doing all we can to ensure that they produce and produce more, high quality and store well, and they can?t market, virtually we have defeated the entire purpose. So it is very important that market research is undertaken. Domfeh	Do you think farmers always have to visit several markets at different times, observing what people are selling and buying and talking to people in a bid to actually obtain market information? Frimpong	Not necessarily. You see we are looking forward to the day when farmers will be well organised, so that through the cooperative departments, the cooperative officers at the district level, they can link up with markets and do the market research. You know farming is a time-bound activity. You have to undertake certain field activities during certain times of the year. If you miss that you have problems with the yield. So usually farmers don?t have time to go out to the market and do the kind of research that you are talking about. That would have been the ideal, but there are so many constraints. So if they are in cooperatives, and they have the market research unit within the cooperative, then that unit can take care of the market research and then the others can concentrate on production. So yes, that survey would be important, but it shouldn?t be the headache of every individual farmer. Domfeh	How then do they find out the best places to sell their crops and make contacts with those potential buyers? Frimpong	What we do is we go, scout for buyers for them, and then we link them up. There is another key thing that we are doing. We don?t want a situation where farmers will be dealing with wholesalers and people who come to buy their foodstuffs on an individual basis. So we are also encouraging farmers to form cooperatives, so that they can negotiate for inputs as a group, and also negotiate, bargain on market terms as a group. They will have a stronger bargaining power when they are together. So that is another key thing that we are doing. Even as we link them up with markets, we are also putting the farmers into strong cooperatives. Domfeh	Value addition to cash crop produce is very important, but how does the farmer undertake this in a cost effective way, while also maintaining quality of the yield? Frimpong	If farmers come together they can source loans and access funds; then they can get more into processing. So value addition is very important. In fact if farmers have the capacity to add value to whatever they produce, then post-harvest losses wouldn?t be a headache. You know, farming is a capital intensive business, so at the end of the season the farmer has a lot of debts to clear. So all most farmers are interested in is to sell off whatever they have so they can take care of their household, and pay off whatever debts they have. That?s a huge challenge. So I guess that if we are able to build them to a level where certain basic needs are taken care of, they wouldn?t mind taking their time to get into value addition of their products, processing them into second class products, before going ahead to sell, which they will get more. End of track. Importance of having market information, and how being a member of a group can help in getting i...|$|E
