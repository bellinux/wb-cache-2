2500|$|In 1903, Remington painted His First Lesson set on an American-owned {{ranch in}} Chihuahua, Mexico. The hands wear heavy chaps, starched white shirts, and slouch-brimmed hats. In his paintings, Remington sought {{to let his}} {{audience}} [...] "take away {{something to think about}} – to imagine." [...] In 1905, Remington had a major publicity coup when Collier's devoted an entire issue to the artist, showcasing his latest works. It was that same year {{that the president of the}} Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) commissioned Remington to create a large sculpture of a cowboy for Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, which was erected in 1908 on a jutting rock along <b>Kelly</b> <b>Drive</b> – a site Remington specifically chose for the piece after having a horseman pose for him in that exact location. Philadelphia's Cowboy (1908) was Remington's first and only large-scale bronze, and the sculpture is one of the earliest examples of site-specific art in the United States.|$|E

[...] The attacks brought unwelcome negative press to DC, and the ultimate failure in the House of Representatives of DC statehood legislation weakened her political capital.

East of Conshohocken at about mile marker 331, it curves sharply southeast in a 90-degree turn locally known as the [...] "Conshohocken Curve" [...] or [...] "Conshy Curve", which has a history of traffic congestion and dangerous conditions. I-76 continues southeast through wooded areas, with the railroad tracks and the river parallel to the northeast. Farther southeast, the Schuylkill Expressway comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with Hollow Road that provides access to the Main Line community of Gladwyne. The freeway passes over the Flat Rock Tunnel carrying Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and continues to the southeast with the Schuylkill River to the northeast and the railroad tracks to the southwest. I-76 comes to a diamond interchange with Belmont Avenue and Green Lane, with Belmont Avenue heading south through Lower Merion Township and Green Lane crossing the river into the Philadelphia neighborhood of Manayunk. Following this interchange, the freeway passes under the Manayunk Bridge that carries the Cynwyd Heritage Trail across the Schuylkill River. The Schuykill Expressway passes over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and runs southeast between the West Laurel Hill Cemetery to the southwest and an industrial area to the northeast that is sandwiched between the railroad tracks and the river.

50|$|Tander was {{the winner}} of the first Bathurst 24hr race driving a {{modified}} Holden Monaro 427C running a 7.0L (427cui) motor rather than the 5.7L Gen III that the road car runs.

Tander was widely tipped to drive the Monaro for GRM in the Australian Nations Cup Championship in 2003 but concentrated instead on V8 Supercars with the drive going to Nathan Pretty. In the 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour Tander, again driving the very same Monaro from 2002 with the same co-drivers in the same team, came second to the team's second Monaro driven by Peter Brock, Greg Murphy, Jason Bright and Todd <b>Kelly.</b> <b>Driving</b> at the end, Tander finished only 0.2 seconds behind Greg Murphy with Tander setting the race's fastest lap on lap 526, the second last of the race.
