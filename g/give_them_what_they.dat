2500|$|The Princess's {{influential}} short hairstyle {{was created}} by Sam McKnight after a Vogue shoot in 1990, which, in McKnight and Donatella Versace's opinion, showed her liberty. The Princess reportedly did her own make up and would always have a hairstylist by her side before an event, on which she told McKnight: [...] "It's not for me, Sam. It is for the people I visit or who come to see me. They don't want me in off-duty mode, they want a princess. Let’s <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want." ...|$|E

As the royal nanny, she soon began to make headlines. Early {{controversy}} came when she said scornfully of the Princess of Wales's attitude towards her sons: [...] "I <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need at this stage, fresh air, a rifle and a horse. She gives them a tennis racket and a bucket of popcorn at the movies". It was also considered to be a gaffe when Tiggy referred to William and Harry as [...] "my babies".|$|E

60|$|Now is not {{the answer}} to the puzzle this: That God is impartial; that He is no respecter of persons, but causing His sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and His rain to fall on the just and on the unjust; and so {{rewarding}} every man according to his work, paying him for all work done, of whatever kind it may be? Some work for this world, which we do see, and God <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> earn in this life; some work for the world above, which we cannot see, and God <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> earn in this life, for ever and ever likewise.

[...] Regarding the series airing on a network that broadcasts other reality shows featuring uncritical depictions of sexuality and alcohol as recurring themes, he said, [...] "The people that need what we have are watching VH1.

[...] It is a troublesome thing, environment, for it sometimes works positively and sometimes negatively, and more often between the two. A beautiful environment may make a child love beauty; it may make him bored with beauty; most likely the two effects will mix and neutralise each other.

Although the interviewers liked Jennifer M., they felt that she was just <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted to hear, rather than what she really had to say. The executives did like Sandy, but they deemed her unworthy of working for Trump, mainly because they were unsure of her ability to transition into a corporate environment and worried about her lack of a college degree.|$|R
50|$|The {{consequences}} of this were to make themselves clear in 1859. Now Camillo di Cavour, the Prime Minister of Sardinia-Piedmont, anxious to goad the Austrians into a war in which {{he knew he would}} have French support, engaged in a series of provocations against the Austrian position in Italy. Although Buol and the Austrians initially seemed unperturbed, to the extent that Cavour and his ally, Emperor Napoleon III of France, feared they {{would not be able to}} have their war, Buol soon <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted by a clumsy ultimatum demanding Piedmontese demobilization.

6000|$|These Neapolitans {{always ask}} {{four times as}} much money as they intend to take, but if you <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> first demand, they feel ashamed of {{themselves}} for aiming so low, and immediately ask more.

One [...] "course," [...] in a two-horse carriage, costs a franc--that is law--but the hackman always demands more, on some pretence or other, and if he gets it he makes a new demand. It is said that a stranger took a one-horse carriage for a course --tariff, half a franc. He gave the man five francs, by way of experiment. He demanded more, and received another franc. Again he demanded more, and got a franc--demanded more, and it was refused. He grew vehement --was again refused, and became noisy. The stranger said, [...] "Well, give me the seven francs again, and I will see what I can do"--and when he got them, he handed the hackman half a franc, and he immediately asked for two cents to buy a drink with. It may be thought that I am prejudiced.|$|E
6000|$|Francie's visitor {{came down}} {{a few minutes later}} and passed through the court and out of the hotel without looking at them. Mr. Dosson had been going to call after him, but Delia checked him with a violent pinch. The unsociable manner of the young journalist's {{departure}} deepened Mr. Dosson's dull ache over the mystery of things. I think this may be said to have been the only incident in the whole business that gave him a personal pang. He remembered how many of his cigars he had smoked with Mr. Flack and how universal a participant he had made him. This haughtiness struck him as the failure of friendship--not the publication of details about the Proberts. Interwoven with Mr. Dosson's nature was the view that if these people had done bad things they ought to be ashamed of themselves and he couldn't pity them, and that if they hadn't done them there was no need of making such a rumpus about other people's knowing. It was therefore, in spite of the young man's rough exit, still in the tone of American condonation that he had observed to Delia: [...] "He says that's what they like over there and that {{it stands to reason that}} if you start a paper you've got to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> like.
