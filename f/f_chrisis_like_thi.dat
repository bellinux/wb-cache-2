40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} estimations of the longshore sediment transport {{were applied to}} a beach in the northern Cádiz Bay. In the first case, several predictive models were applied by combining energetic, morphological and sedimentological characteristics of the beach. In the second case, a field experiment was been carried out by injecting tracers in the beachface, with a later sampling permitted to determine the displacement of the centre of mass. At the same time, remobilization depth was quantified by using rods and sticks. As a conclusion, it can be stated that the models give super-estimations of the real amount of transported sediment measured in the field. This contradiction confirms the limited applicability of these kind of predictive models in a low energy coast <b>like</b> <b>thi...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{test the}} {{accuracy}} and reproducibility of the tangential breast treatment set-up used in The Netherlands Cancer Institute, a portal imaging study {{was performed in}} 12 patients treated for early stage breast cancer. With an on-line electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images were obtained of each patient in several fractions and compared with simulator films and with each other. In five patients, multiple images (on the average 7) per fraction were obtained to evaluate set-up variations due to respiratory movement. The central lung distance (CLD) and other set-up parameters varied within one fraction about 1 mm (1 SD). The average variation of these parameters between various fractions was about 2 mm (1 SD). The differences between simulator and treatment set-up over all patients and all fractions was on the average 2 - 3 mm for the central beam edge to skin distance and the central lung distance. It can be concluded that the tangential breast treatment set-up is very stable and reproducible and that respiration {{does not have a}} significant influence on treatment volume. The EPID appears to be an adequate tool for studies of treatment set-up accuracy <b>like</b> <b>thi...</b>|$|R

The title is a reference to the character Thị Nở in Nam Cao's 1941 short story Chí Phèo, a woman who is well known for her unattractive appearance. Nhà văn như Thị Nở is a collection of essays of literary criticism, discussing fifty-one Vietnamese writers including Nam Trân, Thế Lữ, Hải Triều, Hoài Thanh, Nguyễn Tuân, Trương Tửu, Bích Khê, Xuân Diệu, Tố Hữu, Nguyễn Huy Tưởng, Nguyễn Hữu Đang, Hoàng Cầm, Trần Dần, Lê Đạt, Phùng Quán, Bùi Ngọc Tấn, Nguyễn Xuân Khánh, Dương Tường, Bảo Ninh, Nguyễn Quang Lập, and Vi Thùy Linh. Nguyên stated that it took him so long to come out with the book because he was too lazy to collect his previous essays and edit them into a coherent whole; in particular, he mentioned the World Cup season as one of the various reasons for his delays in submitting the final version to the publisher Nhã Nam for printing. Editor Diệu Thủy stated that the whole process took more than four years, and that at one time she even jokingly threatened to burn down Nguyên's house {{in an effort to get}} him to submit a draft.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} examples for interacting quantum field theory models, the methods of euclidean field theory {{have turned out to}} be a powerful tools since they make use of the techniques of classical statistical mechanics. Starting from an appropriate set of euclidean n-point functions (Schwinger distributions), a Wightman theory can be reconstructed by an application of the famous Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem. This procedure (Wick rotation), which relates classical statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, is, however, somewhat subtle. It relies on the analytic properties of the euclidean n-point functions. We shall present here a C*-algebraic version of the Osterwalder-Scharader reconstruction theorem. We shall see that, via our reconstruction scheme, a Haag-Kastler net of bounded operators can directly be reconstructed.

40|$|Nepal {{has some}} of the highest under-nutrition rates, {{especially}} in children, of all low-income countries. Despite this we still have limited insight into the views and opinions of those feeding the children at risk of under-nutrition. Objective: To assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about nutritious food mothers in one district in Nepal whose children are aged 3 to 5. Methods: A cross-sectional, community-based survey of 524 mothers in Kaski district of Nepal among children aged 36 - 60 months who are no longer breastfed at the time. The questionnaire included: socio-demographic measurements, knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about nutritious food, as well as child feeding patterns, food recommendation, major barriers, food insecurity and health-seeking behaviours. Data were added to a computer data base and analysed using SPSS. Results: There were more urban mothers (56 %) than rural mothers (44 %) in the survey. The mothers perceived major barriers to recommending nutritious foods to include: lack of knowledge (19 %); high market prices (21 %); and cultural influences or beliefs (7 %). The study showed nearly 55 % children were given fruit once a week. Almost 37 % of mothers never gave meat, fish and eggs regularly to their children and 34 % of mothers could not choose nutritious food from the grocery store, 12 % of the respondents lacked food. The majority of children (57 %) had been taken at least once to a spiritual healer for treatment and 16 % more than once. Conclusion: Both urban and rural mothers lacked knowledge of what food is nutritious or not whilst their attitudes and views appear ill informed [...] . Mothers from both rural and urban communities have high faith in spiritual healers. Thus this study suggests that a different approach was needed because the public health problems are associated with behaviour. Thus, special attention should be paid on appropriate intervention of under-nutrition in poor communities <b>like</b> <b>thi...</b>|$|R

40|$|Precipitation {{traditionally}} observed using raingages or weather stations, {{is one of}} {{the main}} parameters that has direct impact on runoff production. This pPrecipitation data requires a preliminary spatial interpolation prior to hydrological modeling. The accuracy of modelling result is determined bydepends on the accuracy of the interpolated spatial rainfall which differs according to different interpolation methods. The accuracy of the interpolated spatial rainfall is usually determined by cross-validation method. The objective of this study is to assess the different interpolation methods of daily rainfall at the watershed scale through hydrological modelling and to explore the best methods that provides a good long term simulation. Four versions of geostatistics: Ordinary Kriging (ORK), Universal Kriging (UNK), Kriging with External Dridft (KED) and Ordinary Cokriging (OCK) and two types of deterministic methods: Thiessen polygon (THI) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) are used to produce 30 -year daily rainfall inputs for a distributed physically-based hydrological model (EPIC-GRID). This work is conducted in the Ourthe and Ambleve nested catchments, located in the Ardennes hilly landscape in the Walloon region, Belgium. The total catchment area is 2908 km², lies between 67 and 693 m in elevation. The multivariate geostatistics (KED and OCK) are also used by incorporating elevation as external data to improve the rainfall prediction. This work also aims at analysing the effect of different raingage densities and position used for interpolation, on the stream flow modelled to get insight in terms of the capability and limitation of the geostatistical methods. The number of raingage varies from 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 8 to 4 stations located in and surrounding the catchment area. In the latter case, we try to use different positions: around the catchment and only a part of the catchment. The result shows that the simple method <b>like</b> <b>THI</b> fails to capture the rainfall and to produce good flow simulation when using 4 raingages. The KED and UNK are comparable to other methods for a raingage case that in which stations are located around the catchment area, especially in the high elevation catchment but the worst methods for other raingage position cases where the rainfall stations are located only at a part and mostly outside of the catchment area. However, three methods (IDW, ORK and OCK) can overcome this problem since they are more robust and can provide good performance of simulation in all raingage densities. When using 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 8 raingages in the catchment area (2908 km²), no substantial differences in model performance are observed...|$|R

Karz may have also been inspired by the 1958 Hindi film Madhumati. Karz was itself remade several times: as the Kannada film Yuga Purusha (1989), the Tamil film Enakkul Oruvan (1984), and more recently the Hindi film Karzzzz (2008).

40|$|The basic {{reality in}} 2002 facing {{those of us}} who want to take {{legislative}} initiatives to protect unborn children from abortion is that the Supreme Court has left us little space in which to act. In a line of decisions that reached full definition in Webster and Casey and consistent application through Stenberg, the Court has painted in big red letters that states, and by implication Congress, cannot pass laws that prevent an adult woman from having her pre-viable unborn child aborted. Once her child reaches the point of viability, the situation changes dramatically. States can then adopt laws that directly protect the child from abortion. We may not like this division of a child’s life into protectible and non-protectible zones, but there is {{nothing we can do about}} it legislatively right now. If we do not keep that fact at the center of our attention, we will burn up our available energy, time and talent for nothing, because each time the Supreme Court will throw our work into the shredder. Of course, we all hope that the Supreme Court will get new pro-life members and that a new majority will re-extend the zone of protectibility to all of a child’s life. But that Court majority does not yet exist, and it may not exist for some time, after which other years may pass before it fully corrects the errors of 1973. So, we should look now at what the Court has given us to work with and use it to extend legal protection to those we can protect. While we are waiting for the new pro-life majority on the Court, we should use the time to fill up the space the present Court has given us to work with. This means two things. First, before viability we continue to push women’s right to know laws, public funding cutoffs, and the <b>like.</b> Second, and <b>thi...</b>|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyLow dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHIs) is a {{cost-effective}} alternative to traditional thermodynamic inhibitors (<b>THIs),</b> <b>like</b> methanol and glycols, {{to prevent the}} occurrence of natural gas hydrates in gas and oilfield operations. One class of LDHIs is the kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs). KHIs have been used commercially in the field for the last 15 years, and the development and search for new KHIs is an ongoing process. This report describes how high pressure rocker rigs can be used to rank KHIs based on their effectiveness and efficiency under different conditions. The high pressure rocker rig used for this thesis was delivered at the end of November, and the experiments started on December 1 st. The last experiment took place May 2 nd. The Rocking Cell RC 5 has five cells that provide five individual results from every experiment. This makes it a very time-effective rocker rig compared to, say, autoclaves, where one normally only obtains one result per day. Since the start-up with the rocker rig in December there have been no major problems, and so it has been a very reliable piece of equipment. A procedure for the Rocking Cell RC 5 has been established. Experiments are run using a constant cooling method and an isothermal method. The reproducibility was found to be best using the constant cooling method. Compared to alternative apparatus the reproducibility has proven to be very good. Reported information from experiences using autoclaves, say that the scattering in hold time using non-precursor methods is usually 30 - 40 % on either side of average of series. Using the constant cooling method the scattering in hold time is found to be within 4. 4 %. The main focus of these thesis has been testing four already known KHIs; Luvicap 55 W, Luvicap EG, Inhibex 101 and Inhibex 501. The chemicals are ranked based on how well they inhibit the gas hydrate formation. Inhibex 101 was found to be the best one, both using the constant cooling method and the isothermal method. Since there are no thorough published studies available on the use of rocker rigs to rank the performance of KHIs, the results cannot be compared to experiments from other groups. For some results, more tests should therefore be run to check the validity of the results...|$|R
