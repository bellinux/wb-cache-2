2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1951, she was fed up; two marriages had failed, and she was typecast in Hollywood as a sex symbol. As {{a result of her}} disillusionment with Hollywood and not liking what it did with people, she walked out on Hollywood, took her three children, and headed to New York to restart her career. Lake wanted to leave her sexy image behind, and New York offered the {{opportunity}} to work in theater and the new medium, television."They said, 'She'll be back in a couple of months'", recalled Lake.

2500|$|These {{claims are}} {{directly}} contradicted by comments from actresses like Cybill Shepherd, who acknowledged her {{affair with the}} singer and said to have introduced Elvis to certain amorous techniques. However, the [...] "much-quoted claims that she taught him the joys of oral sex is viewed with skepticism by other lovers of the King." [...] In an interview, Shepherd reveals that Presley kissed her all over her naked body – but refused to have oral sex with her. His slow tender kisses ended at her bellybutton. Elvis explained to her, [...] "Me and the guys talk and, well, we don't eat pussy." [...] She always knew their relationship was doomed and they wouldn't last as a couple. She says, [...] "The fact is, Elvis got hooked on speed in the army. ... Then it got out of control. <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be with someone who would have dragged me down? The only way to have stayed with Elvis was by doing drugs.".|$|E
2500|$|Some saw the Defence Secretary post as {{a reward}} for Portillo's {{cautious}} loyalty to Major during the 1995 leadership challenge of John Redwood, following Major's [...] "back me or sack me" [...] resignation as party leader. Many urged Portillo, the [...] "darling of the right", to run against Major. He declined to enter the first round, but planned to challenge Major if the contest went to a second round. To this end, he set up a potential campaign headquarters, with banks of telephone lines. He later admitted that this had been an error: [...] "I did not want to oppose , but neither <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to close the possibility of entering a second ballot if it came to that." [...] Portillo acknowledged that [...] "ambiguity is unattractive" [...] and his opponents within the party later used Portillo's apparent equivocation as an example of his indecisiveness; [...] "I appeared happy to wound but afraid to strike: a dishonourable position." ...|$|E

2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E

60|$|Did I? I {{tried to}} put the {{question}} to myself and answer it honestly. Yes, in a sense, I had changed tonight. There was an added appreciation of her fineness, a quickening of that blend of admiration and pity which I had always felt for her. I wanted with all my heart to help her, to take her away from her dreadful surroundings, to make her happy. But <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> her in the sense in which she had used the word? <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> her as I had wanted Audrey Blake? I winced away from the question.
