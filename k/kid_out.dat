500|$|Eminem {{also became}} a highly {{controversial}} figure due to his lyrical content. [...] He was labeled as [...] "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of [...] "making money by exploiting the world's misery." [...] During a radio appearance in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about [...] "slapping a pregnant bitch" [...] {{to the extent that}} she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP on-air. The rapper defended himself by saying, [...] "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every <b>kid</b> <b>out</b> there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be." ...|$|E

[...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little <b>kid</b> <b>out</b> there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'." [...] Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.|$|E
2500|$|Noel {{admits that}} certain {{lines from the}} song are lifted from John Lennon: [...] "I got this tape in the United States that had {{apparently}} been burgled from the Dakota Hotel and someone had found these cassettes. Lennon was starting to record his memoirs on tape. He's going on about 'trying to start a revolution from me bed, because they said the brains I had went to my head.' I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old <b>kid</b> <b>out</b> there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?" [...] Gallagher also admits that he was under the influence of illegal substances when he wrote the song and to this day he claims he does not know what it means.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first of}} the two main events on the show was the first ever Copa Antonio Peña, a 12-man {{gauntlet}} match, where two wrestlers begin in the ring and each time a wrestler is defeated he {{is replaced by a}} new wrestler until all 12 wrestlers have entered the match. The focus of the event was the storyline between La Legión Extranjera ("The Foreign Legion" [...] in Spanish) and the [...] "AAA Loyalists". The match started out with La Legión member X-Pac facing and defeating Super Porky in short order. AAA Loyalist Mascara Divina was the next competitor, eliminating X-Pac after approximately five minutes of action. Next Mascara Divina faced Legiónaire Kenzo Suzuki who made short work of Divina, eliminating him after only a couple of minutes of wrestling. Next Kenzo Suzuki eliminated AAA Icon La Parka, taking advantage of La Parka's shoulder injury. AAA wrestler Laredo Kid surprisingly pinned Suzuki next, giving the young wrestlers one of his biggest wins to date. Unfortunately Laredo Kid suffered a serious leg injury while executing a move on Ron Killings and was eliminated from the match. The injury kept Laredo <b>Kid</b> <b>out</b> of the ring for months. The seventh competitor was Alan Stone, rolling up Ron Killings to eliminate him, only to face his main storyline rival Scorpio, Jr. as the next entrant. Scorpio, Jr. soon got help from his Los Guapos team mates Zumbido and Decnis but Alan Stone still managed to pin Scorpio, Jr. After the loss all three Guapos' attacked Alan Stone, drawing blood. The next competitor was Charly Manson, a member of the very popular Los Hell Brothers faction, who pinned Alan Stone after nine minutes of wrestling. The next competitor was the surprise appearance of Scott Hall, brought in by La Legión as their secret weapon. Konnan, the leader of La Legión made his surprise return as well, recovered from a kidney operation he accompanied Scott Hall to ringside. Manson overcame interference from Konnan, X-Pac and Ron Killings to pin Scott Hall. Just as Charly Manson thought he had won the gauntlet match Konnan attacked him from behind, revealing that he was the final competitor. In the end La Parka came to the ring, thwarting La Legión's plans, helping Charly Manson pin Konnan and win the first Copa Antonio Peña. Following the match Charly Manson was presented with a medal, bearing the image of Antonio Peña, by Joaquin Roldan, Peña's successor as AAA booker.|$|E
2500|$|Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, a cool, efficient, {{resourceful}} {{young woman}} who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls' school. She has largely worked at secretarial jobs ever since {{her job as a}} governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton, whom she intentionally allowed to swim out to sea – as the child had wanted to do, but had theretofore been denied as too dangerous – and drowned. She did this so her lover, Cyril's uncle, Hugo Hamilton, could become the family heir, inherit the estate and marry her, which had been their original plan before Cyril's birth changed things. She swam out to sea to [...] "save" [...] Cyril to make it seem he had disobeyed her – as she had consistently told him it was too dangerous – but knowing she would not arrive in time. Her plan backfired when Hugo, who loved his nephew, abandoned her after he somehow sensed what she had done. Hugo, ironically, did become the heir but has become a miserable drunkard. On a fateful transatlantic journey, he met Wargrave and, inebriated, told the judge, [...] "I've known a murderess – known her, I tell you [...] ... Women are fiends – absolute fiends – you wouldn't think a girl like that – a nice straight jolly girl – you wouldn't think she'd do that, would you? That she'd take a <b>kid</b> <b>out</b> to sea and let it drown – you wouldn't think a woman could do a thing like that?"Wargrave was able to trace Vera with this information, and lure her to the island. In the penultimate scene of the novel, she manages to take Lombard's gun, and shoot him dead in what she believed was self-defence. She returns to the house, relieved she has survived. When she goes to her room, she finds a readied noose, complete with chair beneath it, suspended from a hook hanging from the ceiling. She, in what Wargrave, [...] hidden from her sight, describes first hand as a post-traumatic state, sees and hears Hugo, her former lover, encouraging her. She adjusts the noose round her neck and kicks the chair away, fulfilling the rhyme's final verse ("One little Soldier Boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.") ...|$|E
