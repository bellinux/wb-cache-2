500|$|... "Stark Raving Dad" [...] {{was written}} {{specifically}} for Michael Jackson, {{a fan of}} the show, who had called Groening one night and offered to do a guest spot.

In an early version of the script, Homer decided to take his alcoholic friend Barney Gumble in for rehab, but while there Homer began acting crazily so the doctors assumed he was the one to be committed. It was later changed to Homer being hospitalized for wearing a pink shirt, an idea pitched by Brooks. Michael Jackson pitched several story ideas for the episode, such as Bart telling <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> that Michael Jackson was coming to his house. He also requested that there be a scene in which he and Bart wrote a song together and asked that a joke about Prince be changed to one about Elvis Presley.|$|E
