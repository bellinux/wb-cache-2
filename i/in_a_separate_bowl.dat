50|$|Indonesian {{traditional}} meals usually {{consists of}} steamed rice as staple, surrounded by vegetables and soup and meat or fish side dishes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> typical family meal, {{the family members}} gather around the table filled with steamed rice and several other dishes. Each dish is placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> communal large plate or in bowls. Each of these dishes has its own serving spoons, used only to take parts of the dishes from the communal plate into one's own personal plate. Each {{of the family members}} has their own personal plate that is first filled with steamed rice. Usually the oldest family member or the husband has the right to initiate the meal, followed {{by the rest of the}} family to help themselves with the dishes. Each of them take some portion of dishes from the communal plates into their own individual plates.On their personal plate, the steamed rice will soon be surrounded by two, three or more dishes; vegetables and fish or meat, and maybe some fried dishes, sambal and krupuk. In Indonesian customs — unlike in Japanese counterpart — it is quite acceptable to be seen to mix the different flavoured dishes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single personal plate during consumption. A practice commonly found in nasi campur, nasi Padang, or during a buffet. The soupy dish however, might be served <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> small personal <b>bowl.</b> Today in contemporary Indonesian restaurants, the set menu is often offered. This has led to the personal serving practice, in similar fashion to those of Japanese cuisine, with a personal plate on a tray, a rattan or bamboo container each with <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> small portion of dishes surrounding the rice. This can be found in the presentation of nasi Bali.|$|R

5000|$|Tsukemen (Japanese: つけ麺, English: [...] "dipping ramen") is a ramen dish in Japanese cuisine {{consisting}} of noodles which are eaten after being dipped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl</b> of soup or broth.

50|$|In some European countries, {{the dishes}} are {{generally}} washed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> tub placed inside the sink. This practice {{may have started}} {{as a matter of}} hygiene, as the kitchen sink was the only sink available for all the household water. The clothes were washed in the sink; the water used to wash the floor went down the sink, and so it made sense to separate the dishwater from the sink. There were two other possible reasons: First, kitchen sinks tended to be very large <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time when heating water was considered to be a major household expense; a tub used less water. Second, kitchen sinks were usually made of hard ceramic; any contact between the sink and plates was likely to cause chips, but a tub could be made of more forgiving material. Using <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> washing-up <b>bowl</b> <b>in</b> the sink also provides a place (down the gap between bowl and sink) to dispose of unfinished drink, soaking-water, etc. Using the gap for disposal of waste water requires extra vigilance to make sure food particles and other waste are not trapped under the bowl.|$|R

500|$|Writer David Stern said {{he wanted}} to go back to a [...] "Patty and Selma episode", because it was {{sustained}} so well when he wrote [...] "Principal Charming". He thought it was important to [...] "keep these characters (Patty and Selma) alive." [...] The animators had trouble with the size of the characters' pupils during the season. In this episode, they are noticeably larger. When the family watches the video will, Julie Kavner did five voices in the scene. When Great Aunt Gladys shows off her collection of potato chips, the scene was inspired by Myrtle Young, who appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. During an interview with David Letterman, Young said she was working in quality control at a potato chip factory, and collected potato chips that looked like, amongst other things, famous people. The scene where Homer ate a chip is a reference to the Johnny Carson appearance, where, whilst Young was looking away, Johnny ate a chip from <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl</b> (not of the collection), Young, thinking Johnny had ate a chip from her collection, was shocked, before Johnny cleared up the misuderstanding. Jub-Jub made his debut appearance in this episode; the name of the iguana Jub-Jub came from Conan O'Brien.|$|R
5000|$|Yellow ají {{is one of}} the {{ingredients}} of Peruvian cuisine and Bolivian cuisine. It is used as a condiment, especially in many dishes and sauces. In Peru the chilis are mostly used fresh, and in Bolivia dried and ground. Common dishes with ají [...] "amarillo" [...] are the Peruvian stew Ají de Gallina ("Hen Chili"), Huancaina sauce and the Bolivian Fricase Paceno, among others.

50|$|Singapore wonton noodles {{includes}} noodles, {{leafy vegetables}} (preferably cai-xin), barbecued pork (char siu) and bite-sized dumplings or wonton. It is either served dry or in soup form {{with the former}} being more popular. If served dry, the wontons will be served <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl</b> of soup. Shui jiao or prawn dumplings are served at some stalls and the original Hong Kong version is available at Cantonese restaurants and noodle joints. Fried wontons (wontons deep fried in oil) are sometimes served instead of those boiled in the soup. The Singaporean and Malaysian versions of the wonton noodle are similar to each other, though the Singapore version uses significantly less soya sauce and is often served with chili ketchup.|$|E
5000|$|Various flavorings can be used, and {{can vary}} widely by taste and locality. Demerara sugar, golden syrup, Greek yoghurt and honey, and even langoustine tails and {{scallops}} have been employed for this purpose. A girdle of very cold milk or single cream {{is believed to}} be essential (by some [...] "experts"), traditionally served <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl</b> to keep it cold. Glaswegians typically use canned evaporated milk and jam. Use of whisky, rum, or sherry have been reported. Cooking time can be adjusted to preference, but simmering for ten minutes is typical for non-instant oatmeal. Instant oatmeal, including flavored instant oatmeal, is common and can be prepared with the application of hot water.|$|E

5000|$|Chinese style noodle soups in Thailand are {{commonly}} eaten at street stalls, canteens and food courts. A variety of noodles, from wide rice noodles to egg noodles, are {{served in a}} light stock made from chicken, pork or vegetables, or a mixture thereof, and often topped with either cuts of meat (popular is char siu), fish, pork or beef balls, or wontons, or combinations thereof, and sprinkled with coriander leaves. The diners adjust the flavour by themselves using sugar, nam pla (fish sauce), dried chilli and chilli in vinegar provided in jars at the table. Unlike most other Thai food, noodles are eaten with chopsticks. Both noodles and chopsticks are clear Chinese influences. The word kuaitiao is a direct loan from Teochew. It is also possible to order a [...] "dry" [...] noodle soup (kuaitiao haeng), meaning that the broth is served <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In South East Asia, {{the term}} [...] "yong tau foo" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} a dish instead of the stuffed tofu item exclusively. It is {{a variation of the}} above Hakka cuisine as cooked by other dialect groups. The dish can contain a varied selection of food items, including young tau foo, fish balls, crab sticks, bitter melons, cuttlefish, lettuce, ladies fingers, as well as chilis, and various forms of fresh produce, seafood and meats common in Chinese cuisine. Vegetables such as bitter melon and chilis are usually filled with surimi. The foods are then sliced into bite-size pieces, cooked briefly in boiling broth and then served either in the broth as soup or with the broth <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl.</b> The dish is eaten with chopsticks and a soup spoon and can be eaten by itself or served with a bowl of steamed rice, noodles or rice vermicelli. Another variation of this dish would be to serve it with laksa gravy or curry sauce. Essential accompaniments are a spicy, vinegary chili sauce, originally made with red fermented bean curd and distantly similar in taste to Sriracha sauce, and a distinctive brown sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce for dipping.|$|E
5000|$|Dishes {{served in}} a Thali vary from region to region in South Asia and are usually served in small bowls, called katori. These 'katoris' are placed along {{the borders of the}} round tray - the actual thali; even a steel tray with {{multiple}} compartments is used. Typical dishes include rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad, curd (yoghurt), small amounts of chutney or pickle, and a sweet dish to top it off. Rice or Roti is the usual main dish which occupies the central portion of the Thali, while the side dishes like vegetable curries and other aforementioned delicacies are lined circularly along the round Thali. Depending on the restaurant or the region, the thali consists of delicacies native to that region. In general, a thali begins with different types of breads such as puris or chapatis (rotis) and different vegetarian specialities (curries). However, in South India, rice is the only staple served with thalis. Thalis are sometimes referred to by the regional characteristic of the dishes they contain. For example, one may encounter Nepalese thali, Rajasthani thali, Gujarati thali and Maharashtrian thali. In many parts of India and Nepal, the bread and the rice portions are not served together in the thali. Typically, the bread is offered first with rice being served afterwards, often <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl</b> or dish.|$|E

50|$|The rice is {{measured}} {{and added to}} the inner bowl or washed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> <b>bowl</b> in order to remove loosened starch and residual bran. It is not recommended to wash rice in the inner bowl itself so as to preserve the non-stick surface. Strainers are often used in the washing and draining process. For better texture and taste, some types of rice, e.g., Japanese rice or Calrose rice which is suited for absorption method, require pre-cooking water absorption. The water absorption step typically involves letting the rice stand for at least 5 min after draining water from the washing step and soaking the rice in the measured water for at least 15 min (or some claim it to be 1 hour) before cooking. The water draining step is colloquially believed to make the water measurement more accurate, if the water {{is measured}} and added after the initial water absorption {{that takes place in}} the washing step. Some people prefer to achieve the water absorption by simply leaving the rice soaking in the rice cooker overnight before starting cooking in the morning. Some other types of rice, e.g., long-grain rice or scented rice such as jasmine rice, do not require washing or the water absorption step. The water for cooking is added to the inner bowl by using measuring cups or simply filling up to the appropriate graduated mark in the inner bowl. Although cold water is normally added, boiling water is used for cooking sushi rice.|$|E
