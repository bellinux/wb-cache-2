25|$|In time, {{a number}} of {{prominent}} members of Congress began to oppose the program's expansion, including later Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, who cast votes against the B-2 in 1989, 1991 and 1992 while a U.S. Senator, representing Massachusetts. By 1992, Republican President George H.W. Bush called for the cancellation of the B-2 and promised to cut military spending by 30% {{in the wake of}} the collapse of the Soviet Union. In October 1995, former Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Mike Ryan, and <b>former</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, strongly recommended against Congressional action to fund the purchase of any additional B-2s, arguing that to do so would require unacceptable cuts in existing conventional and nuclear-capable aircraft, and that the military had greater priorities in spending a limited budget.|$|E
25|$|The attack, and {{questions}} surrounding the U.S. Government's preparedness for it, and explanations {{for what had}} happened afterward, became a political firestorm in the U.S., especially {{in the context of}} the ongoing presidential election. The State Department had previously identified embassy and personnel security as a major challenge in its budget and priorities report. On the September 20, Clinton gave a classified briefing to U.S. Senators, which several Republican attendees criticized, angry at the Obama administration's rebuff of their attempts to learn details of the Benghazi attack, only to see that information published the next day in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. She did announce the formation of an Accountability Review Board panel, chaired by longtime diplomat Thomas R. Pickering and vice-chaired by retired Admiral and <b>former</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, to investigate the attack from the State Department's viewpoint.|$|E

During the 2004 presidential election, twelve retired generals and admirals endorsed Senator John Kerry, including <b>former</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe, and the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Merrill [...] "Tony" [...] McPeak, who also appeared in television advertisements defending Kerry against the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.

2500|$|The Republican {{candidate}} for President in 2012, Mitt Romney, lost to incumbent President Barack Obama, {{the fifth time}} in six elections the Republican candidate received fewer votes than his Democratic counterpart. In {{the aftermath of the}} loss, some prominent Republicans spoke out against their own party; for example, 1996 Republican Presidential candidate and longtime former Senator Bob Dole said, [...] "today's GOP members are too conservative and overly partisan. They ought to put a sign on the National Committee doors that says closed for repairs". Former Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine stated as well that she was in agreement with Dole. <b>Former</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs (under George H.W.

2500|$|Obama's {{decision}} to allow the violation of a red line he himself had drawn to go unpunished is widely criticised by the U.S. political establishment, {{as well as the}} allies, as detrimental to America's international credibility. However, in early 2016, Obama said he was [...] "proud" [...] of his decision, which repudiated what he referred to as the [...] "Washington playbook" [...] and avoided entangling the US in yet another [...] "unfixable" [...] situation in the Middle East. More broadly, regarding Obama's lack of meaningful support to the Syrian anti-government rebels, in 2015, The Economist opined, [...] "Rarely has an American president so abjectly abandoned his global responsibility", adding in 2016, [...] "The agony of Syria is the biggest moral stain on Barack Obama's presidency. And the chaos rippling from Syria—where many now turn to al-Qaeda, not the West, for salvation—is his greatest geopolitical failure." [...] In 2016, Nicholas Kristof described inaction in Syria as [...] "Obama's worst mistake", while Jonathan Schanzer said [...] "the White House Syria policy has been an unmitigated dumpster fire."

2500|$|In September 1994, Nunn, former President Jimmy Carter and <b>former</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell {{were asked}} by President Bill Clinton {{to go to}} Haiti in order to force the {{departure}} of the military dictator Lieutenant General Raoul Cédras. In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, Nunn and Powell to urge Cédras to step down and leave the country. Cédras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the country’s elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn's delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. [...] "As all of you know, at my request, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days. They have worked tirelessly, almost around the clock, and I want to thank them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans", Clinton said.|$|E
