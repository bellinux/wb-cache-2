Women accounted for 66% of graduates in natural sciences, 28% of those in engineering and 77% of those in health and welfare. It <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> judge the contribution of women to research, as the data for 2013 only cover the higher education sector.|$|E
5|$|Pleistocene climate <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> determine, {{though it}} was {{probably}} not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account {{for most of the}} water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the Mojave Desert large lakes also formed during that time. In the early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.|$|E
50|$|Membrane {{proteins}} <b>are</b> inherently <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> design, {{in large}} part because it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> validate the designs experimentally for several reasons. Membrane proteins <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> purify. Their structure <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> characterize because they adopt their native conformation only {{in the presence of a}} membrane. Crystallization <b>is</b> inherently <b>hard,</b> and NMR studies of membrane proteins can fail because of their size.|$|R

5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Deshasth Brahmans and Marathas {{observe the}} Champasashthi festival {{every year in}} honour of Khandoba. The festival begins on the bright half of the Hindu month of Margshirsha. The images of Khandoba and Malla are cleaned and worshipped. For six days a fast is observed. On the seventh day the worshippers break their fast by a feast known as the Champasashtliiche parne. An {{invitation}} to this feast is regarded as an invitation from the god Khandoba himself and <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> refuse.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle}} of the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

5|$|Homozygous FH <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only {{high doses}} of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E

5|$|Like all fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren {{is an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E

5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays.
