5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. <b>His</b> <b>early</b> works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of <b>his</b> <b>early</b> works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E

50|$|The Revolt of Aphrodite {{consists}} of two novels by British writer Lawrence Durrell, published in 1968 and 1970.

5|$|Carey has {{routinely}} written {{throughout his}} career, including developing his stand-up comedy routines in <b>his</b> <b>early</b> stand-up career, and then {{moving on to}} assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his autobiography, , wherein he shared memories of <b>his</b> <b>early</b> childhood and of his father's death when he was eight. He also revealed that he was once molested, had suffered bouts of depression, and had made two suicide attempts by swallowing {{a large amount of}} sleeping pills. The book discusses his college fraternity years while attending Kent State University and his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there is one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer, which was a departure from his on-screen persona. The book was featured on The New York Times bestseller list for three months.|$|E
