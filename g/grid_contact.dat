Solar cells with semitransparent contact have almost the same open-circuit voltages (V(oc)) as solar cells with <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> and exhibit a higher fill factor (FF). However, solar cells with <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> exhibit a higher maximum output power density (P(max)) than semitransparent contact due to their larger short-circuit current density (J(sc)). On the other hand, V(oc) and FF decrease significantly with increasing In content (beyond the decrease expected from the band gap of InGaN). By comparing the X-ray rocking curves, AFM images, dark current characteristics and spectral responsivities, it could be concluded that the deterioration of InGaN crystal quality with increasing In content is the dominant reason accounting for the strong decrease of V(oc) and FF. In addition, using AMPS simulation, the band structure and ideal spectral responsivities are obtained. Comparison of the experimental and simulated results also shows that high crystal quality is a key factor to obtain high performance InGaN-based Schottky barrier photovoltaic cells.

40|$|A step-stress {{accelerated}} degradation testing (SSADT) {{method was}} employed {{for the first}} time to evaluate the stability of CuInGaSe 2 (CIGS) solar cells and device component materials in four Al-framed test structures encapsulated with an edge sealant and three kinds of backsheet or moisture barrier film for moisture ingress control. The SSADT exposure used a 15 oC and then a 15 % relative humidity (RH) increment step, beginning from 40 oC/ 40 %RH (T/RH = 40 / 40) to 85 oC/ 70 %RH (85 / 70) as of the moment. The voluminous data acquired and processed as of total DH = 3956 h with 85 / 70 = 704 h produced the following results. The best CIGS solar cells in sample Set- 1 with a moisture-permeable TPT backsheet showed essentially identical I-V degradation trend regardless of the Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layer thickness ranging from standard 0. 12 &# 956;m to 0. 50 &# 956;m on the cells. No clear 'stepwise' feature in the I-V parameter degradation curves corresponding to the SSADT T/RH/time profile was observed. Irregularity in I-V performance degradation pattern was observed with some cells showing early degradation at low T/RH < 55 / 55 and some showing large Voc, FF, and efficiency degradation due to increased series Rs (ohm-cm 2) at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. Results of (electrochemical) impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) analysis indicate degradation of the CIGS solar cells corresponded to increased series resistance Rs (ohm) and degraded parallel (minority carrier diffusion/recombination) resistance Rp, capacitance C, overall time constant Rp*C, and 'capacitor quality' factor (CPE-P), which were related to the cells? p-n junction properties. Heating at 85 / 70 appeared to benefit the CIGS solar cells as indicated by the largely recovered CPE-P factor. Device component materials, Mo on soda lime glass (Mo/SLG), bilayer ZnO (BZO), AlNi <b>grid</b> <b>contact,</b> and CdS/CIGS/Mo/SLG in test structures with TPT showed notable to significant degradation at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. At T/RH = 85 / 70, substantial blistering of BZO layers on CIGS cell pieces was observed that was not seen on BZO/glass, and a CdS/CIGS sample displayed a small darkening and then flaking feature. Additionally, standard AlNi <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> was less stable than thin Ni <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. The edge sealant and moisture-blocking films were effective to block moisture ingress, as evidenced by the good stability of most CIGS solar cells and device components at T/RH = 85 / 70 for 704 h, and by preservation of the initial blue color on the RH indicator strips.

40|$|Standard {{laboratory}} processed organic {{solar cells}} (OSCs) are fabricated in inert atmosphere with no significant time delays {{in between the}} fabrication steps. However for research case scenario only a single processing step is possible at a time with the R 2 R machine installed in ambient atmosphere as used in this dissertation work. A complete working day is needed {{for each of these}} processing steps taking into consideration the cleaning, preparatory work and deposition time. This results in delaying the following processing steps at least for one day exposing the layer stacks in ambient atmosphere. Therefore to understand the influence of processing and such time delays in ambient atmosphere on the final device performance all these processing parameters were replicated on small area devices. This led to the finding that all the layer stacks can be processed and stored in ambient atmosphere but with one limitation. The annealing of organic semiconductor, essential to get an optimum morphology and performance, was not possible in ambient atmosphere and must be done in nitrogen atmosphere. The R 2 R processed OSCs were limited in the performance (2. 0 %), mainly due to the solvent incompatibility of the solution processable metal inks deposited as a top contact. A printed top <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> is attractive as vacuum processing of such a <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> as used in the laboratory process would be too expensive. However for the OSCs where the top contact was thermally evaporated under vacuum, device performance of 3. 5 % of was achieved. The device efficiency of 3. 5 % is not only the highest values reported in literatures obtained for OSCs with R 2 R processed organic (P 3 HT:PCBM) layers but also the same that can be achieved with standard laboratory processing. This confirms that R 2 R processing of organic layers can be done in ambient atmosphere without loss in device performance and the issue with top <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> needs to be solved. Experimentally obtained parameters were taken and module layout calculation showed that with the inverted setup as used in this dissertation work larger area modules with efficiencies of 3 % can be fabricated. Cost calculations were done taking the actual material cost and resulted in the module cost of 1. 4 €/WP mainly dominated by the organic material cost. However for large volume production where studies have shown that all material cost, in particular the organic material cost, are expected to be much less and thus the module cost of below 0. 1 €/WP is achievable. Therefore R 2 R processing has the potential of low cost, lightweight and flexible OSCs with high throughput production...|$|E

40|$|This {{communication}} {{considers the}} design of the front <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> of np GaAs solar cells for high efficiency concentrator applications. This design involves shadowing, contact resistance, and active layer sheet resistance losses, and at high concentrations, the power loss due to voltage drop on the resistance of the grid fingers should be considered. Analysis of the performance can be calculated as a function of junction depth and surface recombination velocity. The junction depth can be optimized by considering its effect on the collection efficiency of the dark current-voltage characteristics or the open circuit voltage, and on the series resistance loss or the fill factor for material parameters. The choice of the material parameters, calculation of the short circuit current, the selection of the n layer thickness, and the cell maximum power and efficiency are discussed.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, we {{investigate}} the potential use of stain etched porous silicon as one possible {{way to increase}} the silicon solar cell efficiency at low cost. A very simple method {{for the formation of}} porous silicon antireflection coatings on random pyramid textured screen-printed monocrystalline silicon solar cells is described. The process is based on electroless metal-assisted chemical etching by immersion of the fully processed cell in HF-H 2 O 2 -Ethanol without masking the contacts. Characterization of the porous silicon layer using SEM, EDX and UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometry revealed that silver nanoparticles that are dissolved from the unmasked front <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> by the HF acid greatly enhance the dissolution rate and therefore serve as catalysts for the porous silicon etching. The solar cell weighted reflectance was reduced from 45. 08 % to 22. 01 % after texturization and dropped further to 11. 34 % after porous silicon formation under optimized conditions. The porous silicon antireflection layer led to a relative improvement of 24. 64 % in the short-circuit current density without fill factor deterioration.

40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} contacts {{is common in}} the process of silicon solar cells production because of low contact resistivity. It has also a great importance in thin film technology for photovoltaics, especially in copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) devices. The final stage of CIGS cell production is the top contact deposition of high conductivity layer for lateral current collection. Such material has to be highly optically transparent as well. In order to make a contact, metal is deposited onto TCO layer with minimum shadowing to allow as much light as possible into device. The metal <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> is being made by deposition of few microns {{of aluminum}}. The resistivity of the deposited material as well as resistance between the metal grid and TCO layer plays a great role in high quality solar cell production.

Influence of technological parameters of the Al deposition process on sheet resistance of deposited layers has been showed. In order to obtain the lowest resistivity of the thin contact layer, optimal set of sputtering parameters, i. e. power applied, deposition time and deposition pressure was found.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The screen-printing {{technology}} {{provides a}} low cost high-throughput approach to good contacts for silicon solar cells. However, currently screen-printed contacts are formed {{at the expense}} of slight performance and fill factor loss. The front <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> is particularly important and requires low contact resistance, high shunt resistance, and low junction recombination for high fill factor. Often contacts are fired in the moderate to high temperature range (750 - 800 oC) to achieve low series resistance. However, high temperature firing can lead to junction shunting and recombination, which degrades fill factor. Moreover shallow or higher sheet resistance emitters (50 - 100 Ω/sq) are desirable for high performance, which makes devices even more vulnerable to high temperature firing. Therefore, in this study, we modify the paste composition by adding some dopants and additives to lower the peak firing temperature for good ohmic contacts. This also reduces the wafer bowing and enhances SiN-induced defect hydrogenation in multicrystalline silicon substrates. The results show that increasing the additives concentration lowered the optimum firing temperature from 780 to 720 oC. In addition, the ideality factor is reduced significantly at the lower firing temperature. Thus additives used in this study were able to lower the peak firing temperature and increase the fill factor without hurting the series resistance. Fill factor of 0. 774 on textured CZ was obtained at ~ 720 oC peak firing temperature for paste G (SOL 9807). These pastes were formulated at Heraeus.

40|$|Flat-panel tandem {{solar cells}} have {{demonstrated}} the potential to exceed the efficiencies of their single-junction constituents. However, robust rules for tandem solar cell design are currently lacking, slowing the development of cost-effective implementations of this technology. The four-terminal (4 T) architecture stacks electrically independent sub-cells and avoids current-matching losses, resulting in two main advantages over the conventional integrated two-terminal (2 T) architecture: a higher energy yield and a loosened constraint on material bandgap combinations. Because both sub-cells are contacted independently in a 4 T tandem, multiple stacked semi-transparent contacts are needed, causing significant shading and series resistance losses. Moreover, for stationary flat panel tandems that do not use tracking, contacts need to be optimized for a varying direction of incident sunlight. In this study, we develop a framework for optimizing metal grid contacts for 4 T tandem solar cells and quantify the electrical and optical loss associated with these contacts. We also examine the question of under which circumstances it is beneficial to align metal <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> fingers to reduce shading. We find that, for most applications, {{the front and back}} contacts of the top cell should be aligned, resulting in an increase in energy yield by 1 - 2 %. We also find that aligning the contacts of top and bottom cells is not beneficial and may even result in a reduced energy yield. This additionally highlights the importance of using energy yield, rather than standard test condition efficiency, as a figure of merit when considering device design. by Sarah E. Sofia. Thesis: S.

It {{combines}} features {{of both the}} Metal-Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell and the p-n junction solar cell, and has a performance superior to either. During {{the course of this}} thesis work, and prior to the invention of the MINP structure, studies were undertaken of the MIS solar cell. Improved grid designs and optimization of insulator growth conditions enabled MIS solar cells to be fabricated with open circuit voltages as high as 685 mV(AMO, 25 (DEGREES) C). The open circuit voltage, fill factor and total and active area efficiencies of the best MIS cells exceeded those of any other contemporary Conductor-Insulator-Silicon solar cell. However, it was established that the high and unstable emitter sheet resistance of MIS solar cells was a major problem. The MINP solar cell is essentially a p-n junction solar cell with an MIS low recombination velocity contact. The presence of a diffused layer eliminates the problem of the high and unstable emitter sheet resistance of MIS solar cells. The advantage of the MINP solar cell over the p-n junction solar cell is the elimination of the high recom- bination velocity ohmic <b>grid</b> <b>contact,</b> leading to an improvement in open circuit voltage. Careful attention was paid to passivation of surface states and optimization of emitter diffusion profile.

40|$|Main {{objective}} of the present work is to develop wide-band gap InGaN solar cells in the 2. 4 - 2. 9 eV range that can be an integral component of photovoltaic devices to achieve efficiencies greater than 50 %. In the present work, various challenges in the novel III-nitride technology are identified and overcome individually to build basic design blocks, and later, optimized comprehensively to develop high-performance InGaN solar cells. Due to the unavailability of a suitable modeling program for InGaN solar cells, PC 1 D is modified up to a source-code level to incorporate spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization in order to accurately model III-nitride solar cells. On the technological front, InGaN with indium compositions up to 30 % (2. 5 eV band gap) are developed for photovoltaic applications by controlling defects and phase separation using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. InGaN with band gap of 2. 5 eV is also successfully doped to achieve acceptor carrier concentration of 1 e 18 cm- 3. A robust fabrication scheme for III-nitride solar cells is established to increase reliability and yield; various schemes including interdigitated <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> and current spreading contacts are developed to yield low-resistance Ohmic contacts for InGaN solar cells. Preliminary solar cells are developed using a standard design to optimize the InGaN material, where the band gap of InGaN is progressively lowered. Subsequent generations of solar cell designs involve an evolutionary approach to enhance the open-circuit voltage and internal quantum efficiency of the solar cell. The suitability of p-type InGaN with band gaps as low as 2. 5 eV is established by incorporating in a solar cell and measuring an open-circuit voltage of 2. 1 V. Second generation InGaN solar cell design involving a 2. 9 eV InGaN p-n junction sandwiched between p- and n-GaN layers yields internal quantum efficiencies as high as 50 %; while sixth generation devices utilizing the novel n-GaN strained window-layer enhance the open circuit voltage of a 2. 9 eV InGaN solar cell to 2 V. Finally, key aspects to further InGaN solar cell research, including integration of various designs, are recommended to improve the efficiency of InGaN solar cells. These results establish the potential of III-nitrides in ultra-high efficiency photovoltaics. Ph. D.

40|$|In this thesis, a high-fidelity multibody {{dynamics}} {{model of}} a backhoe for simulating the digging operation is developed using the DIS (Dynamic Interactions Simulator) multibody dynamics software. Sand {{is used as a}} sample digging material to illustrate the model. The backhoe components (such as frame, manipulators links, track segments, wheels and sprockets) are modeled as rigid bodies. The geometry of the major moving components of the backhoe is created using the Pro/E solid modeling software. The components of the backhoe are imported to DIS and connected using joints (revolute, cylindrical and prismatic joints). Rotary and linear actuators along with PD (Proportional-Derivative) controllers are used to move and steer the backhoe and to move the backhoes manipulator in the desired trajectory. Sand is modeled using cubic shaped particles that can come into contact with each other, the backhoes bucket and ground. A cubical sand particle contact surface is modeled using eight spheres that are rigidly glued to each other to form a cubical shaped particle, The backhoe and ground surfaces are modeled as polygonal surfaces. A penalty technique is used to impose both joint and normal contact constraints (including track-wheels, track-terrain, bucket-particles and particles-particles contact). An asperity-based friction model is used to model joint and contact friction. A Cartesian Eulerian <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> search algorithm is used to allow fast contact detection between particles. A recursive bounding box contact search algorithm is used to allow fast contact detection for polygonal contact surfaces and is used to detect contact between: track and ground; track and wheels; bucket and particles; and ground and particles. The governing equations of motion are solved along with joint/constraint equations using a time-accurate explicit solution procedure. ^ The sand model is validated using a conical hopper sand flow experiment in which the sand flow rate during discharge and the angle of repose of the resulting sand pile are experimentally measured. The results of the conical hopper simulation are compared with previously published experimental results. Parameter studies are performed using the sand model to study the effects of the particle size and the orifices diameter of the hopper on the sand pile angle of repose and sand flow rate. ^ The sand model is integrated with the backhoe model to simulate a typical digging operation. The model is used to predict the manipulators actuator forces needed to dig through a pile of sand. Integrating the sand model and backhoe model can help improving the performance of construction equipment by predicting, for various vehicle design alternatives: the actuator and joint forces, and the vehicle stability during digging. ...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, an {{explicit}} time integration code which integrates multibody dynamics and the discrete element method {{is used for}} modeling the excavation and moving operation on cohesive soft soil (such as mud and snow) by bulldozers. A soft cohesive soil material model (that includes normal and tangential inter-particle force models) is used that can account for soil compressibility, plasticity, fracture, friction, viscosity, and gain in cohesive strength due to compression. In addition, a time relaxation sub-model for the soil plastic deformation and cohesive strength is added in order to account for loss in soil cohesive strength and reduced bulk density due to tension or removal of the compression. This is essential in earth moving applications since the soil that is dug typically becomes loose soil that has lower shear strength and lower bulk density (larger volume) than compacted soil. If the model {{does not account for}} loss of soil shear strength then the dug soil pile in front of the blade of a bulldozer will have an artificially high shear strength. A penalty technique is used to impose joint and normal contact constraints. An asperity-based friction model is used to model contact and joint friction. A Cartesian Eulerian <b>grid</b> <b>contact</b> search algorithm is used to allow fast contact detection between particles.

The components are modeled as rigid bodies and are connected using revolute and prismatic joints. Rotary actuators along with PD controllers are used to drive the wheels. Linear actuators along with PD controllers are used to drive the hydraulic actuators. Polygonal contact surfaces are defined for the tires and blade to model the interaction between the soil and the bulldozer. Simulations of a bulldozer performing typical shallow digging operations in a cohesive soil are presented. The simulation of a rear wheel drive bulldozer shows that, it has a limited digging capacity compared to the 4 -wheel drive bulldozer. The effect of the relaxation parameter can be easily observed from the variation in the Bulldozer 2 ̆ 7 s velocity. The higher the relaxation parameter, the higher is the bulldozer 2 ̆ 7 s velocity while it is crossing over the soil patch. For the low penetration depth run the bulldozer takes less time compared to high penetration depth. Also higher magnitudes of torques at front and rear wheels can be observed in case of high penetration depth. The model is used to predict the wheel torque, wheel speed, vehicle speed, and actuator forces during shallow digging operations on three types of soils and at two blade penetration depths. The model presented can be used to predict the motion, loads and, required actuators forces, and improve the design of the various bulldozer components such as the blade, tires, engine, and hydraulic actuators. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{selective}} processing technique {{based on}} a confined dynamic liquid drop is presented. This approach is based on localized wet treatment of silicon wafers using confined and dynamic liquid drop that while {{in contact with the}} wafer forms a dynamic liquid meniscus. Such new technique allows to touch in specific defined positions the silicon wafer (front and/or back) in order to perform any kind of wet processing without the need of protective photo-resist. The new selective processing technique allows the metallizations (front and back) of mono and multi crystalline silicon solar cells. The front <b>grid</b> <b>contacts</b> are obtained by locally etching the silicon nitride, forming in a thin layer of meso-porous silicon and totally filling the meso-porous layer by pulse reverse plating a Nickel film. Copper and Tin are then electroplated using the same selective processing. This technology provides an effective solution to avoid silver pastes for front <b>contact</b> <b>grid,</b> as it guarantees low specific contact resistivity (550 μΩcm 2 on a 75 Ω/□ n-type doped emitter) and good adhesion to the silicon substrate (i. e. greater than 550 g/mm). The Al back side of the solar cell are also treated by the new selective process. Tin is directly deposited on Aluminum back contact showing adhesion higher than silver on silicon (i. e. > 1 N/mm) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work the space {{compatibility}} of thin-film GaAs solar cells is studied. These cells {{are separated from}} their GaAs substrate by the epitaxial lift-off (ELO) technique and mounted behind a CMG cover glass which {{at the same time}} serves as a stable carrier for the thin film cells. In the present initial stage of development these cells have an average efficiency of about 15. 4 % under AM 0 illumination due to not yet optimized <b>grid</b> <b>contacts</b> and anti-reflection coatings. Inspection after irradiation by 1 MeV electrons, thermal vacuum and thermal cycling experiments reveal that degradation of the cells is largely due to delamination and micro-cracking. Based on these results, glass dehydration and adhesive degassing procedures are implemented in the ELO cell processing. As a consequence, even in this premature phase, newly produced cells show a, radiation hardness comparable to or better than that of commercially available GaAs cells on Ge substrates and are virtually unaffected by severe thermal cycling.

40|$|A top contact {{metallization}} of a photovoltaic {{solar cell}} collects the current generated by incident solar radiation. Several power-loss mechanisms {{are associated with}} the current flow through the front <b>contact</b> <b>grid.</b> The design of the top metal <b>contact</b> <b>grid</b> {{is one of the most}} important areas of efficient photovoltaic solar cell design. In this paper, an approach based on the constructal theory is proposed to design the grid pattern in a photovoltaic solar cell, minimizing total resistive losses. Constructal theory explains the geometric form (shape and structure) of most volume-to-point systems in nature. In this paper, the applicability of the constructal theory to design top contact metallization for a photovoltaic solar cell has been extended...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} using <b>gridded</b> back <b>contacts</b> on silicon solar cells made with Al baked surface field (BSF) was {{experimentally}} investigated {{and found to}} result in a significant increase in conversion efficiency due to higher short-circuit current. An increase of 5 to 8 % was noted for thin cells while a smaller increase was observed for standard thickness cells. Several possible explanatory mechanisms are suggested and summarized, including stress relief, incomplete BSF formation, improved back surface recombination velocity, and improved optical reflection off the back silicon-air interface...|$|R
40|$|The exact {{solution}} for the dependence of specific power of photoconversion {{in the mode of}} maximum collected power on distance l between lines of the <b>contact</b> <b>grid</b> has been obtained. It is shown that in an optimized case, when the change of the potential of heavily doped front layer under contacts and between contacts is less than kT/q, the characteristic length L can be introduced with a meaning of the distance at which the photocurrent reduces by a factor of e due to recombination. Variation of the filling factor of SC IVC due to the presence of <b>contact</b> <b>grid</b> is then analytically expressed via this length. It is found that in unoptimized case, when the distance between contact strips l is much longer than L, the photocurrent collection is determined by lesser, as compared to L, distance, at which the front layer potential changes from the value of Vm under contacts to the open- circuit voltage between the contacts. In this case the change of IVC filling factor due to the presence of <b>contact</b> <b>grid</b> is expressed again analytically via this new characteristic length. In the intermediate case, when l ≈ L, the solution of the problem can be found by numerical methods only...|$|R

Electrical contacts in the camera read the bit pattern. Most cameras read only part of the code; typically, only the film speed is read, and some cameras aimed at the consumer market only read enough bits to tell apart the most common film speeds. For example, 100, 200, 400, and 800 can be detected by reading only S1 and S2 and ground.|$|R
