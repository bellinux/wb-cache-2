He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> people know is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine highlighted the [...] "churning" [...] song as one of the three best on the album. He felt that it was reminiscent of the tracks prevalent on the band's debut album, characterized by similarity to Tori Amos's material and observed that on The Open Door, this type of songs were [...] "ushed to the background". In an album review, Sara Berry from St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined that [...] "The band deftly balances scorching rock anthems with reflective, piano-heavy ballads like 'Lithium'". IGN's Ed Thompson wrote that Lee's [...] "gentle tickling of the ivories" [...] is notably present on [...] "Lithium".|$|E

No. So, {{as far as my}} {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was {{the same as that of}} my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
