This paper {{provides}} {{a method of}} multi-sensor data detection and fusion, aims to resolve the <b>data</b> <b>measurement</b> inaccurate problem in the process variable control system of the ammonia modification equipment. First, it establishes the sensor <b>data</b> <b>measurement</b> model and calculates mutual support level of the multiple sensors, using boundary value judgment method to produce the multiple-sensor mutual support level matrix, {{the total number of}} mutual support level for one sensor in the matrix is the weight value of this sensor, and finally the normalized weighted average data fusion (NWADF) method is used for data process. Experimental results show that the proposed method for multi-sensor data fusion can effectively be used to identify the abnormal <b>data</b> in multi-sensor <b>measurement</b> system and improve the accuracy and stability of the <b>data</b> <b>measurement...</b>|$|R

50|$|For some time, the UAH {{satellite}} data's chief {{significance was}} that they appeared to contradict {{a wide range of}} surface temperature <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> and analyses showing warming. In 1998 the UAH data showed a cooling of 0.05 K per decade (at 3.5 km - mid to low troposphere). Wentz & Schabel at RSS in their 1998 paper showed this (along with other discrepancies) was due to the orbital decay of the NOAA satellites. Once the orbital changes had been allowed for the data showed a 0.07 K per decade increase in temperature at this level of the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{outdated}} <b>data</b> (<b>measurements</b> from 1966 to 1986 were used) and {{the fluctuation of}} the {{inflow of}} sediments, inadequate assessment of the lifespan of the reservoir has been made.

Furthermore, the slopes around reservoir are unstable which can further shorten the lifespan of the reservoir. There is a need to redo the measurements of sediment inflow and to develop mitigation measures to avoid landslides and rock falls into the reservoir area.|$|E

50|$|When the slopes, orientations, and {{elevations}} {{of thousands}} of gullies were compared, clear patterns emerged from the <b>data.</b> <b>Measurements</b> of altitudes and slopes of gullies {{support the idea that}} snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow.Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude. For example, Thaumasia quadrangle is heavily cratered with many steep slopes. It is in the right latitude range, but its altitude is so high that there is not enough pressure to keep ice from sublimating (going directly from a solid to a gas); hence it does not have gullies. A large study done with several years worth of data from Mars Global Surveyor showed that there is a tendency for gullies to be on poleward facing slopes; these slopes have more shade that would keep snow from melting and allow large snowpacks to accumulate.|$|E
5000|$|Strain rate Imaging is {{a method}} in Echocardiography (Medical ultrasound) for {{measuring}} regional or global deformation of the myocardium (heart muscle). The term [...] "deformation" [...] refers to the myocardium changing shape and dimensions during the cardiac muscle. If there is myocardial Ischemia, or {{there has been an}} Myocardial infarction, in part of the heart muscle, this part is weakened and shows reduced and altered Systolic function. Also in regional asynchrony, as in Bundle branch block, there is regional heterogeneity of systolic function. By strain rate imaging, the simultaneous function of different regions can be displayed and measured. The method was first based on colour Tissue Doppler. by using the longitudinal myocardial Velocity gradient, already in use transmurally. Later, the regional deformation has also been available by Speckle tracking echocardiography, both methods having some, but different methodological weaknesses. Both methods, however, will acquire the same <b>data</b> (<b>measurements</b> may differ somewhat, however, being method dependent), and also can be displayed by the same type of display.|$|E

From 1980 to 1990 the share of [...] "pure post-materialists" [...] increased from 13 to 31 percent in West Germany. After {{the economic and social}} stress caused by German reunification in 1990 it dropped to 23 percent in 1992 and stayed on that level afterwards (Terwey 2000: 155; ZA and ZUMA 2005). The ALLBUS sample from the less affluent population in East Germany show much lower portions of post-materialists (1991: 15%, 1992: 10%, 1998: 12%). International data from the 2000 World Values Survey show the highest percentage of post-materialists in Australia (35%) followed by Austria (30%), Canada (29%), Italy (28%), Argentina (25%), United States (25%), Sweden (22%), Netherlands (22%), Puerto Rico (22%) etc. (Inglehart et al. 2004: 384).

5000|$|Genes are the {{nodes and}} the edges are directed. A gene {{serves as the}} source of a direct {{regulatory}} edge to a target gene by producing an RNA or protein molecule that functions as a transcriptional activator or inhibitor of the target gene. If the gene is an activator, then it is the source of a positive regulatory connection; if an inhibitor, then it is the source of a negative regulatory connection. Computational algorithms take as primary input <b>data</b> <b>measurements</b> of mRNA expression levels of the genes under consideration for inclusion in the network, returning an estimate of the network topology. Such algorithms are typically based on linearity, independence or normality assumptions, which must be verified on a case-by-case basis. Clustering or some form of statistical classification is typically employed to perform an initial organization of the high-throughput mRNA expression values derived from microarray experiments, in particular to select sets of genes as candidates for network nodes. The question then arises: how can the clustering or classification results be connected to the underlying biology? Such results can be useful for pattern classification - for example, to classify subtypes of cancer, or to predict differential responses to a drug (pharmacogenomics). But to understand the relationships between the genes, that is, to more precisely define the influence of each gene on the others, the scientist typically attempts to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory network. This can be done by data integration in dynamic models supported by background literature, or information in public databases, combined with the clustering results. The modelling can be done by a Boolean network, by Ordinary differential equations or Linear regression models, e.g. Least-angle regression, by Bayesian network or based on Information theory approaches. For instance it can be done by the application of a correlation-based inference algorithm, as will be discussed below, an approach which is having increased success as the size of the available microarray sets keeps increasing ...|$|E
