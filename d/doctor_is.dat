5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E

5|$|At the house, the <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> {{surprised}} by Caecilius's daughter Evelina, {{who seems to}} have extrasensory perception (ESP) and knows personal details about the Doctor and Donna. They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature.

25|$|As {{with his}} predecessor, all the Second <b>Doctor's</b> {{original}} episodes <b>were</b> in black-and-white. Later guest appearances in The Three Doctors, The Five Doctors and The Two <b>Doctors</b> <b>were</b> in colour. However, Troughton's reign as the <b>Doctor</b> <b>was</b> more notable for what {{does not exist}} than for what does, {{as many of the}} episodes featuring the Second <b>Doctor</b> <b>were</b> junked by the BBC; a full list of incomplete Doctor Who serials shows how many of these episodes are missing from the BBC Archives.|$|R
5000|$|... 380 new {{complaints}} against <b>doctors</b> <b>were</b> received in 2011, a five percent increase. Of these new complaints, 15 doctors received sanctions and six doctors had conditions imposed on them. Eight <b>doctors</b> <b>were</b> struck off the register.|$|R

5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|The {{absolute}} state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally {{gives rise}} to the dominance of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice. Professional consciousness of the <b>doctor</b> <b>is</b> based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient's consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Dr. Mario and the viruses appeared in print media numerous times: Valiant published {{a volume of}} Nintendo Comics Systems entitled The <b>Doctor</b> <b>Is</b> In...

5|$|Apart from Captain Kirk, {{the episode}} {{introduced}} two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, {{a friend of}} director James Goldstone, was cast as the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and had decided that an engineer ought to be Scottish) and George Takei was cast as Ship's Physicist Sulu, who would become the helmsman in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship's <b>doctor</b> <b>is</b> instead Mark Piper (Paul Fix). Piper {{was intended as a}} regular; DeForest Kelley, who played McCoy in the series proper, had been considered for the role.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic screwdriver, but as this was often used as a skeleton key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the screwdriver.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{referenced}} in Theme Hospitals introduction scene twice: a <b>doctor</b> <b>is</b> briefly seen {{playing a}} console version, and the Horned Reaper makes a cameo appearance as a patient. Early concept art for Black & White used Dungeon Keepers Horned Reaper to represent creatures. The Horned Reaper unit {{was so popular}} that the producers of Dungeon Keeper 2 made it a character with {{an important role in}} the game's story. Dungeon Keepers engine was an inspiration for Minecraft.|$|E

5|$|Government-run {{health care}} {{insurance}} plans were available, but Jews were denied coverage starting in 1933. That same year, Jewish <b>doctors</b> <b>were</b> forbidden to treat government-insured patients.

5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her <b>doctor</b> <b>is</b> really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E
5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second <b>Doctor</b> <b>is</b> particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Amy Pond, Rory and River Song are {{summoned to}} Utah, United States, by the Eleventh Doctor, who is {{killed by a}} mysterious figure in a space suit.

The team deals with the Silence, a race of aliens with the ability to make people forget their encounter with them when they look away.|$|E

5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice {{care is not}} seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the <b>doctor</b> <b>is</b> often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E

The <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> prosecuted for violating eugenics laws. The <b>doctor</b> <b>was</b> found guilty, and the operations were considered unjustified, {{as they had been}} performed without adequate diagnoses of gender identity disorder.|$|R
