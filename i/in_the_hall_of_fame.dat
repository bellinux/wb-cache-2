5|$|From 1964 to 1978, the Giants {{registered}} {{just two}} winning seasons and {{were unable to}} advance to the playoffs. During this period the team also traded away quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who would later lead the Minnesota Vikings to three Super Bowls and end up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fame.</b> This period was characterized by the front office's bad decisions in the college draft, several ill-advised trades, and the team's fans' growing disappointment. It was not until the 1980s that the Giants would develop a consistent playoff team.|$|E

5|$|She was {{inducted}} into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1996. In 1999, her daughter Jeanne Varnell published a book titled Women of Consequence: The Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, which contains the biographies of McConnell and 58 other inductees of the Hall of Fame. The project began when Varnell set out to write a biography of her mother, but was urged by her editor {{to do the same for}} all 59 of the women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fame</b> at the time, and compile them into a book.|$|E

After he spent many years in an unmarked grave, the Professional Footballers' Association, the Welsh FA, Manchester City and Manchester United all agreed {{to cover the cost of}} upkeep on a new headstone. Meredith is honoured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>fame</b> at the City of Manchester Stadium.

5|$|As of 2012, {{a maximum}} of four players can be {{inducted}} in one year but {{the greatest number of}} players ever inducted in a year was 23, in 1963. They were inducted because the Hall of Fame was trying to induct many pre-NHL era players. Sometimes noted as 1962 inductees, the pre-NHL era players were named at the 1962 Hall of Fame luncheon at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), but were inducted one year later, in 1963 at the CNE. 232 of the player inductees are Canadian-born, while 16 European-born players have been inducted. The NHL team with the most player inductees is the Toronto Maple Leafs (previously the Toronto St. Patricks and Toronto Arenas), with 60. Seventy-seven defencemen are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fame,</b> more than any other current position, while only 36 goaltenders have been inducted.|$|E
5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy Jet {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, Jet Deck and Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967. His dam, or mother, Lena's Bar, had {{produced}} {{a small number}} of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck's dam. Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents in the Hall of Fame; his two grandsires, Moon Deck and Three Bars, are also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fame.</b>|$|E
5|$|The New England Patriots feature 22 {{former players}} and two {{contributors}} in their team hall of fame, established in 1991. A committee {{of media and}} staff selected 11 players for enshrinement between 1991 and 2001, before a six-year span of no selections. In 2007, {{in advance of the}} 2008 opening of The Hall at Patriot Place, the Patriots introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an Internet fan vote being enshrined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>fame.</b> In order to be eligible, players and coaches must be retired for at least four years. Beginning in 2011, and meeting every five years, a senior selection committee has the option of voting a player who has been retired for at least 25 seasons into the hall of fame.|$|E

5|$|Three Aston Villa {{players have}} won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award. In 1977 Andy Gray won the award. In 1990 it was awarded to David Platt, whilst Paul McGrath won it in 1993. The PFA Young Player of the Year, which is awarded to players {{under the age of}} 23, has been awarded to four players from Aston Villa: Andy Gray in 1977; Gary Shaw in 1981; Ashley Young in 2009 and James Milner in 2010. The National Football Museum in Preston, Lancashire administers the English Football Hall of Fame which {{currently}} contains two Villa teams, two Villa players and one manager. The 1890s team and 1982 team were inducted into the Hall of Fame in July 2009. Joe Mercer was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the same time for his career as a manager including his time at Aston Villa. The only two Villa players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fame</b> are Danny Blanchflower and Peter Schmeichel.|$|E
5|$|Eight Devils {{players have}} been {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Peter Stastny, who played for the Devils from 1989 to 1993, was inducted in 1998. A center who defected from Czechoslovakia, Stastny {{was one of the}} NHL's top goal scorers in the 1980s. In 2001, Stastny was joined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fame</b> by Devils defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov, {{who was one of the}} first Soviet players in the NHL. Fetisov played for the team in the 1989–90 season and again from 1990 to 1995. Scott Stevens, a Devils defenseman from 1991 to 2004 and long-time team captain, was inducted in 2007 in his first year of eligibility. In December 2014, Stevens returned as head coach for the Devils' defense. Igor Larionov, a forward with a 15-year career in the NHL who spent the 2003–04 season with the Devils, was inducted in 2008. Two Devils centers were inducted in 2011: Doug Gilmour, who had played for the team from 1996 to 1998, and Joe Nieuwendyk, a member of the club from 2001 to 2003. In 2013, the Hall of Fame again inducted two former Devils players: left wing Brendan Shanahan, who had played for the team from 1987 to 1991 and again for the 2008–09 season, and defenseman Scott Niedermayer, who was a Devil from 1992 to 2004.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 World Cup champions were {{coached by}} Sir Brian Lochore who had {{represented}} New Zealand in 25 tests between 1964 and 1971, including 17 as captain. He was knighted in 1999 for his lifetime services to rugby. Four of the 1987 World Cup squad {{that he had}} coached are also inductees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fame.</b> Sir John Kirwan played a total of 63 tests between 1984 and 1994, scoring 35 tries, an All Blacks record at the time. In the 1987 World Cup opener against Italy, Kirwan raced 90 meters to score one of the tries of the tournament. An All Black from 1984 to 1993, Grant Fox was one of New Zealand's greatest point-scorers with 1067 points, including 645 test points. Fox played 46 tests, including the 1987 World Cup final against France. Known as The Iceman, Michael Jones {{was one of the}} greatest open side flankers of all time. Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Jones first played international rugby for Samoa, then for New Zealand, playing 55 tests between 1987 and 1998. Due to his Christian faith, Jones never played rugby on Sundays, resulting in him not playing in the 1991 World Cup semi-final against Australia, and also in him not being picked for the 1995 World Cup squad. The team's captain, David Kirk, was inducted into the World Rugby Hall alongside Lochore; all other World Cup-winning captains through 2007 (minus the already-inducted Australian John Eales) were also enshrined at this ceremony.|$|E
