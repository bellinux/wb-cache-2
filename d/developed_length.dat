The first step is to determine the maximum pressure drop between the most remote cold water plumbing fixture and the main distribution supply. The <b>developed</b> <b>length</b> of pipe from the supply to the fixture is then determined from the plumbing drawings.

A uniform inlet velocity was assumed for two different scenarios, namely at the straight duct inlet and at the inlet of a right-angle elbow located immediately upstream of the straight duct. Using STAR CCM+ commercial software, velocity gradient profiles and pressure gradient profiles were obtained for different flow rats and duct sizes representing a range used in engineering practice including round and rectangular duct geometries with the latter having aspect ratios of 1, 1. 5, and 2. The {{results show that the}} velocity and pressure <b>developing</b> <b>lengths</b> in round ducts were shorter than those in corresponding square ducts by around 13 % and 19 %, respectively. Also, the velocity and pressure <b>developing</b> <b>lengths</b> in round ducts were shorter than the corresponded rectangular ducts with a 1. 5 aspect ratio by around 25 % and 30 % respectively. Similarly, the <b>developing</b> <b>length</b> in the round ducts were shorter than the corresponding rectangular ducts with an aspect ratio of 2 by around 36 % based on the velocity profiles and 40 % based on the pressure profiles. All of the above results indicate that the <b>developing</b> <b>length</b> of the flow is geometry dependent in addition to being Reynolds number dependent. Comparing the CFD results for the square and rectangular ducts shows that the velocity <b>developing</b> <b>length</b> of the square duct was 15 % and 27 % less than the <b>developing</b> <b>length</b> for the 1. 5 and 2 aspect ratio ducts, respectively.

40|$|Sheet-metal {{components}} are used {{extensively in the}} aerospace and the electronic industry, where high precision is an essential requirement for the final products. In precision components, the calculation of the bend allowance is important,in arriving at the final dimensions of the <b>developed</b> <b>length</b> of the sheet metal. Bend allowance {{is defined as the}} length of the unstretched fiber in the bent portion of the sheet. Any inaccuracy in calculating the bend-allowance parameter during bending may result in increasing the inaccuracy in the final <b>developed</b> <b>length</b> of the sheet. This causes the blank size to be incorrect, which in turn causes the location of bend lines, slots, and holes to be inaccurate. This may cause mismatch in the final assembly also. In this paper an attempt has been made to first review the current industrial practice for the calculation of bend allowance. The current empirical methods used to calculate the bend-allowance parameter are examined and the drawbacks associated with them are identified. The highlight of this paper is on a mathematical model which has been developed to calculate the bend-allowance parameter accurately by assuming plane-strain deformation and a rigid-plastic material, considering thinning effects. The effects of temperature and friction are neglected. The bend-allowance parameter is calculated on the basis of material properties such as the yield stress and the strain-hardening exponent, and the tool geometry. The model has been tested with available data in the literature to assess its accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) is {{becoming}} a popular particle based method to study flow through microchannels due to {{the ease with which}} the presence of biological cells or DNA chains can be modeled. Many Lab-On-Chip (LOC) devices require the ability to manipulate the transport of cells or DNA chains in the fluid flow. Microchannel surfaces coated with combinations of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials have been found useful for this purpose. In this work, we have numerically studied the hydrodynamics of a steady nonuniform developing flow between two infinite parallel plates with hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces using DPD for the first time. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces were modeled using partial-slip and no-slip boundary conditions respectively in the simulations. We also propose a new method to model the inflow and outflow boundaries for the DPD simulations. The simulation results of the developing flow match analytical solutions from continuum theory for no-slip and partial-slip surfaces to good accord. The entrance region constitutes a considerable fraction of the channel length in miniaturized devices. Thus it is desirable for the <b>length</b> of the <b>developing</b> region to be short as most microfluidic devices such as cell or DNA separators and mixers are designed for the developed flow field.

However, unlike heat exchange processes, {{the implementation of}} chemical syntheses requires to control the residence time to complete the chemistry. A way to combine the laminar regime (i. e. enough residence time) with a plug flow and the intensification of both heat and mass transfers is the corrugation of the reaction path.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{geometric}} characteristics of synthetic macrofibers {{are important because}} they affect the behavior of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC). Because {{there is a lack}} of specific, relevant publications in Brazil, the European standard EN 14889 - 2 : 2006 was adopted as a reference to perform the characterization. Thus, an experimental plan was developed to assess the adequacy of testing procedures for the qualification of synthetic macrofibers for use in FRC. Two types of macrofibers were evaluated. The length measurement was performed using two methods: the caliper method, which is a manual measurement, and the digital image analysis method using the ImageJ software for image processing. These aforementioned methods were used to determine the diameter together with the density method, which is an indirect method that uses the <b>developed</b> <b>length</b> obtained by one of the previous methods. The statistical analyses revealed that the length results are similar regardless of the method used. However, the macrofibers must be pre-stretched to maximize the accuracy of caliper measurements. The caliper method for diameter determination has the disadvantage of underestimating the macrofiber cross-section because of the pressure applied by the load claws. In contrast, the digital image analysis method obtains the projected diameter in a single plane, which overestimate the diameter because the macrofibers are oriented with the pressure of the scanner cover. Thus, these techniques may result in false projections of the diameters that will depend on the level of torsion in the macrofibers. It was concluded that both the caliper method using previously stretched macrofibers and the digital imaging method can be used to measure length. The density method presented the best results for the diameter determination because these results were not affected by the method chosen to determine the length...|$|E

40|$|Hypothermia is a {{life-threatening}} condition. Currently, active warming methods {{are the most}} effective treatment for dysthermic patients. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in evaluating the thermal performance of a parallel/counter-parallel flow heat exchanger used as part of a fluid warmer to treat Hypothermia. The 3 D model of the heat exchanger is divided into three regions; Infusate (fluid to be heated), Hot Water (heating fluid), and a Solid Region (wall). At the end of the heat exchanger, an elbow section is used to create the counter-parallel flow arrangement specific to this design. The primary focus of this study involves evaluating heat transfer between the Infusate and Hot Water regions. Several simulations were performed for varying heat exchanger lengths (0. 6, 1. 2, 1. 8, and 2. 4 m). The current CFD predicted values were compared to previously collected experimental data. In the experimental set-up, the outlet temperature was evaluated using a center-point temperature probe. The current CFD study evaluated the outlets in terms of mean bulk temperature to better characterize the thermodynamic average with respect to fluid flow. Despite this difference, the CFD results of the Infusate outlet temperatures were within 20 % of the previously published experimental values. Using a center-point temperature probe, the CFD simulations were within 8 % of the experimental values. It was concluded that the CFD model accurately represented the thermodynamic characteristics of the heat exchanger and can be used for future design purposes. The Hot Water region features a unique geometric variation on the traditional concentric annulus; a separation along the mid-plane confines the flow to have the area of a true concentric annulus. As such, CFD was used to investigate the thermalhydraulic effects within the Hot Water region (semi-annulus). Correlations were developed to predict the hydrodynamic and thermal <b>developing</b> <b>lengths</b> within the Hot Water region. These correlations were determined for developing flow at the inlet and after the elbow sections of the Hot Water region. CFD simulations of the Hot Water region demonstrated increasing hydrodynamic and thermal <b>developing</b> <b>lengths</b> for increasing Reynolds Number under laminar and turbulent flow. Increased mass flow rates produce increased forces within the flow area, requiring increased axial length for thermal and hydrodynamic profiles to stabilize. Developing effects within a concentric annulus has been addressed in the literature; however the flow characteristics within the proposed semi-annulus are not as well understood. A comparative study was performed evaluating the studied Hot Water semi-annulus against a true concentric annulus. The CFD <b>developed</b> hydrodynamic entrance <b>length</b> correlation for the Hot Water region (semi-annulus) under laminar flow was compared to a known entrance length correlation for a true concentric annulus. Due to the separation along the mid-plane of the Hot Water region, the flow area and wetted perimeter of a true concentric annulus is expected to be greater than that of the semi-annular geometry. Greater flow interaction with the wall in the semi-annulus increases the viscous drag on the fluid, resulting generally in a lower non-dimensionalized <b>developing</b> <b>length</b> as a function of Reynolds Number. Pressure drop within the Hot Water region was also evaluated and compared to known properties of a true concentric annulus within the fully developed region. Under both laminar and turbulent flow, the studied semi-annulus of the Hot Water region demonstrated greater pressure drop than a true concentric annulus with similar dimensions and flow conditions. The elbow section of the Hot Water region produced a significant pressure drop, which may be due to the abrupt change in flow direction resulting in increased centrifugal forces and recirculation zones. The thermal and hydrodynamic properties revealed in the CFD simulations can be used to improve future design considerations, which may lead to improved Hypothermia treatment protocols and patient care...|$|R
