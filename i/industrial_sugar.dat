50|$|A typical sugar {{estate was}} 900 acre. This {{included}} a Great House where the owner or overseer and the domestic enslaved Africans lived, and nearby accommodation for the bookkeeper, distiller, mason, carpenter, blacksmith, cooper and wheelwright. With {{the exception of}} the bookkeeper, {{by the middle of the}} eighteenth century, skilled enslaved Africans had replaced white indentured servants in these posts. The field enslavement' quarters were usually about a half mile away, closer to the <b>industrial</b> <b>sugar</b> mill, distillery and the boiling and curing houses, as well as the blacksmiths' and carpenters' sheds and thrash houses. In addition, there was a poultry pen and a cattle yard along with a hospital for Africans. Some estates, if large enough, had accommodation for an estate doctor. Estates had estate gardens and the Africans had their own kitchen gardens as well as polnicks provision grounds found in the hills, which were required by law from as early as 1678. During enslavement, however, the enslaved Africans kept pigs and poultry and grew mangoes, plantain, ackee, okra, yam and other ground provisions. The cultivation of these lands took on greater proportions as plantations were abandoned when the island faced increasing competition from Brazil, Cuba and beet sugar, a loss in labour after emancipation in the 1830s as well as the loss of protective trade duties after the passage of the 1846 Sugar Equalization Act in England.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>sugar</b> {{production}} started {{slowly in}} Hawaii. The first sugar mill was created {{on the island}} of Lanai in 1802 by an unidentified Chinese man who returned to China in 1803. [...] The first sugarcane plantation, known as the Old Sugar Mill of Koloa, was established in 1835 by Ladd & Co. and in 1836 the first 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) of sugar and molasses was shipped to the United States. [...] By the 1840s, sugarcane plantations gained a foothold in Hawaiian agriculture. Steamships provided rapid and reliable transportation to the islands, and demand increased during the California Gold Rush. [...] The land division law of 1848 (known as The Great Mahele) displaced Hawaiian people from their land, forming the basis for the sugarcane plantation economy. [...] In 1850, the law was amended to allow foreign residents to buy and lease land. In 1850, when California became a state, profits declined and the number of plantations decreased to five due to the import tariff that was created. Market demand increased even further during the onset of the American Civil War which prevented Southern sugar from being shipped northward. [...] The price of sugar rose 525% from 4 cents per pound in 1861 to 25 cents in 1864. [...] The Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 allowed Hawaii to sell sugar to the United States without paying duties or taxes, greatly increasing plantation profits. [...] This treaty also guaranteed that all of the resources including land, water, human labor power, capital, and technology would be thrown behind sugarcane cultivation. [...] The 1890 McKinley Tariff Act, an effort by the United States government to decrease the competitive pricing of Hawaiian sugar, paid 2 cents per pound to mainland producers. After significant lobbying efforts, this act was repealed in 1894. [...] By 1890, 75% of all privately held land was owned by foreign businessmen. The plantation owners wanted the United States to annex Hawaii so that Hawaiian sugar would never again be subject to tariffs. They also wanted the United States to annex Hawaii so there could be a U.S military base on the island (Pearl Harbor).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the situation in}} the EU markets for <b>industrial</b> <b>sugar.</b> The Common Market Organization for Sugar sets an intervention price of € 63. 19 but actual transaction pries are 10 - 20 percent higher. The only reasonable explanation for the observed market behavior is tacit collusion. We analyze the effects of a number of proposed reform alternatives and we find that lowering the intervention price or the export subsidies will only serve to strengthen the tacitly collusive behavior whereas tariff reductions will always be beneficial to the EU consumer.
