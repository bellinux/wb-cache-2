50|$|In {{computer}} science, synchronization {{refers to}} one of two distinct but related concepts: synchronization of processes, and synchronization of <b>data.</b> <b>Process</b> synchronization refers to the idea that multiple processes are to join up or handshake at a certain point, in order to reach an agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action. Data synchronization refers to the idea of keeping multiple copies of a dataset in coherence with one another, or to maintain data integrity. Process synchronization primitives are commonly used to implement data synchronization.|$|E

50|$|Information Technology Auditing (IT auditing) {{began as}} Electronic <b>Data</b> <b>Process</b> (EDP) Auditing and {{developed}} {{largely as a}} result of the rise in technology in accounting systems, the need for IT control, and the impact of computers on the ability to perform attestation services. The last few years have been an exciting time in the world of IT auditing as a result of the accounting scandals and increased regulation. IT auditing has had a relatively short yet rich history when compared to auditing as a whole and remains an ever-changing field.|$|E

The IBM Industry Models are used primarily for the development of internal company standards, and provide an overall integration layer across an organization's existing and future IT investments. With their strong business and IT orientation, IBM Industry Models are designed to be customized to reflect the precise needs of every company using them. Hence, every company will have its own customized industry-specific version of IBM's <b>data,</b> <b>process</b> and service models, allowing them to represent areas that are unique to their business and constitute competitive advantage. In addition, the models can be easily augmented to embrace industry extensions, jurisdiction and company-specific extensions easily.|$|E

5000|$|The {{household}} robot Modulus, {{described by}} the manufacturer as [...] "the friend of Homo sapiens", was made by Sirius, a company Massimo Giuliana set up in 1982 for marketing home and personal computers, and which decided to start building its own domestic robot back in 1984. When the first [...] "Modulus" [...] prototype had been realized, the company asked Isao Hosoe, a Japanese designer who has been {{living and working in}} Milan for many years, to study its [...] "body-work". Hosoe's work, however, went well beyond this, and was followed by a complete technological reprocessing of the robot. <b>Data</b> <b>Process</b> was responsible for the design and manufacture of the electronic and mechanical parts, while Sirius used the expertise of an American company, the RB Robot Corporation, for the software (its founder, Joseph H. Bosworth, is known by some as [...] "the father of personal robotics").|$|E
5000|$|Themes {{differ from}} codes in that themes are phrases or {{sentences}} that identifies what the data means. They describe {{an outcome of}} coding for analytic reflection. Themes consist of ideas and descriptions within a culture {{that can be used}} to explain causal events, statements, and morals derived from the participants' stories. In subsequent phases, it is important to narrow down the potential themes to provide an overreaching theme. Thematic analysis allows for categories or themes to emerge from the data like the following: repeating ideas; indigenous terms, metaphors and analogies; shifts in topic; and similarities and differences of participants' linguistic expression. It is important at this point to address not only what is present in data, but also what is missing from the data. [...] conclusion of this phase should yield many candidate themes collected throughout the <b>data</b> <b>process.</b> It is crucial to avoid discarding themes even if they are initially insignificant as they may be important themes later in the analysis process.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{college in}} PUP is the College of Education, tracing its roots {{back as a}} course in {{business}} education in 1904. From the entrepreneurship courses offered in 1904 began the College of Business Administration, while the College of Accountancy and Finance started in 1960 as a bachelor program in Commerce with major in Accounting. The College of Computer and Information Sciences started in 1969 as an Electronic <b>Data</b> <b>Process</b> course offered by the College of Accountancy. To develop the culture of sports and athleticism, the present-day College of Human Kinetics was established in 1978 as the College of Physical Education and Sports. The College of Engineering was established in 1986 as the College of Engineering and Architecture. In 2001, several collegiate departments were elevated into its own college {{which resulted in the}} establishment of the College of Architecture and Fine Arts, College of Communication, College of Law, and the College of Tourism, Hospitality, and Transportation Management. Its newest academic units are the College of Arts and Letters, College of Political Science and Public Administration and the College of Social Sciences and Development, all of which are founded through an organizational restructuring in 2012.|$|E
