Finally in 1862 Brogdens sold the U to the existing Furness Railway having made little or no direct profit.

We investigate what this means for the dynamics of de facto financial globalization, using recently developed threshold and sample splitting methods. We find that there are indeed signs of multiple equilibria in the dynamics of financial integration. We confirm that the main cause for these non-linearities is the quality of the institutional context, as measured by corruption, investment profile, capital account balance and aggregate <b>growth</b> <b>prospect...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Bahamas is a stable, {{developing}} {{nation with}} an economy {{heavily dependent on}} tourism and offshore banking. Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had led to solid GDP growth for many years, but the slowdown in the US economy and the attacks of September 11, 2001 held back growth in these sectors in 2001-03. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many international businesses have left The Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors. Overall <b>growth</b> <b>prospects</b> {{in the short run}} rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US, the source of more than 80% of the visitors.

The 2014 Country Report describes economic <b>growth</b> <b>prospects</b> as generally positive as the result of large revenues from fishing licenses, together with substantial foreign aid. While a budget deficit of A$0.4 million was projected for 2015, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) assessed the budget as being A$14.3m in surplus as the result of high tuna fish license fees. The ADB predicted that the 2% growth rate for 2015 would continue into 2016. Nonetheless, Tuvalu has the smallest GDP of any sovereign nation in the world.|$|E

In addition, the effect of emotional language on investors will depend on investors' prior beliefs about the firm. Using a sample of 8, 990 transcripts of presentations by executives of 632 organizations at investor conferences between 2004 and 2010, results support the prediction that executives' use of emotional language has a significant influence on investors and that different ways of expressing emotion have differential effects on investor judgment. Moreover, the effect of emotional language is stronger when the firm's uncertainty level is high and <b>growth</b> <b>prospect</b> is low. The results provide insights into how organizations can use language strategically to manage their relationships with stock investors, thereby contributing to a growing literature on symbolic management of organization.
