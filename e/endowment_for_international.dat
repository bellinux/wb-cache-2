5000|$|According to the WWF, [...] "since {{establishing}} The 1001, WWF International {{has been}} able to use interest from the trust fund to help meet its basic administration costs". The establishment of a permanent <b>endowment</b> <b>for</b> WWF <b>International</b> aimed at permitting the international headquarters of the WWF to be financially independent of its national sections. The funds raised through the 1001 Club would enable the WWF's international headquarters to assure potential donors that their money would not be used for headquarters' administrative expenses, since these were already largely assured by the endowment. As one of its consequences this arrangement made WWF International financially independent of the national WWF sections worldwide.|$|R
