5|$|This {{foundation}} stallion {{produced a}} descendent, named Old Tobe, {{who became the}} more modern father of the Rocky Mountain Horse breed. Old Tobe was owned by a resident of Spout Springs, Kentucky named Sam Tuttle. For most of the 20th century, Tuttle was a prominent breeder of Rocky Mountain Horses, and helped to keep the strain alive during the Great Depression and World War II. After World War II, despite declining horse populations in the US, Tuttle kept his herd, and continued to use Old Tobe as a breeding stallion. Tuttle held the Natural Bridge State Park concession for horseback riding, and used Old Tobe for trail rides {{in the park and}} for siring additional trail horses, the latter until the stallion was 34 years old. Old Tobe {{died at the age of}} 37. The presence of the single-foot gait makes <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breed is in part descended from the Narragansett Pacer, a breed known for passing its gaited ability on to other American breeds.|$|E
5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E
5|$|Watkin {{continued}} to harbour ambitions of linking his railway {{companies in the}} north and south of England, and while the construction of the Rickmansworth extension was underway planned two possible routes north from Rickmansworth across the Chilterns. One proposal envisaged the MR taking over or reaching agreement with the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, building a link between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury, and running over the A's line to the north. The A had close relations with the Great Western Railway, with whom they shared a station at Aylesbury. Watkin felt <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> A would reach agreement with the GWR instead and not cooperate with the MR.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the three}} kings, Máel Coluim {{appears to have}} been the most powerful, and it is {{possible}} that Mac Bethad and Echmarcach were underkings or clientkings of his. Mac Bethad appears to have become Mormaer of Moray in 1032 after the slaying of his kinsman, Gilla Comgáin mac Máel Brigti, Mormaer of Moray (died 1032). Previous rulers of Moray are sometimes styled as kings by various Irish annals, a fact which may explain why Mac Bethad was called a king when he met Knútr. Although the apparent date of Mac Bethad's accession to the mormaership (1032) appears to contradict the date of the kings' meeting (1031), this discrepancy can be accounted for in two ways. One possibility is that Gilla Comgáin was actually slain in 1031 but only recorded in 1032. Another possibility is that Knútr merely returned from Rome in 1031, but actually met with the kings in 1032, after Gilla Comgáin's demise and Mac Bethad's accession. There is further evidence that could cast doubt on the date of the meeting. Although the aforesaid versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date Knútr's pilgrimage to 1031, he is otherwise known to have visited Rome in 1027. Whilst it is possible he undertook two pilgrimages during his career, {{it is more likely that}} the chronicle has misdated his journey. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chronicle failed to account for the time in which Knútr spent on the continent and Scandinavia after having visited Rome.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of nearby Romano-British occupation, which numismatic evidence shows extended to at least c. 370. and Tester suggested that the Anglo-Saxons might have intentionally adopted Fordcroft as a cemetery site because of this.

This is just the period in which humanmade carbon dioxide has been pouring into the atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaur {{eggs and}} nests were {{discovered}} by John R. Horner in 1983 in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. Varriccho et al. (2002) have described eight of these nests found to date. These {{are all in}} the collection of the Museum of the Rockies and their accession numbers are MOR 246, 299, 393, 675, 676, 750, 963, 1139. Horner (1984) found isolated bones and partial skeletons of the hypsilophodont Orodromeus very near the nests in the same horizon and described the eggs as those of Orodromeus. Horner and Weishampel (1996) reexamined the embryos preserved in the eggs and determined that they were those of Troodon, not Orodromeus. Varricchio et al. (1997) made this determination with even more certainty when they described a partial skeleton of an adult Troodon (MOR 748) in contact with a clutch of at least five eggs (MOR 750), probably in a brooding position. Van der Reest and Currie considered <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Two Medicine troodont was the same species as Stenonychosaurus.|$|E
25|$|The narrator {{introduces}} a character he once dreamed about, an Abyssinian maid who sings of another land. She is {{a figure of}} imaginary power within the poem who can inspire within the narrator his own ability to craft poetry. When she sings, {{she is able to}} inspire and mesmerise the poet by describing a false paradise. The woman herself is similar to the way Coleridge describes Lewti in another poem he wrote around the same time Lewti. The connection between Lewti and the Abyssinian maid makes <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maid was intended as a disguised version of Mary Evans, who appears as a love interest since Coleridge's 1794 poem The Sigh. Evans, in the poems, appears as an object of sexual desire and a source of inspiration. She is also similar to the later subject of many of Coleridge's poems, Asra, based on Sara Hutchinson, whom Coleridge wanted but was not his wife and experienced opium induced dreams of being with her.|$|E

25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to chip off a large number not nearly enough energy was available. Nor was <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? We {{knew that there were}} strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E
25|$|After its subjugation, {{the state}} of Xu was forced to remain a vassal of the Zhou dynasty for almost one hundred years. The turning point came in the mid 10th century BC: Around 957 BC, the Zhou dynasty lost a {{disastrous}} war against Chu. This defeat appears to have thrown the dynasty into chaos. Based on archaeological findings, Edward L. Shaughnessy even speculates that the Zhou dynasty was so weakened that it largely retreated to its capital area, leaving most of its empire to fend for itself. Building upon this theory, Manfred Frühauf believes that the Huaiyi, among them Xu, regained their independence as consequence of this general Zhou retreat. Regardless of whether this was the case, by 944 BC, Xu and the Huaiyi had definitely regained their independence, as Lord Yan of Xu managed to unite thirty-six Dongyi and Huaiyi states under his leadership, declared himself king and proceeded to invade the Zhou empire. The reasons for this invasion are unknown, but Frühauf speculates {{that it was a}} preventive strike to prevent the Zhou from restoring their domination over the Huaiyi, while Sawyer considers <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Xu either wanted to plunder the Zhou royal domain or aimed to supplant the Zhou rule and establish their own dynasty. The course and scale of the invasion are equally controversial, based on different interpretations of bronze inscriptions and historical texts. It is even disputed if there was just one or two invasions. Generally agreed, however, {{is the result of the}} attacks: Even though the Zhou forces had eventually succeeded in driving the invaders back, they could not subjugate the Huaiyi again and were forced to acknowledge their independence in a peace treaty. If records in the Book of the Later Han, probably based upon early texts of the Bamboo Annals, are to believed, Xu was particularly strengthened by the war. Recognizing that he could not defeat the Huaiyi, King Mu of Zhou recognized King Yan of Xu as overlord over a large confederation that covered most of the Huai River valley and regions south of it. As result, Xu became the new major power of the east and a serious political rival to the Zhou dynasty. The Zuo Zhuan suggests that this confederation also included the remaining Xu enclaves in western Shandong. In the course of its political ascent, Xu's cultural influence began to spread as far as the Yangtze delta region.|$|E

500|$|The eastern {{origin of}} the breed was first {{proposed}} by archaeologist Johannes Reinhold Aspelin, who published Suomalaisen hevosen kotoperäisyydestä ("On the Nativity of the Finnish horse") in 1886–1887. Aspelin proposed that Finnish horses descended from an animal that had accompanied the Finno-Ugric peoples' migration from the Volga region and middle Russia to {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Finland. A similar idea was suggested over a hundred years earlier by natural historian Pehr Adrian Gadd, and this theory has continued to receive support into modern times. Genetic study in 2014 concluded that closest relatives to the Finnhorse were Estonian horse, Mezen horse, Yakutian horse and Mongolian horse. The veterinarian Ludvig Fabritius considered the proposed prototype a side branch of a [...] "Tartarian" [...] breed, and considered <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same prototype also influenced Estonian, Swedish and Norwegian horse populations.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth.

But how is <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true {{if it would be}} accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E
