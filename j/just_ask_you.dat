2500|$|Because {{the films}} {{were being made}} as the novels were being published, the filmmakers {{had no idea of}} the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his {{relationship}} with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, [...] "The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'" [...] Kloves also said, [...] "I don't know what compelled me to say this , but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me." ...|$|E

5000|$|It Takes a Thief, {{which was}} created by {{television}} writer Roland Kibbee, featured the adventures of cat burglar, pickpocket, and thief Alexander Mundy, who steals to finance {{his life as a}} polished playboy and sophisticate. He is in prison when the U.S. government's SIA (the fictional Secret Intelligence Agency) proposes a deal to Mundy: steal for the government in exchange for his freedom. Mundy is puzzled and asks, [...] "Let me get this straight. You want me to steal?"

6000|$|... "Why, as to that matter, Hetty," [...] {{returned}} {{the individual in}} question, [...] "you've put it pretty much in the natyve character of the religious truth. Hurry has not been able, {{and that is the}} long and short of it. I've seen many squalls, old fellow, both on land and on the water, but never did I feel one as lively and as snappish as that which come down upon us, night afore last, in the shape of an Indian hurrah-boys! Why, Hetty, you're no great matter at a reason, or an idee that lies a little deeper than common, but you're human and have some human notions--now I'll <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to look at them circumstances. Here was old Tom, your father, and myself, bent on a legal operation, as is to be seen {{in the words of the}} law and the proclamation; thinking no harm; when we were set upon by critturs that were more like a pack of hungry wolves than mortal savages even, and there they had us tethered like two sheep, in less time than it has taken me to tell you the story." ...|$|E

"Captain," [...] he {{at length}} resumed, [...] "I {{know when a}} poor man talks of credit, he deals in a {{delicate}} word, according to the fashions of the world; and when an old man talks of life, he speaks of that which he may never see; nevertheless {{there is one thing}} I will say, and that is not so much on my own behalf as on that of another person. Here is Hector, a good and faithful pup, that has long outlived the time of a dog; and, like his master, he looks more to comfort now, than to any deeds in running. But the creatur' has his feelings as well as a Christian. He has consorted latterly with his kinsman, there, in such a sort as to find great pleasure in his company, and I will acknowledge that it touches my feelings to part the pair so soon. If you will set a value on your hound, I will endeavour to send it to you in the spring, more especially should them same traps come safe to hand; or, if you dislike parting with the animal altogether, I will <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for his loan through the winter. I think I can see my pup will not last beyond that time, for I have judgment in these matters, since many is the friend, both hound and Red-skin, that I have seen depart in my day, though the Lord hath not yet seen fit to order his angels to sound forth my name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 7. Morning. Your new Lord Chancellor(9) {{sets out}} to-morrow for Ireland: I never saw him. He carries over one Trapp(10) a parson as his chaplain, {{a sort of}} pretender to wit, a second-rate pamphleteer for the cause, whom they pay by sending him to Ireland. I never saw Trapp neither. I met Tighe(11) and your Smyth of Lovet's {{yesterday}} by the Exchange. Tighe and I took no notice of each other; but I stopped Smyth, and told him of the box that lies for you at Chester, because he says he goes very soon to Ireland, I think this week: and I will send this morning to Sterne, to take measures with Smyth; so good-morrow, sirrahs, and let me rise, pray. I took up this paper when I came in at evening, I mean this minute, and then said I, [...] "No, no, indeed, MD, you must stay"; and then was laying it aside, but could not for my heart, though I am very busy, till I <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> how you do since morning; by and by we shall talk more, so let me leave you: softly down, little paper, till then; so there--now to business; there, I say, get you gone; no, I will not push you neither, but hand you on one side--So--Now I am got into bed, I'll talk with you. Mr. Secretary St. John sent for me this morning in all haste; but I would not lose my shaving, for fear of missing church. I went to Court, which is of late always very full; and young Manley and I dined at Sir Matthew Dudley's.--I must talk politics. I protest I am afraid we shall all be embroiled with parties. The Whigs, now they are fallen, are the most malicious toads in the world. We have had now a second misfortune, the loss of several Virginia ships. I fear people will begin to think that nothing thrives under this Ministry: and if the Ministry can once be rendered odious to the people, the Parliament may be chosen Whig or Tory as the Queen pleases. Then I think our friends press a little too hard on the Duke of Marlborough. The country members(12) are violent to have past faults inquired into, and they have reason; but I do not observe the Ministry to be very fond of it. In my opinion {{we have nothing to}} save us but a Peace; and I am sure we cannot have such a one as we hoped; and then the Whigs will bawl what they would have done had they continued in power. I tell the Ministry this as much as I dare; and shall venture to say a little more to them, especially about the Duke of Marlborough, who, as the Whigs give out, will lay down his command; and I question whether ever any wise State laid aside a general who had been successful nine years together, whom the enemy so much dread, and his own soldiers cannot but believe must always conquer; and you know that in war opinion is nine parts in ten. The Ministry hear me always with appearance of regard, and much kindness; but I doubt they let personal quarrels mingle too much with their proceedings. Meantime, they seem to value all this as nothing, and are as easy and merry as if they had nothing in their hearts or upon their shoulders; like physicians, who endeavour to cure, but feel no grief, whatever the patient suffers.--Pshaw, what is all this? Do you know one thing, that I find I can write politics to you much easier than to anybody alive? But I swear my head is full; and I wish I were at Laracor, with dear, charming MD, etc.|$|E
