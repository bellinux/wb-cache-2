I thought, at first, it would be fine to have a talking goat, with whom I could converse as I rode about my city on his back; but--keek-eek-eek-eek!--the rascal treats me as if I were a chimney sweep instead of a King. <b>Heh,</b> <b>heh,</b> <b>heh,</b> keek, eek!

Inqlab- 91. Inoculated as well as uninoculated seeds were germinated and grown under 0 and 100 mM NaCl stress for 10 days. Different growth parameters and some biochemical characters were considered for these studies. Salinity reduced the percentage germination, root, shoot, seedling length as well as fresh weight per seedlings, whereas it increased the dry matter accumulation, Na+, K+ uptake, protein, auxin content and activity of peroxidases and acid phosphatases in uninoculated seedlings. While the association of many bacterial strains with wheat enhanced the seedling growth under 0 and 100 mM NaCl stress. Bacterial inoculations improved different growth parameters by reducing the Na+ uptake and improving the protein content, auxin production and alteration in enzyme activities...|$|R

40|$|In all {{eukaryotic}} cell, form yeast to humans, the Nuclear Pore Complexes {{provide the}} main {{gateway to the}} nuclear interior. While the transport of soluble cargo’s {{in and out of}} the nucleus is relatively well understood, the transport of membrane proteins that reside in the membranes of the nuclear envelope is less well understood. The inner membrane proteins are an important class of proteins as they are involved in organizing the chromatin and positioning and connecting the nucleus within the cell. Their malfunction is associated with a number of genetic diseases jointly called laminopathies. We want to understand how these membrane proteins arrive at the inner membrane after their synthesis at the outside of the nucleus. We used baker’s yeast, a single cell eukaryote, as model organism and two proteins, named <b>Heh</b> 1 and <b>Heh</b> 2, to unravel the mechanism of transport. Using a combination of microscopy and structural studies, we studied what sorting signals are needed on the membrane proteins, how they interact with the transport chaperones and how their transport depends of the different components of the Nuclear Pore Complex. Thus, our study appends toward the understanding of membrane protein transport...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel tunable multi-frequency hybrid energy harvester (<b>HEH).</b> It {{consists of a}} piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) and an electromagnetic energy harvester (EMEH), which are coupled with magnetic interaction. An electromechanical coupling model was developed and numerically simulated. The effects of magnetic force, mass ratio, stiffness ratio, and mechanical damping ratios on the output power were investigated. A prototype was fabricated and characterized by experiments. The measured first peak power increases by 16. 7 % and 833. 3 % {{compared with that of}} the multi-frequency EMEH and the multi-frequency PEH, respectively. It is 2. 36 times more than the combined output power of the linear PEH and linear EMEH at 22. 6 Hz. The half-power bandwidth for the first peak power is also broadened. Numerical results agree well with the experimental data. It is indicated that magnetic interaction can tune the resonant frequencies. Both magnetic coupling configuration and hybrid conversion mechanism contribute to enhancing the output power and widening the operation bandwidth. The magnitude and direction of magnetic force have significant effects on the performance of the <b>HEH.</b> This proposed <b>HEH</b> is an effective approach to improve the generating performance of the micro-scale energy harvesting devices in low-frequency range...|$|R
40|$|High {{hyperdiploidy}} (<b>HeH,</b> 51 - 65 chromosomes) is {{an established}} genetic subtype of {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} (ALL). The clinical and cytogenetic features as well as outcome of <b>HeH</b> among adolescents and adults have not been thoroughly investigated. Among 1232 B-cell precursor ALL patients (15 - 65 years) treated in the UKALLXII/ECOG 2993 trial, 160 (13 %) had a <b>HeH</b> karyotype, including 80 patients aged > 24 years. The frequency of <b>HeH</b> was the same in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive and -negative cases, but Ph-positive patients were older. The cytogenetic profiles of Ph-positive and Ph-negative <b>HeH</b> cases were similar, although trisomy 2 was strongly associated with Ph-positive <b>HeH.</b> Overall, Ph-positive <b>HeH</b> patients {{did not have an}} inferior overall survival compared with Ph-negative patients (P= 0. 2 : 50 vs 57 % at 5 years). Trisomy of chromosome 4 was associated with a superior outcome in Ph-negative patients, whereas + 5 and + 20 were associated with an inferior outcome in Ph-positive and Ph-negative patients, respectively. All three markers retained significance in multivariate analysis adjusting for age and white cell count: hazard ratio for risk of death 0. 47 (95 % CI: 0. 27 - 0. 84) (P= 0. 01), 3. 73 (1. 51 - 9. 21) (P= 0. 004) and 2. 63 (1. 25 - 5. 54) (P= 0. 01), respectively. In conclusion, <b>HeH</b> is an important subtype of ALL at all ages and displays outcome heterogeneity according to chromosomal gain...|$|R

5000|$|Foghorn is knocked {{unconscious}} {{when his}} sled hits a log Dawg has placed in his path. While Foghorn is down, Dawg covers him in water, which freezes him. Dawg tells weasel to eat hearty, so the weasel hits the frozen Foghorn with an axe. Foghorn says he's got a splitting headache and falls in half. To get revenge, Foghorn traps Dawg {{in a bag}} and gives him to the weasel to cook. While being peppered, Dawg sneezes, which causes an avalanche of snow to fall on him. A furious Dawg tells the weasel that he's a dog {{and that he should}} get a chicken instead ("What you want is a chicken! R-A-T. Chicken."). Later, the skiing Foghorn hits a tall pole and slides into a cooking pot, where the weasel is hungrily waiting. Foghorn bolts. Dawg hands a club to the weasel, who chases Foghorn until he is distracted by a huge Foghorn ice statue, which he proceeds to gnaw on. The real Foghorn, watching from behind a tree, thinks his troubles are over until at least the Fourth of July. In the final setpiece, Foghorn pulls on what he thinks is Barnyard Dawg's tail from his doghouse, but it's revealed to be a lit rocket that shoots Foghorn into the sky. Dawg remarks: [...] "The Fourth of July came a little oily this year! <b>Heh</b> <b>heh</b> heh..." [...] and the cartoon ends.|$|E
