6000|$|... "I reckon I can; leastwise <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try.</b> I won't lose {{it unless}} they {{take to the}} rocks and leave the river entirely, and it ain't likely they'll do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{student is}} too mean a prey to be meddled with,' {{proceeded}} Malcolm, 'and is sure of hospitality in castle or convent. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> at Coldingham {{to find out}} whither the two monks are gone, and then follow up the track.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{will come}} as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> to reach you by {{daylight}} to-morrow. My heart is with you. Call up the Redfields; they will help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to hope too--and to help if <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>tried</b> to {{help him}} to- day, but now I fear that I have made a mistake, and that his wife will not thank me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have always}} done your duty," [...] she rejoined, with a faint smile. [...] "Let me take example from you, if <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>try</b> to do mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you really?" [...] John Creedy went on. [...] "It is {{not good}} for man to live alone; he wants a helpmate. Oh, Miss Ethel, may I venture to hope that perhaps, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to deserve you, you will be mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very little, I am afraid," [...] Malcolm said cheerfully; [...] "but {{at least}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try.</b> If I {{must be a}} cook I will at least {{do my best to}} be a good one. Now, what have you got in these pots?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had better}} {{not think of}} my hard fate. Can I help {{thinking}} of it? Can I dismiss from memory the unmerited misfortunes which have taken from me, {{in the prime of}} her charms, the woman whom I love? At least <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have to go}} on now,--and do it as best <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> to do my best. I {{will try}} to do my best. I told him so, and now I tell you so. I will try to do my best." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{folded up}} the paper, and, not having {{read the whole}} of it, {{handed it to the}} girl. [...] "I am almost sorry you were brave enough to show me this; but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>try</b> to forget it," [...] I said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mother, {{that will}} be better, in some respects; for of course, if Father is not rescued by our army, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> {{afterwards}} as we arranged. It would be an advantage, in one way, as I should then be quite accustomed to the country, and more fit to make my way about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, no harm shall come to her; {{she must}} walk round the portage, at any rate; {{but you and}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> this Atlantic oceaner, and then all parties will become better acquainted. We shall find out whether his flint will strike fire; and he may come to know {{something}} of frontier tricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Alan, [...] "you {{need not}} fear that, for {{it would be}} wrong. I understand that you absolutely refuse to sanction my suit on the ground of my poverty, which under the circumstances is perhaps not wonderful. Well, {{the only thing to}} do is to wait for two years, a long time, but not endless, and meanwhile <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to better my position." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking in August 2014, Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray {{said that}} Gray is [...] "one {{of those who}} runs at {{defenders}} in one-versus-one situations and he’s got a great habit of putting the ball between the posts for someone to score". Stobbs himself stated that [...] "I’ve got a bit of pace and I like to take people on, I like {{to get to the}} byline, get crosses into the box and, where <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to get a few goals".|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Cuthbert," [...] said she, [...] "you {{must not}} eat that ice. Water that was frozen countless ages ago {{may be very}} {{different}} from the water of modern times, and might not agree with you. Don't touch it, please. I am going to push the bottle through if <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to think of everything that you might need and brought them all at once; because, if I could not keep the hole open, I wanted to get them to you without losing a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not the slightest, {{so far as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to hide my {{feelings}} until I could {{come to a decision}} as to what I ought to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon for saying your head is empty, Peter," [...] said he. [...] "Your heart is right, anyway. Of course, there isn't {{anything}} {{you can do to help}} Mrs. Quack, but as I told you in the beginning, what you can't do others can. Now I don't say that I can help Mrs. Quack, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try.</b> I believe I'll do a little thinking myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And between ourselves, Nello mio, that Messer Angelo {{has more}} genius and erudition than I {{can find in}} all the other Florentine {{scholars}} put together. It may answer very well for them to cry me up now, when Poliziano is beaten down with grief, or illness, or something else; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> a flight with such a sparrow-hawk as Pietro Crinito, but for Poliziano, he is a large-beaked eagle who would swallow me, feathers and all, and not feel any difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} {{to do now is}} {{to get down to the}} valley, if I can, before dark. Abner said there was an old cabin, where the hunters used to sleep, somewhere round that way. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> for it, and perhaps shoot {{something}} on the way. May break my bones, but I can't sit and starve up here, and I was a fool to come. I'll keep the feather anyway, to prove that I really saw an eagle; that's better than nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "John, I don't mean to, {{any more}} than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to keep him off all I can; but one doesn't want to be rude, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, not I--I never did; and I'm glad I'm {{grown too}} big and ugly for them. I always get as near Elliot as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> and <b>try</b> to hear if they are saying any thing about the hunt; and the ladies never trouble their heads about {{what is good for}} any thing, so they never talk to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Mrs. Keith. [...] "If Lucy goes to Sandymere, I'll go {{with them}} and hurry them off as soon as <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> Then I'll <b>try</b> to make an {{opportunity}} for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{would this}} do?" [...] he asked presently. [...] "Suppose I {{go and see}} Mother Anastasia this afternoon, and try and make her look at this matter from a {{strictly}} business point of view. I can tell her that {{the sort of thing}} you are doing is purely literature, that you can't keep such things out of literature, and that the people who engage in the mechanical work of literature cannot help running against those things at one time or another. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to make her understand what an advantageous connection this is, and what a great injury to the House of Martha it would be if it should be broken off. I can tell her that it is not improbable that you may take to writing as a regular business, and that you may give profitable employment to the sisters for years and years. There are a good many other things I might say, and you may be sure I shall do my very best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then there's another thing," [...] he resumed; [...] "can I? Am I able? Why didn't I {{practise}} different handwritings while I was young? How {{a fellow}} regrets those lost opportunities when he grows up! But there's one comfort: it's not morally wrong; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> it {{on with a}} clear conscience, and even if I was found out, I wouldn't greatly care--morally, I mean. And then, if I succeed, and if Pitman is staunch--there's {{nothing to do but}} find a venal doctor; and that ought to be simple enough in a place like London. By all accounts the town's alive with them. It wouldn't do, of course, to advertise for a corrupt physician; that would be impolitic. No, I suppose a fellow has simply to spot along the streets for a red lamp and herbs in the window, and then you go in and--and--and put it to him plainly; though it seems a delicate step." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since that time," [...] I went on, [...] "your {{father has}} {{compromised}} me. I am in some danger, not much, from the law. I have no prospects {{that are not}} of the most doubtful kind; and I have no excuse for asking you to share them, except that I have fallen into my present misfortune through trying to discover the obstacle that kept us apart. If there is any protection {{in the world that}} you can turn to, less doubtful than mine, I suppose I ought to say no more, and leave the house. But if there should be none, surely I am not so very selfish in asking you to take your chance with me? I honestly believe that I shall have little difficulty, with ordinary caution, in escaping from pursuit, and finding a safe home somewhere to begin life in again with new interests. Will you share it with me, Alicia? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> no fresh persuasions---I have no right, perhaps, in my present situation to have addressed so many to you already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} will suit me very well," [...] Philip said, [...] "and I hope that my service will suit you. Although an Englishman by birth and name, my family have {{suffered}} persecution here as yours have done, and I am as warmly affected to the Huguenot cause as yourselves. If there is danger you will not find me lacking in leading you, and so far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>try</b> to make my service a comfortable one, and to look after your welfare.|$|R
60|$|You {{now know}} an address which will always find me; you might {{let me have}} your address in London; I do not promise anything--for I am always overworked in London--but I shall, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> arrange it, <b>try</b> to see you.|$|R
6000|$|Laurie did not utter the words, but {{he thought}} them, and the next instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, [...] "No, I won't! I haven't forgotten, <b>I</b> never <b>can.</b> I'll <b>try</b> again, and if that fails, why then..." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hummed an {{air from}} Schubert, and sat a moment looking thoughtfully at the will. Then {{he said to}} himself quietly, [...] "The {{simplest}} thing to do would be merely to scrape out or take out with chemicals the name Arthur, substituting the name Walter, and vice versâ. That's a very small matter; a man who draws as well as I do ought to be able easily to imitate a copying clerk's engrossing hand. But it would be madness to attempt it now and here; I want a little practice first. At the same time, I mustn't keep the will out a moment longer than is necessary; my uncle may return by some accident before I expect him; and the true philosophy of life consists in invariably minimizing the adverse chances. This will was evidently drawn up by Watson and Blenkiron, of Chancery Lane. I'll write to-morrow and get them to draw up a will for me, leaving all I possess to Arthur. The same clerk is pretty sure to engross it, and that'll give me a model for the two names on which I can do a little preliminary practice. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> the stuff Wharton told me about, for making ink fade on the same parchment. That will be killing two birds with one stone, certainly. And now if I don't make haste I shan't have time to write my sermon." ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{we shall}} see Him as He is. Herein is a great mystery, and one which I do not pretend to fathom. Only this <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>try</b> to do--to shew how it may seem {{possible}} and reasonable, from what is called analogy, that is by judging of an unknown thing from a known thing, which is, at least, something like it. Now do we not all know how apt we are to become like those whom we see, with whom we spend our hours--and, above all, like those whom we admire and honour? For good and for evil, alas! For evil- -for those who associate with evil or frivolous persons are too apt to catch not only their low tone, but their very manner, their very expression of face, speaking, and thinking, and acting. Not only do they become scornful, if they live with scorners; false, if they live with liars; mean, if they live with covetous men; but they will actually catch the very look of their faces. The companions of affected, frivolous people, men or women, grow to look affected frivolous. Indulging in the same passions, they mould their own countenances and their very walk, also the very tones of their voice, {{as well as their}} dress, into the likeness of those with whom they associate, nay, of those whose fashions (as they are called) they know merely by books and pictures. But thank God, who has put into the hearts of Christian people the tendency towards God--just in the same way does good company tend to make men good; high- minded company to make them high-minded; kindly company to make them kindly; modest company to make them modest; honourable company to make them honourable; and pure company to make them pure. If the young man or woman live with such, look up to such as their ideal, that is, the pattern which they ought to emulate--then, as a fact, the Spirit of God working in them does mould them into something of the likeness of those whom they admire and love. I have lived long enough to see more than one man of real genius stamp his own character, thought, even his very manner of speaking, for good or for evil, on a whole school or party of his disciples. It has been said, and truly, I believe, that children cannot be brought up among beautiful pictures,--I believe, even among any beautiful sights and sounds,--without the very expression of their faces becoming more beautiful, purer, gentler, nobler; so that in them are fulfilled the words of the great and holy Poet concerning the maiden brought up according to God, and the laws of God-- ...|$|E
