40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to review the outcome of dialysis-dependent {{patients}} undergoing cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed 36 dialysis-dependent patients with a mean age of 63 ± 9. 4 years who underwent cardiac operations. Surgery included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 27 patients (75 %), valve surgery in 2 (5. 5 %), <b>combined</b> CABG plus <b>valve</b> surgery in 5 (13. 8 %), <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> surgery and MAZE procedure in 1 patient, <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> surgery, CABG and MAZE procedure in 1 patient, major aortic surgery in 1 patient, suture of injured right ventricle in 1 patient and extirpation of infected right atrial thrombus in 1 patient. In-hospital mortality rate was 11. 1 %. All the deaths occurred in patients who underwent urgent procedure. Two of the deaths occurred in patients who underwent cardiac surgery procedure on pump (ascending aorta replacement and infected thrombus removing), one death occurred in a patient who underwent suture of injured right ventricle and another one death occurred in patient who underwent the conventional myocardial revascularization. The survival was 77. 8 % at 1 year. Generally suggested predictors of increased late mortality are heart failure, urgent/emergent surgery, the complexity of the surgical procedures (<b>valve</b> surgery, <b>combined</b> CABG, <b>valve</b> and major aortic surgery) and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. In dialysis-dependent patients, CABG has an acceptable risk. Results in patients affected by valve lesions associated or not with coronary artery disease are improved by an early referral to surgery, before the onset of symptoms of heart failure...|$|R
40|$|The Pulsatile Catheter (PUCA) pump is a trans-arterial pulsatile {{ventricular}} assist {{device that}} can be used for short-term left ventricular support The separate inflow and outflow valves in the first version of the device (PUCA-I) were replaced by a single inflow/outflow valve in the latest PUCA pump version (PUCA-II). The new <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> was tested during in vitro (mock circulation) and in vivo experiments for valve leakage, flow resistance, and thrombus formation. During the in vitro experiments a maximum valve leakage of 6 % during ejection and 21 % during aspiration was found. The maximum flow resistance coefficient (K) was 4. The animal experiments demonstrated that the PUCA-II could be positioned within a few minutes into the left ventricle without X-ray guidance and without using a vascular graft. Thrombi were not found in the <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> after total pump time of 3 hours, which proved the good washout of the valve. initial experiments to position the pump in the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery were successful and contributed to the development of a new application for the device...|$|R

40|$|Determinants of early, {{late and}} event-free {{survival}} of <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and {{coronary artery bypass}} graft (CABG) surgery were studied in 420 patients using multivariate analysis. It was found that the risk of hospital death increases 5 times when the preoperative NYHA class was > or = IV, 3 times when left ventricular (LV) function is significantly impaired and is double when mitral regurgitation is present. The survival probability of hospital survivors was 91 % (87. 3 - 94. 5 %) at 5 years. Late mortality was determined by advanced preoperative NYHA class (> or = IV) and the presence of mitral regurgitation. The event-free survival probability of hospital survivors, i. e. total events including death, valve-related complications, ischemic complications and recurrent NYHA class > or = IV, was 73. 0 % (66. 7 - 79. 5 %) at 5 years. Postoperative events were determined by the presence of preoperative NYHA class > or = IV, impaired ventricular function, mitral regurgitation and non-sinus rhythm. It is concluded that these parameters can be considered as the most important predictors of clinical outcome after <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and CABG surgery. status: publishe...|$|R

Some studies conclude that off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCABG) may decrease the incidence of AF, whereas the combination of CABG with heart valve replacement may result in more frequent postoperative atrial fibrillation. The aim of our study was to compare the early postoperative AF incidence rate during ICU stay in three groups of patients: after CABG, OPCABG, and CABG <b>combined</b> with <b>valve</b> replacement. During the period from January 2009 till January 2012. Clinical profile of 650 patients were included in a prospective study, factors having potential influence on postoperative AF did not show any {{significant differences between the}} groups. The presence of arrhythmia history was the reason of excluding 42 patients from the statistical analysis. 525 cases after conventional CABG, 96 after OPCABG, and 29 after CABG <b>combined</b> with <b>valve</b> surgery were analyzed. Results: Atrial fibrillation occurred during the postoperative ICU stay in 9. 8 % of patients after CABG, in 10. 2 % after OPCABG, and in 21 % after CABG <b>combined</b> with <b>valve</b> replacement. There {{was no significant difference between}} CABG and OPCABG groups (P= 0. 965). We observed a statistically significant increase of the early postoperative atrial fibrillation incidence rate in patients after CABG <b>combined</b> with <b>valve</b> replacement, when compared with both CABG + OPCABG groups (P= 0. 005). Conclusions: (1) Atrial fibrillation is a common postoperative complication after myocardial revascularization procedures which prolong ICU stay.

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{early effect}} of {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) <b>combined</b> with mitral <b>valve</b> replacement or repair for ischemic mitral regurgitation (insufficiency). Methods　The clinical data of 46 patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation hospitalized in Cardiovascular Department of General Hospital of PLA from December 2006 to November 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 46 patients, there were 34 males and 12 females, aged 66. 8 ± 76. 4 years, and 16 of them received CABG <b>combined</b> with mitral <b>valve</b> replacement, and 30 received CABG <b>combined</b> with mitral <b>valve</b> repair. The left ventricular diameter (LVD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of each patient were determined before and after operation. Results　One patient receiving CABG <b>combined</b> with mitral <b>valve</b> replacement died of early postoperative heart failure, and the remaining 45 patients were cured. Seven days after operation, the echocardiography showed a significant reduction of LVD (from 51. 8 ± 10. 4 mm to 46. 8 ± 8. 1 mm, P< 0. 05), but {{no significant difference in}} LVEF before and after operation (53. 43 %± 11. 6 % and 54. 3 %± 10. 1 %, respectively) was found.

40|$|AbstractBackground:Gender-related {{differences}} in {{morbidity and mortality}} are well described for coronary artery bypass grafting but are not well understood for <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and bypass surgery. MethodsWe reviewed retrospectively the morbidity and mortality of 1570 consecutive patients who underwent <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and bypass procedures at the Toronto General Hospital between January 1990 and October 2000. ResultsThere were 1073 men (68 %) and 497 women (32 %). The mean ages (± 1 SD) {{of women and men}} were 69 ± 9 and 68 ± 9 years, respectively (P =. 02). Of the 1570 total patients, 973 patients (62 %) underwent aortic valve and coronary bypass surgery, 481 patients (31 %) had mitral valve and coronary bypass operations, and 116 (7 %) patients had double or triple valve and coronary bypass operations. Preoperative hypertension (P =. 002), diabetes (P =. 001), and atrial fibrillation (P =. 001) were seen more frequently in women. Body surface area was significantly lower in women (P =. 0001). At presentation, more women were in congestive heart failure (69 % vs 58 %, P =. 001) and in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (25 % vs 19 %, P =. 001). Although {{there was no difference in}} the number of women with three or more diseased vessels (32 % vs 38 %), only 35 % of women received three or more grafts compared with 44 % of men (P =. 001). The use of left internal thoracic grafts, although uncommon in the whole study population (36 %), was less common in women than in men (26 % vs 41 %, P =. 001). Multivariable logistic analyses for morbidity and mortality showed female gender to be an independent risk factor. Mitral valve replacement, age, left ventricular dysfunction, New York Heart Association classes III and IV, and association of tricuspid valve disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and preoperative renal failure were found to be independent risk factors for mortality. ConclusionFemale gender is an independent risk factor for combined morbidity and mortality during and after <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> and coronary bypass surgery. As with isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, women undergoing combined procedures have more premorbid conditions, are more often in heart failure, had an equal incidence of triple vessel disease but received fewer grafts than men, and, therefore, were more frequently incompletely revascularized...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. Factors {{determining}} {{the outcome of}} operative correction of valvular abnormalities combined with coronary artery bypass grafting are still incompletely defined. METHODS. Determinants of early and late (more than 90 days) deaths and event-free survival were studied for <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> operations and coronary artery bypass grafting in 741 patients using multivariate analysis. RESULTS. Ninety-day survival probability was 89 % (95 % confidence interval, 87 % to 92 %). Preoperative risk factors for early death were age, female sex, renal failure, New York Heart Association class IV or V, and mitral insufficiency. The operative risk factor was the duration of aortic cross-clamping. Five- and 10 -year survival probabilities were 74 % (95 % confidence interval, 71 % to 78 %) and 43 % (95 % confidence interval, 36 % to 50 %), respectively. Preoperative risk factors for late death were age, preoperative renal failure, New York Heart Association class IV or V, vessel disease, and nonsinus rhythm. Five- and 10 -year event-free survival probabilities were 57 % (95 % confidence interval, 53 % to 61 %) and 23 % (95 % confidence interval, 17 % to 28 %), respectively. Preoperative risk factors for non-event-free survival were age, female sex, reduced left ventricular function, mitral regurgitation, and pacemaker rhythm. CONCLUSION. The demographic factors of age and female sex; the comorbid condition of renal failure; the cardiac conditions of advanced New York Heart Association class, left ventricular function, mitral regurgitation, vessel disease, and cardiac rhythm; and the operative condition of ischemia time {{are the most important}} predictors of clinical outcome after <b>combined</b> <b>valve</b> operations and coronary artery bypass grafting. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of pexelizumab, a C 5 complement inhibitor, on death and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing <b>combined</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. METHODS: The Pexelizumab for Reduction in Myocardial Infarction and Mortality in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery trial, a phase III prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolled 3099 patients at 205 centers. The primary end point was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or both at postoperative day 30 in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting without valve surgery. Postoperative myocardial infarction {{was defined as a}} creatine kinase MB fraction value of 100 ng/mL or greater, Q-wave myocardial infarction with a creatine kinase MB fraction value of 70 ng/mL or greater, or new Q-wave evidence of myocardial infarction by postoperative day 30. Because patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with a valve procedure {{were not included in the}} primary population, separate analysis of death and myocardial infarction was conducted in 218 patients undergoing <b>combined</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. RESULTS: Of the 353 patients randomized to any valve procedure, 106 (61 %) underwent <b>combined</b> aortic <b>valve</b> replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting in the pexelizumab treatment group compared with 112 (63 %) patients in the placebo group. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed with 1 or more internal thoracic artery grafts in 139 (64 %) patients and with 1 or more saphenous vein grafts in 179 (82 %) patients. There were 4 (3. 8 %) deaths in the pexelizumab group versus 11 (9. 9 %) in the placebo group by postoperative day 30 and 6 (5. 7 %) deaths in the active group versus 16 (14. 4 %) in the placebo group by postoperative day 180 (P =. 107 and P =. 043, respectively, Fisher exact test). The incidence of myocardial infarction 30 days after surgical intervention was identical in the 2 groups, but the study was not designed to detect differences in this cohort of patients.
