5|$|There was {{danger of}} {{invasion}} {{from the more}} powerful French forces, so Adams and the Federalist congress built up the army, bringing back Washington as its commander. Washington wanted Hamilton to be his second-in-command and Adams reluctantly accommodated. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington's advanced years.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.|$|E
5|$|With {{the twin}} {{victories}} of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, {{the threat of}} a future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> {{even small}} towns {{can afford to}} put up public {{striking}} clocks. Turret clocks are now common throughout Europe.|$|R

5|$|After the war, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> most holiday {{camps in}} Britain had {{been damaged by}} troop occupation, and the {{situation}} {{was so bad that}} questions were raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that,</b> {{not only}} were {{conditions}} in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E
5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Brezhnev {{was the leader of}} the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny's position within the collective leadership strengthened.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the {{facilities}} at Hampden were {{in need of}} renewal. As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> {{the light}} {{pollution}} from Cleveland {{was beginning to}} make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 {{miles to the east}} in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> four lanes at {{the western}} end was not enough. Several safety {{improvement}} areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers Road), to a new two-lane road {{to the south of}} it that crossed the Roaring Fork to the east of the town.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which {{increases the risk of}} heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
5|$|Moberly, born in 1846, was {{the tenth}} of fifteen children. She {{came from a}} {{professional}} background; her father, George Moberly, was the headmaster of Winchester College and later Bishop of Salisbury.

5|$|On {{behalf of}} the Allies, Austria agreed to send a force to the Kingdom of Naples to depose Murat in February 1815, when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> Murat corresponded with Napoleon I, which was {{explicitly}} forbidden by a recent treaty. Murat never actually wrote to Napoleon, but Louis, intent on restoring the Neapolitan Bourbons at any cost, forged the correspondence, and subsidised the Austrian expedition with 25million francs.|$|E
50|$|The Collection {{is caught}} up in the war between the Draconians and the Mim. As Bev tries to ensure they stay neutral, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the Draconian Ambassador may have other motives for seeing her...|$|R
50|$|During Alaizabel's slow {{recovery}} <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> she has {{no memory}} of her past life apart from her name. Unbeknownst {{to any of them}} The Wych-kin Fraternity is watching them and waiting for their chance to recapture what is theirs.|$|R
50|$|As such, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> {{companies}} who focuses {{on this particular}} model and, specifically classifieds, whether online or off, are often not focused on profit; but rather, on delivery of the service or product to ensure customer to customer interaction.|$|R
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
5|$|About {{two hours}} later, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> the badly coordinated {{uprising}} had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers {{refused to participate}} in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E
50|$|As {{its title}} suggests, the film {{depends on the}} {{presence}} of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess.
