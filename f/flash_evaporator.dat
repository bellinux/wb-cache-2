40|$|This paper {{describes}} a flexible visualized computer package developed for design and simulation {{of different types}} and configurations of thermal desalination processes. In this package, object oriented programming with Visual Basic (VB) is used to offer a friendly user-interface. The interface aids plants designer engineers to perform different calculations such as energy, exergy, and thermoeconomic. In addition, the package enables the designers to perform different modifications in existing plant or design new desalination configuration. The desalination plant components (units), such as heat exchangers, <b>flash</b> chambers, <b>evaporators,</b> pumps, pipes, etc. are stored as icons in a visual library. This visual library enables the user to construct different configurations by just clicking the mouse over the required units (icons). Each icon is linked with its representative mathematical model. The process mathematical model equations are represented in a sparse matrix form {{in order to minimize}} both memory storage and calculation time. The equations of each unit are grouped according to their variables type and each unit is mathematically represented by four matrices (mass, temperature, pressure and cost matrix). Robust subroutine code is developed to assemble the process mathematical model in four large matrices. The validity and reliability of the developed package is examined for different process and configurations under different operating conditions. The (5000 m 3 /day) MSF desalination plant (Euon Mousa, Egypt) is presented as a case study...|$|R
50|$|During {{the climb}} to orbit, Mission Control asked {{the crew to}} reconfigure a cooling system that {{apparently}} had ice build up. The reconfiguration cleared the system, called the <b>Flash</b> <b>Evaporator</b> System, and it operated normally. Temporary ice in that cooling unit is not uncommon and has occurred on previous missions.|$|E
50|$|Troubleshooting {{of one of}} the <b>Flash</b> <b>Evaporator</b> Subsystem (FES) (FES PRI B) {{was carried}} out. FES A was to be used during reentry but it was {{desirable}} to have both functional. This was in addition to the usual extensive checkout of all systems required for reentry ensuring they were functional.|$|E
5000|$|Two minor {{problems}} {{occurred during}} the flight. After ascent, the <b>Flash</b> <b>Evaporator</b> System for cooling the orbiter iced up and shut down, increasing the crew cabin temperature to approximately [...] The problem was resolved on Flight Day 4 and cooler temperatures resulted.

30|$|All {{reagents}} {{were obtained}} from commercial sources (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Solvents {{were obtained from}} Biosolve (Valkenswaard, the Netherlands) and used as received unless stated otherwise. Dichloromethane (DCM) and DMF were dried over activated 3  Å molecular sieves. THF was first distilled from LiAlH 4 and then stored on activated 3  Å molecular sieves. Reaction monitoring by thin-layer chromatography was performed on pre-coated silica 60 [*]F 254 aluminium plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Spots were visualised by UV light or ninhydrin. Evaporation of solvents was performed under reduced pressure at 40  °C using a rotary <b>evaporator.</b> <b>Flash</b> column chromatography was performed manually on Silica gel 60  Å (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker (Billerica, MA, USA) Avance 250 (250.13  MHz for 1 H and 62.90  MHz for 13 C) or an Avance 500 (500.23  MHz for 1 H and 125.78  MHz for 13 C) with chemical shifts (δ) reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the solvent (chloroform (CDCl 3), 1 H 7.26 [*]ppm, 13 C 77.16 [*]ppm).

40|$|Freeze {{pre-concentration}} system, FPCS, {{with low}} lift reversible heat pump {{is designed for}} selective freezing of water from sugarcane juice. Â Two identical vented double wall tube-and-tube heat exchangers are used, to freeze water in the evaporator and melt ice in the condenser, alternately. Â They are sized based on cooling capacity offered by compressor, ice growth rate and velocity of juice inside the tube to reduce inclusion. Â Low lift heat pump is designed to operate at - 8 oC evaporator and 3 oC condenser saturation temperatures. Â Since, the condenser duty is higher than evaporator duty excess heat duty, {{in the form of}} superheat is utilized to heat pre-concentrated juice. Â Raw juice is precooled in a three stream Tube-and-Tube Heat Exchanger, TT_HE. Â Raw juice is precooled using cool concentrated juice and separated water. Â Freeze pre-concentration of sugarcane juice from 20 Â°Brix to 40 Â°Brix using a low lift reversible heat pump saves bagasse during initial 63 % water removal. Â Water is removed through the freezing process requires 335 kJ/kg heat removal, which is equivalent to 15 % of heat addition during evaporation at atmospheric pressure in open pan in jaggery making. Â Investigations on selection of refrigerant R 744, R 290 and R 22 for FPCS are presented. Â R 290 is identified as preferred refrigerant. Â It is natural refrigerant, no ODP and significantly lower operating pressures compared to R 744. Â R 290 charge of 360 g for 1. 5 TR compressor based system is managed by using small diameter refrigerant side tubes. Â It address safety related issues for modular small capacity systems. Â Superheat temperature of compressed refrigerant is 9 oC for R 290. Â It allows to size the identical LHEs with R 290 as a refrigerant. Â Flashing of refrigerant in evaporator is 7 % for R 290 and 10 % R 744. Â Generally, R 744 is preferred when high temperature heating is required. Â But, high superheat at compressor outlet and increased <b>flashing</b> at <b>evaporator</b> inlet reduces the performance of R 744 system making it less preferred as compared to R 290 and R 22. Â Theoretical cycle COPc calculated for R 290 based reversible heat pump works out to be 20, with compressor isentropic efficiency of 70 %. Â Overall system COPc is in the range of 10 to 13 after accounting for losses like cycling of thermal mass, heat gain from ambient, variation in freezing point depression and ice layer thickness. Â System Carnot efficiency is in the range of 41 to 54 %. Â Power required for 1. 5 TR FPCS is 0. 4 to 0. 6 kWe. Â Different juice side tube diameters are considered to find the optimal size, after accounting for effect of thermal mass of heat exchanger, heat pump switching time and inclusion on the energy consumption per unit water separated. Â Achievable energy consumption is in the range of 9 to 12 kWhe/m 3 of water separated...|$|R

Future NASA vehicles, such as the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), will require non-radiative heat rejection systems during at least {{a portion of the}} planned mission, just as their predecessors have. While existing technologies are available to modify, such as Apollo era sublimators, or the Space Shuttle <b>Flash</b> <b>Evaporator</b> System (FES), several new technologies are under development or investigation to progress beyond these existing heat rejection systems. Examples include the Multi-Fluid Evaporator developed by Hamilton Sundstrand, improvements upon the Contaminant Insensitive Sublimator originally developed for the X- 38 program, and a Compact <b>Flash</b> <b>Evaporator</b> System (CFES). Other possibilities evaluate new ways of operating existing designs. The new developments are targeted at increasing operating life, expanding the environments in which the system can operate, improving the mass and volume characteristics, or some combination of these or other improvements. This paper captures the process and results of a preliminary trade study performed at Johnson Space Center to compare the various existing and proposed phase change based heat rejection systems for the CEV. Because the new systems are still in development, and the information on existing systems is extrapolation, this trade study is not meant to suggest a final decision for future vehicles. The results of this early trade study are targeted to aid the development efforts for the new technologies by identifying issues that could reduce the chances of selection for the CEV...|$|E
