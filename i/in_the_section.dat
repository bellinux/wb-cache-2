5|$|The fungus is {{classified}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél., {{as defined by}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. This section is {{the largest in the}} genus Mycena.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic emphasis is placed on the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would be more appropriate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E

5|$|According to Alexander H. Smith's {{organization}} of the genus Mycena, M.aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes, subsection Granulatae, which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges), such as M.rosella, M.flavescens, M.elegans, and M.strobilinoides. In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M.aurantiomarginata <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M.aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Calodontes. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, the fungus {{is closely related to}} M.crocata and M.leaiana. This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of the orchid Gastrodia confusa.|$|E
5|$|According to Takahashi, the amyloid spores, the cheilocystidia {{covered with}} one or more, knob-like, apical excrescences, the diverticulate {{elements}} in the cortical layer of cap and stem, and the diverticulate caulocystidia suggest that the species is best classified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Fragilipedes, {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
5|$|According to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and {{the dark}} pigment in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best {{classified}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Hiemales of the genus Mycena. Because of its medium-sized, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white spore prints and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus Collybia), the white cord-like rhizomorphs, and its distinctly intervenose gills, it has an isolated position within the section.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|Amanita exitialis is {{classified}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> Phalloideae {{of the genus}} Amanita. Species of this section share the following characteristics: spores that are not strongly elongated, and never with a cylindrical shape; flesh not reddening upon bruising; lamellulae (short gills that do not reach {{the edge of the}} cap) abruptly cut off; a well-formed pouch- or sac-like membranous volva. All species of Phalloideae are ectomycorrhizal and contain amatoxins.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> on balance, one effect {{of turning the}} front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession.
