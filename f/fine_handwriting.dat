25|$|William Harry Russell Andrews {{was born}} in Swindon the son of William and Betty Andrews. Betty's maiden name was Russell hence his third name. He had a younger brother Jack Andrews who played 7 matches as a wicket-keeper for Hampshire between 1937 and 1947, and also a sister known as Betty {{who was also a}} cricketer, being captain of a cricket team in Southern Rhodesia. In Swindon his father was a publican but the family moved to Weston-super-Mare in 1921 where Andrews saw the visiting Australians, sold {{scorecards}} and worked the scoreboard. Andrews left school at the age of fourteen and worked as an office boy in a solicitor's office where his <b>fine</b> <b>handwriting</b> was perhaps his greatest asset. There was tragedy for the family in 1925 when his mother died in childbirth. He played his cricket for the Weston club and learned more about cricket when Arthur Wellard lodged with the Andrews family, having moved to the county in 1927.|$|E

60|$|Three {{days had}} gone by and Christopher and Cicely were walking in the {{shrubbery}} of Shefton Hall. By now, although still weak, he was almost recovered, whose only sickness had been grief and famine, for which joy and plenty are wonderful medicines. It was evening, a pleasant and beautiful early winter evening just fading into night. Seated on a bench he had been telling her his adventures, and they were a moving tale worthy, as Cicely wrote afterwards {{in a letter to}} old Jacob Smith that is still extant in her <b>fine,</b> quaint <b>handwriting,</b> to be recorded in a book, though this it would seem was never done.|$|R

Several mates, envying his <b>fine</b> <b>handwriting</b> and pitying his hard luck, took lessons in penmanship of him and paid him fairly, whereat he rejoiced over the hours spent at home, flat on the kitchen floor, or flourishing splendid capitals on the snow-banks, when his nose was blue with cold and his hands half-frozen.|$|E
60|$|Fischer {{took his}} leave and reached his hotel {{a little before}} midnight. Already {{he had begun to}} look over his {{shoulder}} in the street. He found his rooms empty with a sense of relief, marred by one little disappointment. Nikasti was to have been there to bid him farewell-- Nikasti {{on his way back to}} Japan. He ascertained from the office of the hotel that there had been no telephone message or caller. Then he turned to his correspondence, some presentiment already clutching at his strained nerves. There was a letter in a large envelope, near the bottom of the pile, addressed to him in Nikasti's <b>fine</b> <b>handwriting.</b> He tore open the envelope, and slow horror seized him as he realised its contents. A long photograph unrolled itself before his eyes. The first few words brought confusion and horror to his sense. His brain reeled. This was defeat, indeed! It was a photograph of that other autograph letter. The one which he had given to Nikasti to carry to Japan lay-- gross sacrilege!--about him in small pieces. There was no other line, no message, nothing but this damning proof of his duplicity.|$|E

He had not seen her again, but every quarter he had signed her cheque, forwarding it to her bank, with a note to the Chelsea flat {{to say that he}} had done so; and always he had received a note in acknowledgment, generally from the flat, but sometimes from Italy; so that her personality had become embodied in slightly scented grey paper, an upright <b>fine</b> <b>handwriting,</b> and the words, 'Dear Cousin Jolyon.' Man of property that he now was, the slender cheque he signed often gave rise to the thought: 'Well, I suppose she just manages'; sliding into a vague wonder how she was faring otherwise in a world of men not wont to let beauty go unpossessed. At first Holly had spoken of her sometimes, but 'ladies in grey' soon fade from children's memories; and the tightening of June's lips in those first weeks after her grandfather's death whenever her former friend's name was mentioned, had discouraged allusion. Only once, indeed, had June spoken definitely: [...] "I've forgiven her. I'm frightfully glad she's independent now...." ...|$|E

After the deaths of Dmitry Filosofov and her sister Anna (in 1940 and 1942 respectively) she found herself {{alone in the world}} and, as some sources suggest, {{contemplated}} suicide. With her secretary Vladimir Zlobin still around, though, Gippius resorted to writing what she hoped would some day gel into the comprehensive life story of her late husband. As Teffi remembered, [...] Gippius spent the last months of her life working, mostly at nights. Filling one journal after another with that <b>fine</b> calligraphic <b>handwriting</b> of hers, she was preparing a major book that was to become, as she saw it, a proper tribute to her lifetime companion, the one she referred to as 'the Great Man'. She praised this man in terms which were most unusual for her - a woman of icy sharp intellect whose view on people around her was so utterly ironic. She must have loved him very, very strongly.|$|R

60|$|The {{interview}} occurred {{without any}} disagreeable results. The next day, Ferdinand {{saw his father}} for a few minutes. In a short time, Lady Armine was established as nurse to her son; Sir Ratcliffe, easy in mind, amused himself with his sports; and Glastonbury devoted himself to Miss Grandison. The intimacy, indeed, between the tutor of Ferdinand and his intended bride became daily more complete, and Glastonbury was almost her inseparable companion. She found him a very interesting one. He was the most agreeable guide amid all the haunts of Armine and its neighbourhood, and drove her delightfully in Lady Armine's pony phaeton. He could share, too, all her pursuits, and open to her many new ones. Though time had stolen something of its force from the voice of Adrian Glastonbury, it still was wondrous sweet; his musical accomplishments were complete; and he could guide the pencil or prepare the herbal, and indite fair stanzas in his <b>fine</b> Italian <b>handwriting</b> in a lady's album. All his collections, too, were at Miss Grandison's service. She handled with rising curiosity his medals, copied his choice drawings, and even began to study heraldry. His interesting conversation, his mild and benignant manners, his captivating simplicity, and the elegant purity of his mind, secured her confidence and won her heart. She loved him as a father, and he soon exercised over her an influence almost irresistible.|$|R

40|$|Background. Parkinson disease (PD) is {{characterized}} by hypometric movements resulting from loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PD leads to decreased activation of the supplementary motor area (SMA); the net result of these changes is a poverty of movement. The present study determined the impact of 5 [*]Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the SMA on a <b>fine</b> motor movement, <b>handwriting</b> (writing cursive “l”s), and on cortical excitability, in individuals with PD. Methods. In a cross-over design, ten individuals with PD were randomized to receive either 5 [*]Hz or control stimulation over the SMA. Immediately following brain stimulation right handed writing was assessed. Results. 5 [*]Hz stimulation increased vertical size of handwriting and diminished axial pressure. In addition, 5 [*]Hz rTMS significantly decreased the threshold for excitability in the primary motor cortex. Conclusions. These data suggest that {{in the short term}} 5 [*]Hz rTMS benefits functional fine motor task performance, perhaps by altering cortical excitability across a network of brain regions. Further, these data may provide the foundation for a larger investigation of the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation over the SMA in individuals with PD...|$|R
2500|$|An {{exquisite}} literary perfectionist, {{akin to the}} 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé, Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages [...] "covered with <b>fine</b> {{lines of}} <b>handwriting,</b> much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut for a page...". He worked [...] "long hours with great concentration". According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes. [...] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style [...] "Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts {{by as much as}} two-thirds". The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt [...] "free" [...] and able to concentrate, [...] "writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy", until he instantaneously dozed off. He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. [...] Saint-Exupéry stated {{it was the only way}} he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.|$|R

40|$|For {{his friends}} and for himself, Winckelmann likes to divide his life in two quite {{distinct}} periods: the German one at first, which unfolds in dark libraries, and then the Italian one, lived {{in the light of}} Rome’s art collections. In this construct, the Italian phase stands in contrast to the German one as sensible knowledge does to bookish learning. This dichotomy, which was stylized by Winckelmann himself, then picked up again by his biographers and interpreters, is doubly beneficial for him. It allows him first, in the order of autobiography, to set himself up as the hero of a dynamic tale marked by a strong existential split. In moving from Germany to Rome, Winckelmann could be seen to have lifted himself from the dead universe of books to the tangible reality of stone statues. But it allows him too to position himself as the founder of a new field of study: art history. With his Geschichte der Kunst des Altherthums (1764), written in Rome, the historical discourse about art, which — according to Winckelmann — up to then has rested on ancient texts, begins to rely on the sensible observation of works of art. An attentive reader, however, shouldn’t be content with such a construct. The use of books plays a much more complex role in Winckelmann’s life than what the Roman Winckelmann cares to admit. What, then, is the role of reading in Winckelmann’s work? What {{is the role of the}} book in the German and Italian phase of its development? An unusually rich archival collection is available to answer these questions: his notebooks of excerpts. Starting in his student years, Winckelmann developed the habit of recording entire text passages he read and thus constituting a portable handwritten library, which never left him. The result of this meticulous compilation work appears on approximately 7500 pages covered with <b>fine,</b> narrow <b>handwriting,</b> mostly preserved at the manuscript department of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, in Paris. This tremendous collection raises many questions, on which the present book focuses :I. How did Winckelmann’s reading activity develop?II. How does this reading activity fit within the wider context of the scholarly tradition?III. What was its effect on the written composition of Winckelmann’s work, which is to say, its style, its structure and its theoretical content...|$|R
40|$|A {{sample of}} 125 {{children}} from grades 4 and 5 of two normal Dutch primary schools were investigated regarding {{the incidence of}} handwriting problems and other <b>fine</b> motor disabilities. <b>Handwriting</b> quality was assessed with the concise assessment method for children's handwriting (BHK) and the school questionnaire for teachers (SQT). Two groups of 12 children each were formed, one group of good writers {{and a group of}} poor writers selected from the lower performance range. The latter group was investigated in depth by assessing general and fine motor ability using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC test) and the Motor Performance School Readiness Test (MSRT). We hypothesised that poor handwriting is part of a wider neuromotor condition characterised by faster and cruder movements, lack of inhibition of co-movements and poor co-ordination of fine motor skills. To test the theory kinematic measures of drawing movements were collected on the flower-trail-drawing item of the M-ABC test. Moreover, the experimental group of poor writers received physiotherapy during a three-month period and was tested for handwriting proficiency after therapy and again nine months later. The results revealed that 34 % of the group of 125 children displayed handwriting problems. The analysis confirmed that serious handwriting problems are accompanied by fine motor deficits. We suggest that in these children an enhanced level of neuromotor noise is compensated for by enhanced phasic stiffness of the limb system. This results in higher movement velocity and fewer velocity peaks. In the children who received physiotherapy the quality of handwriting improved. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Developmental Coordination Disorder is a {{diagnostic}} term for describing an impairment in motor skills. Poor sensory integration {{is believed to}} be a cause of this significant impairment which can affect handwriting skills. A literature search was conducted using online databases and manual methods relating to Developmental Coordination Disorder and interventions used by Occupational Therapists to address motor deficiencies. A review of the literature indicated that fine motor skills and handwriting difficulties were the most frequent reasons for referral of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder to Occupational Therapists. The literature review identified that Occupational Therapists are continuously challenged in determining the most efficacious interventions to help children with Developmental Coordination Disorder. The review highlighted the use of sensory integration as a bottom-up approach. This particular approach focuses on enhancing motor skills by improving sensory integration. Limited information was available on the views of Occupational Therapists regarding the specific benefits of sensory integration relating to <b>handwriting,</b> <b>fine</b> motor difficulties and the resulting impact on academic achievement.
