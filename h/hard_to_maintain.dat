5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would find it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, {{it was hard for}} the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E
5|$|Turner and Meyszner clashed {{continually}} throughout 1942, as Meyszner {{sought to}} remove all police matters from Turner's remit, including {{the supervision of the}} security forces of the Serbian collaborationist regime. In response, Turner fought <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> control over these areas. Meyszner believed the only way to maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods; Turner wanted to empower the Nedić regime and then replace the military administration with a civil one, akin to the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, with himself as Reichskommissar (governor). Meyszner attempted to have Turner's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader's staff but Wolff intervened to prevent this. However, Turner's approach was also seriously out-of-step with the Wehrmacht, which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, it would be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, {{in the last year of}} his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E

25|$|Remington's Self-Portrait on a Horse (1890) {{shows the}} artist as he wished he was, not the pot-bellied Easterner {{weighing}} heavily on a horse, but a tough, lean cowboy heading for adventure with his trusty steed. It was the image his publishers worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|Bringing new {{business}} to communities such as Conneautville, which shipped timber and hay to Pittsburgh, the Beaver and Erie Canal was heavily used {{in its early}} years but was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain.</b> Competition from railroads and the collapse of an aqueduct over Elk Creek in Erie County led to the canal's abandonment in 1872.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} Season {{went into}} decline after the First World War, when many aristocratic families {{gave up their}} London mansions.

25|$|Seven Or More Players: Beyond six players, {{the game}} becomes either very complex, or <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> with {{multiple}} decks. An additional {{side effect of}} an increased number of players is a short game, {{as the number of}} cards held by each player is reduced and high trump is more and more likely to take the trick. Seven players should normally be split into groups of four and three, eight players into two groups of four players, nine players into either groups of four and five players, or three groups of three players.|$|E
25|$|Danish {{public opinion}} {{generally}} backed the new government, particularly {{after the fall}} of France in June 1940. There was a general feeling that the unpleasant reality of German occupation must be confronted in the most realistic way possible, given the international situation. Politicians realized {{that they would have to}} try <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> Denmark's privileged position by presenting a united front to the German authorities, so all of the mainstream democratic parties formed a new government together. Parliament and the government agreed to work closely together. Though the effect of this was close to the creation of a one-party state, it remained a representative government.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{railroad}} tie {{used on the}} predecessors of the first true railway (Liverpool and Manchester Railway) consisted {{of a pair of}} stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses to tread the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found that it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the correct gauge. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on soft ground, such as at Chat Moss, where timber ties had to be used. Bi-block ties with a tie rod are somewhat similar.|$|E
25|$|Optimization {{can reduce}} {{readability}} and add code {{that is used}} only to improve the performance. This may complicate programs or systems, making them <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> and debug. As a result, optimization or performance tuning is often performed {{at the end of}} the development stage.|$|R
50|$|Since the Islanders {{moved to}} Barclays Center, {{there have been}} {{numerous}} complaints {{about the quality of the}} ice during hockey games.

5000|$|A {{developer}} using a bottom-up model writes implementing classes first (in some programming language), {{and then}} uses a WSDL generating tool to expose methods from these classes as a web service.

25|$|Many Flemings {{are also}} able to speak French, {{children}} in Flanders generally get their first French lessons in the 5th primary year (normally around 10 years). But the current lack of French outside the educational context makes it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a decent level of French. As such, the proficiency of French is declining. Flemish pupils are also obligated to follow English lessons as their third language. Normally from the second secondary year (around 14 years old), but the ubiquity of English in movies, music, IT and even advertisements {{makes it easier to}} learn and maintain the English language. This makes the Flemish people very proficient in English (in Europe, only Sweden and Malta have a better knowledge of English as a second language).|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, a {{difference}} between hardware and software did not exist. The user and programmer of a computer were one and the same. When the first commercial electronic computer was introduced by IBM in 1952, the machine was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> and expensive. Putting {{the price of the}} machine aside, it was the software that caused the problem when owning one of these computers. Then in 1952, a collaboration of all the owners of the computer got together and created a set of tools. The collaboration of people were in a group called PACT (The Project for the Advancement of Coding techniques). After passing this hurdle, in 1956, the Eisenhower administration decided to put restrictions on the types of sales AT could make. This did not stop the inventors from developing new ideas of how to bring the computer to the mass population. The next step was making the computer more affordable which slowly developed through different companies. Then they had to develop software that would host multiple users. MIT computation center developed one of the first systems, CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System). This laid the foundation for many more systems, and what we now call the Open Source Movement.|$|E
500|$|Miller was {{survived by}} his wife, son, daughter, and grandson. Miller married on August 14, 1982. He was quiet and gentle, and was [...] "a modest man, with a self-deprecating sense of humour". Miller {{described}} his own attitude towards music in a 2005 interview: I worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a certain mental and emotional equilibrium. It's mostly due to my faith in the Creator. I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That allows me {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for money. I play music because I love it.|$|E
25|$|It hurt. It hurt because we'd gone to New Zealand full of hope. We were a {{promising}} and emerging young side, we'd worked damned hard and we'd played good cricket {{most of the}} time.

50|$|Snowkiting is {{very similar}} to windsurfing in technique. It is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> balance than with basic snowboarding, since the hands and arms have to control the kite and thus are not {{completely}} available for balance. However, the balance issue can be somewhat offset by the up-and-forward force generated by the kite.|$|R
25|$|Compared with {{protest and}} noncooperation, nonviolent {{intervention}} {{is a more}} direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective {{than the other two}} methods, but is also <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> and more taxing to the participants involved.|$|R
500|$|Aurora's {{circumstances}} {{changed little}} {{during the following}} months. Stenhouse worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> morale, keeping the crew working whenever possible and organising leisure activities, including games of football and cricket on the ice. On 21 November Aurora crossed the Antarctic Circle, {{and it was at}} last evident that the ice around the ship was beginning to melt: [...] "...one good hefty blizzard would cause a general break up", wrote Stenhouse. Christmas approached with the ice still holding firm; Stenhouse allowed the crew to prepare a feast, but noted in his journal: [...] "I wish to God the blasted festivities were over [...] we are hogging in to the best while the poor beggars at Cape Evans have little or nothing!" [...] A few days later the New Year was celebrated with an improvised band leading choruses of [...] "Rule, Britannia" [...] and [...] "God Save the King." ...|$|E
500|$|Tyler {{retired to}} a Virginia plantation, {{originally}} named Walnut Grove (or [...] "the Grove"), {{located on the}} James River in Charles City County. He renamed it Sherwood Forest, in {{a reference to the}} folk legend Robin Hood, to signify that he had been [...] "outlawed" [...] by the Whig Party. He did not take farming lightly and worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> large yields. His neighbors, largely Whigs, appointed him to the minor office of overseer of roads in 1847 in an effort to mock him. To their displeasure he treated the job seriously, frequently summoning his neighbors to provide their slaves for road work, and continuing to insist on carrying out his duties even after his neighbors asked him to stop. He withdrew from politics, rarely receiving visits from his friends. He was asked to give an occasional public speech, but was not sought out as an adviser. One notable speech was at the unveiling of a monument to Henry Clay; acknowledging the political battles between the two, he spoke highly of his former colleague, whom he had always admired for bringing about the Compromise Tariff of 1833. The former president's time was spent with the doings of the Virginia aristocracy, including parties, visiting or being visited by prominent families, and summers at the family seaside home, [...] "Villa Margaret".|$|E
500|$|Goebbels became {{preoccupied with}} morale {{and the efforts}} {{of the people on the}} home front. He {{believed}} that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be. For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front. At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more [...] "entertaining material" [...] in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment. As Gauleiter of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse. Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim. The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and skeptical that it could be won. On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defenses and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings. In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local Gauleiters, and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.|$|E

50|$|Downhill {{skiing is}} the central focus with over 40 acre of terrain with a 680 ft {{vertical}} drop. Snowboarding is also allowed on both the Big Hill and the Bunny Hill.
