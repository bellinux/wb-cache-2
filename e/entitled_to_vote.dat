5|$|All {{registered}} electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) {{living in}} London aged 18 or over on 5 May 2016 were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the mayoral election. Those who were temporarily away from London (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the mayoral election. The deadline to {{register to vote}} in the election was midnight on 19 April 2016. However, the Electoral Commission warned that thousands of transient renters were not eligible to vote.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} {{elections}} in the UK, Irish and qualifying Commonwealth citizens are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> Unlike elections to the Westminster parliament, citizens of other non-Commonwealth EU member states who are resident in Scotland are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in elections to the Scottish Parliament. Overseas electors on Scottish electoral registers {{are not allowed to}} vote in Scottish Parliament elections. From the 2016 election, the franchise for Scottish Parliament elections was expanded to include 16 and 17-year olds.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} pre-Reform {{electorate}} {{is difficult}} to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English subjects were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%.|$|E
50|$|People {{can choose}} from two statuses; to either become a member or to be a {{registered}} supporter. Both of the statuses <b>entitle</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the primary elections and both can appear and be nominated on the ballot paper. However, only members can elect {{the leadership of the}} party.|$|R

25|$|In 1965, it {{was renamed}} as the International Cricket Conference and new rules adopted {{to permit the}} {{election}} of countries from outside the Commonwealth. This led {{to the expansion of}} the Conference, with the admission of Associate Members. Associates were each <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> one <b>vote,</b> while the Foundation and Full Members were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> two <b>votes</b> on ICC resolutions. Foundation Members retained a right of veto.|$|R
5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> This posed another dilemma for politicians since {{they could be}} seen to be withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males {{as long as they were}} over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E
5|$|The Parliamentary Elections Act and Presidential Elections Act {{regulate}} {{the exercise of}} the vote and set out the procedures for parliamentary and presidential elections in Singapore. These are ordinary statutes which can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. All Singapore citizens not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors (1 January of a particular year), and ordinarily resident in the country, are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in both parliamentary and presidential elections. A one person, one vote system is currently in operation, though in 1994 Senior Minister and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew suggested that people aged between 35 and 60 who were married with children should be given two votes each due to their greater responsibilities and contributions to society. Overseas voting was introduced in 2001, and first carried out during the 2006 general election.|$|E
5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} â€” such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, between black and white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, all adult males, were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E
50|$|Local {{boards and}} local {{government}} districts were finally abolished by the Local Government Act 1894, when all urban sanitary districts became urban districts. A new urban district council was to govern the district. The new council was to be directly elected by all those <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>voted</b> in parliamentary elections, replacing the weighted property voting system used for local boards.|$|R

5|$|Statutes {{passed in}} 1430 and 1432, {{during the reign}} of Henry VI, {{standardised}} property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of people}} were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times; there was usually no need to live in a constituency in order to vote there.|$|E
25|$|All locally {{registered}} electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) {{who were}} aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> {{in the local}} elections.

50|$|As each caucus voter was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> six <b>votes</b> for all delegates {{at large}} (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> {{separately}} for each delegate), {{it is not}} known just how many individual voters cast their ballots for which candidate's pledges; the popular vote totals only reflect the amount of raw votes each delegate received in the final tally.|$|R
50|$|Note: Throughout the {{relevant}} period the Onchan constituency elected three MHKs and each elector was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> three <b>votes.</b> Thus for example achieving 28.1% {{of the vote}} might mean that anything up to 84.3% of the electors may have voted for him.|$|R

It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) {{at the discretion of}} the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{cities of}} ancient Lycia were Xanthos, Patara, Myra, Pinara, Tlos and Olympos (each <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> three <b>votes</b> in the Lycian League) and Phaselis.

50|$|The Letters Patent {{created a}} {{legislative}} assembly with 30 members, and for simplicity the 15 electoral districts set {{the previous year}} for the Legislative Council {{were used for the}} new assembly, but with each district returning two members.
