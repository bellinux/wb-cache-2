40|$|A new {{multiplexing}} {{schedule is}} derived for multiplexing holograms in photorefractive polymers {{which do not}} exhibit mono-exponential recording behavior. An M-number (M/#) of 0. 3 was measured experimentally by recording 20 holograms of roughly equal strength in a single location of 125 -lm-thick material using peristrophic multiplexing.

40|$|A brief {{pulse of}} blue light induces the common soil fungus Trichoderma harzianum to sporulate. Photoresponse mutants with higher light {{requirements}} than the wild type are available, including one class, dim Y, with modified absorption spectra. We found blue-light-induced absorbance {{changes in the}} blue region of the spectrum, in wild-type and dim Y mutant strains. The light-minus-dark difference spectra of the wild type and of several other strains indicate photoreduction of flavins and cytochromes, as reported for other fungi and plants. The difference spectra in strains with normal photoinduced sporulation have a prominent peak at 440 nm. After actinic irradiation, this 440 nanometer difference peak decays rapidly in the dark. In two dim Y photoresponse mutants, the difference spectra were modified; in one of these, LS 44, the 440 nanometer peak was undetectable in difference spectra. Detailed study of the <b>dark-decay</b> kinetics in LS 44 and the corresponding control indicated that the 440 nanometer difference peak escaped detection in LS 44 because it decays faster than in the control. The action spectrum of the 440 nm difference peak {{is quite different from}} that of photoinduced sporulation. The light-induced absorbance changes are thus unlikely to be identical to the primary photochemical reaction triggering sporulation. Nevertheless, these results constitute genetic evidence that physiologically relevant pigments participate in these light-induced absorbance changes in Trichoderma...|$|E
