The presented method is based on finding the stability regions according to the fractional orders of the <b>derivative</b> <b>element</b> {{in the range of}} (0, 2). These regions are computed by using three stability boundaries: Real Root Boundary (RRB), Complex Root Boundary (CRB) and Infinite Root Boundary (IRB). The method gives the explicit formulae corresponding to these boundaries in terms of fractional order PD controller (PDμ controller) parameters. Thus, the complete set of stabilizing controllers for an arbitrary integrating time delay system can be obtained. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness in solution accuracy and the simplicity of this method, two simulation studies are given. The simulation results indicate that the PDμ controllers can provide larger stability regions than the integer order PD controllers...|$|E

They may also have temporal responses described by power laws. The material behavior is represented by the relaxation modulus and the creep compliance. On the one hand, it is shown that in the special case of a Maxwell model characterized by a linearly time-varying viscosity, the medium's relaxation modulus is a power law which {{is similar to that of}} a fractional <b>derivative</b> <b>element</b> often called a springpot. On the other hand, the creep compliance of the time-varying Maxwell model is identified as Lomnitz's logarithmic creep law, making this possibly its first direct derivation. In this way both fractional derivatives and Lomnitz's creep law are linked to time-varying viscosity. A mechanism which yields fractional viscoelasticity and logarithmic creep behavior has therefore been found. Further, as a result of this linking, the curve-fitting parameters involved in the fractional viscoelastic modeling, and the Lomnitz law gain physical interpretation...|$|E

Initially, a time domainmodel relating compressions tocomponent forces accounting for preload effects, frequency anddynamic amplitude dependence is presented. The problem ofsimultaneously modelling the elastic, viscoelastic and frictionforces are removed by additively splitting them, where theelastic force response is modelled either by a fully linear ora nonlinear shape factor based approach, displaying resultsthat agree with those of a neo-Hookean hyperelastic isolatorunder a long term precompression.

It is shownthat the well-known Payne effect - where stiffness is high forsmall excitation amplitudes and low for large amplitudes whiledamping displays a maximum at intermediate amplitudes -evaluated at a certain frequency, is to a large extentinfluenced by the existence of additional frequency componentsin the signal.

Nonsmooth differential–algebraic equations refers here to semi-explicit differential–algebraic equations with algebraic equations satisfying local Lipschitz continuity and differential right-hand side functions satisfying Carathéodory-like conditions. Using lexicographic differentiation, an auxiliary nonsmooth differential–algebraic equation system is obtained whose unique solution furnishes the desired parametric sensitivities. More specifically, lexicographic derivatives of solutions of nonsmooth parametric differential–algebraic equations are obtained.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide new {{evidence}} on the determinants of credit spread returns and their dynamic dependences in three European corporate credit markets: the Bond market (cash market), the Credit Default Swap (CDS) market (derivatives market), and the Asset Swap Package (ASP) market (with properties of both derivatives and cash markets). Using daily data from 2005 to 2009, we find that credit spread returns are primarily driven by innovations and to a lower extent by changes in the expected loss component, the risk premium component, the liquidity premium component and the inertial component whose relative importance changes over time. The intra-market dependence during the current crisis decreases for bonds and ASP innovations but increases slightly for CDS. ASP and bond innovations are closely related, suggesting that the cash component dominates the ASP innovations’ behavior. On the other hand CDS’s innovations are unrelated with both the bonds’ and the ASP’s innovations, suggesting that the <b>derivatives</b> <b>element</b> in the ASP contract (due to the implicit interest rate swap) is essentially unrelated with the innovations in the pure credit derivative contract (CDS) ...|$|R

There {{is a wide}} degree of divergence among different elements, suggesting that these sequences are ancient in origin. Here we report the results of several lines of investigation into the genomic organization and evolutionary history of this element family. Results We present a classification scheme for Sadhu elements in A. thaliana, describing <b>derivative</b> <b>elements</b> related to the full-length elements we reported previously. We characterized Sadhu 5 elements {{in a set of}} A. thaliana strains in order to trace the history of radiation in this subfamily. Sequences surrounding the target sites of different Sadhu insertions are consistent with mobilization by LINE retroelements. Finally, we identified Sadhu elements grouping into distinct subfamilies in two related species, Arabidopsis arenosa and Arabidopsis lyrata. Conclusions Our analyses suggest that the Sadhu retroelement family has undergone target primed reverse transcription-driven retrotransposition during the divergence of different A. thaliana strains. In addition, Sadhu elements can be found at moderate copy number in three distinct Arabidopsis species, indicating that the evolutionary history of these sequences can be traced back at least several millions of years. </p...|$|R
40|$|PID {{controller}} {{is normally}} used in position control e. g. motor position control. However, in real application, a motor is non-linear due to factors like friction and power saturation. Therefore, in this paper, cascaded PID controller is proposed to reduce these nonlinearities. The cascaded PID controller was used {{because of the}} fast response and better disturbance rejection. The error from the motor position is fed into the first PID, and the output from the PID controller is used as velocity reference for the second PID. With these characteristics of a cascaded control, the nonlinearity in a motor can be reduced. Implementation of PID controller is done in a digital form and usually, the <b>derivative</b> <b>elements</b> are subject to noise from sampling time error and quantization error. To solve this problem, the alpha beta gamma filter is used to estimate the velocity of the motor.
