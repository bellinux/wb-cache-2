5|$|While emphasising {{the ability}} of the human {{imagination}} to uncover truth through a study of nature, the poem also questions religious certainty. However, according to the poem only a privileged few are able to see nature as <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> is and reveal its secrets to the world.|$|E
5|$|The climax {{is reached}} on Dr. Impossible's island, as he {{attempts}} to start a controlled Ice Age, making him Earth's ruler and only source of energy. He almost succeeds, using the hammer formerly belonging to the supervillain The Pharaoh to defeat the New Champions. CoreFire suddenly returns but is also unsuccessful against Dr. Impossible. Lily, who had quit the team earlier, eventually returns and defeats Dr. Impossible. Lily reveals that she is actually Erica Lowenstein, Dr. Impossible's childhood crush before his transformation and frequent kidnapee when she was the girlfriend of CoreFire. In the final chapter, Dr. Impossible ponders what <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> means to conquer the world, and whether such a feat can really be achieved, as he prepares for yet another escape from custody to start the cycle all over again with a new plan.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty, Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the Emperor and to defend the Empire {{whenever}} needed. He also accepted the appointment of a Greek Patriarch. In return, he was given the titles of sebastos and doux (duke) of Antioch, and he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the County of Edessa. Following this, Bohemond retreated to Apulia and died there. His nephew, Tancred, who was regent in Antioch, refused to accept {{the terms of}} the Treaty. Antioch came temporarily under Byzantine sway in 1137, {{but it was not until}} 1158 that <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> became a Byzantine vassal.|$|E
5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E

25|$|To use {{a sample}} {{as a guide}} to an entire population, it is {{important}} that <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.|$|E
25|$|Tristanne J. Connolly makes {{a similar}} observation, {{stating that the}} husband-wife motif {{reflects}} marriage as it was understood at the time. Connolly also suggests that in context the marriage metaphor was necessary in that <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> exemplified the unequal interaction between Yahweh and the people Israel. Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. According to Coogan, Hosea falls under a unique genre called “covenant lawsuit” where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God’s disappointment towards Israel is therefore expressed through the broken marriage covenant made between husband and wife.|$|E
25|$|Another famous {{philosophy}} is that formulated by Nachman of Breslov and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast {{to most of}} his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics {{and the manner in}} which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> is.|$|E

25|$|Zoey came to {{live with}} the Mileses shortly after she was born. Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and patience to be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no matter how much trouble she causes.|$|E

500|$|Prior to its interdiction by Solon, Athenians practiced debt enslavement: {{a citizen}} {{incapable}} of paying his debts became [...] "enslaved" [...] to the creditor. The {{exact nature of}} this dependency is a much controversial issue among modern historians: was <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> slavery or another form of bondage? However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as [...] "hektēmoroi" [...] working leased land belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the Near East and is cited in the Bible.|$|E
500|$|Ports of Night Trap {{to other}} {{platforms}} received more harsh reviews; critics felt the game did not age well. Staff at GamePro {{said it was}} [...] "innovative at one time, but Traps graphics and sounds now play like standard stuff." [...] Reviewers at GameFan blamed the game's extensive publicity for making it seem better than <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> was, saying [...] "it's a so-so game that {{got a lot more}} attention than it deserved." [...] Critics overwhelmingly found the game to be boring and dull. On a positive note, however, they did agree that the 3DO and 32X provided a larger color palette and higher-quality video than the Sega CD original. Night Trap was a commercial success, with sales totaling 400,000 copies by 1998.|$|E
500|$|A two-part episode, aired to {{coincide}} with the Canadian National Eating Disorder Awareness Week, earned mixed reviews. Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said [...] "Thankfully, the show moves far away from the health-class ideal that anorexia and bulimia simply stem from self-conscious teens. Rather, it displays it as the ugly disease that <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> is... All aspects of the story were done well. The plot was realistic. The display of the disease was truthful and progressive, while the acting was at an all time high... Miriam McDonald's performance was phenomenal. [...] performs with strength and credibility." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun criticized the episodes' [...] "ham-fisted handling of anorexia" [...] and wrote: [...] "It’s just that, well, the Degrassi foray, while well-intentioned, leaves you hungry for a fresh insight, some relevant information, a compelling storyline, good writing, believable dialogue, anything." [...] Harris even went as far as saying, [...] "That Degrassi episode was so bad it made me want to throw up." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{number of}} cover songs, which play a {{prominent}} role in Carlile's live act, represented what she typically includes in a concert. Carlile said that she felt as though she were a member of The Beatles when the audience stood and loudly sang the words to [...] "Dreams", and that [...] "Before It Breaks" [...] and [...] "I Will" [...] were emotionally the most difficult to perform. Carlile jokes with the audience between songs, which she felt was well-received, and requests their participation in three-part harmony during [...] "Turpentine". During the concert, the band experienced technical difficulties, and a bra thrown from the audience, intended for the drummer, hit Carlile on stage. Carlile said the [...] "rock 'n' roll symphony album" [...] was [...] "the meeting of two worlds, two different kinds of artists who got together for completely different reasons." [...] She has said that the album is the one she and her band are most proud of, believing <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> represents their live act.|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor from Billboard also praised [...] "I'm Your Angel", a {{duet with}} R. Kelly.

[...] Taylor commented, [...] "what raises the roof is the tune's elegant, epic instrumental base, which includes sweeping strings, a soulful choir, and gentle but determined percussive drive." [...] He continued, that [...] "I'm Your Angel" [...] "sells big at the bridge, where the instrumentation drops and Kelly and Dion harmonize in a gorgeous minor key – <b>it</b> <b>truly</b> makes the song." [...] Chuck Taylor also reviewed [...] "The Prayer", calling it [...] "a breathtaking, ultra-lush song, and the tour de force combination of Dion and Bocelli [...] will send a half-dozen chills up your spine." [...] Although {{he felt that the}} song is [...] "an unorthodox track for the radio", Taylor called it [...] "affecting", [...] "heartwarming", [...] "absolutely exquisite" [...] and [...] "one of Dion's most radiant performances ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Jill became {{engaged to}} Australian {{businessman}} Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers). Unbeknownst to her, he is Cane's biological {{father and the}} head of an organized crime syndicate in Australia. Cane was shot and [...] "killed" [...] on the day of her wedding to Colin, however it was actually Caleb (Cane's twin) that died. Jill found out that Colin was married to a woman named Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis), Cane's mother. Jill ended things with Colin and he was sent to jail for his crimes. In 2012, Jill leaves town for several months to help Phillip in Australia. Upon her return, she agrees to help Katherine come out of retirement to take control of Chancellor Industries, but Katherine ends up with a brain tumor. She has the tumor successfully removed and leaves town indefinitely with Murphy. Murphy later returns to Genoa City alone, revealing Katherine died while they were away. She leaves Nikki and Jill in charge of her funeral arrangements, and during this time Jill begins trying to figure out cryptic messages left by Katherine in a personal letter to her. Jill expected Katherine to have left everything to her in her will, but she only ends up with the Chancellor Estate, for which she can't afford the upkeep, and a mysterious music box.

This architecture also supports so-called channel programs that run on channel processor to do heavy lifting for I/O activities and protocols.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} Gao's writing is [...] "multivocality," [...] or {{polyphonic}} dialogue. In Gao's notes, Gao explains {{that there are}} occasionally many characters speaking at once. He instructs the actors to speak at varying volumes and pitches. The main idea should be the loudest, but <b>it's</b> <b>truly</b> at the director's discretion.
