5|$|In {{addition}} to Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: “Camouflage <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> in war” in the Royal Engineers Journal (December 1938), pp501–517; and ”Animal form {{in relation to}} appearance” in Lancelot Law Whyte, ed. Aspects of form: a symposium on form <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> art (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951). As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda {{in black and white}} (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the kittiwake eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the five official tropical cyclones, a disturbance {{in the middle of}} September that tracked from east of the Lesser Antilles to off the coast of Canada was studied for potential classification.

5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory <b>in</b> <b>nature),</b> <b>and</b> disorganized thinking and speech.
