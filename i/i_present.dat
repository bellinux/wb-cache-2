5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, <b>I</b> <b>present</b> to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of my thesis <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> the reservoir of the object Prigorica dam. In the next part <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> two conceptual solutions of reconstruction of the spillway on the right-hand side slope of the Prigorica dam. I described a possible solution to the sealing wall of the dam using the jet grouting technology. The first conceptual solution which <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> in my thesis is the reconstruction of {{the current state of the}} spillway. The current state is improved by replacing the useless material with a new better material. As the second conceptual solution <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> the reconstruction of the same spillway of the Prigorica dam using roller-compacted concrete technology. At the end of my thesis <b>I</b> briefly <b>presented</b> the organization of the construction site and a short analysis of the stability of steel reinforced concrete walls which are made as a part of the reconstruction of the spillway at the Prigorica dam. The stability of reinforced concrete walls I checked with a computer program CADAM...|$|R

500|$|In the album's liner notes, Gaye {{explained}} {{his views on}} the themes of sex and love, stating [...] "I can't {{see anything wrong with}} sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that <b>I</b> <b>present</b> here makes you lucky." ...|$|E

The first was to erect a monument to my memory that every man, woman and child in Coldwater would appreciate. Second, I would show the unhappy dissatisfied portion of our community that I was not selfish, but ready and willing to do anything in my power to beautify and ornament our city. [...] The old time worn saying that Coldwater is behind the times, and has no respectable place of amusement, tonight passes into oblivion, and with more pleasure than I am able to express <b>I</b> <b>present</b> for your inspection this evening a theatre unequaled in any city the size of Coldwater." ...|$|E

I also collected examples of teaching {{with the help of}} social media in Austria and Croatia. In the second part <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> and interpreted the results of an online survey that I conducted among teachers at primary and secondary schools in Slovenia. I wanted to explore if teachers use social media, which social software and social networks include in their teaching and why. I explore how knowledge of social media according to teachers do students have, and whether they use social media in the classroom to motivate them. I also asked respondents how they obtain knowledge about social media and what they think about integrating social media into the learning process. In the third part <b>I</b> <b>presented</b> a proposal of improvements to increase the use of social media in the calssroom and the possibility of the use social media in teaching and pointed out the dangers that can be encountered when using social media. ...|$|R
