This paper proposes an "economic cost approach" that not only adjusts for the changes in the value of the options during its life but also records the issuance of the stock at fair market value on the exercise date.

40|$|Background: While several socio-demographic {{predictors}} of disability pension have been identified, less {{is known about}} the importance of the medical aspects. The aim of this study was to explore the importance of diagnoses, prognoses, level of care and previous sickness absence as predictors for future disability pension status among long-term sickness absentees. Methods: A representative sample of Norwegian long-term sickness absentees, 2043 women and 1585 men, with detailed diagnostic information (based on International Classification of Primary Care), was followed up for 5 years. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> disability pension was obtained from the Norwegian disability register and was used as the dependent variable in Cox multivariate regression. Results: Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 5 -year risk of disability pension (1 - survival) were 22. 9 % for the full sample, 22. 5 % for men and 23. 3 % for the women. Men on sick leave for mental health disorders had an increased disability risk. For women a diagnosis of a cardiovascular disorder implied a slightly increased risk, while a pregnancy-related sickness absence carried almost no risk for disability pension during follow-up. Among cases with musculoskeletal disorders (54. 5 % of the sample), subgroups with significantly different disability risks were identified, with a gender-specific pattern. The prognoses formulated by the certifying doctor significantly predicted the outcome. Previous sickness absence days increased the disability risk, but were significant only for total absence above 20 weeks in the 4 years preceding inclusion. The level of care at the eight-week sickness certification did not affect the disability risk. Conclusion: Medical factors were important in identifying cases with an increased risk of disability pension...|$|R
50|$|John de Birthwaite was Prior of Monk Bretton in 1350. In {{that year}} Sir William de Notton, a {{powerful}} local landowner, who was later Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, {{and his wife}} Isabel, conveyed to him lands at Fishlake, Monk Bretton, Moseley and Woolley. The purpose <b>of</b> the <b>grant</b> was to build a chantry chapel at Woolley Church. Notton directed that prayers were {{to be said for}} the souls of himself, Isabel, their children, and also King Edward III, Queen Philippa of Hainault and their children. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grant</b> suggests that Notton made the grant as his way of giving thanks for England's deliverance from the first outbreak of the Black Death.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} two types of {{centrally}} executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the limitation and revocation procedures. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant</b> of that patent. It is a quasi-judicial process, subject to appeal, {{which can lead to}} maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute). National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.|$|E
5000|$|Unitary {{effect can}} be {{requested}} up to one month after grant of the European patent, with retroactive effect from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant.</b> However, according to the Draft Rules Relating to Unitary Patent Protection, unitary effect would be registered only if the European patent has been granted with {{the same set of}} claims for all the 26 participating member states in the regulations, whether the unitary effect applies to them or not. European patents automatically become a bundle of [...] "national" [...] European patents upon grant. Upon the grant of unitary effect, the [...] "national" [...] European patents will retroactively be considered to never have existed in the territories where the unitary patent has effect. The unitary effect does not affect [...] "national" [...] European patents in states where the unitary patent does not apply. Any [...] "national" [...] European patents applying outside the [...] "unitary effect" [...] zone will co-exist with the unitary patent.|$|E
50|$|Until a {{decision}} of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO of 1994, namely G 9/93 (reverting earlier {{decision of the}} same instance of 1985, namely G 1/84), {{it was possible for}} the proprietor of a European patent to oppose its own patent with the aim of centrally limiting it. Decision G 9/93 however deprived patent proprietors of this opportunity. This means that, after G 9/93, the only possibility for the proprietor of a European patent to voluntarily limit the scope conferred by its patent (e.g. for instance to strengthen the patent in view of some newly discovered prior art documents and/or in advance of envisaged litigation) was to request such limitation at the national level, i.e. before the national patent offices or competent courts of the Contracting States, if permitted. The EPC of 1973 made no provision for a limitation procedure, and a fortiori no provision for centrally limiting a European patent before the EPO after the nine-month period for filing an opposition (nine months as from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>grant</b> of the European patent).|$|E

50|$|A {{step-change}} {{occurred in}} the governance of the Cumbria area with the succession of Henry I of England. Henry enjoyed good relations with both Alexander I of Scotland and Henry's nephew, David I of Scotland, and therefore he could concentrate on developing his northern lands without {{the threat of a}} Scottish invasion. Either he or his predecessor, Rufus, possibly around 1098, granted Appleby and Carlisle to Ranulf le Meschin who became the strongman of the north-west frontier. (Others place the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grants</b> after the Battle of Tinchebrai, that is, 1106 onwards). Ranulf was the third husband of Lucy of Bolingbroke, the first husband of whom had been Ivo Taillebois, whose Cumbrian and Lincolnshire lands he inherited.|$|R
