5|$|Super Mario Kart {{features}} eight playable {{characters from}} the Mario series – Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad. Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad returned {{in all of}} the subsequent Mario Kart games starting with Mario Kart 64. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use. These powers are specific to each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players who <b>hit</b> <b>them</b> to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, he was convinced that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what <b>hit</b> <b>them.</b> He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations {{to take advantage of the}} confusion that followed in order to disengage.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} lest {{he and his}} men should be engaged when they reached the Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by the Canadians on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the Australians, the Canadian fire did not <b>hit</b> <b>them.</b> This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the Canadians and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E

5|$|Striking the Philippines as {{a rapidly}} {{weakening}} system, Maysak had only minimal {{effects in the}} country, producing strong waves and light rainfall. Across Aurora and Isabela provinces, a total of 2,761people were directly affected by the storm, {{most of whom were}} evacuated prior to Maysak's landfall. No damage or loss of life was reported; however, four people were injured after waves generated by Maysak <b>hit</b> <b>them</b> while they were taking selfies along the shoreline of Dipaculao town in Aurora province on April4. An overloaded, unregistered ferry capsized off Sulu Province in Mindanao on April3, resulting in five deaths. The Philippine Coast Guard stated that seas at the time were calm and the sinking likely resulted from overcrowding of the vessel rather than Typhoon Maysak.|$|E
5|$|Though the Indian Navy {{achieved}} significant {{success with}} Operation Trident, its main target, the oil storage facilities in Karachi, were still operational as {{only one of}} the two missiles fired had <b>hit</b> <b>them.</b> This failure was later assessed as the result of confusion created between the commanding officers of the three missile boats. Furthermore, the Indians mistook tracer fire from the coastal artillery of Karachi as originating from Pakistani aircraft, and retreated hurriedly before they could properly target the tanks. After the first attack during Operation Trident on the Port of Karachi, Pakistan stepped up aerial surveillance of its coast as the presence of large Indian Navy ships gave the impression that another attack was being planned. Pakistani warships attempted to outsmart the Indian Navy by mingling with merchant shipping. To counter these moves, Operation Python was launched.|$|E
5|$|When it advanced, Brisbane's brigade {{came under}} {{artillery}} fire that caused many casualties. The brigade finally reached some dead ground where the guns could not <b>hit</b> <b>them,</b> but French skirmishers began picking off the soldiers. After some urging by Edward Pakenham, Brisbane continued the attack. The 1/45th Foot fought its way {{close to the}} top of the ridge where Joseph François Fririon's brigade of Foy's division held the ridgeline. On the left of Brisbane's brigade, the 1/88th Foot had two companies guarding the divisional artillery battery as it began pounding the French line. Soult spotted the threat and ordered a squadron of the 21st Chasseurs-à-Cheval to charge. The cavalry overran the two companies, inflicting heavy losses, and then went after the gunners. The remaining companies of the 88th immediately opened fire on the French horsemen, mowing most of them down. The 21st Chasseurs went into combat 401 strong but 11 days later reported only 236 men on active duty. The 88th Foot suffered 269 killed and wounded, by far the most of any British unit.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or <b>hit</b> <b>them</b> with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none <b>hit</b> <b>them.</b> They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
5|$|However, Nansouty's move {{compromised}} Lannes's entire plan, which {{counted on}} powerful reinforcements arriving through Heinrichsdorf. An alarmed Lannes immediately sent {{one of his}} aides de camp to Grouchy urging him to stop the enemy from cutting his communications with the Emperor, whatever the cost. Grouchy duly took command of Nansouty's leading squadrons, ordering {{them back to their}} initial position, then launched a desperate but successful charge with his own dragoons, arriving in the streets of the village and cutting off its Russian defenders. Grouchy's dragoons became disorganised and were badly positioned following this sudden charge, and the Russian cavalry countercharged them, but Nansouty arrived just in time and the French repulsed the Russian cavalry, momentarily securing the position. A lively argument ensued between the two cavalry commanders. Grouchy invoked his seniority and position as commander of the cavalry and criticised Nansouty's earlier decision to withdraw. Nansouty countered by saying that he had superior experience at handling cavalry. When combat resumed, the quarrel did not prevent Nansouty from performing brilliantly under Grouchy's command during the dramatic series of events that followed. Having been repulsed earlier, the Russians decided to force the position at Heinrichsdorf, and they assembled a strong infantry force preceded by no less than 60 cavalry squadrons, plus around 2,000 Cossacks. To counter this move, Grouchy opted for deception, luring some of the enemy cavalry away from the infantry. Then, Grouchy charged the enemy horse from the front; simultaneously Nansouty <b>hit</b> <b>them</b> from the flank and together Grouchy and Nansouty repulsed them. Despite numerous charges and countercharges, the French cavalry maintained the upper hand.|$|E

25|$|In baseball, celebrating an out, {{stealing}} bases when well ahead, or smiling on {{the field}} when well ahead are considered serious breaches of sportsmanship. Possibly the most serious breach of sportsmanship is the pitcher's throwing behind the batter, since batters often react to a pitch that may <b>hit</b> <b>them</b> by backing up.|$|E

If the player fails to signal Elika's magic, they fall off of the plate, sometimes to their death.|$|E

As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married and had children, including Manto. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes; depending on the myth, either she made sure to leave the snakes alone this time, or, according to Hyginus, trampled on them and became a man once more.|$|E
25|$|The biggest manifestation was when, Jaworski {{came back}} from the nearby Medical City with seven {{stitches}} in his lip to lead the Gins to a come-from-behind victory against NCC. Jaworski incurred this from a wayward elbow inflicted by Jeff Moore in the second quarter. But with them behind by 15 points going into the final seven minutes of the game, Jaworski re-entered the court and sparked a frenzy that to date, has yet been matched. The NCC team simply froze upon the sight of the Big J and didn't know what <b>hit</b> <b>them,</b> eventually losing to the Gins.|$|E
25|$|Varkaus was an {{industrial}} community of 3,000 {{people in the}} Leppävirta municipality of Kuopio Province. The local Red Guard {{was established in the}} autumn of 1917.

As the Civil War broke out in late January 1918, the frontline soon formed {{in the southern part of}} Finland and Varkaus became the last remaining Red spot behind the White lines. The Whites made their first attempt to take Varkaus in 6 February but the Reds managed to <b>hit</b> <b>them</b> back.
