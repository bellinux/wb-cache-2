40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1994 Jane Moira TaupinThe innovative forensic technique of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> has been acclaimed {{as the most important}} advance in forensic science since fingerprinting. Whilst there is much anecdotal information on the impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on criminal investigation, prosecution and adjudication, there is little quantitative and control comparison data on the routine use of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> This study evaluates the effect of the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> in Victoria on a number of key points in the criminal justice system. The overall impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was low as determined by the percentage of criminal cases which utilise <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> However, in certain classes of cases its impact was measurable, most notably in sex offences committed by “strangers”. Less than one quarter of sexual offence cases of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiled</b> resulted in a contested trial, suggesting that the focus of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on the criminal justice system should swing to the pre-trial phase. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was most often used in sexual offence cases and a database comparison of these cases before and after the advent of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was examined. Whilst not statistically significant, trends indicated there were more solved cases, more guilty pleas and fewer trials after the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> but more individuals were drawn into the investigatory process. The number of trials of sexual offences in which consent was an issue was slightly greater than previously. The increase in guilty pleas with <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was only for stranger type crime. Further research is recommended as <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> becomes the cornerstone of biological forensic analysis. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Legal and criminalistic {{aspects of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> - Summary The Thesis deals with <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> {{one of the}} most {{accurate}} methods used in recent criminal science to identify individuals. It also deals with the legal aspects of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> because it raises many important legal questions. The The- sis consists of two parts. The first part is about <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> itself. The history of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> worldwide and in the Czech Republic is mentioned. The first cases solved with its contribution are described. A very important feature of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> is that it can be used not only for conviction of offenders but also for acquittal of innocent individu- als. Biological principles of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> are explained as well as possibilities of its utilization in criminal science, criminal and civil proceedings. The fact that monozy- gotic twins have identical DNA is mentioned as well as some very extraordinary occurrences such as hermaphrodites or another kind of individuals, who have two different DNA. These anomalies can cause problems with interpretation of the results. DNA databases can be used for comparison of many <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> without the necessity to repeat sample analysis. This fact caused the expansion of DNA pro- filing. A special software required for DNA databases is also shortly described. The second [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{repository}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>Profiles</b> {{held by the}} FSL prior to the commencement of the DNA Act comprises two indices, namely a Casework Index containing forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> derived from biological samples collected from crime scenes and a Reference Index containing forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of known people, including victims, suspects, volunteers and personnel. The Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 currently prevents DNA samples from being taken from convicted offenders. The <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> in the DCID are generated by analysing an AmpFlSTR Profiler Plus STR multiplex system of 9 different STR loci (D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317 and D7S820) plus Amelogenin for sex determination. There were approximately 80,000 <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> on the DCID in 2007, with the number increasing to approximately 180,000 by late 2013.|$|R
25|$|Scientists at the Forensic Science Service (FSS) {{examined}} the scarf {{which had been}} tied around Tiernan's neck and found a hair caught in the knot which {{did not belong to}} her.

This provided a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> which matched Taylor's.|$|E

25|$|In {{the hope}} that she could {{eventually}} be identified by a DNA match with any living relatives, the body was exhumed in September 2005 to extract DNA. The University of North Texas Center for Human Identification was able to produce nuclear STR (nucDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) <b>profiles</b> of her <b>DNA</b> via forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> Her <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> were stored in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a database that allows the United States public crime laboratories to compare and exchange <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> {{in order to identify}} criminal suspects and crime victims.|$|R
25|$|Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have {{determined}} that Pinot gris has a remarkably similar <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> to Pinot noir and that the color difference is derived from a genetic mutation that occurred centuries ago.

25|$|Early assays {{such as the}} HLA-DQ alpha reverse {{dot blot}} strips grew to be very popular due to their ease of use, and {{the speed with which}} a result could be obtained.

25|$|In December 2003, {{forensic}} investigators extracted enough {{material from}} a mixed blood sample found on JonBenét's underwear {{to establish a}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profile.</b> That DNA belonged to an unknown male person. The DNA was submitted to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a database containing more than 1.6 million DNA profiles, but the sample did not match any profile in the database.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{national}} DNA database {{is called}} Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). It is maintained at three levels: national, state and local. Each level implemented its own DNA index system. The national DNA index system (NDIS) allows <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> to be exchanged and compared between participated laboratories nationally. Each state DNA index system (SDIS) allows <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> to be exchanged and compared between the laboratories of various {{states and the}} local DNA index system (LDIS) allows <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> collected at local sites and uploaded to SDIS and NDIS.|$|R

50|$|Through {{the use of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has {{revealed}} the identity of 6,598 persons missing from the July 1995 fall of Srebrenica, by analysing <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> extracted from bone samples of exhumed human remains and matching them to the <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from blood samples donated by relatives of the missing. The overall high matching rate between DNA extracted from these bone and blood samples leads ICMP to support an estimate of close to 8,100 individuals missing from the fall of Srebrenica.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, Lothian and Borders Police's {{cold case}} unit {{instructed}} further forensic {{work to be}} undertaken in the case, reflecting improvements in DNA profiling technology since the murders occurred. This resulted in the isolation of a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> of a male, found on both girls. The DNA of the original 500 suspects was analysed and compared to the new sample, {{but there was no}} match.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{a partial}} <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> was {{generated}} from {{evidence at the}} crime scene, which {{was not possible to}} perform in the past due to lack of knowledge. The profile matched a local criminal, William Ross Knight, who was notorious for his crime spree of robberies in the 1980s. Knight died in 2005 due to liver complications. Although a suspect was identified, the victim's DNA did not match with any individual in the CODIS database.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, SFPD {{developed}} a partial <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> from the saliva on stamps and envelopes of Zodiac's letters. SFPD compared this partial DNA to the DNA of Arthur Leigh Allen.

25|$|The CODIS {{software}} contains multiple different databases {{depending on}} the type of information being searched against. Examples of these databases include, missing persons, convicted offenders, and forensic samples collected from crime scenes. Each state, and the federal system, has different laws for collection, upload, and analysis of information contained within their database. However, for privacy reasons, the CODIS database does not contain any personal identifying information, such as the name associated with the <b>DNA</b> <b>profile.</b> The uploading agency is notified of any hits to their samples and are tasked with the dissemination of personal information pursuant to their laws.|$|E

The Arrestee Index and Convicted Offender Index contains forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of all persons arrested or convicted, as the case may be, of a Schedule 8 offence which range from rape and murder to burglary. Forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>Profiles</b> entered into the Arrestee Index will either be migrated to the Convicted Offender Index upon conviction, where they will be held indefinitely, or removed within three years if the arrest does not result in a conviction. Forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from volunteers with informed consent will be held under the Investigative Index and will be removed from the NFDD within 3 months of the case being finalised.|$|R

25|$|On September 25, 2012, the RCMP {{announced}} {{a link between}} the murders and deceased United States criminal Bobby Jack Fowler. His DNA was found on the body of Colleen MacMillen, one of the presumed victims. Investigators first compiled a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> of the perpetrator in 2007, but technology available at the time did not yield a strong enough sample. New technologies allowed police to re-examine the DNA in 2012, leading to the identification. In addition, Fowler is also strongly suspected of having killed both Gale Weys and Pamela Darlington in 1973. The RCMP believe that he may have also killed as many as ten or possibly even twenty of the other victims. Several of the murders took place after Fowler's arrest in June 1995.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, {{there have been}} several {{incidents}} of bold or aggressive behavior towards humans in Algonquin Provincial Park. Between 1987 and 1996, there were four instances of wolves biting people. The most serious case occurred in 1998, when a male wolf that had been long noted to be unafraid of humans stalked a couple walking their four-year-old daughter in September that year, losing interest when the family took refuge in a trailer. Two days later, the wolf attacked a 19-month-old boy, causing several puncture wounds on his chest and back before being driven off by campers. After the animal was killed later that day, it was found to be non-rabid, and had a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile</b> typical of wolves of the area, thus indicating it was not a hybrid.|$|E
