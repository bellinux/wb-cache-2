5000|$|Typically on LTR systems, each {{of these}} {{controllers}} periodically sends out a <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> (approximately every 10 seconds on LTR Standard systems) so that the subscriber units know {{that the system is}} there. The idle <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> can be turned off if desired by the system operator. Some systems will broadcast idle data bursts only on channels used as home channels and not on those used for [...] "overflow" [...] conversations. To a listener, the idle <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> will sound like a short blip of static like someone keyed up and unkeyed a radio within about 1/2 second. This <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> is not sent at the same time by all the channels but happen randomly throughout all the system channels.|$|E
30|$|An easy-to-implement {{approach}} to allocate downlink <b>data</b> <b>bursts</b> in IEEE 802.16 e (mobile WiMAX) frames is proposed. With the proposed allocation scheme, each mobile station can employ a decision-directed channel estimation method without demodulating <b>data</b> <b>bursts</b> destined for other stations. Three decision-directed channel estimation methods, each with different computational complexity, are suggested {{based on the}} proposed allocation method. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show {{that one of the}} suggested decision-directed methods, the adaptive weighted-average estimation, outperforms the widely used two-dimensional interpolation method for all considered channel models, especially for high-speed reception in a large-delay-spread channel. Therefore, the proposed allocation method together with the adaptive weighted-average estimation can be used to increase the successful transmission probability for <b>data</b> <b>bursts</b> requiring low error rates, such as hybrid automatic repeat request bursts.|$|R

50|$|One {{annoyance}} {{with the}} fire systems was the presence of unit ID <b>data</b> <b>bursts.</b> These constant squawks, heard {{at the end of}} transmissions, are decoded at dispatch to identify the calling radio. The annoyance of the <b>data</b> <b>bursts</b> is a trade-off that could help find a firefighter who has been injured or needs help. It also automatically displays the unit ID at the dispatch console. In most systems, it also saves dispatch personnel from typing the unit ID. They press one key and the calling unit's ID is inserted into the current CAD screen or command line.|$|R

5000|$|In OBS, packets are {{aggregated}} into data bursts at {{the edge}} of the network to form the data payload. Various assembling schemes based on time and/or size exist (see burst switching). Edge router architectures have been proposed (see [...] ). OBS features the separation between the control plane and the data plane. A control signal (also termed burst header or control packet) is associated to each <b>data</b> <b>burst.</b> The control signal is transmitted in optical form in a separated wavelength termed the control channel, but signaled out of band and processed electronically at each OBS router, whereas the <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> is transmitted in all optical form from one end to the other end of the network. The <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> can cut through intermediate nodes, and data buffers such as fiber delay lines may be used. In OBS data is transmitted with full transparency to the intermediate nodes in the network. After the burst has passed a router, the router can accept new reservation requests.|$|E

That these [...] "pips" [...] were present at all was therefore anomalous, but they were also too fast, too loud, and exhibited a [...] "low-frequency audio shadow," [...] implying [...] "some kind of doctoring of the tape," [...] said Audiotels managing director, Andrew Martin, in his firms report.

50|$|Motorola radios with MDC options have {{an option}} {{allowing}} {{the radio to}} filter out data bursts from the receive audio.

50|$|The ORBCOMM {{satellite}} network is {{best suited for}} users who send small amounts of data.

50|$|Note {{that the}} matrix scan routine loops continuously. When no key is pressed, {{we still have}} a signal {{composed}} of multiple equidistant peaks. These emanations may be used to remotely detect the presence of powered computers.

5000|$|In DVB-H, for {{additional}} error protection and power efficiency for mobile receivers, a systematic Reed-Solomon code is employed as an erasure code over packets within a <b>data</b> <b>burst,</b> where each packet is protected with a CRC: data in verified packets count as correctly received symbols, {{and if all}} are received correctly, evaluation of the additional parity data can be omitted, and receiver devices can switch off reception until {{the start of the}} next burst.|$|E
50|$|Unit ID {{can be sent}} {{as leading}} or {{trailing}} a voice message. In the leading option, the <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> is sent at the moment a user presses the radio's push-to-talk button. An option can be set to make the radio's speaker emit a tone {{for the length of}} the unit ID data, (about 1-1.5 seconds). This reminds a user to wait until the data has been sent before talking. The leading unit ID takes slightly more air time (is longer) than a trailing ID because of a header tone and the need to delay the <b>data</b> <b>burst</b> to allow time for CTCSS decoders and voting comparators to open an audio path to the decoder. A default delay is defined with the unit ID option. To adjust for time delay variations in each individual system, radios can be programmed to delay the sending of a radio's unit ID data by up to hundreds of milliseconds within a range. In the trailing option, the data packet is sent at the moment the microphone button is released. This avoids timing issues because the audio path to the base station is already open.|$|E
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>bursts</b> {{can occur}} naturally, {{such as when}} the {{download}} of data from the internet briefly experiences higher speeds.

40|$|Survivable {{networks}} {{have the capability}} to survive from the events of network components failures. The resilience mechanisms in these networks protect and restore the impaired communication paths by using spare capacity. On the other hand, Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms focus on network capabilities that provide the facilities to differentiate network traffic and offer different levels of service to each class of traffic. Traditionally the survivability algorithms were applied at the physical (optical) layer, whereas the QoS mechanisms mainly applied at packet-forwarding level. Recent technological breakthroughs can now facilitate novel forwarding techniques for optical <b>data</b> <b>bursts</b> that make it possible to capture packets at the optical layer. A major challenge in the transfer of these ultrahigh-speed <b>data</b> <b>bursts</b> is to allocate resources according to QoS specifications and to provide spare capacity required to address link failures...|$|R
