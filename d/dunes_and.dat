5|$|Damage {{was light}} in Maryland. Some sand <b>dunes</b> <b>and</b> wooden {{structures}} were damaged, and above-normal tides occurred.

5|$|Banksia prionotes occurs {{throughout}} much of the Southwest Botanical Province, occurring both along the west coast and well inland, and ranging from Shark Bay (25°30′S) in the north, to Kojonup (33°50'S) and Jerramungup (34°24'S 118°55'E) in the south and south-east respectively.

5000|$|At {{the west}} end of the Indiana Dunes, in Gary there is a <b>dune</b> <b>and</b> swale {{province}} of the system. The area is characterized by low, linear sand ridges, parallel to the shoreline. Between these ridges are low areas of marsh or ponds. The ridges are characterized by prairie and savanna life forms and the marsh areas and ponds by the plants and wildlife of those characteristic areas of the dune lands. The <b>dune</b> <b>and</b> swale topography is easiest to see in the Miller Woods area of the lakeshore. Much of the <b>dune</b> <b>and</b> swales was eliminated by the construction of the industrial plants of Gary, East Chicago, Whiting and Hammond. [...] Some key identifiers of a <b>dune</b> <b>and</b> swale community include the common yellowthroat, Blanding's turtle, and bluehearts.|$|R

5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} <b>dunes,</b> <b>and</b> water rails in the reed bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The limited {{high-resolution}} {{radar coverage}} of Titan obtained through 2007 (22%) suggested {{the existence of}} nonuniformities in its crater distribution. Xanadu has 2–9 times more craters than elsewhere. The leading hemisphere has a 30% higher density than the trailing hemisphere. There are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial <b>dunes</b> <b>and</b> in the north polar region (where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common).|$|E
5|$|The reserve {{has over}} 100,000 {{visitors}} a year, including birdwatchers and horse riders, {{and is therefore}} significant for the local economy. The NNR has taken steps to control entry to the fragile <b>dunes</b> <b>and</b> other areas important for their animals or plants because of the damage to sensitive habitats that could be caused by unrestricted access. The dunes are an essential natural defence against the projected rises in sea level along this vulnerable coast.|$|E
5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' <b>dunes</b> <b>and</b> into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E

5|$|During Ruisdael's last period {{he began}} to depict {{mountain}} scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses {{all but two of}} them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, <b>dunes</b> <b>and</b> country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey {{started an}} {{enterprise}} {{to develop the}} Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach <b>dunes,</b> <b>and</b> planting coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E
5|$|Lack {{of money}} has precluded major improvements, however, and timber {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including <b>dunes</b> <b>and</b> coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, {{partly due to the}} suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E

In February 2016, officials announced that there was no funding available for replenishment of Bethany Beach′s <b>dune</b> <b>and</b> beach during 2016, and that replenishment would not take place until 2017, in accordance with the schedule established before the two storms hit.|$|R

5|$|Sufficient habitat {{complexity}} is {{a crucial}} requirement {{for the presence of}} this species, in order to support its various behaviours-basking, foraging, and hibernation—as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment. It is found in a variety of habitats, including: chalky downs, rocky hillsides, moors, sandy heaths, meadows, rough commons, edges of woods, sunny glades and clearings, bushy slopes and hedgerows, dumps, coastal <b>dunes,</b> <b>and</b> stone quarries. It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.|$|E

5|$|The {{large number}} of {{tourists}} can have negative effects; wildlife may be disturbed, particularly species that breed in exposed areas, such as ringed plovers, and plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand <b>dunes</b> <b>and</b> vegetated shingle. Damage can be reduced by measures such as wardening the breeding colonies and using fences, boardwalks and signs to control access. The access paths to the hides, other than the northernmost, are largely boardwalked, and an extensive programme of fence replacement and improvements to the control of water levels on the reserve took place in 2010–2011.|$|E
