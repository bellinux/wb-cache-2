Nevertheless, under the findings the species appears closest evolutionarily to three clades of nuthatches: two nuthatches that prefer rocky environments, the western rock nuthatch (S. neumayer) and the <b>eastern</b> <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (S. tephronota); species in the [...] "europaea" [...] group, including the Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea), Siberian nuthatch (S. arctica), chestnut-vented nuthatch (S. nagaensis), Kashmir nuthatch (S. cashmirensis), Indian nuthatch (S. castanea), chestnut-bellied nuthatch (S. cinnamoventris) and the Burmese nuthatch (S. neglecta); {{as well as the}} white-tailed nuthatch (S. himalayensis), and therefore, the white-browed nuthatch (S. victoriae).

50|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} (Sitta neumayer) (sometimes known simply as {{rock nuthatch}}) is a small passerine bird which breeds from Croatia east through Greece and Turkey to Iran. This nuthatch is largely resident apart from some post-breeding dispersal. The <b>eastern</b> <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> Sitta tephronota is a separate species, which occurs further east in south-central Asia.|$|E
5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} {{nuthatch}} present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and <b>eastern</b> <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch {{is very similar to}} the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.|$|R

5000|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling. Its kinship {{with other members}} of the genus is unclear. The bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to the blue nuthatch (S. azurea), or other blue-tinted nuthatch species such as the velvet-fronted nuthatch (S. frontalis), yellow-billed nuthatch (S. solangiae) and the sulphur-billed nuthatch (S. oenochlamys), but its distribution being focused in the eastern Himalayas, and the uniqueness of its plumage, argues against the assumption. According to the International Ornithological Congress and ornithologist Alan P. Peterson, no subspecies have been identified. * Weakly-supported clade** Beautiful nuthatch (S. formosa)** *** **** <b>Eastern</b> <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (S. tephronota)**** [...] Western rock nuthatch (S. neumayer)*** **** ***** Kashmir nuthatch (S. cashmirensis)***** Chestnut-vented nuthatch (S. nagaensis)***** [...] Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea)**** [...] White-tailed nuthatch (S. himalayensis) ...|$|E

5|$|All nuthatches nest in cavities; {{except for}} the two species of <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches,</b> all use tree holes, making a simple cup lined with soft {{materials}} on which to rest eggs. In some species the lining consists of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|R
5|$|All nuthatches {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need.

5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of <b>rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|R
5|$|Nuthatches forage along {{tree trunks}} and {{branches}} and {{are members of}} the same feeding guild as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. Krüper's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. <b>Rock</b> <b>nuthatches</b> forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits or join mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|R

When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a Geospiza fortis island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor G. magnirostris in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on.|$|R
