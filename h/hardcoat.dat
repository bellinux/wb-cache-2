40|$|AbstractIn this work, a {{duplex coating}} is {{performed}} by conducting microwave plasma nitriding on Ti 6 Al 4 V, {{followed by the}} deposition of <b>hardcoating</b> (CrN) using an arc coating system. Plasma nitriding of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy using microwave plasma technique, created a thick (∼ 130 μm) modified layer (case depth) at processing temperature of 700 °C and 5 hour. The load carrying capacity of the duplex coating assessed using Rockwell-C test shows that the case depth increases {{with an increase in}} process temperature and time for nitriding. Consequently, it affects the formation of compound layer on the plasma nitrided specimen.

Germinability of untreated (control) seeds was relatively high (ca. 70 %), indicating the presence of primary (coat-imposed) dormancy in {{a fraction of the}} seeds studied. Hot water immersion, dry heat, sulphuric acid treatment and water soak effectively relieved dormancy of the <b>hardcoated</b> portion of the seed population and consequently increased rate and final percentage of germination (92, 84, 80 and 78 %, respectively). This positive effect of heat on seed germination followed by a massive and rapid seedling emergence might be used as a tool for the control of invasive Spartium populations...|$|R
40|$|Transparent oxide layers on plastic webs show a high {{potential}} {{for a variety of}} applications. The Pulsed Magnetron Sputter (PMS) process using Dual Magnetron Systems is the key to deposit oxide layers as TiO(2) and SiO(2) on plastic webs for optical applications like window films. Transparent permeation barrier layers for food packaging have already gained industrial application. The barrier properties are essentially influenced by the deposition technology. Plasma-activated evaporation may significantly improve the barrier properties. High end permeation barriers layers for applications in the display industry can be achieved by further increasing the energy of the condensing particles.

The objectives of this project were to do methodical and process basic research for welding of aluminium alloys and surface treatment of steel and copper substrates with laser power up to 20 kW. Extensive parameter studies in the case of cw and pulsed laser welding of thick and thin aluminium alloy plates leaded to the welding of aluminium construction units; dependent upon the joining geometry it was welded with and without additional material.

50|$|Headlight {{restoration}} {{or plastic}} headlight restoration is {{the act of}} refinishing aged headlight lenses that have become discolored or dull due to oxidation primarily due to UV light and other environmental factors such as road debris impact (stones, sand, etc.) rain, and exposure to caustic chemicals. Over time the protective <b>hardcoat</b> breaks down with UV degradation and wear from abrasion, etc. If left untreated the headlights will eventually develop small surface cracks, a condition referred to as crazing. The effectiveness of the headlight in terms of light output measured by LUX can be significantly reduced. This condition which results in hazy and discoloured lenses is known for causing reduced night time visibility for travelers as the condition becomes worse. It is possible for cloudy and hazy headlights to be restored to a like-new condition and represents typically a far more economical alternative than replacing the lens.|$|E

A {{few of the}} major brands that produce these [...] "kits" [...] include 3M, Turtle Wax, Sylvania, Headlight Wizard, Meguiar's, Mothers, and Rain-X. Most of these kits require multiple stages of wet sanding to remove the oxidation of the headlight lens, usually with descending level of grit (coarse to fine). Some kits include a UV sealant which is said to protect {{the lens of the}} headlight longer. Kits with the UV sealant include some of the 3M, Sylvania, and Headlight Wizard.

40|$|Polycarbonate (PC) is {{a leading}} {{challenger}} to glass in automotive applications. While offering excellent impact resistance, it suffers from minimal long term weathering resistance. The present paper presents research from the Foresight Vehicle sponsored PABS 2 K programme that has delivered cost effective and efficient environmental protection mechanisms for PC components. The utilisation of specially formulated acrylic laminates provides excellent protection to the PC matrix when subjected to accelerated weather testing. Careful material formulation and component processing made this protection possible without significant reductions in impact performance normally witnessed with PC-PMMA laminate structures. However, optimum levels of acrylic impact modifying and UV absorbing agents exist, beyond which no physical improvements are witnessed and reductions in properties may even occur. The present work theoretically allows more diverse selections of abrasion resistant hardcoats to be subsequently employed to improve component hardness if desired, {{as the need for}} ultraviolet blocking capabilities is removed and an effective protection mechanism remains in place on any final component even if any applied <b>hardcoat</b> becomes damaged. ...|$|E
40|$|Beside {{the layer}} quality a good {{adhesion}} between coating and polymer substrate is {{a precondition for}} the manufacture of quality thin film products. Due to the inertness of most polymer surfaces an appropriate treatment of substrates prior deposition is necessary. Typical examples for the necessity of pretreatment are the deposition of barrier layers on BOPP film and the deposition of layer systems on organic <b>hardcoat</b> for window films. The classic methods are the corona treatment as a separate step prior vacuum coating and the plasma (glow discharge) treatment as in-line process. However, we could show that energetic ion bombardment typical for sputter etching processes is superior to simple plasma treatment in many applications. Two technical solutions for the pretreatment of substrates by sputter etching will be presented. The Web Treater uses an asymmetric RF discharge to power a plasma and to maintain an energetic ion bombardment also for electrically insulating substrates without restrictions in film thickness. MF bias treatment is a method suitable especially for plastic film substrates up to 100 micrometers thick. High treatment doses can be achieved due to the large treatment area. Both methods combine the surface activation effects by plasma radicals and radiation with the particle removal and cross linking action caused by energetic ion bombardment.

40|$|A new {{synthesis}} {{and processing}} route for preparing multilayer interference coatings on plastic substrates has been developed. For this purpose, alcoholic sols of surface modi®ed (3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, GPTS) SiO 2 and TiO 2 particles with sizes of 10 and 4 nm, respectively, were synthesized. Layers were prepared by dip coating, subsequent UV curing (2. 1 J/cm 2) and thermal post treatment at 808 C for 15 min. Refractive indices of nD 1 : 47 for SiO 2 layers and nD 1 : 93 for TiO 2 were measured. As an example, plastic sheets were coated by angle dependent dip coating with withdrawal speeds from 3 up to 6 mm/s and an inclination angle of 48. By this way, {{one side of}} the substrate was coated with six quarterwave thick layers (peak wavelength at 750 nm), producing a re¯ective interference ®lter with a re¯ectivity of 72 % between 650 and 900 nm. On {{the other side of the}} substrate, an interference ®lter with a re¯ectivity of 66 % between 800 and 1100 nm was produced simultaneously. The interference coatings do not show delamination or defects after boiling water test (H 2 O 1 5 wt. % NaCl, 8 h) and excellent adhesion (GT 0, TT 1) was obtained in the cross cut tape test. Yellowing did not occur (Dg, 3) and the mechanical properties of the interference ®lters were not altered after dry sun test at 760 W/m 2 for 270 h.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from July 8, 2011 - July 7, 2012 The various solution-based processes, spin coating, inkjet printing, microreactor assisted nanoparticle deposition (MANDTM) and spin-successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (Spin-SILAR) were used to demonstrate thin film electronics and anti-reflective coatings. Several aspects of thin film transistors (TFTs) were tested including a range of temperatures, annealing atmosphere, and deposition methods. At high processing temperature, TFTs with spin coated-InO, -IWO, -IZO and -IGO achieved high mobilites of 55. 26, 37. 86, 6. 06 and 5. 50 cm²/V•s, {{some of the highest}} reported mobilities for the spin coating process. Inkjet printed-ZTO, -IGZO and -IGTO from metal halide chemistry were fabricated and achieved mobilities of 3. 09, 25. 62 and 14. 96 cm²/V•s, the highest reported values in inkjet printed TFTs. At low processing temperature, an ozone annealing process was adopted. TFTs with spin coated InO, IWO and IZO were processed with ozone. High mobilities of 0. 85 ~ 16. 76 cm²/V•s and I[subscript on/off] of 10 ⁵ ~ 10 ⁶ were achieved with the ozone annealing process at temperatures as low as 200 °C. A newly developed MANDTM system was used to fabricate ZnO TFTs which were shown to have strong potential for high performance devices made with low processing temperature. In addition, solution processing was used to produce anti-reflective coating of biomimic moth-eye structure on polished aluminum substrates, a textured silicon surface, glass slides and eyeglass lenses. Two films materials were explored - ZnO nanostructures, by MANDTM, and silica nanoparticles, by batch process - in which experimental conditions were tested and characterized. On aluminum two ZnO nanostructures were created by controlling temperature, flower-like shapes which dramatically reduced reflectance from ~ 65 % to ~ 4 % and chrysanthemum shapes which reduced reflectance down to ~ 0. 7 %. On silicon, pyramid shaped texture reduced reflectance and was used with and without a Ag nanoparticle seed layer as a substrate for ZnO nanostructures; the presence of a seed layer initiated a unique orzo nanostructured shape, which minimized anti-reflectance for silicon from 30. 8 % of polished silicon, 10. 6 % of textured silicon to 3. 4 % with the orzo structure. SiO₂ nanoparticles were deposited on glass and CR- 39 substrates with and without <b>hardcoat</b> material and {{it was found that the}} smallest produced SiO₂ nanoparticles gave the highest performance and that a very dilute layer of hard coat material followed by nanoparticle deposition, and again followed by a very dilute layer of hard coat material was successful in preserving the biomimic nanostructure of the film and producing a minimized reflectance of as low as 1 %, while maintaining a higher durability than commercially available products. Overall, these films achieved a minimization in reflectance and high durability...|$|E
40|$|The first {{approach}} utilises a {{thin film}} of acrylic that is moulded onto the outside of a polycarbonate substrate. It {{was found that the}} gate of the injection mould cavity must be of uniform cross section otherwise local shear heating can occur and melt the acrylic film. The injection gate must also be located entirely {{on one side of the}} mould cavity otherwise the film is punctured by the molten polycarbonate and free to float within the cavity. Any mixing of the two materials will lead to opaque components due the difference in the refractive indices. The film was found to improve the UV resistance of any component, acting as a protective buffer for the polycarbonate. A new variety of <b>hardcoat</b> was applied to film-backed samples to impart abrasion resistance and samples were found to outperform commercially available alternatives under recognised laboratory conditions. The film-backed samples also exhibited excellent impact resistance when impacted upon the film-face. However, similar components failed at extremely low energy levels when impacted from the non-film face because flaws in the acrylic film caused cracks to be initiated when the film was placed into tension. The level of adhesion between the film and the polycarbonate has been found to be critical and if the failure mechanism could be guaranteed, then intruder resistant glazing that could be broken from the inside in an emergency becomes a possibility. Such a product would address the identified consumer concern of being trapped in a vehicle. The second approach utilises simultaneous dual injection moulding (2 K), which has previously only been used to manufacture coloured components. A successful feasibility study was undertaken to demonstrate the concept of producing transparent components via such a process. This showed that much greater control is required for transparent applications otherwise the skin and core materials mix and opaque components are produced. The generally accepted academic principles associated with the process have been shown to be too simplistic and cannot be relied upon to guarantee good results. The ratio of viscosities of the skin and core materials appear to be more dominant than previously thought and the relative injection speeds of the two materials has a direct influence upon interfacial mixing and haze generation. It was also found that haze could be avoided if the refractive indices of the skin and core material were matched to within ± 0. 002, but this is impractical. A third area of research examined the feasibility of introducing structured glass fibres weaves into transparent components to improve rigidity. The study resulted in the construction of a transparent glass fibre pre-preg that could be moulded onto the outer surface of polycarbonate components. Flexural tests revealed that a single layer of glass fibre increased the flexural modulus of test samples by a factor of 3, whilst transparency and clarity were retained. Two patents have been filed as a direct result of this work...|$|E
