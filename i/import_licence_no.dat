50|$|In August 1966 the Gibbs' sought Government {{consent to}} obtain an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for their proposal. They {{proposed}} to build 3,000 cars per annum, with production commencing in mid-1968. Jack Marshall, was the then Minister of Trade and Industry, whose consent was sought. He declined their request {{on the grounds that}} New Zealand was suffering from falling export prices at the time, which was causing a balance of trade problem for the Government. Other established car manufacturers were having the <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> reduced and the granting of a licence to another manufacturer was seen as counter-productive.|$|R

5000|$|The weekly {{newspaper}} New Zealand Truth, {{in an article}} dated 24 March 1959, published {{a story about the}} allocation of <b>import</b> <b>licences,</b> which contained a quote by importer Harry Judd saying to a fellow importer: [...] "see Phil and Phil will fix it" [...] The [...] "Phil" [...] referred to was the Hon. Phil Holloway, the then-Minister for Industries and Commerce under Prime Minister Walter Nash during the Second Labour Government. Holloway was not happy with the innuendo that he was involved in issuing <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> in a questionable way, and sued the paper for defamation. The paper defended the matter on the basis of privilege, in publishing an article of national significance.|$|R

50|$|The project {{commenced}} in Autumn 1966 when Alan {{moved to}} Auckland {{to join with}} his brother Ian, owner of Anziel Limited, in the venture. The Gibbs' also needed an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the assembly plant, parts, and materials. Because of its use of fibreglass bodywork Reliant Motor Co of England was approached for a suitable design. This was to maximise the quantity of local product in the manufacture.|$|R

5000|$|The {{formation}} of Databank {{came at a}} time when computer systems were a scarce and expensive commodity in New Zealand, with the import of computers being restricted by the then government's prevailing highly regulatory economic policy. Computers could only be <b>imported</b> under <b>licence.</b> The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing cheque transaction volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion. The other, smaller banks were approaching the point where they would face a similar situation. However, the NBNZ (National Bank of New Zealand) {{was the only one that}} happened to have a computer <b>import</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Production {{began in}} an old flour store in Devon Street, New Plymouth. The aim was to make 120 {{machines}} a year, but demand was higher after a flurry of articles in magazines and newspapers about the bike. Some were sold to Borneo and the New Hebrides. [...] Problems soon arose with the government refusing to issue an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the engines and brake hubs. While negotiations continued between Callender and the government, Callender sent {{a photo of the}} bike along with Hillary, Mulgrave, and himself to Suzuki in Japan. Suzuki turned the photo into a giant poster on their Tokyo Motor Show stand along with a replica of the bike. In 1966 the government issued the <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> to allow enough parts to build the 120 bikes per year. By that time Callender had decided to sell the business to Motor Components of Waitara. Motor Components planned to sell 1,000 bikes per year, but by then Suzuki had commenced production of its own specialised machine. They in turn were followed by the other major Japanese motor cycle manufacturers. Production at the Waitara plant stopped in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of sales was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume {{for the whole}} year was estimated to reach about 400units. VAT employed about 200 workers {{at the time and}} changed to a four-day working week. The company blamed the government's <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> bureaucracy for the problemit was difficult to get diesel engines from abroad. In the following month, over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting diesel engines. The economy improved in 1959.|$|R

In May 1920, federal government regulators assigned this field the designation of Canada 's first licensed [...] "air harbour".

Although the 90 was identical to the Super Minx, the cheaper 80 featured a horizontal bar grille design.

40|$|This paper {{follows the}} work of H. Uzawa (1965) and R. E. Lucas (1988) by {{presenting}} an endogenous growth model with human capital accumulation as the engine of growth. Agents make time allocation decisions in an economy where quantitative restrictions are employed in the trade regime. Agents may allocate time to obtain valuable <b>import</b> <b>licences.</b> The effect of this activity on the growth rate {{is found to be}} dependent upon whether agents specialize in the rent-seeking activity. When agents do not specialize, the rent-seeking activity reduces growth by reducing the incentive to accumulate productive human capital. ...|$|R

50|$|After 1976, the zoo {{suffered}} from {{competition with the}} much larger Ocean Park. On 31 July 1993, the zoo was closed.

Most of the remaining animals were sent to Xili Lake Wild Animal Park (now called Safari Park Shenzhen) in Shenzhen.

40|$|This paper uses an overlapping-generations {{framework}} {{to model the}} allocation of <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> of intermediate goods according to firm capacity. It shows that this method of allocation encourages rent-seeking and also thereby improves welfare compared with a method that does not allow rent-seeking. A. O. Kreuger (1975, 1974) and J. N. Bhagwati and P. Desai (1970) describe how Turkey and India have allocated imports {{on the basis of}} firm capacity, which led to rent-seeking through overexpansion of capacity. J. N. Bhagwati and T.

Press censorship and petrol rationing were imposed, <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> were cancelled and emigration allowances were cut to £100. News of UDI was generally received calmly by the local citizenry, apart from some isolated incidents of passing cars being stoned in the black townships outside Bulawayo.

Baron, the younger brother of the scientist Jacob Bronowski, was arrested nine minutes after UDI was made.|$|R
50|$|The Morris Marina was {{a popular}} car on the New Zealand market, {{imported}} by the New Zealand Motor Corporation. Imports began with built-up British-sourced saloons and coupes (in 1.3- and 1.8-litre forms) in 1971. Local assembly of Australian-sourced (E-Series engines) models began in 1972 {{after the release of}} the Marinas there. Six-cylinder models were added in 1973. In 1974, before the termination of Leyland Australia's manufacturing operations, local assembly switched to British-sourced models again in saloon, estate, van and pick-up forms. Batches of fully built UK-sourced cars also came in 1973 and 1974 when the government allowed additional <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> due to the inability of local assembly plants to keep pace with demand for new cars.|$|R
