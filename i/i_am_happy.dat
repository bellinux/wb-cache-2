I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to San Clemente, California, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, La Casa Pacifica, Pat Nixon rarely appeared {{in public and}} only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> {{to tell you that}} I'm not gone—I mean, not really gone."

In one notable case, {{the owner of a}} funeral parlor refused to allow the family of Private Felix Longoria, a soldier killed in action in the Philippines, to use his facility because [...] "whites would not like it". Then-U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and Hector P. Garcia, the Mexican-American World War II veteran who founded the American G.I. Forum, intervened on Longoria's behalf. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, Congressman John Lyle, and President Truman's military aide Gen. Harry H. Vaughan joined the Longoria family for a full military burial with honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 16, 1949. Johnson stated of the incident, [...] "This injustice and prejudice is deplorable. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to have a part seeing that this Texas hero is laid to rest with the honor and dignity his service deserves." ...|$|E

500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|At the Giants Pérez {{hoped for}} a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about {{problems}} in the clubhouse, {{and it was no}} secret that the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City. Commented Pérez: [...] "I feel happy here. I like the National League. I was happy in Colorado and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> here." [...] Pérez hit [...]256 {{over the course of the}} 2003 season; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable. Although signed as a starter at second base, he quickly became backup to José Cruz, Jr., while he lost out at shortstop to Deivi Cruz. His batting average slumped to [...]232. He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou, but in the end he was the [...] "odd man out" [...] and the Giants released him on August 14, 2004. Almost immediately the Chicago Cubs signed Pérez to a minor-league contract.|$|E
500|$|It was in Socha Na Tha (2004) that Kukunoor noticed Ayesha Takia {{and until}} then he assumed {{her to be}} a glamor doll. After getting {{convinced}} about her acting skills, she was roped in for the character of Meera. Takia said that though her character emotionally drained her, it was not tough to portray and that she could learn a lot about life. She further said that, [...] "Dor was indeed an exciting challenge for the actor in me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> that it was also a very exciting role, which not many actors get to portray at such a young age." [...] She said that with Dor, she was not only in the film industry for glamor, but also for her acting prowess. While filming, Kukunoor bonded so well with Takia that he requested her to be his sister. Since she did not have a brother in real life, she got quite emotional with Kukunoor's brotherly proposal. This affection eventually solemnized {{in the form of a}} rakhi symbolically.|$|E

500|$|Only a few {{of those}} in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized {{collapsible}} boat B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; [...] "In no instance, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'." [...] Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached Collapsible boat A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.|$|E
500|$|The Tunnel {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated that while remakes are [...] "often underwhelming", The Tunnel was [...] "gripping stuff", {{and he believed}} that viewers [...] "should find plenty to enjoy" [...] in the series. The performances of Dillane and Poésy were also lauded. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent was positive in his assessment of the series, stating that [...] "as an avid fan of The Bridge, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to report that The Tunnel works well {{in its own right}} – it's intelligently made, well cast and ambitiously cinematic", adding that it had [...] "succeeded in its high-risk strategy of re-working a near-flawless Scandi-drama in our Anglo-French image". Ellen E Jones, also of The Independent, said that Dillane and Poésy's performances [...] "stuck closely" [...] to the original characterisation of the leads from the Scandinavian version. Of the execution, Jones stated: [...] "should you bother watching The Tunnel even if you've already seen the original? The early signs are good. The makers obviously have sense enough to preserve what was effective about the original, and invention enough to distinguish their work too." ...|$|E
500|$|Benfica {{began their}} {{season with the}} 2005 Super Cup, trying to win the trophy for the fourth time. On the 13 August, Benfica faced Vitória de Setúbal at the Estádio Algarve, winning 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. It was the first win in 15 years since 1989, {{breaking}} a five-time losing streak, all against Porto. Koeman praised his players, saying, [...] "We played very well. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> with the work I have done with my players". On 20 August, Benfica began their title defence with an away game at the Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. The home team, Académica, held the score to 0–0 and won a point against Benfica. After the match, Koeman said Benfica had struggled in Coimbra. On 26 August, Benfica {{took part in the}} draw for the group stage of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League; their first in the new century because they failed to qualify in the past two seasons. In 2005 the club ranked 57th in the UEFA coefficient, thus placing them on pot 4. They were drawn in Group D with Manchester United, Villarreal and Lille. The following day, Benfica hosted Gil Vicente for their final match in August. An unusual 3–4–3 formation did not work as planned; Benfica lost 2–0 and posted their worst league start since 1976–77. Koeman blamed anxiety in the players after Simão missed a penalty.|$|E

500|$|By 1792 Sophia and {{her sister}} Mary were being {{included}} in more family activities, and at age fourteen, Sophia debuted at court on her father's birthday, 4 June 1792. According to biographer Christopher Hibbert, in her young adulthood Sophia was a [...] "delightful though moody girl, pretty, delicate and passionate." [...] As within her childhood, Sophia was devoted to her father, though she occasionally found him exasperating. She wrote that [...] "the dear King is all kindness to me, and I cannot say how grateful I feel for it." [...] Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters {{that he would take}} them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, [...] "I cannot deny that I have never wished to see any of them marry: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> in their company, and do not in the least want a separation." [...] However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Sophia was aged eleven. Sophia remarked of her father's behaviour, [...] "He is all affection and kindness to me, but sometimes an over kindness, if you can understand that, which greatly alarms me." [...] Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared the subject, something which had always discomforted the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the queen, strained from her husband's illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.|$|E
500|$|President Obama said {{upon her}} death that [...] "Geraldine {{will forever be}} remembered as a {{trailblazer}} who broke down barriers for women, and Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life," [...] and said that his own two daughters would grow up in a more equal country because of what Ferraro had done. Mondale called her [...] "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [...] George H. W. Bush said, [...] "Though we were one-time political opponents, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> to say Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, {{not the least of which}} was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [...] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, [...] "She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women." [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, [...] "Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind – tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in – a New York icon and a true American original." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1840, Mary Shelley, Percy Florence (her one {{surviving}} child), {{and a few}} of his friends—George Defell, Julian Robinson, and Robert Leslie Ellis—began their European tour. They travelled to Paris {{and then}} to Metz. From there, they went down the Moselle by boat to Coblenz and then up the Rhine to Mainz, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Freiburg, Schaffhausen, Zürich, the Splügen, and Chiavenna. Feeling ill, Shelley rested at a spa in Baden-Baden; she had wracking pains in her head and [...] "convulsive shudders", symptoms of the meningioma that would eventually kill her. This stop dismayed Percy Florence and his friends, as it provided no entertainment for them; moreover, since none of them spoke German, the group was forced to remain together. After crossing Switzerland by carriage and railway, the group spent two months at Lake Como, where Mary relaxed and reminisced about how she and Percy had almost rented a villa with Lord Byron at the lake one summer. The group then travelled on to Milan, and from there, Percy Florence and his friends soon left for Cambridge to take their university finals. Mary Shelley remained, waiting for funds to complete her journey. In September, she returned to England via Geneva and Paris. Upon her return, she became depressed and could not write: [...] " [...] I might live – as once I lived—hoping—loving—aspiring enjoying... I am placid now, & the days go by – <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> in Percy [...] society & health – but no adjuncts... gild the quiet hours & dulness [...] creeps over my intellect". Despite this lethargy she managed to publish a second edition of Percy Shelley's prose and began working on another edition of his poetry.|$|E
