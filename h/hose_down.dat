2500|$|An {{estimated}} 30 local NKVD agents, {{guards and}} drivers were {{pressed into service}} to escort prisoners to the basement, confirm identification, then remove the bodies and <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> the blood after each execution. Although some of the executions were carried out by Senior Lieutenant of State Security Andrei Rubanov, Blokhin was the primary executioner and, true to his reputation, liked to work continuously and rapidly without interruption. In keeping with NKVD policy and the overall [...] "wet" [...] nature of the operation, the executions were conducted at night, starting at dark and continuing until just prior to dawn. [...] The bodies were continuously loaded onto covered flat-bed trucks through a back door in the execution chamber and trucked, twice a night, to Mednoye, where Blokhin had arranged for a bulldozer and two NKVD drivers to dispose of bodies at an unfenced site. Each night, 24–25 trenches, measuring eight to 10 meters (24.3 to 32.8 feet) total, were dug to hold that night's corpses, and each trench was covered up before dawn.|$|E
2500|$|Austin {{returned}} to WWE programming (appearing on Raw, ECW, and SmackDown!) in March 2007, partially {{to promote his}} starring role in the release of WWE Films' production, The Condemned. On March 31, 2007, Austin inducted Jim Ross into the WWE Hall of Fame. At WrestleMania 23, Austin, as a special guest referee, officiated the match between Bobby Lashley and Umaga. The stipulation for the match was that if Lashley lost, Donald Trump's head would be shaved, and if Umaga lost, Mr. McMahon's head would suffer that fate. During the match, Austin delivered Stone Cold Stunners to Umaga, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon and Donald Trump. Lashley won the match and Trump, Austin and Lashley then shaved Mr. McMahon's head. Austin ended by hitting the Stone Cold Stunner on McMahon, as well as Donald Trump. He then appeared in a video on the June 11 episode of Raw as part of [...] "Mr. McMahon's Appreciation Night", where he shared his thoughts on his past feuds with McMahon. Austin appeared on the August 18, 2007 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, as a possible illegitimate child of Mr. McMahon and stunned McMahon and Jonathan Coachman. He then appeared at SummerSlam to aide Matt Hardy in battling Montel Vontavious Porter in a Beer Drinking Contest. The match ended in a no contest after Austin handed a beer to MVP {{and gave him the}} Stone Cold Stunner. Austin made another appearance at Cyber Sunday, where he guest refereed a World Heavyweight Championship match between Batista and The Undertaker, which Batista won. On the November 5 episode of Raw, Austin made an appearance to confront Santino Marella for criticizing The Condemned. The argument ended as Marella received a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin, who then walked backstage only to return with a Budweiser beer truck to <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> Marella and his valet Maria with beer. On the Raw 15th Anniversary special, Austin returned after Vince McMahon was attacked by Mankind and the Undertaker. Shortly after, McMahon received a Stone Cold Stunner and Austin called out all WWE stars in attendance to the ring to celebrate the 15th anniversary of Raw. The show closed as Austin, Triple H and Hornswoggle poured beer on McMahon, who was knocked out outside the ring.|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAREST COLVIN,--I was sharply ill at Sydney, cut off, {{right out}} of bed, in this steamer on a fresh island cruise, and have already reaped the benefit.

50|$|In some animals, {{a failure}} to burp {{successfully}} can be fatal. This is particularly common among domesticated ruminants that are allowed to gorge themselves on very rich spring clover or alfalfa. The condition, known as ruminal tympany, is a high pressure buildup of gas in the stomach(s) and requires immediate treatment to expel the gas, usually the insertion of a flexible rubber <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> the esophagus, or in extreme cases the lancing of the animal's side with a trochar and cannula.|$|E

50|$|This {{argument}} is logically valid, but quite demonstrably wrong, because its first premise is false - one could <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> the streets, the local river could have flooded, etc. A simple logical analysis will {{not reveal the}} error in this argument, since that analysis must accept {{the truth of the}} argument's premises. For this reason, an argument based on false premises can be much more difficult to refute, or even discuss, than one featuring a normal logical error, as the truth of its premises must be established to the satisfaction of all parties.|$|E

5000|$|The term hoser, {{popularized by}} Bob & Doug McKenzie, {{typically}} {{refers to an}} uncouth, beer-swilling male and is a euphemism for [...] "loser" [...] coming from the earlier days of hockey played on an outdoor rink and the losing team would have to <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> the ice after the game so it refreezes smooth.

The Lanyon Homestead was not impacted by fire, though it did come under ember attack. A single fire truck was on hand to <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> and protect the historic homestead.

5000|$|A popular origin story {{holds that}} in outdoor ice hockey before ice resurfacers, the losing {{team in a}} hockey game would have to <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> the rink after a game to make the ice smooth again. Thus the term hoser was synonymous with loser. Another {{suggestion}} for {{the origin of the}} term involves farmers of the Canadian prairies who would siphon gasoline from farming vehicles with a hose during the Great Depression of the 1930s. [...] "Hosed" [...] is also a euphemism for drunkenness in Canadian English, and by extension a hoser is one who is drunk.|$|E

The fire company that both men were assigned to was the first to arrive at the scene. Firefighters then rushed in the building to rescue residents from the upper floors while Walsh and Kennedy ran with a <b>hose</b> <b>down</b> to the basement, where the fire was believed to have originated.
