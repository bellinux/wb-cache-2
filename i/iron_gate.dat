The Man then locates the woman's room, though is devastated when he discovers that The Brute had already killed her.|$|E

5|$|The Upper Klamath Basin, {{defined by}} the {{drainage}} area of the Klamath River above <b>Iron</b> <b>Gate</b> Dam, is a unique transitional area between the Cascade Range {{to the west and}} the Basin and Range Province of the northern Great Basin to the southeast. This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath Lake basins. Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions. Almost the entire basin is a graben region, bearing basin and range characteristics, formed by uplifting and subsidence along several north–south faults.|$|E
5|$|The north choir aisle has a stone screen by R.C.Hussey and an <b>iron</b> <b>gate</b> dated 1558 {{that came}} from Guadalajara. At {{the east end of}} the aisle is the chapel of St Werburgh which has a vault of two bays, and an east window {{depicting}} the Nativity by Michael O'Connor, dated 1857. Other stained glass windows in the north aisle are by William Wailes, by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and by Clayton and Bell. The chapel contains a piscina dating from the 14thcentury, and monuments to Bishop Graham dated 1867, and to William Bispham who died in 1685, Other monuments in the north aisle include a tablet to Bishop Jacobson, dated 1887, by Boehm to a design by Blomfield.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. They were {{part of a group of}} about 40 people that had made a dash for an <b>iron</b> <b>gate</b> that had been left open. After this breach, stand-by officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people had turned up to protest against Griffin.|$|E

5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is both large and well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the <b>Iron</b> <b>Gate</b> gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 he {{designed}} a funerary chapel for the Güell {{family at the}} abbey of Montserrat, but {{little is known about}} this work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the Bodegas Güell, the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi Güell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 under the direction of Francesc Berenguer, Gaudí's aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join them to an older building. It has three floors: the bottom one for a garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter's lodge, notable for the <b>iron</b> <b>gate</b> {{in the shape of a}} fishing net.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi Güell between 1884 and 1887, the Güell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now {{on the outskirts of}} Barcelona. Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an <b>iron</b> <b>gate</b> in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E

5|$|This {{success was}} {{followed}} however by the rebellion {{in the autumn}} of 709 of much of Lower Tokharistan under Nizak of Badhgis, {{with the support of the}} principalities of Yalqan and Faryab, and the city of Balkh. In an effort to raise the entire region in revolt, Nizak also forced the nominal suzerain of Tokharistan, the Yabghu, to join the uprising. The year was too advanced for a direct confrontation and the Muslim levy-based army mostly disbanded, but Qutayba ordered his brother Abd al-Rahman to take the garrison of Merv, some 12,000 men, and head to Balkh to secure the Muslim position there. This move proved effective in discouraging the rebellion of more local princes, and in spring, Abd al-Rahman was able to re-establish Muslim control over Tokharistan almost without bloodshed. Most of the rebel rulers fled or capitulated, and finally, Nizak was captured and executed on al-Hajjaj's orders, despite promises of pardon, while the Yabghu was exiled to Damascus and kept there as a hostage. Tokharistan was more firmly incorporated into the Caliphate, as Arab district representatives were appointed alongside the local princes, who were gradually relegated to secondary positions. Qutayba's brother Abd al-Rahman ibn Muslim was installed with a garrison near Balkh to oversee the affairs of the province. Despite the swift end of Nizak's revolt, the king of Shuman and Akharun decided to rebel as well. Qutayba led his forces against him, besieged his citadel and took it. The king fell in battle, and his supporters were executed. Qutayba then marched west over the <b>Iron</b> <b>Gate,</b> taking Kish and Nasaf and visiting Bukhara, where he settled relations between the Arabs and the locals, installed the young Sogdian prince Tughshada in the position of Bukhar Khudah and established an Arab military colony in the city. Later, in 712/713, Qutayba built a mosque in the city's citadel, but although the Arab authorities encouraged the conversion of the native population by paying them to attend prayers, Islamization proceeded slowly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the management and}} administration {{of one of the}} largest, beautiful and complex natural parks from Romania, the <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Natural Park. The management plan is a frame of integration of the biodiversity conservation problems and protection of the natural and cultural environment that also supports socio-economic development of <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Natural Park. It is also an instrument of dialog between the institutions which coordinate this area. The management plan is a document approved by H. G 1048 / 2013 and it resulted after consulting the interested factors of the area (city halls, local and central authorities, civil society). The administration of <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Natural Park has a new structure, founded in 2003 and is working as a subunit of Forest-National Administration (Romsilva), which assures the necessary personal and equipment for administrating the area. The area has the status of: Natural Park, Natura 2000 and Ramsar site. The forest represents 65 % of the total area, 98 % being a state property. Analysing <b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Natural Park documents (<b>Iron</b> <b>Gates</b> Natural Park management plan, scientific council and park administration documents, visits and observations within park), we can conclude that the park has a good administration leaded by the scientific councils, who also achieved many successful European projects...|$|R
