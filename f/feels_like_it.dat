He wrote, [...] "Some parts of it feel dated, but the web {{features}} even more ill-informed opinions today than it did nine years ago, {{so much of it}} remains timeless and on target." [...] However, he was critical of the episode's third act. [...] "The side of the show <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was intended to amuse a few fans and it doesn’t show a lot of real cleverness or wit", he wrote. He summarized the episode as being decent, but inconsistent.|$|E

500|$|BBC America {{signed on}} to provide co-production funding in March 2006. The {{producers}} regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. Cameron's assistant took notes from these conversations, after which they would look over the notes and start the process again. The producers invited Moffat to [...] "write anything", {{with the intention of}} cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego.

500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] in {{his list}} of the album's top four tracks. Although J. Edward Keyes of Newsday {{described}} the track as [...] "exuberant", he was critical of its placement on the album: [...] "The production, courtesy of the reliable Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, feels boilerplate at best. At 17 songs, the record is far too long, {{and by the time}} the exuberant 'Up Out My Face' arrives, it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was grafted on from a better record." [...] Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that Carey lacked conviction in her approach to the song, writing that despite its aggressive tone, [...] "restraint stops serving her agenda".|$|E

500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage onto one of the drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when he <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think, 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the success of Frozen, {{director}} Chris Buck stated: [...] "We never expected anything like this. We just hoped {{to make a movie}} that did as well as Tangled! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this." [...] He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: [...] "There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen and I like to do– we essentially create two imperfect princesses." [...] As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: [...] "It’s just a remarkable thing. Usually you do a project and it has its moment. This just <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> keeps going." ...|$|E
500|$|The film is {{primarily}} presented {{from the perspective}} of the character Dax and his camera, but Nourizadeh also obtained footage by providing the cast and extras with recording devices such as BlackBerrys and iPhones to capture events occurring outside of the perspective or knowledge of the cameraman. This resulted in hours of unusable footage that had to be observed by Nourizadeh and his team to find segments that could be incorporated into the final film. Nourizadeh stated [...] "when you have real material being shot by real people, it then kind of <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is. It is found footage. I hated spending 10 hours looking through bits of flip footage – people didn’t press stop, it's like in their pockets. But yeah, it was great, man." [...] Other footage was provided from fictional police and news cameras to give a different perspective on the events.|$|E

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] {{garnered}} {{a positive}} response from music critics. Nick Levine for Digital Spy described the track as [...] "unexpected" [...] due to its urban edge. Sarah Rodman for The Boston Globe wrote it was a [...] "contender" [...] to be released as a single because of how it {{is a mix of}} [...] "classic and au courant" [...] music. Linda McGee for RTÉ was complimentary of Lewis decision to experiment with the song instead of taking a [...] "slushy ballad" [...] approach and remaining in her comfort zone. She continued to write that {{it is for this reason}} that she is more suited to [...] "the Beyoncé end of the market than the Mariah end." [...] Kitty Empire for The Guardian noted that all of the songs on Spirit are love songs, but only [...] "Take a Bow" [...] <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is from the 21st century.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from The Onions The A.V.

The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plot’s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter about finding a new place for them to live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astrid—and really not discovering much, except that she doesn’t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astrid’s underused yet again, even in an episode where she gets a lot of lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E

500|$|Messick {{said they}} {{designed}} [...] "a fairy tale, mythological fantasy world" [...] that <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> happened {{long time ago}} but is not set in any particular time period. Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel and look like they could fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ron and Tammy" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Troy Miller. The episode featured comedian and actress Megan Mullally in a guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy. Mullally is the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived {{the idea for the}} story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table out of the wall after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her. The scene was used in the final episode. Offerman said of filming the diner scenes, [...] "At the end of doing that for a few hours, we said, you know that <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was five weeks worth of really good therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|Though much of {{his work}} was made public only years later, Charles Ives had been {{exploring}} the possibilities of the tone cluster—which he {{referred to as the}} [...] "group chord"—for some time. In 1906–7, Ives composed his first mature piece to extensively feature tone clusters, Scherzo: Over the Pavements. Orchestrated for a nine-piece ensemble, it includes both black- and white-note clusters for the piano. Revised in 1913, it would not be recorded and published until the 1950s and would have to wait until 1963 to receive its first public performance. During the same period that Ornstein was introducing tone clusters to the concert stage, Ives was developing a piece with what would become the most famous set of clusters: in the second movement, [...] "Hawthorne," [...] of the Concord Sonata ( [...] 1904–15, publ. 1920, prem. 1928, rev. 1947), mammoth piano chords require a wooden bar almost fifteen inches long to play. The gentle clusters produced by the felt- or flannel-covered bar represent the sound of far-off church bells (...) [...] Later in the movement, there are a series of five-note diatonic clusters for the right hand. In his notes to the score, Ives indicates that [...] "these group-chords...may, if the player <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> be hit with the clenched fist." [...] Between 1911 and 1913, Ives also wrote ensemble pieces with tone clusters such as his Second String Quartet and the orchestral Decoration Day and Fourth of July, though none of these would be publicly performed before the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|His next film, {{entitled}} How Do You Know, {{was released}} December 17, 2010; Brooks produced, directed and wrote it. The film stars Reese Witherspoon {{as a professional}} softball player involved in a love triangle. Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film he also became interested in [...] "the dilemmas of contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they {{may not even be}} aware." [...] He created Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson's characters for this concept. Filming finished in November 2009, although Brooks later reshot the film's opening and ending. The New York Times described it as [...] "perhaps the most closely guarded of Columbia's movies this year." [...] Brooks was paid $10 million for the project, which cost $100 million. The film was negatively received. Patrick Goldstein wrote in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "the characters were stick figures, the jokes were flat, the situations felt scarily insular." [...] He felt the film showed Brooks had [...] "finally lost his comic mojo" [...] concluding [...] "his films used to have a wonderfully restless, neurotic energy, but How Do You Know <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was phoned in from someone resting uncomfortably on his laurels." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge also felt the film showed Brooks had lost his [...] "spark". Richard Corliss of Time was more positive, writing [...] "without being great, it's still the flat-out finest romantic comedy of the year," [...] while [...] "Brooks hasn't lost his gift for dreaming up heroes and heroines who worry amusingly." ...|$|E
500|$|Carolyn Menyes of Music Times complimented the song's time {{signature}} {{for adding}} [...] "a {{bit of a}} waltz flavor, channeling the old school Ariana that fans first fell in love with", adding that [...] "a sultry, distorted guitar line and Grande's passionate, soaring vocals add a sense of texture and modernity that makes 'Dangerous Woman' feel as powerful as the title." [...] A writer of NME felt that Grande [...] "shows herself as someone who continues to be determined to challenge the norm." [...] The publication as well pointed out that [...] " [...] does sound empowered, even if it doesn't sound especially dangerous {{for her in the}} wake of her 2014 collaboration 'Love Me Harder' with The Weeknd." [...] Writing for Idolator, Robbie Daw, Carl Williot and Mike Wass reviewed [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] during their [...] "Pop Perspective" [...] article, with Daw calling it [...] "one walk of danger worth taking", Williot praising her vocal performance and highlighting the [...] "clever little flip of '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman'", and Wass naming it a [...] "decent song" [...] but noting that [...] " [...] still hasn't found her own lane." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy praised Grande's vocals, describing as [...] "angelic" [...] and completed writing it [...] "almost sound too pure over the seductive guitar line and prowling beat, which threatens to blindfold you and tie up your wrists within one listen.". Reviewing the album with the same name, the editor from Sputnikmusic described the song as [...] "the first moment that the album really shows flashes of becoming something special," [...] and continued, [...] "as it sways to a seductive beat that <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was extrapolated from the most revealing scene of a James Bond film." [...] Quinn Maryland of Pitchfork shared similar opinion, the reviewer described it as [...] "a slinky, empowered, Bond theme of a belter;" ...|$|E

Bertschy also criticizes the character design of {{the girls in the}} show as [...] "ridiculously-endowed heroines" [...] with [...] "cartoon bombshell bodies" [...] that are [...] "tiresome and <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was written by a 13-year old." ...|$|E
