50|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} is {{the process}} of burning a fuel using pure oxygen instead of air as the primary oxidant. Since the nitrogen component of air is not heated, fuel consumption is reduced, and higher <b>flame</b> <b>temperatures</b> are possible. Historically, the primary use of oxy-fuel combustion has been in welding and cutting of metals, especially steel, since oxy-fuel allows for higher <b>flame</b> <b>temperatures</b> than can be achieved with an air-fuel flame.|$|R
25|$|Ammonia is {{sometimes}} proposed {{as a practical}} alternative to fossil fuel for internal combustion engines. Its high octane rating of 120 and low <b>flame</b> <b>temperature</b> allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production.

25|$|In daily life, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of flames one encounters are those of organic compounds including wood, wax, fat, common plastics, propane, and gasoline. The constant-pressure adiabatic <b>flame</b> <b>temperature</b> of such substances in air is in a relatively narrow range around 1950°C. This is because, in terms of stoichiometry, the combustion of an organic compound with n carbons involves breaking roughly 2n C–H bonds, n C–C bonds, and 1.5n O2 bonds to form roughly n CO2 molecules and n H2O molecules.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen has a clean {{flame and}} {{is good for}} use on aluminium. It can be used at a higher {{pressure}} than acetylene and is therefore useful for underwater welding and cutting. It is a good type of flame to use when heating large amounts of material. The <b>flame</b> <b>temperature</b> is high, about 2,000°C for hydrogen gas in air at atmospheric pressure, and up to 2800°C when pre-mixed in a 2:1 ratio with pure oxygen (oxyhydrogen).

Because of its low <b>flame</b> <b>temperature</b> when burnt in free air, the risk is lower should the performer come in contact with the flame. Kerosene is generally not recommended as fuel for indoor fire dancing, as it produces an unpleasant (to some) odor, which becomes poisonous in sufficient concentration. Ethanol was sometimes used instead, but the flames it produces look less impressive, and its lower flash point poses a high risk.|$|E
500|$|Most thorium {{applications}} use its dioxide (sometimes called [...] "thoria" [...] in the industry), {{rather than}} the metal. This compound has a melting point of 3300°C (6000°F), the highest of all known oxides; only a few substances have higher melting points. This helps the compound remain solid in a flame, and it considerably increases {{the brightness of the}} flame; this is the main reason thorium is used in gas mantles. All substances emit energy (glow) at high temperatures, but the light emitted by thorium is nearly all in the visible spectrum, hence the brightness of thorium mantles. Energy, some of it in the form of visible light, is emitted when thorium is exposed to a source of energy itself, such as a cathode ray, heat or ultraviolet light. This effect is shared by cerium dioxide, which converts ultraviolet light into visible light more efficiently, but thorium dioxide gives a higher <b>flame</b> <b>temperature,</b> emitting less infrared light. Thorium in mantles, though still common, has been progressively replaced with yttrium since the late 1990s.

A mixture of coal and torrefied biomass was used as fuel in the experiments. Radiative intensity, gas composition, temperature and particle concentration were measured along the diameter in the flame. The radiation model treats the furnace as an axisymmetric and infinitely long cylinder. The gas properties are calculated with a statistical narrow-band model while the particle properties are calculated with Mie theory. The radiative heat transfer, peak <b>flame</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the influence from different parameters using sensitivity analyses are studied. It is shown that the total radiation is dominated by the contribution of particles, hence the total radiation is sensitive to changes in the particle concentration and size distribution. It was also possible to estimate the peak <b>flame</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and conclude that more accurate temperature and particle measurements are needed in future work...|$|R
