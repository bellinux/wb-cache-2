5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technologies.</b> Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> has {{increased}} in the society, and {{can be useful in}} nursing care. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe district nurses' attitudes regarding the implementation of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing. The first and third authors performed five focus group discussions with 19 district nurses' from five primary healthcare centres in northern Sweden. During the focus group discussions, the following topics were discussed: the current and future use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing; expectations, advantages, disadvantages and hindrances in the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing; and the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> from an ethical perspective. The transcribed focus group discussions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that district nurses' attitudes were positive regarding the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in their work. They also asked for possibilities to influence the design and its introduction. However, the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home nursing can be described as a complement to communication that could not replace human physical encounters. Improvements and risks, as well as the importance of physical presence in home nursing were considered vital. The results revealed that the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> requires changes in the district nurses' work situation.

Major employers are the National Health Service, the city's two universities, and the Bath and North East Somerset Council, as well as the Ministry of Defence although a number of MOD offices formerly in Bath have recently moved to Bristol. Growing employment sectors include <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technologies</b> and creative and cultural industries where Bath is one of the recognised national centres for publishing, with the magazine and digital publisher Future plc employing around 650 people.

Followed by a short historical overview of the application of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in educational processes. In the empirical part the results of the research are presented, which I conducted in the elementary school with pupils from sixth grade in home economics class. Pedagogical experiment lasted fourteen days, pupils were split into two groups – the control and the experimental group. In the control group they were repeating the home economics subject matter using the worksheet, and in the experimental group they were solving a quiz, which was accessible on the internet. My purpose was to find out what students think about the usage of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> for teaching, <b>and</b> whether they consider classes more interesting, if we put it in the teaching process. I also tried to determine whether the pupils repeating the subject matter with the help of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> will better remember the subject matter. I found that pupils, who repeated the subject matter in home economics with the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology,</b> achieved a better result in the examination, and also remembered the subject matter better. In integrating <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home economics class it is necessary to be aware that the pupils wish to use <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> more frequently, <b>and</b> that they find teaching with the help of computer in home economics class more interesting than frontal methods of teaching. Therefore, the integration of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> in home economics class makes sense. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This paper {{profiles}} a {{study that}} explored nursing students’ <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> competence <b>and</b> confidence. It presents selected findings that focus on students’ attitudes towards <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> as an educational methodology and their perceptions of its relevance to clinical practice. Background: <b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> is integral to contemporary nursing practice. Development of these skills is important to ensure that graduates are ‘work ready’ and adequately prepared to practice in increasingly technological healthcare environments. Methods: This was a mixed methods study. Students (n = 971) from three Australian universities were surveyed using an instrument designed specifically for the study, and 24 students participated in focus groups. Findings: The focus group data revealed {{that a number of}} students were resistant to the use of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> as an educational methodology and lacked the requisite skills and confidence to engage successfully with this educational approach. Survey results indicated that 26 per cent of students were unsure about the relevance of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> to clinical practice and only 50 per cent felt ’very confident’ using a computer. Conclusion: While the importance of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> to student’s learning and to their preparedness for practice has been established, it is evident that students’ motivation is influenced by their level of confidence and competence, and their understanding of the relevance of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> to their future careers...|$|R
