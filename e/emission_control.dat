5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} lubricating greases, paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
25|$|The {{concerns}} over {{the health effects of}} dioxin and furan emissions have been significantly lessened by advances in <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> designs and very stringent new governmental regulations that have resulted in large reductions in the amount of dioxins and furans emissions.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the legal {{difficulties}} faced by several cities to implement policies to replace existing taxi fleets with hybrids and other clean fuel vehicles, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Jerrold Nadler, both from New York, introduced the Green Taxis Act in September 2009. The proposed Green Taxi Act would modified federal law to allow local governments to improve the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> and fuel economy standards of their taxi cabs. Senator Gillibran is planning to reintroduce the legislation in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Bluebird 810 {{was sold}} in export markets as the Datsun 160B, Datsun 180B, Datsun 200B and Datsun 810. Australian {{magazine}} Wheels called the 200B 'a 180B with 20 more mistakes.' In Japan the range gradually received upgraded motors which could pass the 1978 emissions standards; these models carry 811 series chassis numbers, with Japanese market vehicles were installed with a NAPS badge on the rear deckled that identified <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> technology having been installed. This process began in October 1977 and continued until August 1978. This meant replacing the earlier L-series engines with the new crossflow Z engines, based on the L.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel {{can be used}} in any {{diesel engine}} when mixed with mineral diesel. In some countries, {{manufacturers}} cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although Volkswagen of Germany, for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100. B100 may become more viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use 'Viton' (by DuPont) synthetic rubber in their mechanical fuel injection systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> protocol available for biodiesel before this date.|$|E

25|$|Spirits were marketed in Mexico. They were badged as Chryslers {{rather than}} Dodges, since the Dodge brand {{at the time}} was used only on trucks. The Spirit was {{introduced}} in the Mexican market for 1990, one year after its début in the U.S. and Canada. The 1990-1991 Mexican versions were equipped with the U.S. market Plymouth Acclaim tail lights. The initial 1990-model Spirits used a version of the 2.5L engine operating on leaded gasoline, equipped with a carburetor, a tubular exhaust header, and electronic control of ignition timing. This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler's U.S.-market Lean Burn <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> systems of the late-1970s.|$|E
25|$|The ADR 79/01 vehicle {{standard}} (Australian Design Rule 79/01 – <b>Emission</b> <b>Control</b> for Light Vehicles, 2005) is the Australian {{equivalent of}} OBD-II. It {{applies to all}} vehicles of category M1 and N1 with a gross Vehicle Weight rating of 3500kg or less, registered from new within Australia and produced since January 1, 2006 for petrol (gasoline) engined cars and since January 1, 2007 for diesel engined cars. For newly introduced models, the regulation dates applied a year earlier – January 1, 2005 for petrol and January 1, 2006 for diesel. The ADR 79/01 standard was supplemented by the ADR 79/02 standard which imposed tighter emissions restrictions, applicable to all vehicles of class M1 and N1 with a {{gross vehicle weight rating}} of 3500kg or less, from July 1, 2008 for new models, July 1, 2010 for all models. The technical implementation of this standard is essentially the same as OBD-II, with the same SAE J1962 diagnostic link connector and signal protocols being used.|$|E
25|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve environmental conditions and to safeguard the environment, the Federal <b>Emission</b> <b>Control</b> Law established the basis for taking of legal action against those responsible for excessive noise and air pollution, the Works’ Constitution Act and Personnel Representation Act strengthened the position of individual employees in offices and factories, and the Works’ Safety Law required firms to employ safety specialists and doctors. An amendment to the Labour Management Act (1971) granted workers co-determination {{on the shop floor}} while the new Factory Management Law (1972) extended co-determination at the factory level. This Act acknowledged {{for the first time the}} presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils. A law was passed in 1974 allowing for worker representation on the boards of large firms, although this change was not enacted until 1976, after alterations were made. In 1974, redundancy allowances in cases of bankruptcies were introduced. The Federal Law on Personnel Representation, which came into force in April 1974, gave increased co-management rights to those employed in factories and offices in the public sector. The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.|$|E

500|$|In December 2015, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport {{announced}} plans to introduce congestion charges in 2016. According to city's motor vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> plan 2013–2017, the congestion charge will be a real-time variable pricing scheme based on actual traffic flows and emissions data, and allow the fee to be charged for different vehicles and varying by {{time of the day}} and for different districts. The Dongcheng and Xicheng are among the districts that are most likely to firstly implement congestion charge. Vehicle emissions account for 31% of the city's smog sources, according to Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau. The local government has implemented already several policies to address air quality and congestion, such as a driving restriction scheme based upon the last digits on their license plates. Also a vehicle quota system was introduced in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units set by the city authority for 2017. In May 2016, the Beijing city legislature announced it will consider to start levying traffic congestion charges by 2020 as part of a package of measures to reform the vehicle quota system. [...] , the city's environmental and transport departments are working together on a congestion pricing proposal.|$|E
