40|$|A first {{space vehicle}} is {{attached}} {{with a second}} space vehicle which includes a rocket propulsion nozzle having a combustion chamber upstream from the nozzle throat. Apparatus 10 includes an elongate <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> 12 extending from the first space vehicle, a pair of inflatable bladders 16, 18 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> for engaging an inner surface of the combustion chamber upon inflation. {{and a pair of}} rear bladders 20, 22 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> for engaging an inner surface of the nozzle downstream from the combustion chamber upon inflation for aligning the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. A pressurized fluid source 24 is provided on the first space vehicle for supplying fluid pressure to the inflatable bladders. and a fluid control valve manifold 30 selectively controls the release of pressurized fluid to the bladders. According to the method of the invention. the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> is inserted into the rocket propulsion nozzle. and the control valves are actuated to first inflate the front bladders and thereby interconnect the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. The rear bladders are subsequently inflated to align a central axis of the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> with a central axis of the rocket propulsion nozzle. Inflation of the rear bladders provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front bladders. Attaching the vehicles in space may be controlled from the earth by activating the control valves to inflate the bladders. The cost of attaching space vehicles is significantly reduced by attaching a <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> on one vehicle with the existing rocket propulsion nozzle of another vehicle...|$|R

30|$|In a {{heterogeneous}} environment {{it is important}} to differentiate the problem of packet routing from the problem of optimal access network selection, which has already been extensively studied in the literature [1 – 7]. These studies consider the case where end-users are directly covered by several <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> and decisions should be made to select the most appropriate <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> for receiving service. However, in a more general case an end-user may not be directly covered by any <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> or even if an <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> is available in a single hop, other alternate <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> could still be preferred. In this case, it is necessary to employ a reliable, robust, and efficient routing protocol that finds the most appropriate <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> in a larger neighborhood and forwards the packets between the end-user and the <b>attachment</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
30|$|When an <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> {{receives}} a request packet, it acquires the packet forwarding {{prices of the}} vehicles which are registered with the <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> of other service providers. For this purpose, the <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> queries their corresponding AAA servers for the prices of packet forwarding by the registered vehicles. As a result, if the requester selects to use the route comprising those vehicles for packet forwarding, the AAA servers charge the <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> instead of the registered packet forwarding vehicles. The <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> in turn charges the requester. Note that the communications {{to and from the}} AAA servers take place on the core network via the Internet. Other than the cost of packet forwarding over the registered vehicles, the <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> also charges the requester for the service it requests, i.e., the service cost.|$|R

In some existing implementations this property is used to automatically (as opposed to through configuration) add or remove <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> for dual-homed technologies such as rings to maintain optimum packet flow between a nonparticipating ring protocol and the IEEE 802.1aq network by activating a secondary <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> and deactivating a primary <b>attachment</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

30|$|If {{the request}} packet is {{received}} {{by more than}} one <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> and (or) the same <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> receives the request packet from different intermediate nodes, more than one routes exist and the most appropriate one must be selected. For this purpose, two approaches are possible: centralized and distributed. In the centralized approach a route selection center is included in the topology to which all the <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> forward their received request packets. The center then selects the most appropriate route according to a route selection logic and generates a reply packet containing the selected route to be sent back to the requester. In the distributed approach, every <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> generates a reply packet and sends it back and {{it is up to the}} requester to select the most appropriate route based on the route selection logic. Note that every <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> also has a unique IP address known to the core network. This IP address is included in the reply packet to start a unicast connection between the <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> and the requester.|$|R

30|$|Any {{end-user}} {{wishing to}} establish a connection with an <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> generates a request packet and broadcasts it in the network using all of its available radios, e.g., simultaneous over its WLAN and WiMAX radios if it is so equipped. Any intermediate vehicle that receives the request packet rebroadcasts it on all of its available radios no matter which radio the packet was received on until an <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> receives the request packet. Since the potential recipients of request packets could be any of the available <b>attachment</b> <b>points,</b> {{the use of an}} anycasting mechanism is inevitable. In anycasting the same IP address is shared among all <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> in the network for addressing request packets. This IP address translates into the same ID for all the <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> to which the request packets are destined. In this article, to mitigate packet flooding effect we employ several methods to limit the propagation of request packets in the network. One way is to restrict the propagation of request packets to a limited geographical area. Other methods are detailed in Section 4. Note that for wireless technologies which do not support ad hoc networking, e.g., cellular network, the request packets are directly forwarded by the onboard radio to the corresponding <b>attachment</b> <b>point.</b> The radio cannot be used at that point if the vehicle is not within the coverage area of any <b>attachment</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

30|$|Ad hoc {{networking}} in {{a heterogeneous}} setting can be advantageous when vehicles {{are not covered}} by any <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> or in the case where desirable access networks are available but are out of range. Eventhough only a few papers in the literature have studied the possibility of ad hoc networking in a heterogeneous environment [3], these articles employ ad hoc networking only as a means for forwarding data to the <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> that are pre-selected. In our topology we consider ad hoc communications as an independent connectivity alternative which enables us to take the appropriateness of both the possible multi-hop routes and the <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> into account as opposed to only the <b>attachment</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{to choose the}} graft diameter <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> of each bundle {{has not yet been}} determined since they are usually dependent on a surgeon’s preference. Therefore, the influence of bundle diameters and <b>attachment</b> <b>points</b> on the kinematics of the knee joint needs to be quantitatively analyzed. A three-dimensional knee model was reconstructed with computed tomography images of a 26 -year-old man. Based on the model, models of double bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction were developed. The anterior tibial translations for the anterior drawer test and the internal tibial rotation for the pivot shift test were investigated according to variation of bundle diameters and <b>attachment</b> <b>points.</b> For the model in this study, the knee kinematics after the double bundle ACL reconstruction were dependent on the <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> and not much influenced by the bundle diameter although larger sized anterior-medial bundles provided increased stability in the knee joint. Therefore, in the clinical setting, the bundle <b>attachment</b> <b>point</b> needs to be considered prior to the bundle diameter, and the current selection method of graft diameters for both bundles appears justified...|$|R
