5|$|However, {{interviews}} with the two of the voice actors have given a glimpse into small parts of the development process. An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of Jim Raynor in all released StarCraft games to date, has revealed {{that for the most}} part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to <b>four</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>a</b> fact mirrored in a similar interview with Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell. Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of <b>four</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>a</b> series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces {{with an opportunity to}} inflict heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. In stark contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E

Then, an emissary {{came out with a}} white flag to negotiate the terms of the fort’s surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated {{at the beginning of the}} month at Patras. He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage. The aghas submitted. However, the fortress’ resistance had cost 25 men, killed or wounded in the French expedition.|$|E
5|$|Eguchi and Matsueda {{are noted}} for {{creating}} mainly jazzy and electronic tracks for the scores they have collaborated on; Eguchi is credited {{for most of}} the electronic music. The soundtrack to The Bouncer, of which Eguchi and Matsueda co-composed a lot of the pieces, featured among other genres rock, electronica, and jazz fusion. A professional pianist, Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions. He has stated that {{most of the time he}} composes and arranges music is at his home studio, where his friends help out by recording acoustic instruments; if the quality of these recordings are not adequate, however, Eguchi replaces them at the company's studio. He has said that by the time he is finished creating the music, he is only sleeping three to <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> week.|$|E

The passengers were subjected to attempts at indoctrination for up to <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day. The South Korean police initially suspected that the co-pilot conspired with two North Korean agents in the hijacking. The night after the hijacking, 100,000 South Koreans held a mass rally in freezing weather to protest the hijacking, and burned an effigy of Kim Il-sung.|$|E
25|$|At Nalanda, a Buddhist university, <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day {{and four}} hours at night were {{measured}} by a water clock, which consisted of a copper bowl holding two large floats in a larger bowl filled with water.

The amount of water added varied with the seasons and this clock was operated by the students of the university.|$|E

A train trip to Matsue, Shimane’s capital, takes as long as <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>As</b> it is close to Yamaguchi prefecture, many tourists who come to Tsuwano also visit Hagi on the Sea of Japan and Yamaguchi at the same time, and Tsuwano is often mistaken as being in Yamaguchi prefecture.|$|R

In that role, he accompanied the Prince during his time at Magdalen College, Oxford. The Prince's father, the King, was horrified at his riding technique, and had Cadogan make the Prince ride <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> week {{in the hope of}} improving it.|$|E
25|$|The new {{business}} controlled 60% {{of the radio}} advertising market in November 1998 {{and more than half}} the market in 2002. However, in response to increased competition and falling market share, it looked for ways to cut costs. In its early years Classic Hits broadcast live local programmes in every region from Monday to Saturday, taking Auckland network programmes at night and on Sundays. In 1998 it reduced local programming to <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day in all regions except Christchurch, and introduced new network shows for mornings and afternoons. As Christchurch announcers left, their shows were also replaced with network programmes.|$|E

Her date of birth is usually given as 1 November 1847, but other authors have placed her birth in 1848 or 1850, and Albani's memoir puts her birth in 1852. She began her musical studies with her mother, and at age five her father took over her musical lessons. Her father was a proficient musician who was skilled with the violin, harp, piano and organ. He kept her on a strong practice regimen, with as much as <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day of lessons on the harp and piano.|$|E

25|$|Graf's {{schedule}} was closely controlled by her father, who limited her play {{so that she}} would not burn out. In 1985, for instance, she played only 10 events leading up to the US Open, whereas another up-and-coming star, Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, who was a year younger than Graf, played 21. Peter also kept a tight rein on Graf's personal life. Social invitations on the tour were often declined as Graf's focus was kept on practicing and match play. Working with her father and then-coach Pavel Složil, Graf typically practiced for up to <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day, often heading straight from airports to practice courts. This narrow focus meant that Graf, already shy and retiring by nature, made few friends on the tour in her early years, but it led to a steady improvement in her play.|$|E
