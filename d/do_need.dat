5|$|Species that <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to swim {{continuously}} {{to breathe}} {{go through a}} process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.|$|E
5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they <b>do,</b> <b>need</b> to be incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and {{be capable of}} escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of powerful businesswomen—still a rare sight—in {{some of these}} groups helps get them heard. Prior to 2008, women {{were not allowed to}} enter hotels and furnished apartments without a chaperon or mahram. With a 2008 Royal Decree, however, the only requirement for a woman to be allowed to enter hotels is a national ID card, and the hotel must inform the nearest police station of their room reservation and length of stay; however, this happens with everybody staying in the hotel. In April 2010, a new, optional ID card for women was issued which allows them to travel in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The cards include GPS tracking, fingerprints and features that make them difficult to forge. Women do not need male permission to apply for the card, but <b>do</b> <b>need</b> it to travel abroad. Proponents argue that new female identity cards enable a woman to carry out her activities with ease, and prevent forgeries committed in the name of women.|$|E
500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you {{have no choice but to}} use the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] is the right thing to do. Sometimes you <b>do</b> <b>need</b> a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E

500|$|Spiderlings hatch {{from their}} eggs after about 8 days and can {{emerge from the}} egg sac as early as 11 days after being laid, {{although}} cooler temperatures can significantly slow their development so that emergence does not occur for months. After hatching they spend about a week inside the egg sac, feeding on the yolk and molting once. [...] Baby spiders appear from September to January (spring to early summer). Male spiders mature through five instars in about 45–90 days. Females mature through seven–eight instars in about 75–120 days. Males live {{for up to six}} or seven months, while females may live between two and three years. Laboratory tests have shown that redbacks may survive for an average of 100 days, and sometimes over 300 days without any food, those starved at 10°C faring better than those kept without food at 25°C. Spiders are known to reduce their metabolic rates in response to starvation, and can distend their abdomens to store large amounts of food. Redbacks can survive temperatures from below freezing point to 40°C, though they <b>do</b> <b>need</b> relatively warm summers, with temperatures of 15 to 25°C for two to three months, to survive and breed.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} he only {{managed to}} play one match before being loaned out again on 24 March 2005, this time to League Two club Bristol Rovers, {{until the end of}} the season. He made his debut two days later as a substitute on 79 minutes in a 2–1 victory away to Notts County. He stated his desire to stay at the club long-term in April 2005, saying [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>need</b> a change, just to get myself going again really because it has been disappointing not playing." [...] He made his first start for the club in a 4–0 away defeat against Scunthorpe United on 30 April 2005. The loan expired in May 2005 after playing five times and he again expressed his desire to stay at the club. Wycombe Wanderers agreed to sign Carruthers on a two-year contract on a free transfer on 16 June 2005 and Rovers manager Ian Atkins revealed his disappointment at not signing him, saying [...] "He was high on my list. There are not many players who can play left-back, wing-back or as out-and-out wingers". However, after speaking to Atkins and being guaranteed regular football, he decided to join Rovers instead on 29 June 2005.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, the Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames {{argued that}} the {{programme}} would contribute little to the subject: [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to have a rational, informed debate about how to improve our welfare system, but the editorial line taken by supposedly factual ‘reality TV’ adds very little to that." [...] The programme was condemned by the current Ladywood MP, Labour's Shabana Mahmood: [...] "I found it shocking that Channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment. It was profoundly wrong." [...] In the Radio Times, Clare Short, who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood, said the series was [...] "totally unrepresentative" [...] of the area, and condemned it as [...] "crummy and misleading". Others have also criticised Benefits Street, arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject. Labour MP Anne Begg, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, said that the programme was a [...] "misrepresentation" [...] of people claiming benefits, arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up {{a small proportion of}} the overall welfare bill. Referring to the first episode that featured a shoplifter, Chris Williamson (also a Labour MP) said it was [...] "irresponsible" [...] to portray him as a typical benefits claimant. Owen Jones, a columnist for The Independent, described the series as [...] "medieval stocks updated for a modern format". In an article for the Birmingham Mail, writer and television personality Samantha Brick, a native of Birmingham, said that the series was an [...] "atrociously unbalanced" [...] view of the city. Shadow Welfare Minister Chris Bryant claimed that the residents of The Bishop's Avenue in Hampsteadknown as Billionaire's Row because of its expensive propertieswere as likely to have drink and drugs problems as the residents of James Turner Street.|$|E

They decided to recruit Wharton Tiers, who had previously been associated with noise rock bands such as Pussy Galore and Sonic Youth, to produce and engineer the record. This marked the first time White Zombie had worked with a producer on any of their releases.
