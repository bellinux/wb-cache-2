25|$|Methane is {{important}} for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator. Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion</b> is lower than any other hydrocarbon but {{the ratio of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion</b> (891 kJ/mol) to the molecular mass (16.0 g/mol, of which 12.0 g/mol is carbon) shows that methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon, produces more heat per mass unit (55.7 kJ/g) than other complex hydrocarbons. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking. In this context it is usually known as natural gas, which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter, or 1,000 BTU per standard cubic foot.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of reliable methods for predicting <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>of</b> ionic liquids.

Moreover, a new purpose-built model for <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>of</b> ionic liquids has been developed using a multilinear regression. The model obtained from a training set of 40 molecules, meeting Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guiding principles, revealed a good fit with literature values (R 2 = 0. 989).

25|$|During operation, the boiler's {{water level}} is {{constantly}} monitored, normally via a transparent tube {{referred to as}} a sight glass, or with a gauge. Maintaining a proper water level is central to the efficient and safe operation of the boiler. If the water level is too high, steam production is decreased, efficiency is lost and in extreme cases, water will be carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, if the water level gets too low, the crown (top) and/or side sheets of the firebox may become exposed. Without sufficient water to absorb the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion,</b> the firebox sheets may soften and melt, with the possible result of high-pressure steam being ejected with tremendous force through the firebox and into the locomotive's cab. The development of the fusible plug, a device to release pressure in conditions of excessively high temperature and low water levels was intended to protect against this occurrence.|$|E
