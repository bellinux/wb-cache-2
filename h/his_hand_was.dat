5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E
5|$|Qasim al-Ahmad, head of {{the rebels}} in Jabal Nablus, then {{requested}} a pardon from Ibrahim Pasha {{so that he could}} negotiate an end to the fighting himself. Ibrahim agreed and with guarantees of safety by al-Husayni and Abd al-Hadi, Qasim met with Ibrahim in late June. The latter admonished Qasim for his betrayal of Muhammad Ali, to which Qasim responded with an apology and an explanation that <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> forced. By the end of the meeting, the two reconciled and Ibrahim reappointed Qasim as mutassalim of both Nablus and Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|Sulayman looked {{favorably to}} Abdullah's {{potential}} succession and appointed him katkhuda in his father's place, an appointment which surprised many in Sulayman's administration due to Abdullah's young age. Nonetheless, Sulayman sought to publicly downplay Abdullah's political rise by imposing certain rules on him. Among these were that Abdullah was to sit among government employees and administrators {{instead of having}} his own office like Ali Pasha had. He was forbidden from eating or drinking coffee with Sulayman and <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> not to be kissed by anyone.|$|E

25|$|Two {{weeks before}} his thirteenth birthday, Paige {{was arrested for}} shoplifting. Because this {{incident}} followed several earlier incidents of theft and truancy, he was committed to the Industrial School for Negro Children in Mount Meigs, Alabama, the state reform school, {{until the age of}} eighteen. During the more than five years he spent at the school, he developed his pitching skills under the guidance of Edward Byrd. Byrd taught Paige to kick his front foot high and to swing his arm around so it looked like <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> in the batter's face when he released the ball. Paige was released from the reform school in December 1923, six months early.|$|E
25|$|Angle, {{who became}} a fan {{favorite}} {{as a result of}} Austin's treachery, immediately began challenging Austin for the WWF Championship. His first chance came at SummerSlam, which Angle won by disqualification allowing Austin to retain the title. At Unforgiven in September, Angle forced Austin to submit to his ankle lock and won the WWF Championship in front of his hometown fans in Pittsburgh. Austin demanded a rematch, claiming <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> under the ropes when he tapped out, and received it on the October 8, 2001 edition of Raw. Austin regained the title when William Regal, the WWF Commissioner and special enforcer, attacked Angle and joined The Alliance.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} rabbinical sources {{argue that}} Simeon was very fearless, but also was particularly envious, {{and so had}} always been antagonistic and spiteful towards Joseph, owing to Joseph being Jacob's favourite son. The midrashic book of Jasher argues that Simeon {{was the one who}} proposed that the brothers should kill Joseph, and other classical sources argue that it was Simeon who threw Joseph into a pit, and became furious when he found out that Judah had sold Joseph rather than killed him. According to the classical sources, Simeon suffered divine punishment for this inhumanity, with his right hand withered, but this caused Simeon to repent, and so <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> restored a week later.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of the {{controversy}} and the delay in relieving Bee, Jackson's brigade, which would thenceforth {{be known as the}} Stonewall Brigade, stopped the Union assault and suffered more casualties than any other Southern brigade that day; Jackson has since then been generally known as Stonewall Jackson. During the battle, Jackson displayed a gesture common to him and held his left arm skyward with the palm facing forward – interpreted by his soldiers variously as an eccentricity or an entreaty to God for success in combat. <b>His</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> struck by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger. He refused medical advice to have the finger amputated. After the battle, Jackson was promoted to major general (October 7, 1861) and given command of the Valley District, with headquarters in Winchester.|$|E
25|$|Georg Wilhelm von dem Bussche (19 July 1726 – 11 December 1794) was {{a general}} officer of Hanoverian {{soldiers}} during the War of the First Coalition who famously led one of the Coalition columns at the Battle of Tourcoing. He {{was born into a}} noble family in the Kingdom of Prussia but later became a page to King George II of Great Britain who was also Elector of Hanover. In 1743 he joined the Hanoverian military service and fought in the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven Years' War, fighting at Minden and Lutterberg. He led a battalion at Gibraltar in the American Revolutionary War. In the War of the First Coalition he led his soldiers at Valenciennes, Hondschoote, Mouscron, Tourcoing and Tournai. On 11 December 1794 while defending the Bommelerwaard in the Dutch Republic, <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> taken off by a cannonball and he died shortly afterward.|$|E
25|$|Even {{traditional}} {{depictions of}} Orion have varied greatly. Cicero drew Orion {{in a similar}} fashion to the modern depiction. The Hunter held an unidentified animal skin aloft in his right hand; <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> represented by Omicron2 Orionis and the skin was represented by the 5 stars designated Pi Orionis. Kappa and Beta Orionis represented his left and right knees, while Eta and Lambda Leporis were his left and right feet, respectively. As in the modern depiction, Delta, Epsilon, and Zeta represented his belt. His left shoulder was represented by Alpha Orionis, and Mu Orionis made up his left arm. Lambda Orionis was his head and Gamma, his right shoulder. The depiction of Hyginus was similar to that of Cicero, though the two differed in a few important areas. Cicero's animal skin became Hyginus's shield (Omicron and Pi Orionis), and instead of an arm marked out by Mu Orionis, he holds a club (Chi Orionis). His right leg is represented by Theta Orionis and his left leg is represented by Lambda, Mu, and Epsilon Leporis. Further Western European and Arabic depictions have followed these two models.|$|E

25|$|Austin {{lost his}} title to Angle at Unforgiven by {{submitting}} to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch after claiming <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> under the ropes (which it was). Austin received that rematch on the October 8 episode of Raw {{and won the}} title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance. Austin then began feuding with Alliance member Rob Van Dam, who was {{the only member of}} the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at No Mercy later that month and won by pinning the latter. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. Survivor Series was coming up and it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and Big Show. Before Survivor Series, Austin and Rock rekindled their rivalry at the UK-only pay-per-view Rebellion and Austin successfully defended his WWF title with help from Angle.|$|E
500|$|He was poignantly mourned in Philadelphia as {{a benevolent}} {{employer}} of over 3,000 and a rare businessman who treated his employees exceptionally well. The Chicago Tribune {{wrote that he}} was [...] "peculiar in his ideas. <b>His</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> always {{in his pocket and}} his influence always for his less successful fellow-men to whom he took a fancy." [...] He was reported in 1889 to give $17,000 in Christmas gifts to his employees. His philanthropy branched out in other areas as well. In 1882 he sponsored the immigration of approximately 40 or 50 Russian Jewish families and purchased homes for them, assuring they would settle in Pennsylvania.|$|E

Roethlisberger {{was forced to leave}} the game after <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> stepped on in the final quarter.

500|$|The {{stubborn}} defence of {{the garrison}} irritated the khagan, who blamed his Soghdian allies for claiming {{that there were}} [...] "fifty donkeys in this (town) {{and that we would}} take it in five days, but now the five days have become two months". At length, the khagan resumed negotiations, and offered safe-conduct for either Dabusiyya or Samarkand, which were still in Arab hands. The garrison sent a rider to Samarkand to ask for advice, and was told to choose Dabusiyya, which was closer to Kamarja. After fifty-eight days, out of which, according to al-Tabari, the garrison [...] "did not water their camels for thirty-five days", the siege was over. The Arabs and Turgesh exchanged five hostages each, including one of Suluk's most important nobles, Kursul. After the mutual massacre of captives early in the siege, the Arabs' mistrust was such that they refused to leave until the khagan and his army had departed, and an Arab with a dagger in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> seated behind each of the Turgesh hostages, who wore no armour.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 1942, Flight Lieutenant Winckel was {{transporting}} {{refugees from}} the Bandung, Dutch East Indies, to Perth, Western Australia, in his Lockheed Lodestar. He had just stopped on the Broome Airfield to refuel when Broome was attacked by nine Japanese Zero fighter planes on a long-distance raid from Kupang, Timor. Winckel saw the danger of his plane being on the open airstrip and proceeded to dismount the Colt 7.99mm machine gun from the plane. When one of the Zeros, piloted by Osamu Kudō, flew over at low altitude, Winckel managed to shoot {{him out of the}} air; the crash killed Kudō. Winckel was thereby credited with the raid's only [...] "kill" [...] on the Allied side. He also believed that he hit another Japanese plane that had to ditch in the sea. The Japanese destroyed 22 allied aircraft at Broome, many of them flying boats used for refugee transport and moored in Roebuck Bay. Winckel suffered severe burns to his hand during the attack, as he had to hold the machine-gun barrel to aim. <b>His</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> treated and Winckel flew medical evacuations for the next two days without rest.|$|E
500|$|Pineda {{competed for}} {{a spot in the}} Yankees' {{starting}} rotation during spring training in 2014. He was named the Yankees' fifth starter towards the end of spring training. He made his first start for the Yankees on April 5, 2014. On April 10, 2014, during a start against the Boston Red Sox, Boston broadcasters noticed a substance that appeared to be pine tar on the palm of Pineda's pitching hand in the early innings of the game. Midway through Pineda's outing, the substance was wiped from his hand only to be added to his wrist. The umpires of the game were never notified and no action was taken against Pineda, who told reporters after the game that the substance on <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> dirt. On April 23, 2014, during Pineda's next game against the Red Sox, Red Sox manager John Farrell notified the umpires about pine tar on Pineda's neck, and he was ejected from the game in the second inning. [...] Pineda was suspended for 10 games for the incident. He had a 1.83 ERA in [...] innings pitched across his first four starts.|$|E
