40|$|Abstract: Using {{secondary}} market data on corporate bonds issued in Japan between 1997 and 2005, this paper explores {{the determinants of}} the credit spread of corporate bond rates over interest swap rates. We find that credit spreads properly reflect financial factors at the firm level, including <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios,</b> volatility, and maturity, particularly for longer-term bonds. In addition, an economy-wide factor common among bond issues unable to be captured by firm-level factors, {{plays an important role}} in determining credit spreads, and these economy-wide effects to a great extent cancel out firm-level factors for some subsample periods. We also identify possible factors responsible for the significant economy-wide effects...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- This study investigates {{whether the}} {{adoption}} of integration in New Zealand and Canada {{had a significant impact}} on corporate financing decisions in those countries. Because Canada instituted a capital gains tax on the sale of stock concurrent with {{the adoption of}} integration, firms within the Canadian samples believed to be affected by one of these tax changes and not the other are identified. Using regression analysis, we substantiate that tax integration significantly reduced corporate <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> in New Zealand and Canada, supporting theoretical arguments that the imputation credit method of integration can reduce corporate financial leverage. However, this favorable impact is very sensitive to changes in tax rates, particularly taxes on gains realized through stock appreciation...|$|R
40|$|This paper assesses how price {{regulation}} for energy, water, telecommunications, and rail networks has {{developed in the}} two decades since incentive regulation was introduced. Regulation is necessary because Coasean bargaining is unlikely to produce efficient outcomes, and because the consumer and the firm have relationship-specific capital and are unable to write long-term contracts. Incentive regulation has been successful at promoting operating efficiency in the UK and elsewhere. Incentive regulation has, so far, also been successful at promoting investment, but some challenges remain for regulators and policy-makers. The relationship between the required cost of capital {{and the extent to}} which prices are allowed to track costs is explored, and the implications of the recent large increases in <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> for regulation is discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates equity return {{exposure}} to various macroeconomic factors {{and the performance}} of factor betas in predicting the cross-sectional variation in stock returns. We utilize a two-step procedure to directly test the implications of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory. First, we calculate monthly factor betas and then, we estimate the sensitivity of equity returns towards the factor betas. We find that (i) there exists a negative and significant relation between interest rate betas and future equity returns; (ii) the inclusion of market, book-to-market, size and momentum factor betas does not subsume the predictive power of the interest rate beta; and (iii) these results are driven by the <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> of individual firms. We conclude that the financial leverage driven sensitivity of returns towards interest rates is a priced risk factor in the Turkish stock market...|$|R
50|$|Trade-off {{theory of}} capital {{structure}} allows bankruptcy cost {{to exist as}} an offset {{to the benefit of}} using debt as tax shield. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, namely, the tax benefits of debt {{and that there is a}} cost of financing with debt the bankruptcy costs and the financial distress costs of debt. This theory also refers to the idea that a company chooses how much equity finance and how much debt finance to use by considering both costs and benefits. The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Empirically, this theory may explain differences in <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> between industries, but it doesn't explain differences within the same industry.|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} empirical literature documents {{a generally}} negative correlation, named the "leverage effect," between asset returns and changes of volatility. It is more challenging to establish such a return-volatility relationship for jumps in high-frequency data. We propose new nonparametric methods {{to assess and}} test for a discontinuous leverage effect [...] - i. e. a relation between contemporaneous jumps in prices and volatility. The methods are robust to market microstructure noise and build on a newly developed price-jump localization and estimation procedure. Our empirical investigation of six years of transaction data from 320 NASDAQ firms displays no unconditional negative correlation between price and volatility cojumps. We show, however, {{that there is a}} strong relation between price-volatility cojumps if one conditions on the sign of price jumps and whether the price jumps are market-wide or idiosyncratic. Firms' volatility levels strongly explain the cross-section of discontinuous leverage while <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> have no significant explanatory power...|$|R

40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{financial}} performance of hospitals by ownership type and of five publicly traded hospital companies with other industries, using such indicators as profit margins, {{return on equity}} (ROE) and total capitalization, and <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios.</b> We also examine stock returns to investors for the five hospital companies versus other industries, {{as well as the}} relative roles of debt and equity in new financing. Investor-owned hospitals had substantially greater margins and ROE than did other hospital types. In 1982, investor-owned chain hospitals had a ROE of 26 percent, 18 points above the average for all hospitals. Stock returns on the five selected hospital companies were more than twice as large as returns on other industries between 1972 and 1983. However, after 1983, returns for these companies fell dramatically in absolute terms and relative to other industries. We also found investor-owned hospitals to be much more highly levered than their government and voluntary counterparts, and more highly levered than other industries as well...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} main {{components}} of this measurement {{that are worth}} noting. While ratios such as return on equity and return on assets use net income as the numerator, ROIC uses operating income. Second, this operating income is adjusted to reflect an effective or marginal tax rate. Third, while many financial computations use market value instead of book value (for instance, calculating <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> or calculating the weights for the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)), ROIC uses book values of capital as the denominator. This procedure is done because, unlike market values which reflect future expectations in efficient markets, book values more closely reflect the amount of initial capital invested to generate a return. Lastly, because ROIC attempts to measure how well a firm is able to generate an operating return per unit of invested capital, the ratio is often calculated using the invested capital during a given year, rather than the average of invested capital; however, some analysts still prefer to use the latter.|$|R

40|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been developed}} to explain the motives for corporate insurance purchases, but there are few empirical tests of these theories. Furthermore, the empirical results are not consistent across studies, suggesting the need for further research. This study uses accounting data for 433 publicly listed nonfinancial firms in Korea to test the determinants of insurance demand for the period 1990 through 2001. Our results support the theory that firm size, tax considerations, and firm ownership are important determinants of insurance demand. Firms that are members of chaebols demand more insurance than unaffiliated firms, all else equal. Contrary to theory, our results also indicate that firms that have higher <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> demand less insurance than less leveraged firms, and that firms that have greater liquidity demand more insurance. This might be related to the overall high debt levels of firms in the period leading up to the Korean financial crisis in 1997, but that investigation {{is beyond the scope of}} this study.

40|$|I {{present a}} {{rationale}} for a government to discriminate between {{debt and equity financing}} when taxing corporate income. For risk-averse entrepreneurs, equity generates more surplus than debt, because it provides financing and insurance. A government seeking to extract surplus from entrepreneurs would naturally tax equity-generated income more than debt-generated income. I also establish a less obvious reason why the government might want to extract surplus from entrepreneurs. It is well understood that when the quality of projects is unobservable to investors, risk-averse entrepreneurs with higherreturn projects might retain a larger share of equity to signal their type (Leland and Pyle (1977)). I show that in such an adverse selection setting, while competitive investors are constrained to offer actuarially fair terms, the government can use taxes to discriminate between types. This degree of freedom allows manipulation of the relevant incentive constraints so that a lower level of debt suffices for separation, and an increase in overall efficiency can be obtained. Since entrepreneurs separate along their <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios,</b> the optimal non-linear tax schedule to achieve the desired discrimination is isomorphic to one that taxes debt-generated income at a lower rate than equitygenerated income...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how three {{regulatory}} reforms {{undertaken in}} the aftermath of the global financial crisis have affected returns of real estate companies. The three reforms are aimed at regulating different segments of the market – Basel III targets banks, and could restrict the availability of bank debt to the sector; the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive (AIFMD) targets funds, which could increase compliance costs and reduce the potential investor pool; the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) is aimed at derivative trading and could impact the cost of debt capital. We employ an event study methodology using daily stock returns of real estate companies and identify the regulatory events through news published in major international financial newspapers and news agencies. Our results show different responses across the three regulations. For Basel III we find support for the regulatory burden hypothesis of the bank lending channel for small real estate firms and firms with low <b>debt-to-equity</b> <b>ratios</b> as they cannot diversify their funding sources. The direct regulatory effect as tested using AIFMD announcements supports the profit-based reaction hypothesis for large firms. We also show that the news have asymmetric effects with tighter regulation news more frequently leading to significant responses in average abnormal returns (AARs) than loosening regulation news...|$|R
