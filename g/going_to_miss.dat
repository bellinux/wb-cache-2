500|$|An {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Gregory Dark, {{was released on}} December 17, 1999. It portrayed Spears packing her belongings as she readies herself {{to move away from}} home, and feeling upset because she knows that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> her first love. The video was the subject of controversy among the press, who panned the singer for hiring an adult filmmaker to direct her video. A Spears representative commented that they were only aware of Dark doing music videos. The singer performed [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] in a few live appearances, including at the 2000 Grammy Awards, in a medley with [...] "...Baby One More Time", and in three of her concert tours.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} portrays Spears packing up her belongings, as she readies herself {{to move away}} from home, and feeling upset because she knows that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> her first love. Throughout the video, scenes of the couple's past are also seen and Spears is sitting on a tyre swing, {{including}} one where they climb up onto a windmill, with Spears singing the song, and Spears is standing by a billboard that reads [...] "Welcome to Cedar Springs Gardens" [...] similar to the video [...] "Lucky". Before the end of the video, Spears is waiting at a bus stop while, at the same time, her first love is driving to come see her one last time. However, by the time he finally gets there, Spears had left him behind and taken the bus.|$|E

500|$|Patchy the Pirate {{is stuck}} in traffic on US 101 near Encino and gets cross that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> the new SpongeBob episode, and his super rare eight track also breaks down. [...] His cell phone rings, and Potty tells him to hurry because the episode is about to start. [...] Patchy tells Potty to record the episode, but Potty tells him that he threw the Betamax machine in the trash, making him more mad. [...] The traffic lines moves, but suddenly, he finds himself nowhere, and finds out that [...] "Encino is gone", and then he cries {{that this is not}} the only time a Lost-City had occurred. He tells us that the episode is what we should watch instead of {{watching}} him suffer. Patchy gets his eight track fixed, but not for long when it explodes again and produces smoke.|$|E
500|$|... "Closure," [...] {{written by}} series creator Chris Carter and {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, brought an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted {{when he was a}} child.

500|$|Entering {{the final}} round of matches, Somerset led the group, having won all three of their matches. They faced Worcestershire, while Glamorgan had to play a side {{representing}} the Minor Counties. The Somerset players, led by their captain, Brian Rose, worked out that despite their place {{at the top of the}} table, they could still miss out on qualification for the quarter-finals. Aware of their previous problems with run rate in the 1976 and 1978 John Player League tournaments, they knew that if they lost heavily to Worcestershire, and Glamorgan beat the weak Minor Counties side by a large enough margin, all three teams would be level on points, and Worcestershire and Glamorgan could qualify by having superior bowling strike rates. After their near misses over the previous years, the Somerset players were determined that they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> out again; one of the players, Vic Marks, later described how they wanted to [...] "atone for the acute disappointments of the 1978 season." ...|$|E

500|$|An unnamed narrator (Callum Keith Rennie), {{who as a}} {{teenager}} intended to be the [...] "Michael Jordan of sex" [...] or [...] "Wayne Gretzky with a hard-on", discusses how he met {{and fell in love}} with an older man named Frank. After the two met at a group sex session, they began an older brother–younger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a box kite and cooking omelettes for him. The narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to Peter Gzowski's Morningside during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank– having lost much weight and developed Kaposi's sarcomas– has been diagnosed with AIDS, leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> him. [...] He was the best friend I ever had." ...|$|E
500|$|Martyn Williams {{remained}} {{in the dressing room}} for 90 minutes after the game, and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media. He later did give his reaction, expressing his opinion that the format {{was a bit of a}} lottery and observed [...] "somebody was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> – I've just got to live with the fact that it was me." [...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams' miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue. Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot-out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that [...] "gutted is the only word that properly describes how I am feeling".|$|E
500|$|Blackadder Goes Forth is more satirical in tone {{than the}} {{previous}} three Blackadder series and most sitcoms, taking the opportunity to present an anti-war message. The dialogue is marked throughout by satirical musings {{about the nature of}} the war, its origins and the effects on the soldiers who suffered over its course. The idea that the soldiers suffered whilst their commanders remained safely distant from the action was also referenced on many occasions, such as when Melchett says to Baldrick, [...] "Don't you worry my boy, if you should falter, remember that Captain Darling and I are behind you!", to which Blackadder responds, [...] "About 35 miles behind you!". In the episode [...] "Corporal Punishment", Blackadder justifies the shooting for food of a carrier pigeon (which turns out to be Melchett's pet) by saying, [...] "With 50,000 men getting killed a week, who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> a pigeon?" [...] This episode sees Blackadder being sentenced to death by firing squad for the act, a reference to the capital sentences carried out under the laws of war in force at the time.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the third}} season were mixed {{compared}} to the previous two seasons. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Bell's performance, who she said deserved the [...] "truckload of glowing press notices for her work as the tightly wound, emotionally resilient young detective". Ryan thought Veronica's relationship with Keith was [...] "one of the best, if not the best, parent-child relationship on television", and described Logan and Veronica's on-screen chemistry as [...] "sizzling". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com felt that although the third season [...] "wasn't the strongest", it did show that Veronica Mars [...] "could not only survive but continue {{to find ways to}} reinvigorate itself". Zacharek liked newcomer Piz, and realized how much she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> the character Dick. Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer felt that Veronica Mars [...] "easily has a few more seasons left in it", and described the writing as [...] "unfailingly hysterical and clever". McFarland praised the cast as [...] "without a doubt one of the most likable on television", and called Dohring [...] "the most beloved of the bunch".|$|E
500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the accident, the Cyrus family released a statement via Cyrus' official website; it stated, [...] "We are deeply saddened {{by the loss of}} Bill 'Uncle Bill' Douglas. Members of our tour are like members of our family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family {{in the midst of this}} tragedy. He will truly be missed." [...] Omar Abderrahman, the tour's production manager, said, [...] "That was real tough. It's always a tragedy to lose anyone. Uncle Bill was a great driver and a good friend. He’d done a lot of tours with me, and we’re all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> him." [...] Although the cause for the accident remains undefined, authorities confirmed the roads were wet from overnight rain. However, CBS News reported that speed and weather were not attributed as factors for the accident's occurrence. Despite the incident, the tour's following concert on November 22, 2009 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina proceeded as scheduled. During the concert, Cyrus dedicated the performance of [...] "The Climb" [...] to Douglas as overhead screens displayed a video commemorating him.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian {{published}} {{two separate}} reviews for the episode. Sam Wollaston started by saying [...] "they never listen", noting the [...] "prisoner either disappears or is killed" [...] and that Section D [...] "need {{to rethink the}} whole prisoner thing, or hire less rubbish guards"; however, Wollaston also noted that since it was Sarah who was killed, [...] "mo one's really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> snaky Sarah much". Plot-wise, Wollaston liked the phrase [...] "getting pretty Finding Nemo about it", and said that Ros [...] "better had" [...] survived the cliffhanger, claiming [...] "Spooks without Ros would be like Christmas without presents". Vicky Frost called the episode a [...] "cracking finale", stating that after [...] "weeks of build-up, it feels almost a relief to have the Nightingale plot finally revealed". In regards to the cliffhanger, Frost commented that Spooks has [...] "passed its peak but not sunk so low as to be embarrassing, it still goes out on something of a high, and it's remembered as a decent example of its type". She was also receptive of Norris' portrayal as Ros in her likely final appearance, but felt the Harry and Ruth relationship was [...] "wolly".|$|E
500|$|Several years later, Dibnah and {{his family}} went on holiday, to Blackpool. The trip was filmed for {{television}} and showed Dibnah's preference for working rather than holidaying. He did however manage to undertake the removal of a small chimney stack from a business in the town, under a distinctly grey sky and aided by his wife, Alison. His payment for the job was a new front plate for the boiler of his traction engine. Dibnah, however, refused to take any more holidays and, after 18years of marriage, Alison booked and paid for a holiday to Greece, taking their three children (Jayne, Lorna and Caroline) with her. Dibnah remained at home and was surprised when, upon her return, she asked for a divorce. One day in October 1985, Dibnah attended a solid fuel exhibition in nearby Bury. Upon his return he discovered that Alison had left the house, taking with her their three children, the dog and some items of furniture. Short of money, {{he was forced to}} sell his antique AJS motorcycle. He found life without his family difficult but defended his wife: [...] "There is no doubt whatsoever, she were a good help to me and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> her. It was just that all the pressure got too much for her." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{addresses}} {{the death of}} Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been {{the heart and soul of}} the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> him." ...|$|E

500|$|While filming was {{underway}} {{for the seventh}} season, {{many members of the}} crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, [...] "Millennium" [...] was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, [...] "Closure", features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, [...] "It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away." [...] As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, [...] "we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful." ...|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{was seen}} as having a {{classical}} technique. While batting, he stood very straight and side on to the bowler. His off-driving was powerful, his defence was excellent, and he was superb at judging {{the line of the}} ball and letting it pass by if it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> his wickets. His on-side play was also excellent, being able to place the ball between fielders for easy runs. Christopher Douglas described Jardine as [...] "the epitome of the old-fashioned amateur". However, he also comments that his approach to batting was like that of a professional and that his back-foot batting was of a quality that few amateurs could manage. In 1928, Wisden's correspondent described Jardine as the most secure amateur batsman of the time, and identified his greatest strength as his defence and his [...] "mental gifts." [...] He played very straight and hit the ball hard in defence, but could not play all the strokes, particularly on the off side. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed that Jardine had modelled himself on C. B. Fry. He also noted that Jardine displayed good concentration, a strong desire to improve his batting and a fighting spirit that brought out his best in a crisis. He also said that Jardine could play every recognised cricket shot, but would not do so in a match and Robertson-Glasgow believed it was Jardine's one weakness as a batsman. The more important the occasion, the more defensive and restricted Jardine's batting became: [...] "In general, as the task grew greater, the strokes grew fewer." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E
