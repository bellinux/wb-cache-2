5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{reshape the}} geology near the coast by <b>eroding</b> sand {{from the beach}} as well as offshore, rearranging coral, and changing dune configuration onshore. Their rain water gets absorbed into stalagmites within caves, creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts.|$|E
5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by <b>eroding</b> the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs.|$|E
5|$|Early {{tropical}} cyclone computer models anticipated Mireille would pass close to Guam, prompting officials to undergo {{preparations for the}} storm. The storm ultimately passed north of Saipan, causing damage along the island's northern portion. Mireille knocked over trees and damaged over 70% of Saipan's crops while also <b>eroding</b> coastal roads.|$|E

5|$|The {{high volume}} of {{visitors}} ascending the Borobudur's narrow stairs, {{has caused a}} severe wear out on the stone of the stairs, <b>eroding</b> the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent are severely worn out.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from <b>eroding</b> the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the risk}} of sinkholes {{occurring}} in Guatemala City is high and unpredictable. One recent, similar sinkhole had collapsed in 2007, forming a pit 100 metres deep. The 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole was formed by fluid from a sewer <b>eroding</b> uncemented volcanic ash, limestone, and other pyroclastic deposits underlying Guatemala City. The hazards around the pipe have since then been mitigated, by improved handling of the city's wastewater and runoff. Several rainstorms {{also contributed to the}} sinkhole's collapse, as stormwater percolated into the ground, further dissolving the rocks beneath Guatemala City. The 2010 sinkhole was formed for similar reasons.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erode</b> District {{is divided}} between 3 Parliamentary Constituencies namely: <b>Erode,</b> Nilgiris and Tirupur. The {{district}} consists of 8 assembly constituencies namely Anthiyur, Bhavani, Bhavani Sagar, <b>Erode</b> East, <b>Erode</b> West, Gobichettipalayam, Modakurichi and Perundurai.|$|R
50|$|It {{is part of}} <b>Erode</b> City, located 7 km from <b>Erode</b> Junction and 5 km from <b>Erode</b> bus station.|$|R
50|$|<b>Erode</b> Junction {{railway station}} (Station Code: ED) {{is the main}} railway station serving the city of <b>Erode,</b> Tamil Nadu. <b>Erode</b> Junction {{is one of the}} major railway {{stations}} in Southern Railway and is located near <b>Erode</b> Central Bus Terminus. There is an ISO certified diesel locomotive shed and an electric loco shed attached with <b>Erode</b> Junction.|$|R
5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of <b>eroding</b> penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused {{the rest of the}} park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds {{exacerbated}} the pollution of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was <b>eroding</b> the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly <b>eroding</b> cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1â€“2mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.|$|E
50|$|The Government Museum, <b>Erode</b> is {{an archaeological}} museum {{located in the}} city of <b>Erode,</b> Tamil Nadu. It is located inside the VOC Park campus, 200 meters to the north of <b>Erode</b> Central Bus Terminus and 3 km from <b>Erode</b> Junction.|$|R
50|$|It {{is about}} 9 km from <b>Erode</b> Central Bus Terminus, 6 km from <b>Erode</b> Junction and 7 km from <b>Erode</b> Junction Bus station in Tamil Nadu, India. The village {{is located on}} the State Highway-84A, where it bisects <b>Erode</b> Ring Road.|$|R
50|$|Outer Ring Road, <b>Erode</b> or <b>Erode</b> Ring Road is a 22 km long Ring Road being {{constructed}} around the South Indian City of <b>Erode</b> in Tamil Nadu. It also {{acts as an}} easy roadway for connecting Namakkal district with <b>Erode.</b>|$|R
5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} force in the Everglades, shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. Starting at the last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades, <b>eroding</b> some of it away, and created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|When Parliament {{convened in}} January, the Liberals {{introduced}} no major proposals, and proposed nothing controversial. Diefenbaker turned over his parliamentary duties to British Columbia MP Howard Green and {{spent much of}} his time on the road making speeches across the country. Diefenbaker toured a nation in which Liberal support at the provincial level had slowly been <b>eroding.</b> When the Liberals gained Federal power in 1935, they controlled eight of the nine provincial governments, all except Alberta. By early 1957, the Liberals controlled the legislatures only in the tenth province, Newfoundland, and in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is <b>eroding</b> material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E

5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus <b>eroding</b> the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{the conquest}} the {{highlands}} of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states. In the centuries preceding the arrival of the Spanish the K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering {{a large part of the}} western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K'iche' allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast with Iximche as its capital. In the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily <b>eroding</b> the kingdom of the K'iche'. Other highland groups included the Tz'utujil around Lake AtitlÃ¡n, the Mam in the western highlands and the Poqomam in the eastern highlands.|$|E
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is <b>eroding</b> headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of the village is increasing due its presence along the periphery of <b>Erode</b> city. The Ring Road laid for <b>erode</b> passes through this village, where a new Bus stand has been built.

25|$|<b>Erode</b> has {{two state}} {{assembly}} constituencies namely <b>Erode</b> East and <b>Erode</b> West and it elects {{members to the}} Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly once every five years. The City Corporation area covers a part of Bhavani, Modakurichi, Perundurai and Komarapalayam constituencies. Until the 2004 elections, <b>Erode</b> had only one constituency. From the 1977 elections, All India Anna Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) won the assembly seat five times (in 1977, 1980, 1984, 1991 and 2001 elections) and four times by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK, 1989, 1996 and 2006). The current MLA of <b>Erode</b> (East) constituency is K.S.Thennarasu from the AIADMK party and <b>Erode</b> (West) is K.V. Ramalingam from AIADMK. During the 1951 and 1962 elections, <b>Erode</b> {{was a part of}} <b>Erode</b> constituency and was held by the Indian National Congress. The current Member of Parliament from the constituency is Selvakumara Chinnayan from the AIADMK party.|$|R

He now runs a small but {{successful}} Italian restaurant named after her, where he regales his patrons with stories of his past. He also battles personal demons, involving his grief over Adrian's death, the changing times, and his <b>eroding</b> relationship with his son Robert, who has moved out to become a struggling corporate employee. Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law and longtime best friend, continues to support him whenever he can, but is constantly riddled with guilt over his poor treatment towards his late sister.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's {{agenda for}} the 1930 session {{was lost in the}} fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued <b>eroding</b> his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E
5|$|The District Railway (DR) was a sub-surface {{underground}} railway {{which had}} opened in 1868. Its steam-hauled services operated around the Inner Circle and on branches to Hounslow, Wimbledon, Richmond, Ealing, Whitechapel and New Cross. By 1901, the DR {{was struggling to}} compete with emerging motor bus and electric tram companies and the CLR which were <b>eroding</b> its passenger traffic. To become more competitive, the DR was contemplating a programme of electrification, {{although it was not}} financially strong enough to raise the capital to carry out the work on its own. It also had parliamentary approval for a congestion-relieving deep-level line that was to run beneath its existing route between Gloucester Road and Mansion House.|$|E
