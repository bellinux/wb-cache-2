40|$|Making markets {{work for}} people Cue: How {{often do you}} go to the market? Once or twice a week? Or perhaps you sell goods in a market, and go there everyday? For people who sell {{perishable}} goods, like fruit and vegetables, choosing the right market can be vital. A poor day?s trade may mean that valuable produce must be thrown away, sold for a low price, or taken back to the village. Around 35 years ago in Lusaka, Zambia, a group of farmers decided to change the way they marketed, to make the system work better, both for them and their customers. The Tuesday market was born, which now operates as a cooperative with over 200 members. Chris Kakunta went to find out how it works. IN:	?Very shortly I will be talking ? OUT:	? it has been a pleasure. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 53 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta reporting from Lusaka?s Tuesday market. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Kakunta	Very shortly I will be talking to my colleagues here at the Lusaka Tuesday Marketing Cooperative Limited. Farmers flock from as far as Mumbwa, Chongwe, Kafue. They all <b>gather</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Lusaka Tuesday market for one purpose, to sell their products. As you can hear from the background {{there are all sorts of}} farmers selling different types of products around. And with me is Mr Friday Pride Shawa. You are the Chairperson for this particular cooperative. Could you tell me why you came up with this idea? Shawa	We came up with this idea when we looked at the market. We found it was ideal that each and every farmer should come and gather in the capital here so that we can sell our produce at a very competitive and fair price. Kakunta	So what type of farmers do you have here? Shawa	The farmers who come to this market are from small-scale farmers, subsistence farmers and a few commercial farmers. Kakunta	Now coming to you Mr Ernest Kayumba, you are coming from Mumbwa which is about two hundred kilometres from where we are having our interview. What brings you here? Kayumba	What brings me here is because of the good outlet that we have at Tuesday market. You find that products here are very competitive compared to Mumbwa. Kakunta	Most farmers deliver their crops everyday to an open market. This particular market only opens on Tuesdays. Do you think you are able to make more money by selling on a specific day? Kayumba	Yes we do because a lot of our customers come on this specific day. Kakunta	This looks like a market for those who are well to do? Kayumba	It seems so. Kakunta	And is that the reason why you prefer selling your products on Tuesday? Kayumba	I think so. Kakunta	As a chairman, do you think this is a very good idea that can be replicated elsewhere? Shawa	This is a very good idea because the customers will come specifically for that day and they will buy things in bulk and farmers will make their money at good time. Kakunta	What makes this market popular here in Lusaka? Shawa	It is a market which has got security and a lot of diplomats they buy here. Even our politicians, the Chinese, they come here and each and everything which you want, a vegetable, a fruit, you will find it at this market and this is only on Tuesdays. Kakunta	Now as a farmer it is often said that a farmer produces these crops at a very high cost. At the end of the day they lose, they are unable to sell their products. Are experiencing this here as a farmer who is brining their products on a Tuesday? Kayumba	No, I am not experiencing this because when you come here on Tuesday the prices are very competitive and good, such that that loss is not actually incurred. Kakunta	Now if a similar market has to be established elsewhere, what are the key things that you would like to tell our listeners on how they can establish a similar market? Shawa	The thing is they have to come together and register themselves under the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and then they get clearance from the council to allow them a permit to operate such a market. Kakunta	And to the farmers who bring their products like Mr Kayumba? Shawa	The farmers like Mr Kayumba, these are most welcome here. As long as we have got space we can still accommodate them. But if we do not have space we can also encourage them that in outlets they can open a similar market. Kakunta	Madam I found you here at Lusaka Tuesday market. Why do you come here? Kulkhani	Because we can get all things at one place you know and it is very reasonable price and people we know so long, almost fifteen, sixteen years they are coming and selling it here. So they are like our friends and they are bringing all things to us, you know. Kakunta	Do you like the products? Kulkhani	We like the products. It is a quality product you know. What we want, that is, we are getting it here. This is convenient. This is centralised. We are working people so we are getting half days and we are coming here and marketing at a time. We can get groceries also, you can get vegetables also. You can get your show pieces like crafting. Everything we can get it here. Safety wise also, parking is good, everything is ok. So we do not have to worry, you know. Kakunta	Most people believe that farmers are underpaid for their products. Do you think the farmers here are getting value for their product? Kulkhani	They are getting value for the product, and mostly people they are coming, it is all people, I will say Indians, Zambians, all white people, everybody comes here you know. Kakunta	Thank you so much and you names, Madam? Kulkhani	My name is Mrs Kulkhani. Kakunta	Thank you so much, it has been a pleasure. End of trackWhy having a weekly market in Lusaka is good for farmers and their customer...|$|E
5000|$|Baneshwar fair in {{its present}} form is {{actually}} one of two fairs: one which used to be held in of Baneshwar Mahadev (Lord Shiva) and another fair, which started after the construction of the Vishnu Temple by Jankunwari, daughter-in-law of Mavji, a highly revered saint considered to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. [...] Two disciples of Mavji named Aje and Vaje built the Lakshmi- Narain Temple near the confluence of rivers Som and Mahi. The 'pran-pratishtha' ceremony of the idols was performed on Magh Shukla Ekadashi and since then, the fair is held on this day. The large congregation that <b>gathers</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the time of the fair pays homage to all the deities with equal reverence. On Magh Shukla Ekadashi, the priest - called the Mathadhish, arrives at the fair site from Sabla, in a huge procession. A 16-cm silver image of Mavji on horseback is also brought here. The river water supposedly becomes holier when the Mathadhish takes a bath. Hence, people bathe along with him in the river. The Bhils consign the ashes of their dead at the confluence of the rivers. [...] The Baneshwar fair is predominantly a tribal fair with {{more than half of the}} congregation consisting of Bhils. They revere Baneshwar Mahadev as well as Mavji. The majority of the gathering is from the Districts of Dungarpur, Udaipur and Banswara.|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} amused with another of their {{movements}} during the building season. The steward {{has suffered a}} considerable number of sheep to graze on a lawn near the house, somewhat to the annoyance of the Squire, who thinks this an innovation on the dignity of a park, which ought to be devoted to deer only. Be this as it may, there is a green knoll, not far from the drawing-room window, where the ewes and lambs are accustomed to assemble towards evening, {{for the benefit of the}} setting sun. No sooner were they <b>gathered</b> <b>here,</b> <b>at</b> the time when these politic birds were building, than a stately old rook, who Master Simon assured me was the chief magistrate of this community, would settle down upon the head of one of the ewes, who, seeming conscious of this condescension, would desist from grazing, and stand fixed in motionless reverence of her august burthen; the rest of the rookery would then come wheeling down, in imitation of their leader, until every ewe had two or three of them cawing, and fluttering, and battling upon her back. Whether they requited the submission of the sheep, by levying a contribution upon their fleece for the benefit of the rookery, I am not certain; though I presume they followed the usual custom of protecting powers.|$|R
5000|$|On June 5, 2014, a {{demonstration}} {{was held in}} Ust-Usa Village in Usinsk District, Komi Republic. The demonstration, held in the same region affected by the 1994 spill, followed earlier protests in Izhma and saw {{the adoption of a}} [...] "strongly worded" [...] resolution by Indigenous groups present. Protesters threatened to boycott future Komi Republic elections if their demands were not met. An excerpt from the declaration reads,We, the inhabitants of villages within Usinsk municipal district, have been experiencing the terrible consequences of oil extraction in our land for over four decades. Our rivers, lakes and swamps are being mercilessly polluted. Our ancestral land is being destroyed. We are deprived of the natural resources which are our main source of livelihood. Our constitutional rights to a healthy living environment, to clean air and clean water is being violated systematically. Oil companies, and first of all LUKOIL-Komi, the main operator of oil production within Komi Republic, are brushing off our letters and appeals with dismissals, promises and deceit. Neither have we never received an adequate and constructive response to our repeated enquiries to various authorities, from the municipal district administration to the country's leadership. They do not listen, they don't understand us.Therefore we are <b>gathered</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> the rally in the ancient village of Ust-Usa, and we declare that we join the residents of Krasnobor, Shelyayur and other settlements of Izhma district in that we will no longer idly observe the barbaric destruction of our land and the pollution of our rivers. People have come to our ancestral lands, who are not interested in our future and future of our children - they are only interested in the [...] "black gold" [...] - our mineral resources. And for its sake they are prepared {{to turn it into a}} lifeless space; and they do so.|$|R

En savoir plus [URL] (consulté le 10 / 10 / 2016) ]The articles <b>gathered</b> <b>here</b> aim <b>at</b> outlining a complex {{view of the}} relationship between cities in a state of ‘crisis’ and changes to policing systems, in a period marked by rapid urbanization and industrialization. They explore the connections between the rhythms of urban change and the changes in the institutions responsible for policing the city. This introduction defines ‘urban crisis’ as a brief paroxysm and a way of describing rapid urban change that is considered problematic especially in terms of social control. It examines three sets of issues to highlight the relationships between policing powers and urban dynamics: first, how the police managed to handle unforeseen, traumatic events in emergency situations; second, how the police forces tried to legitimize their status through their understanding and control of urban dynamics; and third, how the police used the discourse of urban crisis they helped to produce, as a tool for their own ends...|$|R
