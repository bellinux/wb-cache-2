Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court of Appeals, in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for <b>financial</b> <b>gain</b> in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail {{in an attempt to}} establish whether he was writing for <b>financial</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as <b>financial</b> <b>gain</b> or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Himmler {{founded the}} first SS {{business}} venture, Nordland-Verlag, a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased Allach Porcelain, which {{then began to}} produce SS memorabilia. Because of the labor shortage and a desire for <b>financial</b> <b>gain,</b> the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor. Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939. Even then, most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for their business experience, and the workers were starving. In July 1940 Pohl established the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns. Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.|$|E
5|$|In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York {{attorney}} Charles F. Peck. The two {{men were}} experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for <b>financial</b> <b>gain.</b> Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1/3 to Tesla, 1/3 to Peck and Brown, and 1/3 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{significance}} of the protests was the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch, more commonly known as Manchester United Supporters' Trust today, by journalist Michael Crick. Working alongside IMUSA (Independent Manchester United Supporters Association), their joint aim was to seek a reference of the merger by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Both groups therefore submitted papers to the Office of Fair Trading, stressing the importance of why the merger shouldn’t be carried out. IMUSA in particular argued that BSkyB’s main intention was not that of United’s but their already dominant position. Sky Television’s relevant market was premium subscription channels and by buying an established Premier League team when they already had rights to the division was purely for <b>financial</b> <b>gain.</b> Moreover, Manchester United’s market was on the pitch and an acquisition by a media organisation– particularly one run by Murdoch– may create detrimental damage to the sport in the long term.|$|E

What is less easy to explain, and what again violates the presumptions of the encroachment narrative, is that, the Crown paid more to runholders to purchase leasehold rights of 235, 000 [*]ha than the runholders paid the Crown for freehold rights of 290, 000 [*]ha.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{machining}} service providers to determine cutting speeds that could maximize their financial returns. This is done based on measures considered by the Theory of Constraints (TOC). It starts by defining the cutting parameters {{and their relationship to}} the machining costs. Also, TOC principles are examined in relation to the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> obtained {{as a result of the}} bottleneck analysis. Next, this paper proposes to combine both sets of concepts in such a way that a relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> and cutting speed is established. A graphical solution identifies the cutting speed that maximizes the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> for a given part at the bottleneck equipment. Finally, a linear programming approach expands the concept for real-life situations where several different parts are machined at several machining equipments. Hence, this approach could be helpful to machining service providers for maximizing their profitability at the same time they fully utilize their bottleneck equipment, in line with TOC principles...|$|R
40|$|Interorganizational alliances {{are widely}} {{recognized}} as critical to product innovation, particularly in high-technology markets. Many new product development (NPD) alliances tend to be asymmetric, that is, they are formed between a larger firm and a smaller firm. As {{is the case with}} alliances in general, asymmetric alliances also typically result in changes in the shareholder values of the partner firms. Are the changes in shareholder values of the partner firms significant? Are asymmetric NPD alliances win-win or win-lose partnerships? Are the gains or losses symmetric for the larger and smaller partner firms? What factors drive the changes in shareholder values of the partner firms? These important questions remain largely unexplored as evidenced by the dearth of empirical research on the effect of asymmetric NPD alliances on shareholder value and on the apportionment of this value between the partner firms. We develop and empirically test a model of short-term changes in shareholder values of larger and smaller firms involved in NPD alliances, using the event study methodology on data covering 167 asymmetric alliances in the information technology and communication industries. In this model, we examine alliance, firm, and partner characteristics as potential determinants of the changes in shareholder values of the partner firms due to an NPD alliance announcement. Our model accounts for selection correction, potential cross-correlation across the residuals from the models of firm value changes for the larger and smaller firms, and unobserved heterogeneity. The results suggest that both the partners experience significant short-term <b>financial</b> <b>gains,</b> but there are considerable asymmetries between the larger and smaller firms with regard to the effects of alliance, partner, and firm characteristics on the gains of the partner firms. The results relating to alliance characteristics suggest that while a broad scope alliance enhances the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> for the larger firm, a scale R& D alliance (relative to a link alliance) contributes positively to the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> for the smaller firm. With regard to partner characteristics, while partner alliance experience positively influences the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> for the larger firm, it has no significant effect on the financial returns for the smaller firm. Further, partner innovativeness is positively associated with the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> for the larger firm, but partner reputation is unrelated to the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> of the smaller firm. Regarding firm characteristics, the magnitude of the <b>financial</b> <b>gains</b> accruing from a firm's own alliance experience is considerably higher for the smaller firm than it is for the larger firm. We outline the implications of the research findings for future research and management practice. innovation, new product development, strategic alliance, shareholder value, strategic management...|$|R
5|$|The hippo {{population}} declined most {{dramatically in}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo. By 2005, the population in Virunga National Park had dropped to 800 or 900 from around 29,000 in the mid-1970s. The decline is attributed to the disruptions caused by the Second Congo War. The poachers {{are believed to be}} Mai-Mai rebels, poorly paid Congolese soldiers, and local militia groups. Reasons for poaching include the belief that hippos are harmful to society, as well as <b>financial</b> <b>gain.</b> However, as of 2016, the Virunga hippo population appears to have increased, possibly due to greater enforcement and cooperation between fishermen and park authorities. The sale of hippo meat is illegal, but black-market sales are difficult for Virunga National Park officers to track. Hippo meat is considered a delicacy in some areas of central Africa and the teeth have become a valued substitute for elephant ivory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal <b>financial</b> <b>gain.</b> In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E
