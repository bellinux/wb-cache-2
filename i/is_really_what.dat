It has been decided that neither of the new spouses will grant a divorce for a year, to give Amanda and Elyot time to confirm if this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> they want. As tempers rise, Sybil and Victor begin to bicker with each other, defending their respective spouses. Amanda and Elyot realise that Sybil and Victor are as suited {{to each other as}} they are, forgive one another and sneak out, leaving the younger two together.

500|$|Though he was {{considered}} one of the front-runners, there was still much competition for one of the limited 2013 bullpen spots as a relief pitcher. His main competition was seen as Brett Cecil and J. A. Happ. John Gibbons said, [...] "How it best fits the team, how it all stacks up down there <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> it's going to come down to. But we're going to go with the best guy, not because guys are out of options." [...] Reportedly, Loup learned that he had acquired one of the bullpen spots when Gibbons walked by his locker and said, [...] "Oh, hey Loup—you made the team." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's Joseph Staten noted that, [...] "Master Chief <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space Marine in really cool green armor." [...] The character's perspective changed as the game itself changed from a real-time strategy game to a first-person shooter, but the Chief was always {{intended to be a}} soldier in the last part of a long and bitter war. For much of the game's development, the character had no name. The developers spent time considering what rank and branch of the armed forces the Chief would belong to—naval ranks grabbed them as [...] "different" [...] from ones the developers had heard of before. [...] "Master Chief" [...] was intended to be a placeholder while a real name was finalized, but the moniker stuck.|$|E

500|$|... "Batgirl: A Matter of Family", {{which was}} {{developed}} by WB Games Montréal, is an [...] "Arkham Episode" [...] featuring Barbara Gordon as Batgirl set before the events of Arkham Asylum. Set in the Seagate Amusement Park, a nautical theme park built atop an oil rig, Batgirl and Robin team up to save her father, Commissioner Gordon, from the Joker and Harley. The content carries over the Dual Play function and hacking ability, which allows Batgirl to take down enemies, control objects, and solve puzzles. Design producer Justin Vazquez said, [...] "Hacking <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> separates her from the other characters... Our intention was that Batgirl should be less powerful than Batman, but that Batgirl plus hacking could give her opportunities {{to do things that}} not even Batman can pull off." [...] The content was released on July 14, 2015, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with the Windows release on October 28, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Mulder {{is caught}} {{by a group}} of commandos after {{swimming}} to shore. In Washington, Scully tends to the critically wounded Pendrell while Man in Black Garrett escapes. Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) arrives shortly afterwards and tells Scully that the orders to protect Frish have been countermanded and he is being arrested for providing false testimony. Scully releases Mulder from confinement and tells him the [...] "official" [...] explanation for the crash, that Frish and Gonzales caused the crash by mistakenly vectoring a military fighter craft with the plane, and that Frish has been lying to cover it up. Mulder is skeptical of this latest explanation and thinks the crashed UFO he found underwater <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> was involved in the crash. Scully tells Mulder that Sharon is not really Max's sister, but rather an unemployed aeronautical engineer who met Max in a mental institution. She also tells him that Agent Pendrell died from his wounds.|$|E
500|$|Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, {{commonly}} referred to as simply the Master Chief, is the main protagonist and main playable character in the Halo trilogy. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey. One of the last SPARTAN-II supersoldiers still in active service (one of the few survivors of the Fall of Reach), the Master Chief inspires awe and fear in the alien Covenant, who refer to him as (a) [...] "Demon". Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the firing of Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved, an event which the player is told would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy. Bungie staff member Joseph Staten noted that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not paid any attention to how to make people want to play in the world. [...] "Master Chief <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor." [...] The character has since become a gaming icon, the mascot of the Xbox, and was rated {{as one of the greatest}} videogame characters of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E

500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith {{is ever going to}} be happy, she's got to {{deal with the fact that}} she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E

None of us are God – [...] just His servants.|$|E
2500|$|Linklater was not {{interested}} in turning the book into a big-budget action thriller as had been done in the past because he felt that A Scanner Darkly was [...] "about these guys and what they're all doing in their alternative world and what's going through their minds <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> keeps the story moving". He wanted to keep the budget under $10 million so that he could have more creative control, remain faithful to the book, and make it an animated film.|$|E

[...] Regarding their reunion, Einziger stated, [...] "I think just the gravity of my friendships with the guys in the band <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> caused [...] to happen - our friendships with each other." [...] The band subsequently reconvened in August 2010 to begin work on their next studio album.|$|E
2500|$|... "Nobody {{really knows}} what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But {{that was what the}} Web was {{supposed}} to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [...] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact." [...] Other critics labeled Web 2.0 [...] "a second bubble" [...] (referring to the Dot-com bubble of 1997–2000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of business models. For example, The Economist has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies as [...] "Bubble 2.0".|$|E

[...] Shue continued to play on the team till 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, [...] "the movie <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>what</b> would have happened if I hadn’t quit [...] I quit because of what people would think of me. The pressure from the boys. The awkward development of my body. I really, really regret it. I wish I’d been brave enough." ...|$|E
