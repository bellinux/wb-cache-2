500|$|Frank Spotnitz was {{assigned}} writing duties for [...] "Nisei", which was {{originally intended to}} be a stand-alone mythology story and to air as the seventh episode of the third season. However, as Spotnitz developed his script, the episode hit several logistical snags. Most notably, Spotnitz's script featured several scenes filmed on trains: Chris Carter explained, [...] "We found {{that we were going to}} have some trouble shooting with trains." [...] Eventually, the sheer scope of the episode caused co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin so much trouble that he wanted to scrap the story. Spotnitz explained, [...] "Goodwin called Chris and said, 'This is unproducable. [...] you've got to throw out the script, basically.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>devastated,</b> and Chris [...] 'Let's make it a two-parter.'" [...] So, the episode was bumped back to number nine and was lengthened to a two parter, resulting in it being delayed several weeks.|$|E

Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. A weakened Cassie escapes from the hospital to find Daniel and tell him she was driving; she is returned to the hospital. During the episode dated May 24, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. Following her death, the strong relationship between Nick and Sharon changes forever. Weighing in on the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] plot, Morrow stated, [...] "As a person who watched Camryn grow up, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>devastated</b> and it was not that difficult to use those feelings in the scenes we had to play. But as an actor, I have to commend our producer and writers at that time because it gave the show a huge new storyline that years later we are still playing out". He felt that losing a child gave Nick [...] "an edge and a change" [...] that affected him deeply. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick tells a judge that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. Luke Kerr of Zap2it referred to this as playing the [...] "Cassie card".|$|E
