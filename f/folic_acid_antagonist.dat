40|$|IT is {{well known}} that whereas folic acid antagonists may induce {{temporary}} remissions in various forms of malignant disease, apparently permanent remissions can be obtained in a high proportion of patients with choriocarcinoma. Broquist (1956) and Hiatt, Goldstein and Tabor (1958) observed that patients receiving a <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>antagonist</b> for leukaemia showed an abnormal excretion of formiminoglutamic acid in patients with various forms of cancer before any form of therapy. It has also been reported that patients with cancer, including the leukaemias, frequently have low serum folate values (Rao et al., 1965) but others have suggested that this correlated with nutritional status (Hellman, Iannotti and Bertino, 1964) and that the serum folate was not more depressed than in comparable hospital patients with non-malignant disease (Spector, Hutter and Fedorko, 1966). In the present paper we report the serum folate and formiminoglutamic acid excretion of patients with trophoblastic tumours.

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activities of}} <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>antagonists</b> {{are supposed to}} be antagonized by elevated extracellular thymidine concentrations in damaged host tissues. Therefore, this study was aimed at screening for nucleoside analogs that impair bacterial thymidine utilization and analyzing the combined antimicrobial activities of nucleoside analogs and <b>folic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>antagonists</b> in the presence of thymidine. Our screening results revealed that different nucleoside analogs, in particular halogenated derivatives of 2 ′-deoxyuridine, substantially impaired the bacterial utilization of extracellular thymidine in Staphylococcus aureus. Time-kill methods showed that 5 -iodo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine enhanced the extent of killing of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) at 24 h against S. aureus in the presence of thymidine (200 μg/liter). While SXT (40 mg/liter) alone did not kill bacteria in the presence of thymidine, its combination with the nucleoside analog at a concentration of 8 μmol/liter showed a bactericidal effect. Moreover, 5 -iodo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine combined with SXT in the presence of thymidine showed a broad spectrum of activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that the in vitro antimicrobial activity of SXT in the presence of thymidine can be significantly improved by combination with a nucleoside analog...|$|R

40|$|Summary. -The {{effect of}} {{methotrexate}} on solid rodent tumours has been in-vestigated using the spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma {{of the female}} C 3 H/Bts mouse.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between delayed hypersensitivity and antibody production has been intensively investigated.

This and other considerations suggested that FAAs may act not only as selective agents for resistant organisms but also as mutagens. Seven FAAs including amethopterin, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, chlorguanide triazine, an experimental quinazoline, WR- 158, 122, and two experimental triazines, WR- 99, 210 and WR- 38, 839, were tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella reversion assay developed by Ames et al.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of electrophoretically separable isozyme patterns is specific both to type of tissue {{and to its}} stage of development (Markert & Moller, 1959).

In malformed embryos from folic-acid-deficient rats the altered zymogram patterns of esterases from abnormal limbs were different from those of abnormal kidneys, yet differentiation of zymograms from the normal hearts of these embryos was unaltered. This implies a correlation between altered tissue-specific zymogram patterns and abnormally developing systems, though no causal relationship has as yet been shown (Johnson, 1968).

First, a thymine-auxotrophic B. subtilis mutant is transformed to prototrophy by integration of a thymidylate synthetase encoding gene at the desired chromosomal locus. In a second step, the mutant strain is transformed with a DNA fragment carrying the heterologous gene and Tmp(r) colonies are selected. Approximately 5 % of these appear to be thymine auxotrophic and contain a single copy of the heterologous gene at the chromosomal locus previously carrying the thymidylate synthetase-encoding gene. Repetition of the procedure at different locations on the bacterial chromosome allows the isolation of strains carrying multiple copies of the heterologous gene.
