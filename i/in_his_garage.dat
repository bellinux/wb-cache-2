5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1958, nearing his 37th birthday, Lindwall stepped up his bid to reclaim his Test place. He {{committed}} him to an intense fitness program that included a 5km daily run followed by vigorous exercises to increase his abdominal and back strength. He set up equipment <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage.</b> Lindwall was determined to add to his Test tally of 212 wickets, which was just four behind the Australian record of Clarrie Grimmett. He was unmoved by a 6000-pound offer from an English newspaper to cover the 1958–59 Ashes series as a journalist, instead wanting {{to play in the}} series.|$|E
5|$|In December 1963 Byrne {{took over}} the control of Stramsact in the UK, and then set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelt backwards) in the United States. Epstein was able to renegotiate a more {{favourable}} commission of 49% in August 1964, but then became embroiled in a three-year court battle with Byrne regarding payment of monies due, during which time potential sponsors lost interest. In August 1967 Epstein died, from what was ruled an accidental overdose of a prescribed drug. Jacobs was found hanged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> on 15 December 1968. Byrne later retired to the Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|Wasting Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was {{released}} on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since The Colour and the Shape (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to {{capture the essence of}} the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his 37th lap Bernhard {{reported}} a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris. He had difficulty turning into the track's right-hand turns and fell to fourth place behind di Grassi and Tréluyer. The tyre degraded further which damaged his car's bodywork, but he cautiously returned to the pit lane for a replacement front nose, and Webber took over his position. Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's tyre carcass which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into his garage for ten-minute bodywork repairs. Then his front-axle energy retrieval system was changed, forcing Webber to remain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, kept the lead after the pit stops. The first full course caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car flipped over but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E

25|$|In September 2001, Joe Sillett {{was hunting}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> for a bat {{ahead of a}} Sunday match for his club side Brook in Surrey versus The Zombies. The only one he could find had {{a bad case of}} woodworm, and to repair the damage, Joe's father Bob carved out small curves towards the top of the bat, {{finishing}} it by hand and a Black and Decker power sander. In the match, using his oddly shaped bat, he scored 142 not out, and it was at that point Joe decided to found The Woodworm Cricket Company, with its now famous shaped bats.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Golovkin {{purchased}} a beige-colored VAZ-2103 car, which he stored <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> where he began constructing a basement, originally {{to be used}} as a workshop, however he realized it could be used as a dungeon to commit his sexual crimes. From August 1990, Golovkin killed eight boys aged 10 to 15-years-old, on two occasions torturing two boys at the same time. In September 1992, Golovkin raped and killed three boys who he had lured into his garage, offering to commit theft from a warehouse. The last of them Golovkin tortured and raped for 12 hours and then hung up before he went to work.|$|E

25|$|Bob Clendenin as Tom Gazelian – Jules' widowed {{neighbor}} who expresses his attraction {{for her in}} weird ways, makes wine <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage,</b> and is always doing things for Jules and the gang without getting anything back {{in an attempt to}} become part of their group. He is frequently found to be peering into Jules' kitchen window, unnoticed by Jules and/or the gang until he says something. By season 4 he {{is considered one of the}} gang, appearing in most episodes and accompanying the group wherever they go, although still generally standing outside Jules' window instead of in the kitchen with the others. His behaviour is often weird and creepy, and details of his otherwise normal and successful life (that he is a millionaire neurosurgeon, former all-state track star, with an adult son in the Marines and a daughter attending law school) are slowly revealed as the series progresses.|$|E
25|$|Police then {{compared}} the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's {{body to the}} ones in Buell's van, which was {{the same color as}} the one seen in 1982. The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Robert Anthony Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.|$|E
25|$|When {{specifically}} {{questioned about}} Robert Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling the youth {{at his house}} {{on the evening of}} December 11 after luring him there, adding that he had been interrupted by {{a phone call from a}} business colleague while doing so; he also admitted to having slept alongside the youth's body that evening before disposing of the corpse in the Des Plaines River the following evening. The reason he had arrived at the Des Plaines police station in a dirty and disheveled manner in the early hours of December 13 was that he had been in a minor traffic accident after disposing of Piest's body, en route to his appointment with Des Plaines officers. In this accident, his vehicle had slid off an ice-covered road, and he had unsuccessfully attempted to free the vehicle himself before the vehicle had to be towed from its location. He also confessed to police he had buried the body of John Butkovitch <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage.</b> To assist officers in their search for the victims buried in his house, Gacy drew a diagram of his basement to show where the bodies were buried.|$|E

25|$|Rosberg set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the second}} {{practice}} session at one minute and 26.225 seconds; Hamilton was 0.061 seconds behind in second despite remaining <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> for an hour while his team repaired an electrical problem that prevented him from driving on the track and Räikkönen third. His teammate Alonso was fourth-fastest, with Bottas fifth and Button sixth. Vettel (who ran wide at Parabolica corner on his fastest lap), Magnussen, Massa and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Multiple drivers went off the track during the session and both Lotus cars of Grosjean and Maldonado struggled to generate heat into their tyres and had further difficulty with braking stability {{and the ability to}} steer into corners. In the third practice session, which was held in warmer and sunnier weather conditions, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the weekend so far at one minute and 25.519 seconds, ahead of Alonso in second and Bottas third. His teammate Massa was fourth-fastest; Button was fifth and Vettel sixth. Räikkonen was seventh-fastest, Kvyat eighth, Ricciardo ninth and Hülkenberg completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Rosberg was affected by gearbox problems which forced him to abandon his short run programme early and it reoccurred when he next emerged on track, causing him to prematurely end his session.|$|E
