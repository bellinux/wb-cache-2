S.) degree in the United States and its {{expression}} through the Society of American Archivists 2 ̆ 7 Guidelines for the Development of a Curriculum for a Master of Archival Studies. He contends that the substantial and distinct body of archival knowledge, coupled with the emergence of new information technologies that have changed the way archives are created, maintained, and used, make an autonomous two-year degree curriculum necessary. The article examines SAA 2 ̆ 7 s history in educational guidelines development, the Canadian experience with educational guidelines and twelve years of M. A. S. degree programs, the growth of U. S. graduate archival education during the 1980 s, and major features of the 1993 <b>draft</b> <b>M.</b> A. S. guideline...|$|E
40|$|In June 2007, the EPA {{released}} draft Method 30 A – Determination of Total Vapor Phase Mercury Emissions from Stationary Sources. Coal-fired {{power generators}} installing mercury CEMs {{are required to}} complete certification testing under the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) prior to January 1, 2009, including relative accuracy test audits (RATAs). The issued <b>draft</b> <b>M</b> 30 A, a work-in-process document, is offered as an option for RATA testing. ADA-ES, Inc. has developed a portable mercury CEM system for use as an Instrumental Reference Method (IRM) as described in Method 30 A in response to industry needs. This effort was conducted through a DOE NETL Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) at We Energies Presque Isle Power Plant. A Thermo mercury CEM has been installed and operating at Presque Isle since June 2005 on the combined flue gas from Units 7, 8, and 9. The IRM was tested at Presque Isle in June 2007 in conjunction with Ontario Hydro RATAs on the installed CEM. Sorbent Trap Method measurements (EPA draft Method 30 B) were also collected. This paper provides a discussion of draft Method 30 A illustrated with results from the IRM RATA testing at Presque Isle including traversing, system integrity testing, and dynamic spiking. Performance of the installed mercury CEM, Ontario Hydro RATA, and M 30 B RATA results will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|Background: Molecular {{characterization}} of highly diverse gene families can be time consuming, expensive, and difficult, especially {{when considering the}} potential for relatively large numbers of paralogs and/or pseudogenes. Here we investigate the utility of Pacific Biosciences single molecule real-time (SMRT) circular consensus sequencing (CCS) {{as an alternative to}} traditional cloning and Sanger sequencing PCR amplicons for gene family characterization. We target vomeronasal gene receptors, one of the most diverse gene families in mammals, with the goal of better understanding intra-specific V 1 R diversity of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Our study compares intragenomic variation for two V 1 R subfamilies found in the mouse lemur. Specifically, we compare gene copy variation within and between two individuals of M. murinus as characterized by different methods for nucleotide sequencing. By including the same individual animal from which the M. murinus draft genome was derived, we are able to cross-validate gene copy estimates from Sanger sequencing versus CCS methods. Results: We generated 34, 088 high quality circular consensus sequences of two diverse V 1 R subfamilies (here referred to as V 1 RI and V 1 RIX) from two individuals of Microcebus murinus. Using a minimum threshold of 7 × coverage, we recovered approximately 90 % of V 1 RI sequences previously identified in the <b>draft</b> <b>M.</b> murinus genome (59 % being identical at all nucleotide positions). When low coverage sequences were considered (i. e. < 7 × coverage) 100 % of V 1 RI sequences identified in the draft genome were recovered. At least 13 putatively novel V 1 R loci were also identified using CCS technology...|$|E
