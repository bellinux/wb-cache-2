60|$|And {{then came}} the Goths. My face was in a lather, {{the time of the}} first invasion, and I {{suspended}} my razor in mid-air to gaze out on my beloved field. At the far end I saw a little girl and a little boy, their arms filled with yellow spoil. Ah, thought I, an unwonted benevolence burgeoning, what a delight to me is their delight! It is sweet that children should pick poppies in my field. All summer shall they pick poppies in my field. But they must be little children, I added as an afterthought, and they must pick from the lower end--this last prompted by a glance at the great golden fellows nodding in the wheat beneath my window. Then the razor descended. Shaving was always an absorbing task, and I did not glance out of the window again until the operation was completed. And then I was bewildered. Surely this was not my poppy field. No--and yes, for there were the tall pines clustering austerely together on one side, the magnolia tree burdened with bloom, and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>quinces</b> splashing the driveway hedge with blood. Yes, it was the field, but no wave of poppy-flame spilled down it, nor did the great golden fellows nod in the wheat beneath my window. I rushed into a jacket and out of the house. In the far distance were disappearing two huge balls of colour, orange and yellow, for all the world like perambulating poppies of cyclopean breed.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were also}} some exotic foreign foods {{imported}} to China from abroad, including raisins, dates, Persian jujubes, and grape wine; rice wine was {{more common in}} China, a fact noted even by the 13th century Venetian traveler Marco Polo. Although grape-based wine had been known in China since the ancient Han dynasty Chinese ventured into Hellenistic Central Asia, grape-wine was often reserved for the elite. Besides wine, other beverages included pear juice, lychee fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, tea, and pawpaw juice. Dairy products and farming were foreign concepts to the Chinese, which explains the absence of cheese and milk in their diet. Beef was also rarely eaten, since the bull was an important draft animal. The main diet of the lower classes remained rice, pork, and salted fish, while it is known from restaurant dinner menus that the upper classes did not eat dog meat. The rich {{are known to have}} consumed an array of different meats, such as chicken, shellfish, fallow deer, hares, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Local freshwater fish from the nearby lake and river were also caught and brought to market, while the West Lake provided geese and duck as well. Common fruits that were consumed included melons, pomegranates, lychees, longans, golden oranges, jujubes, Chinese and <b>Japanese</b> <b>quinces,</b> apricots and pears; in the region around Hangzhou alone, there were eleven kinds of apricots and eight different kinds of pears that were produced. Specialties and combination dishes in the Song period included scented shellfish cooked in rice-wine, geese with apricots, lotus-seed soup, spicy soup with mussels and fish cooked with plums, sweet soya soup, baked sesame buns stuffed with either sour bean filling or pork tenderloin, mixed vegetable buns, fragrant candied fruit, strips of ginger and fermented beanpaste, jujube-stuffed steamed dumplings, fried chestnuts, salted fermented bean soup, fruit cooked in scented honey, and 'honey crisps' of kneaded and baked honey, flour, mutton fat and pork lard. Dessert molds of oiled flour and sugared honey were shaped into girls' faces or statuettes of soldiers with full armor like door guards, and were called [...] "likeness foods" [...] (guoshi).|$|R

40|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) {{is a minor}} {{fruit crop}} in Latvia and Lithuania; it is used for {{production}} of juice, aroma and fruit fibers. The seeds are by-products of food processing {{that could be used}} further for different purposes. The seeds of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> contain about 10 to 20 % of oil. The composition of this oil is quite unique: nearly 90 % of it is formed by two fatty acids - linoleic (52. 4 %) and oleic (35. 6 %). We have also found out that the extracts of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> seeds can be used to improve stability of vegetable oils; 10 % additive of ground seeds to rapeseed oil and 5 % additive to hempseed oil can increase the oxidative stability of these oils about 2. 0 and 1. 6 times, respectively. Unfortunately, the seeds of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> contain also amygdalin - toxic cianogenic glycoside. Due to this compound the usage of seeds of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> are very limited, especially in case of their hydrophilic extracts. Our research was focused on hydrophilic extracts of seeds in order to find out both the best method to prepare polyphenols rich extracts, as well as to determine the amount of toxic amygdalin in the ethanol/water extracts of seeds and in the extracted seeds.

40|$|In this paper, an ideotype for {{the fruit}} crop <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) is {{established}} and traits to be specifically considered for selection and breeding are discussed: adaptation and hardiness, disease resistance, thorns, suckering, growth, rooting, time of ripening, yield, amenability for mechanical harvesting and fruit quality. In addition, test guidelines and descriptors for Chaenomeles species are presented. Short-term and long-term breeding strategies are suggested, {{based on a}} study of general and specific combining ability for plant vegetative traits, fruit yield and morphology traits, and fruit biochemistry traits. An efficient breeding strategy for <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> could be based on recurrent selection.

40|$|In this paper, {{research}} on vegetative propagation of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) plants is reported and summarised. An efficient system for propagation of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> based on softwood cuttings was developed. For this purpose, 20 cm long top cuttings, with {{the base of}} the cuttings soaked in 30 mg/l IBA for 18 hours, were used. Although hardwood cuttings seemed less useful for propagation of chaenomeles plants, a high rooting percentage was obtained using 20 cm long base cuttings, soaked in 100 mg/l IBA for 24 hours. Procedures for micropropagation were improved and micropropagation was shown to be a very efficient method for propagation of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince,</b> with an average proliferation rate of around 3 – 4 and a rooting percentage of over 90 %. For the proliferation phase a medium consisting of complete MS medium with macronutrients reduced to 3 / 4, iron added as NaFeEDTA, 1. 0 g/l BA as growth regulator and 35 g/l sucrose as a source of carbohydrates, was useful in large scale commercial propagation. For rooting of microshoots, a shoot elongation phase of two weeks and a soaking of microshoots in 250 mg/l IBA before planting seemed important. It was shown that the ability to form roots was genotype dependent. Rooting potential should therefore be evaluated during plant breeding and selection...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, applied {{research}} on the usefulness of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) fruits in processing and for development of products is reported.

Aroma was extracted from fresh fruits by sugar and was also enriched by pervaporation from juice. Several products were developed based on fruit juice, purée and aroma extracts, including consumer products such as chaenomeles ice cream, lemonade, jam, curd and yoghurt. Pectin extracted from <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> fruits was tested in baking of white bread. The pectin {{was found to be}} highly useful in improving bread quality, and had a positive effect on crumb hardness and elasticity. A dosage of only 0. 5 % of flour weight resulted in a 7 % increase in bread volume.

40|$|In this paper, {{studies on}} in vitro polyploidization of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) are reported. Tetraploid and {{mixoploid}} plants were obtained both when microshoots and cotyledons {{were treated with}} colchicine or oryzalin. In general, morphogenesis {{seemed to be more}} dependent on the concentration than on time and duration of treatment. High colchicine concentrations were toxic for <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> microshoots, but genotype differences were also observed. Although high oryzalin concentrations inhibited growth, intermediate and low concentrations were very efficient for induction of polyploids without severe negative effects on shoot growth. The optimal concentration for polyploidization of microshoots was 0. 6 – 0. 9 % for colchicine and 30 – 40 μM for oryzalin. The optimal concentration for polyploidization of excised cotyledons was 0. 3 – 0. 6 % for colchicine, and 20 – 40 μM for oryzalin. For efficient polyploidization, cotyledons should not be treated with colchicine until four days after excision, whereas oryzalin should be applied immediately...|$|E
40|$|Various {{extracts}} of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) seeds obtained using organic solvents {{were studied}} for their polyphenol content and antiradical activity.

40|$|Introduction: In {{times of}} {{worsening}} civilization diseases {{the interest in}} natural healing substances is on the increase. To reduce unwanted side effects of many synthetic drugs, {{it is reasonable to}} introduce to the daily diet foods rich in natural compounds of plant origin that are beneficial for health. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the biological activity and stability of selected ethanol extracts of the fruit of chokeberry, blackcurrant, hawthorn, rosehip, quince and <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> as potential nutraceuticals. Materials and methods: Antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined in relation to model phospholipid membranes (IC 50 PC). Antiradical activity was determined in a test with the DPPH• radical (IC 50 DPPH). Also the inhibition of enzymatic (1 -LOX) oxidation of linoleic acid was determined at the beginning of the period of storage of the extracts at room temperature and after 12 months. Results: After 12 months of storage the highest antioxidant stability was shown by blackcurrant extract (1. 5 % increase in IC 50 PC), the highest antiradical stability by quince extract (1. 0 % reduction in IC 50 DPPH), and the highest stability of 1 -LOX enzyme inhibition by chokeberry extract (6. 3 % reduction in inhibition at a concentration of 8 μg∙ml- 1). <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> extract showed the strongest regenerating properties with respect to oxidized phospholipid membranes and the highest ability to eliminate the free radical DPPH•. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the ethanol extracts of the fruits (in particular blackcurrant, chokeberry and <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince)</b> are a potential source of dietary supplements of expected effectiveness in preventive treatment...|$|E

There are many ways of preventing and treating these diseases including the consumption of products that contain significant amounts of antioxidant compounds, such as polyphenols and antioxidative vitamins. However, currently food stores offer mainly convenient food, ready-to-eat foodstuffs or highly processed products. During numerous technological treatments they have been deprived of many valuable compounds occurring in fresh products. Therefore, {{an important element of}} the food production technology is to ensure a proper composition of valuable human health-promoting compounds, mostly vitamins, minerals and polyphenols in final food product. Consumers often and willingly drink beverages. They are also a good starting base for supplementation. Drinks can be enriched with polyphenols, which may reduce the risk of lifestyle diseases, owing to their antiradical potential. The aim {{of this study was to}} use the fruit extracts for beverages enrichment in order to increase their antioxidative potential and polyphenol content. For the experiment the fruits of Cornelian cherry, lingonberry, elderberry, hawthorn and <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> were used.

40|$|In this paper, {{research}} on dietary fibre and cell-wall polysaccharides in chaenomeles fruits is reported and summarised. The dietary fibre in fruits of 12 genotypes of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) and 1 genotype of flowering quince (C. speciosa) was prepared using two different methods: the Alcohol Insoluble Solid (AIS) method; and the AOAC method for total {{as well as}} for soluble and insoluble fibre. The two methods resulted in significantly different estimates, however, no interaction was found between the methods and the genotypes studied. For content of total dietary fibre, three main groups were distinguished, one containing a low amount of fibre (3 genotypes, 28 – 30 g/ 100 g dry matter); one containing a moderate amount of fibre (9 genotypes, 30 – 36 g/ 100 g dry matter) and an isolated genotype (C. speciosa) that contained a high amount of fibre (38 g/ 100 g dry matter). The amount and the nature of monomeric sugars in the constituent polysaccharides of the fibre were determined after total hydrolysis of the AIS and the TDF (Total Dietary Fibre). The fibre contained mostly pectic and cellulosic polysaccharides. A sequential extraction scheme allowed the separation of the cell-wall material into its major components (cellulose, pectins and hemicelluloses). The AIS was composed of 30 g pectins, 8 g hemicelluloses and 60 g cellulosic residue/ 100 g AIS. In 100 g entire dry fruit (800 g entire fresh fruit) there were 11 g pectins, 3 g hemicelluloses and 18 g cellulosic residue. Pectins were mostly located in the flesh of the fruit. Pectins were more efficiently extracted with hot dilute acid than with other extraction media. Pectins had a high degree of methylation (DM) and a low degree of acetylation (DAc). No difference was found in the quantity of polysaccharides extracted from two <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> genotypes, or in the composition of these constituent polysaccharides. The physico-chemical properties of pectins extracted from two genotypes of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> were studied. On average, the fruits contained 11 g pectins/ 100 g dry fruit corresponding to 1. 4 g pectins/ 100 g fresh fruit. Pectins were sequentially extracted, and the cells from the flesh of the fruits were observed with a confocal laser scan microscope. Although the dilute acid conditions were the most efficient for extraction of pectins, pectins extracted by water or potassium oxalate had higher (> 600 ml/g) intrinsic viscosities than pectins extracted by dilute acid (< 400 ml/g). Anionic exchange chromatography was performed on the acid-extracted pectins. The pectins were composed of four populations, the first being mainly composed of arabinans, the second of homogalacturonans and the third of rhamnogalacturonans. The composition of the fourth population differed depending on the genotype studied...|$|E
40|$|Stability {{of vitamin}} C in stored fruit and sugar syrup of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> was tested.

Sugar syrup obtained from the fruit was subjected to analysis before and after pasteurisation, and after several weeks of storage. The Chaenomeles genotypes tested were valuable in terms of vitamin C content. Storage significantly reduced the vitamin C content in the fruit, by 20 % on average after 2 weeks of storage. The mechanical treatment and preparation of sugar syrup decreased the vitamin content by nearly two-thirds when compared with the fruit at harvest. Pasteurisation and storage of the sugar syrup contributed to further losses of vitamin C, reducing it to a very low level...|$|E

Chaenomeles lemonade and chaenomeles curd were also very much appreciated. Curd-type preservatives seemed to be unknown {{for many of the}} Swedish consumers surveyed. Nevertheless, chaenomeles curd obtained high scores and 83 % of women aged 40 – 60 would buy the product if available on the market. Less appreciated (however with high scores) were jam and yoghurt with the highest buying preferences for 75 % for women aged 40 – 60 and 62 % for women aged 20 – 39.

40|$|Characteristics and {{chemical}} composition of chaenomeles seeds and seed oil were investigated in samples of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) and a hybrid taxon (C. japonica x C. speciosa). The content {{of oil in}} the seeds was 6. 1 – 16. 8 % based on dry weight, with an average value of 8. 2 %. The content of moisture in the seeds was 40 – 46 %. The average iodine index of the seed oil was 98, and the acidity index was 2. 4. Nine fatty acids were detected: erucic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, oleic acid, cis- 11 -eicosenoic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. The oil was rich in unsaturated fatty acids (89 %), linoleic acid and oleic acid being the main types present. The amount of individual fatty acids varied from traces to 53 % for linoleic acid. The ratio saturated/unsaturated fatty acid was very low (0. 1). Chaenomeles seed oil could thus be useful in e. g. the food industry, if it were competitive from an economic viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of gibberellic acid (GA 3) and cold stratification of Japonese quince tree seeds (Chaenomeles sinensis), on the growth of rootstock seedlings. Seeds were collected from fruits, rinsed in water, and dried for 48 hours. Soon after, the seeds were submerged in different gibberellic acid concentrations: 0, 100, 200 and 300 mg L- 1, for 24 hours, with an oxygenation system. The seeds were placed in Petri plates between moistened cotton and submitted to cold stratification in a B. O. D. chamber (at 4 °C) for different periods (0, 20, 40 and 60 days). At the end of each period, the seeds were distributedin polystyrene trays containing 72 cells, with vermiculite as substrate. After 30 and 60 days, the percentage emergence was measured and at the end of 60 days, the mean length of the seedlings and mean dry mass were determined.

40|$|The {{amount of}} flowers with {{defective}} pistils, drop of flowers after pollination, initial fruit set, drop of fruitlets and final fruit set were investigated for <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica). Pollen germination, pollen tube growth and fertilisation were studied at cross- and self-pollination. Embryo development was followed from fertilisation to mature fruit. The percentage of flowers with defective pistils was {{very high in}} most of the genotypes studied. This phenomenon seemed to be influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. In compatible (cross-) combinations, pollen tubes reached the base of the ovary within 2 – 5 days, and fertilisation took place 4 – 8 days after pollination. In incompatible combinations, pollen germination was slow, pollen tubes grew slowly and were often completely arrested in the style. The effective pollination period was estimated to be 3 – 5 days. The average initial fruit set was 21. 1 % (range 0 – 83. 3 %), whereas the final fruit set decreased to 10. 4 % (range 0 – 37. 9 %). During embryo development some deviations from normal development were observed, which may influence final fruit set...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a survey}} of {{pathogens}} on <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) plants is reported. The {{main part of the}} study was performed in South Sweden, in experimental fields where no pesticides or fungicides were applied. In the fields shoots, leaves, flowers and fruits were collected, and fruits in cold storage were also sampled. It was concluded that <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> is a comparatively healthy plant, but some fungi were identified that could be potential threats to the crop, which is currently being developed for organic growing. Grey mould, Botrytis cinerea, was very common on plants in the fields, and was observed on shoots, flower parts, fruits in all stages and also on fruits in cold storage. An inoculation experiment showed that the fungus could infect both wounded and unwounded tissue in shoots. Studies of potted plants left outdoors during winter indicated that a possible mode of infection of the shoots could be through persisting fruits, resulting in die-back of shoots. Fruit spots, brown lesions and fruit rot appeared in the field. Most common were small red spots, which eventually developed into brown rots. Fungi detected in these spots were Septoria cydoniae, Phlyctema vagabunda, Phoma exigua and Entomosporium mespili. The fact that several fungi were connected with this symptom indicates that the red colour may be a general response of the host, rather than a specific symptom of one fungus. Fungi found in brown lesions and rots were Botrytis cinerea, Phlyctema vagabunda, Penicillium expansum, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Cryptosporiopsis curvispora. Phlyctema vagabunda was often found in brown rots and also in red spots, indicating that this was the most common fungus. Leaf spots were also a common symptom in the fields. The spots varied in size, shape and colour, and it was obvious that they were caused by several different fungi. From leaves sampled in Latvia, Septoria cydoniae, Phoma pomorum, Asteromella sp. and Ramularia sp. were detected. Phoma pomorum and Alternaria alternata were isolated from leaves sampled in Sweden. However, most of the fungi recorded were widely distributed saprophytes or secondary invaders and leaf diseases were not considered severe. On flowers, the most commonly observed fungi were Cladosporium sp. and Botrytis cinerea but Penicillium expansum, Alternaria alternata and Fusarium sp. were also recorded. Pests found were leaf weevils, Phyllobius spp., larvae of Operophtera sp., Yponomeuta sp., and Caliroa sp. Aphids and red spider mites were also observed, but these were not identified to species. Differences in susceptibility to fruit spots were detected between populations derived from controlled cross-pollination. Plant breeding programmes aimed at developing varieties with resistance to fruit spots should therefore be successful...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{studies on}} the changes in {{characteristics}} and chemical composition of <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> (Chaenomeles japonica) fruits and fruit juice during fruit ripening and storage are reported. Juice was extracted from unripe, mature and stored fruits, respectively, and pH, density, viscosity, turbidity, content of soluble and insoluble solids, titratable acidity and content of vitamin C and phenols were analysed. Fruit biochemistry was clearly influenced by genotype and site of cultivation of plants. Ripening was associated {{with an increase in}} density, soluble solids, titratable acidity and content of vitamin C in the juice. During storage at 1 °C and 5 °C, respectively, the general tendencies for changes in fruit biochemistry were similar for all genotypes analysed. The characteristics of the fresh fruit were well preserved at 1 °C, even during two months of storage. However, after three months a significant loss in juice yield was observed. This was accompanied by browning of the fruit skin, an increase in turbidity of the juice, changes in the content of vitamin C and a modification of aroma. The fruits kept at 1 °C and 85 % relative humidity could be stored for a maximum of nine weeks without significant loss in quality. At 5 °C and 80 % relative humidity, the corresponding storage period decreased to four weeks...|$|E

Based on symptoms, and isolation and identification data, itwas concluded that Erwinia amylovora was the causal agent of pear drying in Macedonia(1989). It was the first experimental confirmation of a presence of E. amylovora in the territoryof the former Yugoslavia. The presence of E. amylovora was also proved in Serbia thatsame year. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, FB was detected during 1990. Based on an officialreport filed with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in Belgrade, the presence of E. amylovorain Yugoslavia was confirmed (EPPO – Reporting Service, 1991). Therefore, the presenceof the bacterium E. amylovora in the territory of Yugoslavia was officially confirmedin 1990. In Croatia, FB was first observed in villages near the border on Serbia in 1995. In Montenegro, FB was first detected in 1996. In Slovenia, FB appeared as late as in 2001. E. amylovora is now present on 10 hosts (pear, wild pear, apple, quince, medlar, mountainash,hawthorn, firethorn, cotoneaster and <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince)</b> in the territory ofthe former Yugoslav republics. Based on literature data, losses caused by FB in theformer Yugoslav republics in the period 1989 - 1992 were estimated at about 12, 000, 000 DEM (mostly in Macedonia) and in the period 1992 – 1996 at 6, 000, 000 DEM. Total damage in a more recent epiphytotic year in Slovenia (2003) was estimated atabout 474, 200 EUR. Conventional and up-to-date rapid methods (PCR, ELISA and IF, BIOLOG and API System,FAME and SDS-PAGE) {{have been used to}} identify E. amylovora. Mainly preventive measures have been used to control E. amylovora in the former Yugoslav republics. Spraying withcopper products has been practiced during the dormant period and in early spring. Inrare cases, spraying has been done at the flowering stage (MARYBLYT), but the problemis that no synthetic bactericides are available on the market. When symptoms occur, onlymechanical measures are being applied...|$|E
40|$|Os marmeleiros sempre foram propagados comercialmente mediante o enraizamento de estacas. Devido ao baixo vigor das mudas, principalmente nos primeiros anos após o plantio, alguns trabalhos foram desenvolvidos no Brasil a fim de viabilizar a utilização do marmeleiro 'Japonês' (Chaenomeles sinensis Koehne) como porta-enxerto para marmelos. Os resultados foram satisfatórios, mas frente à falta de outras opções de porta-enxertos mais vigorosos para marmeleiros e devido a observações em viveiro e a campo do alto vigor dos porta-enxertos para pereira 'Taiwan Nashi-C' (Pyrus calleryana Decne) e 'Taiwan Mamenashi' (Pyrus betulifolia Bunge), objetivou-se, neste trabalho, verificar o crescimento de cultivares de marmeleiros ('Provence', 'Mendoza Inta- 37 ', 'Portugal', 'Smyrna' e 'Japonês') enxertados sobre esses porta-enxertos, na fase de viveiro. Os marmeleiros foram enxertados pelo método de garfagem em mudas dos porta-enxertos 'Japonês', 'Taiwan Nashi-C' e 'Taiwan Mamenashi', mantidas em sacos plásticos (capacidade de 3 L de substrato), no período hibernal. Foram utilizados garfos com três gemas, coletadas de plantas-matrizes do Instituto Agronômico (IAC). O experimento foi realizado em viveiro telado (50 % de luminosidade), sendo avaliados o comprimento e diâmetro do enxerto aos 60, 90, 120 e 150 dias após a realização da enxertia e a porcentagem de garfos brotados na última avaliação. Os porta-enxertos orientais de pereira apresentaram bons resultados na fase de viveiro, com 'Taiwan Nashi-C' destacando-se como porta-enxerto para os marmeleiros 'Smyrna' e 'Mendoza Inta- 37 ', 'Taiwan Mamenashi' para o marmeleiro 'Smyrna' e 'Japonês' para o mesmo. The {{quince tree}} {{has always been}} commercially {{propagated}} by cuttings. Due to the low vigor, mainly {{in the first years}} of the orchard, a series of works was developed in Brazil in order to enable the use of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>quince</b> tree (Chaenomeles sinensis Koehne) as a rootstock. The results were satisfactory but the lack of other options for more vigorous rootstocks for quince tree and the observations in the nursery and in the field of a higher vigor of the pear rootstocks 'Taiwan Nashi-C' (Pyrus calleryana Decne) and 'Taiwan Mamenashi' (Pyrus betulifolia Bunge), led us to verify the performance of quince cultivars grafted on 'Japonês', 'Taiwan Nashi-C', and 'Taiwan Mamenashi' rootstocks, in nursery conditions. The 'Provence', 'Mendoza Inta- 37 ', 'Portugal', 'Smyrna', and 'Japonês' quinces were grafted using the cleft grafting method onto the 'Japonês', 'Taiwan Nashi-C', and 'Taiwan Mamenashi' seedlings and maintained in plastic bags (3 L capacity of substrate) in the dormant period. The scion sticks used had three buds each and were collected from mother plants at the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC). The experiment was accomplished at a nursery (50 % light). The length and diameter of the grafts were measured at 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after the grafting and the percentage of sprouted grafts was evaluated after 150 days. The oriental rootstocks 'Taiwan Nashi-C' and 'Taiwan Mamenashi' presented good results at the nursery, with 'Taiwan Nashi-C' outstanding as rootstocks for 'Smyrna' and 'Mendoza Inta- 37 ' quinces, whereas 'Taiwan Mamenashi' was the best rootstock for 'Smyrna' quince and 'Japonês' for 'Japonês' quince...|$|E
