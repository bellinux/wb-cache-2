25|$|The Schreiber {{team found}} that the NiCl2 and CrCl2 {{promoted}} addition of alkynyl iodide to aldehyde effectively. The reaction provides a 2:1 mixture of desired product and its isomer. However, the undesired isomer can be recycled to the desired <b>epimer</b> in three steps, including Swern oxidation and Corey’s asymmetric reduction. Pd catalyzed partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to establish the Z-configuration at C(8)–C(9). The pivaloyloxy group was then converted to a bromide for the final coupling. A stereoselective enolate alkylation between the allylic bromide with the lithium enolate derived from the second fragment provided a 3:1 mixture of isomers and completed the backbone assembly of (-)-discodermolide. During the final conversion, the NaBH4 reduction of ketone provided a separable 2.5:1 mixture of isomers. The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 3.2% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 36 total steps. In 1996, the Schreiber group published the total synthesis of natural discodermolide with similar synthetic strategy (4.3% overall yield, 36 steps, 24 steps longest linear sequence.|$|E
40|$|The 1 -oxaspiro[2. 5]octane moiety is {{a common}} motif in many biologically active spiroepoxide compounds. Stereochemistry plays an {{important}} role in the action of these spiroepoxides, since the O-axial C 3 <b>epimers</b> are predominantly responsible for biological activity. In view of this, the reactivity of the yeast epoxide hydrolase (YEH) from Rhodotorula glutinis towards both O-axial and O-equatorial C 3 <b>epimers</b> of various 1 -oxaspiro[2. 5]octanes was investigated. O-axial C 3 <b>Epimers</b> were hydrolyzed faster than the O-equatorial C 3 <b>epimers.</b> The stereochemical preference was greatly dependent on the type of substitution on the cyclohexane ring. The preference of YEH for O-axial C 3 <b>epimers,</b> found throughout this study, illustrates the effectiveness of YEH in enzymatic detoxification of spiroepoxide...|$|R

2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its <b>epimer</b> 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This <b>epimer</b> was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E

The stereochemistry at C- 2 was clearly defined by extensive spectroscopic analysis and direct comparison of NMR and HPLC data {{with those of}} the known R-epimer. Both <b>epimers</b> were examined for their cytotoxicities against human leukemia K 562 (K 562 /S) and doxorubicin-resistant K 562 (K 562 /R) cell lines. Different from doxorubicin (IC 50 = 10. 78 mu M for K 562 /R and 0. 66 mu M for K 562 /S), <b>epimers</b> 1 and 2 exhibited similar activities against both cell lines (IC 50 = 1. 32 and 0. 89 mu M for 1, IC 50 = 1. 11 and 0. 86 mu M for 2). These results suggested that both <b>epimers</b> were not Multidrug resistance (MDR) substrates. Furthermore, <b>epimers</b> 1 and 2 were tested for their inhibitory effects against six human cytochrome P- 450 enzymes. <b>Epimers</b> 1 and 2 showed little inhibitory effects toward five of the enzymes except CYP 2 C 9.

40|$|Stereoselective {{disposition}} of sulbenicillin (SBPC) <b>epimers</b> in healthy human volunteers was studied {{in order to}} clarify the differences in pharmacokinetic behavior between the <b>epimers.</b> Stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatography {{was used for the}} determination of SBPC <b>epimers.</b> Plasma protein binding was measured in vitro with an ultrafiltration method. The binding was stereoselective, with the unbound fraction (fu) of the R-epimer being approximately 1. 3 -fold greater than that of the S-epimer. SBPC was administered intravenously to human volunteers, and concentrations of SBPC in plasma and urinary excretion rates were measured. Renal clearance (CLR) for the unbound drug (approximately 400 ml/min) was greater than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (approximately 109 ml/min) for both <b>epimers,</b> suggesting that both <b>epimers</b> are secreted at the renal tubules. Renal tubular secretion appeared to be greater for the S-epimer. When probenecid was coadministered, the CLR values of both <b>epimers</b> were significantly reduced and were approximately equal to the GFR values. CLR was greater for the S-epimer (37. 5 and 49. 8 ml/min for R-SBPC and S-SBPC, respectively), which was simply due to the greater fu of the S-epimer in plasma. In contrast, total body clearance was greater for the R-epimer (67. 8 and 56. 3 ml/min for R-SBPC and S-SBPC, respectively) because of the stereoselective degradation of the R-epimer in plasma. It was revealed that stereoselective degradation in the body had significant influence on the {{disposition of}} SBPC <b>epimers...</b>|$|R

50|$|An anomer {{is a type}} of {{stereoisomer}} and <b>epimer</b> {{found in}} carbohydrate chemistry.

5000|$|The sugars glucose and {{galactose}} are <b>epimers.</b> In glucose, the -OH {{group on}} the first carbon is in the axial position, the direction opposite the -OH group on carbon C-4. In galactose, the -OH group is oriented in the same direction, the equatorial position. In cyclical compounds like these, the -OH group on C-1 may lie in opposite directions as well.
