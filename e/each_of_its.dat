5|$|Doctor Who is unusual, however, in that <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, {{recorded}} off-air by fans at home.

5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> choices. This either {{leads to a}} contradiction and a backtracking step, or, if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E

5|$|This tiling has four-way {{rotational}} symmetry around <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> squares. When {{the ratio of}} the side lengths of the two squares is an irrational number such as the golden ratio, its cross-sections form aperiodic sequences with a similar recursive structure to the Fibonacci word. Generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied.|$|E

5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a one-dimensional geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> points.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E

5|$|As the ANAK Society is ostensibly {{a student}} {{organization}} at Georgia Tech, it {{is subject to}} the same rules and regulations as other student organizations.

The president's name must be kept on file in the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement, available to any student who seeks it. As of 2007, the society's current faculty advisor is Gary S. May, the dean of the College of Engineering and an ANAK member since 1985.|$|E

5|$|Grow Home is an {{adventure}} platform video game developed by Ubisoft Reflections {{and published by}} Ubisoft. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 4, 2015, and for PlayStation 4 on September 1, 2015. The game follows a robot named B.U.D., who is tasked with growing a plant that will oxygenate its home planet. Players explore an open world, moving B.U.D. and individually using <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> arms to climb and interact with objects.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, in {{the spirit}} of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more {{expansive}} history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E
5|$|In <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> iterations, {{the brigade}} was not {{organized}} {{as a permanent}} formation. Typically it was created only as a temporary front-line unit while larger United States Marine units were formed. The brigade would then merge with these to form a Marine division. The 1942 brigade merged with the 2nd Marine Division, the 1944 brigade {{was the basis for}} the formation of the new 6th Marine Division, and the 1950 brigade acted as an advance force for the newly reactivated 1st Marine Division before merging into that unit.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E
