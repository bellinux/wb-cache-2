Results show that when depth of hole is fixed, with diameter of hole increasing, time for elements at the same location to receive stress shortens gradually, and when diameter of hole is fixed, with depth of hole increasing, time for elements at the same location to receive stress prolongs gradually, that is, the bigger the diameter of hole is, the more easily cracks extend in coal seam, and the deeper the hole is, the more adversely cracks extend in coal seam.

In this paper, the low-temperature oxidation laws of coal, oil shale, and mixtures of coal and oil shale were studied by using laboratory programmed heating experiments combined with a field beam tube monitoring system. The results from the programmed heating experiments showed that the heat released from oil shale was less than that from coal. Coal had a lower carbon monoxide (CO) -producing temperature than oil shale, and the mixture showed obvious inhibiting effects on CO production with an average CO concentration of about 38 % of that for coal.

40|$|The United States has vast {{reserves}} of coal {{that make it}} one of the most energy rich nations in the world. In order to utilize these reserves and keep up with increasingly stringent environmental requirements coal based power plants are continually changing. Recent technology advances are changing the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> based power plants. Oxidizing coal to produce steam and drive steam turbines is being replaced by reduction reactions to convert coal to a combustible gas that is cleaned then burned in a gas turbine. These gasification combined cycle plants have many technology options available to them. This work uses thermodynamic, economic and statistical methods to evaluate how well these technology options will perform in order to determine the best combinations of technologies for these future coal based power plants. ^ One of the future technologies that is available for gasification power plants is a fuel cell. Fuel cells convert the chemical energy in the clean coal gas directly to electrical energy. Fuel cell technology is not sufficiently reliable or cost effective to be realistically considered for current gasification power plants. However, if the technology continues to improve as it has over the past few years it will soon be an economically viable option. In order to predict the performance of a fuel cell in a gasification power plant, a fuel cell model is developed that predicts its performance when operating on gasified coal. ^ This work demonstrates the effectiveness of using statistical methods to determine effective future power plant designs. Suggestions are given on important focus areas for gasification power plant development. Fuel cell technology is evaluated in the context of gasification power plants to determine when they will become economically viable and what technology advancements need to be made. ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{electric}} power sector {{is in the}} early stages of transitioning from a reliance on carbon intensive generation sources to a system based on low-carbon sources. In this thesis, I present analyses of four different aspects of this transition, with an emphasis on the PJM Interconnection. The effects of bulk electricity storage on the PJM market I analyze the value of three storage technologies in the PJM day-ahead energy market, using a reduced-form unit commitment model with 2010 data. I find that large-scale storage would increase overall social welfare in PJM. However, the annualized capital costs of storage would exceed social welfare gains. Consumers would save up to $ 4 billion annually, largely at the expense of generator surplus. Storage modestly increases emissions of CO 2 and other pollutants. The external costs and benefits of wind energy in PJM Large deployments of wind create external costs and benefits that are not fully captured in power purchase agreements. I find that wind’s external costs in the PJM market are uncertain but significant when compared to levelized PPA prices. Pollution reduction benefits are very uncertain but exceed external costs with high probability. The climate and health effects of a USA switch from coal to gas electricity generation I analyze the emission benefits created by a hypothetical scenario in which all U. S. coal plants are switched to natural gas plants in 2016. The net effect on warming is unclear; results are highly sensitive to the rate of fugitive methane emissions and the efficiency of replacement gas plants. However, the human health benefits of such a switch are substantial. The costs of building and operating new gas plants likely exceed the health benefits. Robust resource adequacy planning in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> retirements Over the next decade, many U.

I investigate the resource adequacy requirements of the PJM Interconnection, and how procuring less capacity may affect reliability.

PJM could reduce reserve margins to 13 % and still achieve levels of reliability accepted by other power systems...|$|E
