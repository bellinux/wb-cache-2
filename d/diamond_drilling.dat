25|$|On June 25, 2008, Geodex Minerals Ltd., a gold venture firm, {{announced}} {{the results of}} a 2007 - early 2008 <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> program {{on the west side of}} Mount Pleasant. Along with the development of the Sisson Brook tungsten-molybdenum-copper project north of Fredericton, the area surrounding the former Mount Pleasant mine has been a major focus of the company. Research is ongoing, and focuses on the two most likely candidates: the McDougall Brook Granitic suite (MBG) and the Mount Pleasant Granitic suite (MPG).|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s the South Ore Shoot {{had been}} {{exhausted}} and workings below the 175Fathom Level {{at the south}} end were abandoned and allowed to flood. Exploration was continued in all likely areas, from <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> in the Glencoyne Level at the north end, to an extension of the 175Fathom Level beyond the Clay Vein {{at the south end}}. Good pockets of ore were found in some places and production actually remained higher than in the mid-19th century. In 1954 a second exit from the mine was created as an emergency escape route. This led through the Alma workings to the Low Horse Level, up an old sump into the High Horse Level, through the old brick dam and out through the Glencoyne Level. The shafts were fitted with climbing ladders, and the route was inspected weekly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} tunnelling {{method used}} during the war was the blast-hole <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> technique, which had only recently been developed. It involved either undercutting the tunnel and bringing down the back using diamond drill blasting– detonating gelignite charges in drill holes spaced between [...] to [...] apart– or excavating the central portion of the tunnel to its full height and diamond drill blasting the sides. The resulting rubble was used to extend the airfield at RAF North Front out into the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{the southeastern}} {{margin of the}} Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone lies the {{abandoned}} Beanland Mine property. Exploration work in 1937–1938 resulted {{in the creation of}} a three level [...] mine shaft. In February 1992, Deak Resources completed <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> and bulk sampling at the mine and 3,000tons of rock was shipped to its Kerr Mill in Virginiatown. The estimated reserves, before this work, were 8,778tons averaging [...] of gold per ton across a [...] mining width and 24,000tons averaging [...] of gold per ton across a [...] mining width.

Exploration work by United Reef Petroleums Limited (now known as United Reef Limited) followed in 1965. This consisted of line cutting, geologic mapping, magnetometer surveying and sampling, but no further work was done at the mine. At the time of exploration, the mine site comprised , consisting portions of WD271 and six staked claims.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high level}} of {{production}} proved to be unsustainable. Development work of new reserves could not {{keep pace with the}} production of 6,000 tons of crude ore per month. In January 1943 production had to be scaled down, and the ore dressing mill reduced to a single shift per day. But a bigger blow was to follow. In May 1943, as one of the shafts was being deepened, the miners encountered bands of soft, black shale. The Ministry sent in a team of Canadian Engineers with <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> equipment, and this confirmed that the Skiddaw Group of rocks lay at about [...] below the main entrance to the mine (The Lucy Level), not at [...] as the geologists had predicted. The rich bonanza of ore the company had expected was not there.|$|E
50|$|Compressed air {{for running}} power drills and for driving fans and small {{hoisting}} engines was {{adopted in the}} Comstock mines. <b>Diamond</b> <b>drills</b> for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use, but were discarded for prospecting purposes, being found unreliable.

50|$|Anglo American, {{along with}} De Beers, backed the {{manufacturing}} of a {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) {{to help improve}} the sensitivity of exploration surveys. Anglo American established Boart Products South Africa Limited in 1936 (later named Boart International) to turn the company’s stockpile of boart, or low-grade natural <b>diamonds,</b> into <b>drilling</b> products. This initiative resulted {{in the development of the}} first mechanically set <b>diamond</b> <b>drill</b> bit and later led to additional research into cutting and abrasive tools.|$|R

Helicopter borne magnetic and EM-16 surveys were also conducted. [...] The goal of this campaign was to establish the depth and breadth of the Boston Richardson Belt. It was also targeted at the East Goldbrook property and on targets under the Boston Richardson Belt. It led to the detection of four additional belts under the Boston Richardson Belt and additional belts over the Boston Richardson Belt in the East Goldbrook area. These belts showed impressive gold values and visible gold was found in almost every hole.|$|R

2500|$|Between 1975 and 2000 {{the lease}} to the {{underground}} workings at Dolaucothi {{was held by}} Cardiff University. Students from the School of Engineering were {{largely responsible for the}} renovation of the underground workings that were made safe for tourists. [...] The mine was extensively used as a training mine for Mining Engineering and Exploration Geology students under the supervision of Alun Issac, Alwyn Annels and Peter Brabham. Students from the School of Earth Sciences carried out an active gold exploration programme using surface and underground <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> techniques, geochemical soil sampling and geophysics.Geological exploration was carried out by students using both surface and underground drilling methods. The ore processing waste tailings dam was also sampled, mapped geophysically and assessed for its Gold potential. The mine was extensively mapped and a library of Dolaucothi data is still held at the School of Earth & Ocean Sciences at Cardiff University. Cardiff University finally gave up the lease to the underground workings in 2000 due to the closure of its BSc Mining Engineering degree course.

The holdings of the Brookes family were organized into The Birdsboro Iron Foundry Co. by 1867, and later for a short time, the E&G Brooke Iron Co. This marks the beginning of steel production for the company. In the 1880s, a tool manufacturing company called <b>Diamond</b> <b>Drill</b> and Machine Co from Pottsville, Pennsylvania began to operate a division on the Birdsboro Iron Foundry's property. This operation lasted for about ten years. In 1894, Birdsboro Iron Foundry (by then referred to as E&G Brooke Iron Co) bought <b>Diamond</b> <b>Drill</b> and Machine Co.|$|R

2500|$|In 1991, Gwen Resources Limited {{performed}} a detailed program of <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling,</b> geological mapping, trenching and surveying at Beanland. After {{this work was}} completed, a 3,392 ton bulk sample was taken from an open pit in January 1992 to confirm old assay results on the Beanland Vein. Equipment consisted of a Caterpillar D6, a Gardner-Denver hydraulic track drill and a John Deere backhoe to remove the blasted material. The extracted ore was shipped to the Kerr-Addison Mine mill in Virginiatown for processing. All of the ore was stockpiled in the mill yard rather than being directly dumped into the crusher and therefore directly into the mill. Because the ore was stockpiled, where it froze {{and had to be}} blasted, it was handled twice which put up the costs of the milling. The mill results were not as high as expected. It was discovered that the ore had a higher percentage in silver than gold. The cause of this was probably due to a deposit of silver hidden in the very high erratic values of gold and silver. Such an occurrence is quite common in the Cobalt-Temagami area. Since the bulk sample was taken in January 1992, it was very cold and experienced a lot of dilution of ore due to overload of holes. Because of the cold weather, the test pit had to be [...] wide. Beanland Mine has remained idle since 1992.|$|E
