40|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> is {{a process}} in which oxygen diffuses into an alloy and reacts with solute to form oxide {{precipitates}} internally. Although mathematical modeling of <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> has been performed for decades, most models followed the classic work of Carl Wagner. His model assumes that the dissolved solute concentration is zero at the moving boundary between the <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> zone and the unoxidized zone, an assumption that leads to the enrichment of solute in the <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> zone. However recent work on local equilibrium at moving boundaries suggests that this assumption is in error for all cases. It follows that new models for <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> are needed, ones that make use of different conditions at the moving interface, that provide a different explanation for enrichment, and that can explain other experimental results found in the literature, as well. The goal of this project is to create such mathematical models. ^ An Error Function Model (EFM) was derived first and used to simulate <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> in the limit of small volume fractions of oxide and for cases when the initial alloy is unsaturated with oxygen. Then a more general finite difference model was created using DICTRA, a commercial finite difference software designed to simulate phase transformation, for cases when the initial alloy is saturated with oxygen. Although both models assume local equilibrium conditions, this is a reasonable assumption for <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> at high temperature where there is sufficient thermal energy for rapid nucleation and growth. ^ Both models can predict concentration profiles, diffusion paths, and oxide volume fraction profiles that result from <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation.</b> The simulation results show that when oxide fraction decreases to zero near the moving boundary, the dissolved solute concentration is equal to the average concentration rather than zero as suggested by the classic model. These simulation results are supported with the experimental NiO volume fraction profiles measured in internally oxidized Cu-Ni alloys. The enrichment of Ni in <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> zone is explained with the outward diffusion of Cu from <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> zone to surface rather than the diffusion of Ni from unoxidized zone to <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> zone as suggested by the classic model. ...|$|E

In addition to simple proton transfer, two other abundant product ions are observed at m/z 125 and 109 corresponding to the S-methyl methylphosphonothioate and methyl methylphosphonate anions, respectively. The structure of these product ions is demonstrated {{by a combination of}} collision-induced dissociation and isotope-labeling experiments that also provide evidence for their formation by nucleophilic reaction pathways, namely, (i) S(N) 2 at carbon to yield the S-methyl methylphosphonothioate anion and (ii) nucleophilic addition at phosphorus affording a reactive pentavalent intermediate that readily undergoes <b>internal</b> sulfur <b>oxidation</b> and concomitant elimination of CH 3 SOH to yield the methyl methylphosphonate anion. Consistent with previous Solution phase observations of VX perhydrolysis, the toxic P-O cleavage product is not observed in this VX model system and theoretical calculations identify P-O cleavage to be energetically uncompetitive. Conversely, intramolecular sulfur oxidation is calculated to be extremely exothermic and kinetically accessible explaining its competitiveness with the facile gas phase proton transfer process.

40|$|Oxidation is a {{fundamental}} process in the fabrication of microelectronic devices {{and in order to}} promote the incorporation of SiGe into Si technology we have investigated the thermal oxidation of Si 1 -yGey alloy (y≈ 0. 5) at high temperatures (mainly 900 °C and 1000 °C) using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, infrared transmission spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It has been observed that three distinct regions form during oxidation of Si 0. 5 Ge 0. 5 alloy, which are (I) a mixed oxide layer Si 0. 5 Geg 0. 5 O 2, (II) a pure SiO 2 layer and (III) a Si 1 -yGey (y≠ 0. 5) alloy layer. These are formed during both wet and dry oxidation when the sample is not preheated, whilst only two regions (II) and (III) form when the sample is preheated in a non oxygen ambient up to the oxidation temperature prior to oxidation. Enhancement of the rate of wet oxidation of SiGe compared with bulk Si and the accumulation of Ge in region III just below SiO 2 layer (region II) has also been observed. This behaviour is in good agreement with other results, however, some abnormal behaviour during wet and dry oxidation has been observed. The rate of oxidation during short wet oxidations (15 minutes) of Si 0. 5 Ge 0. 5 decreases as the oxidation temperature increases from 800 °C to 1000 °C for 15 minutes, which has not been previously reported, A reduced rate of oxidation of Si 1 -yGey (y≈ 0. 5) in a dry environment has been observed and is discussed. In order to investigate the thermodynamics of the oxidation process new experiments have been carried out which involve the synthesis of a buried oxide layer, by O+ implantation followed by a high temperature anneal. The implanted oxygen atoms preferentially bond to silicon atoms and the oxygen atoms are found to bond to germanium atoms only after all of the silicon atoms are fully oxidised. Germanium tends to be rejected from the growing oxide during a subsequent higher temperature (> 900 °C) anneal. The different behaviour of the Si and Ge atoms during both thermal and <b>internal</b> <b>oxidations</b> is described in terms of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the SiGe alloy system. There are three important conclusions which emerge from these analyses: (i) in order to adequately control the composition of thermal oxides (T> 800 °C) grown on Si 0. 5 Ge 0. 5 material it is necessary to preheat the samples in a non oxidising atmosphere prior to oxidation. By so doing the entrapment of Ge in the near surface layer (region I) is inhibited; (ii) during the initial stage of dry oxidation the process is described by the reaction Si+O 2 ?Si 2 and we suggest that the rate is controlled by the availability of oxygen atoms and is numerically the same as for bulk Si; (iii) in contrast, during the initial stage of wet oxidation, the process is described by the reaction Si+ 2 OH→SiO 2 +H 2 and the rate is controlled by the areal density of Si atoms, which we propose is high due to the weak Si-Ge binding energy and thus an enhanced oxidation rate occurs...|$|R

There were two groups of Febase alloys; ferritic alloys that were Fe-Al-Cr and others that also contained approximately 9. 3 at% Ni {{in order to make}} them austenitic. Ni?base alloys were oxidised in oxygen partial pressures of either 4. 6 × 10 - 11 atm or 9. 8 × 10 - 13 atm and Febase alloys were oxidised in an oxygen partial pressure of 1. 2 × 10 - 16 atm The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> on Fe- and Ni-base alloys containing Al or Al with Cr. The morphology of the precipitates formed and rates of reaction were of interest. Oxidation of the ferritic Fe-base alloys produced <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> only at lower solute concentrations. In these alloys steady state diffusion-controlled precipitation was prevented from occurring due to the formation of an oxide barrier at the reaction front, and cracking off of the <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> zone. In all of the austenitic alloys (Ni-base and y-Fe-base) <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> was observed after all exposures. In y-Fe-base alloys and in Ni-base alloys oxidised at the higher oxygen partial pressure (4. 6 × 10 - 11 atm) precipitation zones were found to widen according to parabolic kinetics, indicating diffusion control. In Ni-base alloys oxidised at 9. 8 × 10 - 13 atm, precipitation zones were observed to widen according to parabolic kinetics up to 40. 9 hours. However, the rate slowed for longer reaction times due to coalescence of precipitates at the reaction front. The rate of <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> decreased with increasing Cr, and thus total solute, concentration. The parabolic rate constants measured for <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> were higher than predicted by Wagner's theory of <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation,</b> which is consistent with observations in previous studies. Kinetics were accelerated by the presence of elongated precipitates, aligned approximately normal to the alloy surface. Chromium alloy additions led to precipitate coarsening, and at lower oxygen partial pressures, to loss of elongated morphology.

The ability of the oxidized clad {{to act as a}} physical barrier to either hydrogen or oxygen diffusion was further investigated in the current work with a molecular-dynamics approach, with the interactions between atoms represented by a Modified Embedded Atom Method. During the initial Zircaloy oxidation phase in the CRL experiments, the model was able to predict the reduced fission product release kinetics as well as the timing for the completion of the clad-oxidation process. In this simulation, the model (with an effective gap size of 20 {micro}m) was able to successfully predict whether singlesided or double-sided oxidation had occurred in accordance with the metallographic examination. However, in order to account for the observed release kinetics after the completion of clad oxidation, it was necessary to assume a greater atmospheric exchange due to possible cracking of the brittle oxide layer. With the assumption of cracking (by assuming a reduced path length for gas transport), the model was successfully able to reproduce the fission product release kinetics and the final fuel stoichiometry as determined from end-of-test weight gain measurements. This analysis particularly shows that local hydrogen production (from the <b>internal</b> fuel <b>oxidation</b> process) will result in a reduced local oxygen potential in the fuel-to-clad gap compared to that which occurs in the bulk coolant...|$|R
40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{chain of}} plants contains both proton-pumping enzymes that conserve energy and non-proton-pumping alternative enzymes that bypass {{the sites of}} energy conservation. In addition to the proton-pumping complex I, plant mitochondria contain alternative type II NAD(P) H dehydrogenases, which allow oxidation of NADH and NADPH from the matrix and the cytosol. The seven gene homologues of type II NAD(P) H dehydrogenases in Arabidopsis thaliana group into three families, including two nda homologues, four ndb homologues and one ndc gene. By producing the seven type II NAD(P) H dehydrogenases in Escherichia coli, we could show that NDB 1 and NDB 2 bind calcium. A single amino acid substitution identified an EF hand motif as the calcium-binding site of NDB 1. Furthermore, NDB 1 was characterised as a calcium-dependent NADPH-specific dehydrogenase, while NDB 4 and NDB 2 {{were found to be}} NADH-specific dehydrogenases, with only the latter enzyme being stimulated by calcium. NADH and NADPH are major reducing equivalents in the cell. Supplying A. thaliana seedlings with ammonium or nitrate, which have different reductant demands for assimilation, induced opposite effects on transcription of non-proton-pumping respiratory enzymes. Ammonium led to broad inductions in alternative pathways, also reflected at the enzyme level, whereas nitrate suppressed gene expression in the same families. This points to a role of non-proton-pumping respiratory enzymes in cellular redox balancing. Respiratory inhibitors can elevate the reduction state of the inner membrane, thereby inducing oxidative stress. In potato, inhibition of complex III by antimycin A resulted in a decrease of <b>internal</b> NADH <b>oxidation</b> via the alternative dehydrogenase in isolated mitochondria, which could potentially counteract over-reduction. A method for permeabilisation of membranes by alamethicin was adapted for use on intact plant suspension cells. This allows in situ studies on mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes in their native environment. Furthermore, the mitochondrial purification method for A. thaliana, the major plant model organism, was improved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} new {{austenitic}} alloys {{based on the}} Fe–Ni–Cr system requires knowledge of their oxygen permeability. Data are available for pure Fe and Ni but not for Fe–Ni alloys. Wagner’s model for <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> is {{used to evaluate the}} oxygen permeability in Fe–Ni alloys. <b>Internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> of Fe–Ni–Cr alloys carried out at 1150 and 1100 °C in Rhines packs and H 2 /H 2 O mixtures is described. <b>Internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> produces zones of FeCr 2 O 4 and Cr 2 O 3 precipitates, according to parabolic kinetics. Permeabilities are deduced taking into account interfacial diffusion contributions. Oxygen permeability decreases with nickel addition in a non-ideal way, and oxygen permeability in nickel-rich alloys is independent of the studied environments. However, the oxygen permeability in iron at the highest temperature studied is increased in H 2 /H 2 O...|$|E
40|$|The steam {{oxidation}} {{behavior of}} inner tube surfaces in the as-manufactured condition for selected martensitic steels and nickel-based alloys was {{compared with that}} of standard laboratory test coupons that were ground to a 600 grit surface finish prior to the steam exposure. Exposures up to 10, 000 h in the temperature range of 550 °C to 700 °C revealed that the as-delivered inner tube surfaces may exhibit substantial <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> {{as a result of the}} (solution) heat treatment in the final stages of the manufacturing process. The internal oxides contained mainly chromia in the martensitic steels and alumina and/or titania in the nickel-based alloys. For the latter materials, the <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation,</b> especially of Ti, caused the steam-grown external chromia scales to be generally thinner than those observed on the specimens that were ground prior to oxidation testing. For the martensitic steels, the <b>internal</b> <b>oxidation</b> modified the incorporation of Cr (Mn, Si) into the surface scales, thus suppressing the formation of protective chromia-based surface scales.

A 22 -N (5 -lb(sub f)) chamber has been operated for 15 hours at 2200 C (4000 F) using nitrogen tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (NTO/MMH) propellant, with negligible <b>internal</b> erosion. The <b>oxidation</b> resistance of these chambers {{could be further}} increased {{by the addition of}} refractory oxide coatings, providing longer life and/or operation in more oxidizing and higher temperature environments. The oxide coatings would serve as a thermal and diffusion barrier for the iridium coating, lowering the temperature of the iridium layer while also preventing the ingress of oxygen and egress of iridium oxides. This would serve to slow the failure mechanisms of Ir/Re chambers, namely the diffusion of rhenium to the inner surface and the oxidation of iridium. Such protection could extend chamber lifetimes by tens or perhaps hundreds of hours, and allow chamber operation on stoichiometric or higher mixture ratio oxygen/hydrogen (O 2 /H 2) propellant. Extensive thermomechanical, thermochemical, and mass transport modeling was performed as a key material/structure design tool. Based on the results of these analyses, several 22 -N oxide-coated Ir/Re chambers were fabricated and delivered to NASA Lewis Research Center for hot-fire testing...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} air oxidation {{of the two}} conventionally cast Ni-based superalloys Rene 80 containing 92 [*]wt[*]ppm boron and CM 247 containing 110 [*]wt[*]ppm of boron was studied at temperatures between 850 and 1050 [*]°C and times ranging from 1 to 100 [*]h. Analysis by GD-OES and SEM/WDX/EBSD revealed the surface scale on Rene 80 after exposure at 1050 [*]°C to consist of Cr 2 O 3 with TiO 2 in the outer part and BCrO 3 and CrTi 2 O 5 in the inner part. Internal Al 2 O 3 precipitates were present below the external scale. After 1 [*]h exposure of CM 247 an inner dense alumina scale formed over eutectic alloy regions containing coarse γ′ precipitates. Over dendritic regions a Cr-rich oxide scale with BCrO 3 -precipitates formed initially and aluminum was internally oxidized. After longer oxidation times an alumina sub-scale grew from the <b>internal</b> precipitates, and <b>oxidation</b> of the initially present depleted alloy zones resulted in formation of outer Ni and Co rich oxides. In both alloys, boron depletion in the bulk alloy occurred due to formation of the mentioned boron rich oxide.
