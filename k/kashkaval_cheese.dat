50|$|The cuisines in Tetovo have {{a unique}} taste and flavour due to the local {{agricultural}} products {{used to make the}} cuisines. In Macedonia, Tetovo <b>Kashkaval</b> <b>cheese</b> is the most popular as it is made naturally from sheep's milk from the Šar Mountains. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, apples from Tetovo were popular in Belgrade and were known as Tetovo Jabuka.|$|E
40|$|Model samples <b>kashkaval</b> <b>cheese</b> {{were made}} by the {{microwave}} processing of cow's milk in thermisation mode (62 - 67 °C) and direct microwave treatment of cheddared curd with subsequent dry salting. Control cheese samples were produced by the conventional approach with classical thermisation (62 - 67 °C) of cow's milk and classic hot brining in brine solution (72 - 74 °C, 14 %NaCl). Samples were placed in ripening conditions (8 - 10 °C). The changes of microbiological and proteolytic profile on the 5 th, 15 th, 30 th and 45 th day of ripening were studied. Higher survival levels of the starter culture responsible for ripening were established in <b>kashkaval</b> <b>cheese</b> produced by microwave treatment in comparison with classical cheese. It was found that the higher cell concentration of the starter culture leads to active and accelerate process of proteolysis with production of free amino acids in concentrations significantly exceeding the obtained in the classical cheese: 490, 10 ± 2, 10 mg 100 g- 1 (microwave <b>kashkaval</b> <b>cheese)</b> versus 216, 50 ± 2, 00 mg 100 g- 1 (classical <b>kashkaval</b> <b>cheese)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|During my investigations, I {{highlighted}} three innovations, all {{of which}} serve {{the production of a}} final product, sheep kefir. This product contains a unique added value and involves several innovational opportunities. I examined the complex economic analysis of the innovations and technological elements investigated with respect to revenues from the sale of sheep milk, sheep <b>cheese</b> (<b>kashkaval)</b> and sheep kefir. The kashkaval-type sheep cheese does not contain sufficient added value to cover the costs of innovational investments. Investigating the innovational activity for developing sheep kefir and for its market introduction, its cash flow balance becomes positive already in the second year after realization, and is able to generate significant profit. sheep breeding, innovation, recovery calculation, sheep kefir, sheep milk production, Livestock Production/Industries, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R
