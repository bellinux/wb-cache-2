40|$|An <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> for a partial-admission turbine {{has been}} {{designed}} to cause the inlet airflow to make a smooth transition from an open circular inlet to an inlet slot. The smooth flow is required for purposes of measuring inlet flow characteristics and maximizing the efficiency of the turbine. A partial-admission turbine is a turbine in which the inlet slot occupies less than a complete circle around the rotor axis. In this case, the inlet slot occupies a 90 arc. The present special inlet-housing design is needed because the "bull nose" shape of a conventional turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> fails to provide the required smooth transition in a partial-admission configuration and thereby gives rise to a loss of turbine efficiency and inaccuracies in inlet flow measurements. Upon entering the <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> through the circular opening, the flow encounters a "tongue"-shaped passageway, which serves as a ramp that diverts the flow to the first of two straight passages. This first passageway occupies a 90 arc and has a length equal to two passage heights. Instrumentation rakes for measuring the characteristics of the inlet flow are installed in this passageway. Just past the first straight passageway is the second one, which is narrower and leads to the 90 turbine inlet slot. This passageway is used to smooth the flow immediately prior to its passage through the turbine inlet slot. The length of this second passageway equals the length of the chord of a turbine vane. The <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> incorporates small ports for measuring static pressures at various locations of the flow, and incorporates bosses for the installation of the instrumentation rakes. The <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> also includes a flange at its inlet end for attachment to a circular inlet duct and a flange at its outlet end for attachment to the outer casing of the turbine...|$|E

40|$|ASME LectureIce {{ingestion}} {{has caused}} damage and subsequent failures of a Solar Mars 100 natural gas pipeline gas turbine on two separate occasions in Seligman Arizona. Understanding this phenomenon and the required ambient conditions {{is key to}} preventing ice related failures in the future. This paper investigates the required ambient temperature and relative humidity for inlet ice formation. It presents the data collected from an on site ambient temperature and relative humidity meter {{as well as a}} real time bell-mouth inlet camera. An ambient temperature and relative humidity meter was installed on site and used to protect the turbine by shutting it down (trip) based on high relative humidity and low ambient temperatures. The initial criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) used to trip and protect the unit were a combination of an educated guess and values cited in General Electric document Gas Turbine Inlet Air Treatment. [1] To further refine these trip parameters and better understand the inlet icing process, a camera was installed in the turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> {{with a view of the}} bell-mouth and inlet guide vanes (IGV). This provided real time images of the inlet icing phenomena that was then correlated with the ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). Also, the camera images showed, after a significant icing event, that pieces of ice sloughed off the IGVs and were ingested by the turbine. Weather Radar data collected from www. weather. com shows that this can occur without precipitation. The theory of inlet ice formation was investigated using the Magnus equation for dew-point calculations and the ?Ideal Gas Law? with an assumption of constant specific heat for the flowing inlet temperature depression. Using a temperature recovery factor of. 8 (this has been supported by numerical modeling in previous research by Stewart [2]) the inlet guide vane temperature depression was predicted to be 6. 9 ?F (3. 8 ?C). With this IGV temperature depression, icing was predicted for ambient temperatures less then 38. 9 ?F (32 + 6. 9 ?F) (3. 8 ?C) and RH above 74 to 76 %. Evidence is also given for inlet ice formation on a General Electric model Frame 3 turbine at the same location. The collected RH, ambient temperature data and inlet camera images suggest condensate and not precipitate icing could be the root cause of the past ice ingestion failures. With the ambient temperature, RH data and bell-mouth camera images, the temperature depression at the inlet guide vanes was measured to be about 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C). The temperature recovery factor (RF) was shown to be 0. 73. A 9. 5 ?F (5. 3 ?C) IGV temperature drop will result in IGV ice when ambient temperatures are below 41. 5 ?F (32 + 9. 5 ?F) (5. 3 ?C) and RH above 67 to 69 %. Setting the trip criteria to guarantee ice free operation will negatively impact the reliability and drop it to unacceptable levels. The original trip criteria of relative humidity greater then 95 % and ambient temperature less then 35. 5 ?F (1. 9 ?C) remain and are now seen as an acceptable compromise. Inlet air heating as a method of preventing inlet ice formation will be discussed. The amount of heat added to the inlet air to guarantee ice free operation is determined to be greater than 250 hp (186 kW). Finally, options for the inlet air heating energy source are suggested...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} valve {{for controlling}} {{the rate of}} flow of a fluid would include an electric-motor-driven ball-screw mechanism for adjusting the seating element of the valve to any position between fully closed and fully open. The motor would be of a type that can be electronically controlled to rotate to a specified angular position and to rotate at a specified rate, and the ball screw would enable accurate linear positioning of the seating element {{as a function of}} angular position of the motor. Hence, the proposed valve would enable fine electronic control of the rate of flow and the rate of change of flow. The uniqueness of this valve lies in a high degree of integration of the actuation mechanism with the flow-control components into a single, relatively compact unit. A notable feature of this integration is that {{in addition to being a}} major part of the actuation mechanism, the ball screw would also be a flow-control component: the ball screw would be hollow so as to contain part of the main flow passage, and one end of the ball screw would be the main seating valve element. The relationships among the components of the valve are best understood by reference to the figure, which presents meridional cross sections of the valve in the fully closed and fully open positions. The motor would be supported by a bracket bolted to the valve body. By means of gears or pulleys and a timing belt, motor drive would be transmitted to a sleeve that would rotate on bearings in the valve body. A ball nut inside the sleeve would be made to rotate with the sleeve by use of a key. The ball screw would pass through and engage the ball nut. A key would prevent rotation of the ball screw in the valve body while allowing the ball screw to translate axially when driven by the ball nut. The outer surface of the ball screw would be threaded only in a mid-length region: the end regions of the outer surface of the ball screw would be polished so that they could act as dynamic sealing surfaces. The inlet end (the right end as depicted in the figure) of the ball screw would be the main seating valve element: in the fully closed position, it would be pressed against the valve seat, as depicted in the upper part of the figure. A retainer would hold the valve seat in an inlet fitting. In addition, the retainer would be contoured to obtain a specified flow rate as a function of axial position of the ball screw. In the fully closed position, little force would be needed to press the ball screw against the seat because the push bore area upon which the upstream pressure would act would be small. The motor would position and hold the ball screw against the seat, providing the force necessary for sealing. To open the valve to a particular position, the motor would be commanded to rotate to a particular angular position (equivalently, a particular number of revolutions) at a particular rate of rotation within its torque limitations. Once the valve was open, fluid would flow through the inlet fitting and the chamber in the <b>inlet</b> <b>housing,</b> past the seat and its retainer, along the hollow core of the ball screw, and through the outlet housing and outlet fitting. The net force generated from fluid pressure in the open position would be small because the pressure exposed to the push bore areas at the inlet and outlet are nearly equal and the forces generated would be in opposing directions...|$|E
40|$|A program {{designed}} to implement a ceramic matrix composite integrally bladed disk (blisk) into rocket engine style turbomachinery has successfully completed testing. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) program, utilizing the MSFC turbomachinery design, analysis, and testing capabilities along with materials development capabilities from both Glenn Research Center (GRC) and MSFC, has tested two carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide blisks in the Simplex Turbopump at MSFC's Test Stand 500. One blisk contained a polar woven fiber preform, while the second blisk tested utilized a quasi-isotropic preform. Vhile earlier papers have chronicled the program's design, material testing, and torque testing efforts, this paper focuses on the testing of the blisks in the Simplex turbopump. Emphasis will {{be placed on the}} actual condition of the blisks before and after the testing test program design methodology, and conclusions that can be drawn from the test data and blisk final conditions. The program performed three separate test series. The first series was needed to validate that the Simplex turbopump was correctly re-built following a major incident to the turbopump. The turbopump had two major differences from the original design. The most obvious difference was the sleeve required throughout the bore of the main housing. The second major difference was modifications to the pump diffuser to improve performance. Several areas were burnt during the incident and were either repaired by weld repair (pump <b>inlet</b> <b>housing)</b> or simply smoothed out (turbine nozzle discharge). The test series was designed to weed out any turbopump design and manufacturing flaws or fatigue issues prior to putting the C/SiC blisks into it. The second and third series were the C/SiC blisk test series. The primary goal of these series was to expose the blisks to as much fatigue causing dynamic stress as possible to examine the material's capability. Initially, the test plan was to put equal time on the two blisks, however, as the test series progressed, the funding allowed additional testing to occur. The additional test time was placed on the polar weave blisk. The total test time accrued on the polar blisk was 2550 seconds with 860 seconds near the turbopump design speed of 25, 000 rpm. This testing included 6 tests / 775 seconds pumping liquid nitrogen and 7 tests / 1775 seconds pumping liquid oxygen. The drive gas for all of the tests was gaseous nitrogen {{due to the lack of}} hot gas source for the Simplex turbopump. The quasi-isotropic blisk was tested for XX total tests and XXXX seconds with X tests/XXXX seconds pumping liquid nitrogen and X tests/XXXX seconds pumping liquid. During the test series, the blisks were inspected following each test. Inspections initially were viewed from the downstream side of the blisks only. Midway through the testing, a method of borescoping the leading edges of the blades was devised, and subsequently, both sides of the blades were inspected following each test. The leading and trailing edges of the polar blisk held up better than the quasi-isotropic blisk. This was a known possibility due to the varying fiber direction in the blades as the rectangular preform weave is cut in a circular pattern. The surprising fact about the testing was that there was no measurable performance loss due to the inaccuracies in the blade manufacturing in the C/SiC blisks, the surface roughness C/SiC of the blades, or the loss of the material in the polar blisk. A performance shift was seen in the quasi-isotropic blisk as portions of the leading and trailing edges were lost. After the testing was completed, detailed inspections of the blisks were performed. The largest surprise was the polar blisk had a obvious crack in a single blade that was located nearly midspan which was not detected in test. The crack ran completely through the blade circumferenciary and through the radial length of the blade. However, the crack does not appear to extend into the blisk hub. Although the cause of the crack is still under investigation, the material appears to be tolerant of this crack, and other hairline cracks discovered under higher magnification. This bodies well for eventual use of this material in actual flight turbopumps where monolithic fracture toughness issues limit its use...|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to {{soil and water}} sources of indoor radon, construction materials can be a significant contributor. 222 Rn is a daughter of 226 Ra and is in turn derived from the longer-lived antecedent 238 U. Since most materials contain 238 U, therefore, any material can be a potential radon emitter. However, some materials have higher concentrations of 238 U and 226 Ra such as alum shale and black shale. Certain granites are typical of uranium-bearing natural materials, but it is always possible to find uranium-rich bedrocks of different types used locally as building materials. Construction materials are sources of airborne radioactivity and external radiation from the decay series of uranium in buildings. Exhalation of radon (222 Rn) from these materials is of interest since the short-lived decay products of radon are the greatest contributors to the lung dose of inhaled radionuclides [3]. Even though radon <b>inlet</b> into <b>houses</b> is a complex process involving building materials, soil, gas, water, and weather-related factors, 226 Ra in construction materials may be {{in some cases the}} predominant source. Much of the radon is released from the radium trapped in the mineral grains in building materials. In building materials with high radium levels, the radon exhalation may become of major importance [4]. Areas with unusually high background (high background radiation areas (HBRAs)) are found in Yangjiang, China; Kerala, India; Guarapari, Brazil, and Ramsar, Iran. The high background radiation in the Ramsar can be considered to be due to the presence of considerable amount of 226 Ra along with its decay products brought to the earth surface by numerous hot springs [5, 6].|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis was to demonstrate the concept of generating electrical energy using only compressed air as a working fluid. Compressed air systems are common on naval installations, posing an enticing opportunity for small-scale electrical generation. The use of a small turbine, {{in this case a}} turbocharger, provided a constant source of shaft power which was used to spin a small permanent magnet motor. With the permanent magnet motor generating alternating current (AC) voltage, a bridge rectifier integrated circuit (IC) was used to rectify the voltage to direct current (DC). The electricity generated was then stored in a 16 -volt supercapacitor. While testing the system, it was discovered that more shaft power could be produced if atmospheric air was entrained into the turbine <b>housing</b> <b>inlet.</b> The effect was similar to an ejector, which is commonly used on aircraft engines to increase thrust. This research demonstrated the feasibility of combining commercially available components to harness compressed air in order to generate electricity on a small scale. This system could be utilized to offset power spikes associated with heavy equipment startup, or as an always-on emergency backup system for critical components. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Static, dynamic, {{and thermal}} {{characteristics}} (measured and predicted) are presented for a 4 -pad, spherical-seat, TPJB with 0. 5 pivot offset, 0. 6 L/D, 101. 6 mm nominal diameter, and 0. 3 preload in the LBP orientation. One bearing is tested four separate {{times in the}} following four different lubrication configurations: (1) flooded single-orifice (SO) at the bearing shell, (2) evacuated leading edge groove (LEG), (3) evacuated spray-bar blocker (SBB), and (4) evacuated spray-bar (SB). The LEG, SBB, and SB are all considered methods of ?directed lubrication?. These methods rely on lubrication injected directly to the pad/rotor interface. The same set of pads is used for every test to maintain clearance and preload; each method of lubrication is added as an assembly to the bearing. Test conditions include surface speeds and unit loads up to 85 m/s and 2. 9 MPa respectively. Static data includes measured bearing clearances prior to operation (cold) and immediately after operation (hot), rotor-bearing eccentricities and attitude angles, and {{a new approach to}} locating the hot center of a bearing. Dynamic data includes: (1) impedance values calculated from measured accelerations, displacements, and excitation forces; and (2) four sets (one set for each bearing configuration) of direct and cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients derived from measurements and fit to a frequency independent KCM model. Thermal data include measured temperatures from sixteen bearing thermocouples along with <b>inlet,</b> outlet, stator <b>housing,</b> and ambient thermocouples. Twelve of the bearing thermocouples are embedded in the babbitt layer of the pads while the remaining four are oriented at the leading and trailing edge of the loaded pads exposed to the lubricant. Bearing thermocouples provide a circumferential and axial temperature gradient. The pivot stiffness (pad and pivot in series) is measured and incorporated into predictions. Measured static, dynamic, and thermal values are compared to predictions from XL_TPJB, a computer code developed at the Texas A&M University Turbomachinery Lab for predicting bearing performance. Measurements show significant cross-coupled stiffness terms with opposite signs and magnitudes that are 20 - 50 % of the direct terms, a max axial temperature gradient of 9. 6 ?C, and attitude angles as high as 29 ?; all of these indicate that the tilt motion of the pad may be impeded by friction between the spherical pivot and the pad. Temperature measurements show directed lubrication, coupled with an evacuated bearing housing, reduces max bearing temperatures up to 13. 9 ?C for the LEG, 10. 2 ?C for the SBB, and 12. 8 ?C for the SB. Although the SB and SBB reduce the max bearing temperature as intended, they can also cause an increase in temperatures at the leading and trailing edges of the loaded pads. The LEG typically reduced temperatures at all locations. Compared to the base case of the flooded SO, directed lubrication reduces the max bearing temperature. Additionally, the dynamics of the system can also be significantly impacted. Using directed lubrication can reduce direct stiffness by up to 18 % for the LEG, 25 % for the SBB, and 20 % for the SB. Similarly, the direct damping can be reduced by up to 24 % for the LEG, 45 % for the SBB, and 34 % for the SB...|$|R
40|$|The {{demands on}} climate control in animal houses {{increases}} as the methods for production improve. The relationship between maximum and minimum ventilation rate in Swedish houses for fattening pigs, around 1 : 15, causes {{problems with the}} distribution of fresh air. The same type of inlets for fresh air are usually used under both ventilation rate conditions. Independently of the ventilation rate the inlets should offer thermal comfort. A prototype to a new inlet (air distributor) has been developed by Sveaverken Agri AB {{as an attempt to}} solve the distribution problem within a wide range of thermal conditions. The prototype consists of a vertical air penetrable textile tube and a bottom which can be lowered creating a circular slotted inlet. This project was initiated by Sveaverken Agri AB in order to test the inlet on a farm with pig production. The aim of the study was to: - identify the demands of thermal environment in a house for finishing pigs by a literature review - compare two inlets for fresh air, the new prototype and a conventional slotted <b>inlet</b> A <b>house</b> containing two compartments for finishing pigs was used for the study, one of the compartments had slotted inlets and the other one the new prototype. Tests were made during summer conditions, 1996. Animal growth and health aspects were excluded from the study. The literature review shows that temperatures between 15 and 25 °C are suitable for finishing pigs. The air speed can vary between 0, 2 and 0, 8 m/s, lower air speeds during lower temperatures and faster when it is warmer. The idea behind the air distributor has been to provide the pigs with a slow, diffuse air movement during the winter and stronger air stream during the summer. A tube of textile is used for distribution of fresh air when the incoming air is cold. As the temperature rises in the house the air distributor opens and the airflow pattern changes to reach the animals directly. Measurements were made to study the abilities of the air distributor considering the expected air flow pattern. The compartment with slotted inlets was used as a reference. The construction of the air distributor was expected two induce greater convective cooling than the slotted inlets. During the test period several parameters were measured two compare the two different air inlets. In each compartment respectively temperatures and air humidity were registered by computer loggers, inside as well as outside the stable. The effect of convective cooling was considered by calculating the chill factor. For this reason air speed, skin- and air temperature were measured in tree pens in each compartment. Smoke was used to trace the air flow pattern. The pen and animal hygiene was controlled in 13 pens in each compartment. The static pressure between each compartment and the attic was measured to find possible differences in the regulation of the ventilation systems. Occasionally the concentration of carbondioxide was measured to calculate the ventilation rate. The results from the measurements show that the new air distributor has a greater capability to stratify the temperature than the slotted inlets. This was proved by calculating the differences between temperatures at pen level and the average temperature in each compartment. Both inlets showed greatest temperature differences when the incoming air was cold. The lowest temperature measured of incoming air was - 5 °C, which gives a 20 °C difference (∆t) between temperature of the stable and the incoming air. Calculations of the chill factor proved no greater difference between the two air inlets. The slotted inlets showed slightly higher values. Non of the inlets reached the recommended level of 60 - 80 W/m 2. The study of the air flow pattern showed that a lower ∆t reduced the ability of incoming air to reach the lying area of the pens, independently of the type of inlet. The air distributor was expected to direct incoming air towards the lying area. This ability was proved to be overestimated. The fast air stream passed above animal level. A comparison between air and skin temperatures implied that the cooling effect was higher with the air distributors than the slotted inlets. This was confirmed by the results from the study of hygiene. Animals and pens reached a better level of hygiene with the new inlet. Knowledge of the concentration of carbondioxide and relative humidity of air was used to estimate the ventilation rate in each compartment. The calculated ventilation rates were higher in the compartment with slotted inlets, despite equivalent exhaust fans. Non of the compartments reached the Swedish recommendations for maximum ventilation rate. Minor adjustments were made to improve the ability of the new inlet to direct incoming air towards the lying areas in the pens. This effects of these adjustments were not studied carefully but the air speed seemed to increase over the lying area. Considering the results, the new inlet functions at least as well as ordinary slotted inlets during summer conditions. The air distributor has several advantages, greater capability to stratify temperature, greater cooling effect under warm conditions and with that better pen and animal hygiene. The adjustments of the new inlet seem to improve the ability to convective cooling. The new inlet has not been tested during winter conditions but by adjusting the inlet height above floor level, there should be no difficulty to prevent cold air from falling down on the animals...|$|R
