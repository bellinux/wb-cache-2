40|$|Partially-eviscerated (also {{described}} as effilé, effileé, roped, partly eviscerated, partially drawn, wire drawn or Boston <b>drawn)</b> <b>poultry</b> {{are produced by}} removing the intestines from the poultry carcass but leaving the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard inside the body cavity (as defined in Regulation (EC) 543 / 2008). Regulation (EC) 853 / 2004 allows production of partially-eviscerated poultry, provided it is authorised by the competent authority. The overall aim of this project was {{to carry out a}} risk assessment of partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry production (poultry with the heart, liver, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard left inside the body cavity) with a view to considering whether the risks of partially-eviscerated poultry production can be managed to an acceptable level such that the practice could be authorised in the UK. To achieve this aim the project had four Objectives: Objective 1, an initial risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain together with a review of all relevant and appropriate literature/company information relating to the control of partially-eviscerated poultry production; Objective 2, an industrial survey of current production of partially-eviscerated poultry; Objective 3, a series of short practical evaluations of any processes where further data was required; Objective 4, a full analysis of all the data and findings of Objectives 1 to 3 and the production of the final project report. The literature review found that documentation on the production of partially-eviscerated poultry was scarce and not comprehensive. However, it highlighted the important points for risk assessment and identified a reason for the development of partial-evisceration processing, i. e. the prevention of “greening” during storage due to the removal of the intestines. The review of current post-mortem inspection of poultry concluded that of the twenty one conditions that are currently looked for during post-mortem inspection of poultry, the majority of these conditions do not pose a risk to public health. Seven conditions were considered to be of concern to public health (Ascites/oedema, Cellulitis, Contamination, Hepatitis, Pericarditis, Perihepatitis/peritonitis, Respiratory disease (airsacculitis)). It was concluded that only four of those seven conditions (hepatitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis/peritonitis, and respiratory disease (air sacculitis)) may not be identified during post-mortem inspection of partially-eviscerated poultry. Their public health significance was considered to be as indicators of the presence of enteric microbial pathogens rather than any inherent pathology of the conditions. Data on condemnations show that the rates of condemnations for these conditions are very low. In addition, these conditions should be clearly identifiable by the end user of the poultry during preparation of the carcass for cooking. Therefore, in our opinion, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumer would ingest such infected viscera. Four French plants and two UK plants were visited during the industrial survey. Although there was a commonality in the practices employed at all of the plants, differences were found between the plants, particularly in the specific method used to remove the intestines from the carcasses in order to produce the product. Four main methods have been identified that can be used to partially eviscerate poultry, three are manual, one is mechanical. The only UK plant currently producing partially-eviscerated poultry, skinned the whole carcass with its feathers on. Partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry report 3 of 166 Due to the lack of data on the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated poultry a series of short targeted experimental evaluations were carried out to: (1) investigate the difference in chilling time between partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses; (2) investigate any difference between the growth of microorganisms on partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage; (3) investigate the growth of microorganisms in the organs of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage. These studies showed: (1) due to the presence of warm internal organs partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses are warmer than eviscerated carcasses at the start of chilling and the rate of cooling of partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses is slower than that of similar eviscerated carcasses; (2) there was no significant difference between the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage; (3) ACC, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, coliform and Escherichia coli counts were all shown to be capable of increasing in/on the heart, crop, feet, gizzard, cavity, skin and liver of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage. A critical review of all available relevant and appropriate literature and data was carried out, supplemented by a survey of current industrial practice and a practical evaluation of processes, to form a risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain. This risk assessment considered: 1. What abnormalities may not be identified in partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 2. Whether the risk of zoonotic pathogens are any greater for partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 3. The aetiology of those conditions; 4. The public health implications of those conditions and of allowing partially-eviscerated poultry into the food supply...|$|E

The Wu-Hausman endogeneity test is used to examine demand specifications and industry structure specifically for turkey meat. In contrast to general poultry, quantity-not price-is found to be predetermined in demand models that use annual turkey data. Quarterly demand analysis suggests this result stems from biological cycles that limit a producer's ability to react to price change {{and the use of}} a weighted average for determining price and quantity. demand analysis, endogeneity, market structure, poultry industry, turkeys, Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new models}} for {{controlling}} diseases, incorporating the best features of different control measures, are proposed and analyzed. These models would <b>draw</b> from <b>poultry,</b> livestock and government expertise to quickly, cooperatively and cost-effectively stop disease outbreaks. The combination strategy of pulse vaccination and treatment (or isolation) is implemented in both models {{if the number}} of infectives reaches the risk level (RL). Firstly, for one time impulsive effect we compare three different control strategies for both models in terms of cost. The theoretical and numerical results show that there is an optimal vaccination and treatment proportion such that integrated pulse vaccination and treatment (or isolation) reaches its minimum in terms of cost. Moreover, this minimum cost of integrated strategy is less than any cost of single pulse vaccination or single treatment. Secondly, a more realistic case for the second model is investigated based on periodic impulsive control strategies. The existence and stability of periodic solution with the maximum value of the infectives no larger than RL is obtained. Further, the period T of the periodic solution is calculated, which can be used to estimate how long the infectious population will take to return back to its pre-control level (RL) once integrated control tactics cease. This implies that we can control the disease if we implement the integrated disease control tactics every period T. For periodic control strategy, if we aim to control the disease such that the maximum number of infectives is relatively small, our results show that the periodic pulse vaccination is optimal in terms of cost.

40|$|The authors {{attempted}} {{to ascertain the}} entrepreneurial potential of poultry farmers in Delta State using farmers’ scores in six entrepreneurial traits measured on a five-point Likert scale. The study covered the population of 275 poultry farmers in the State. The objectives were to ascertain the level of entrepreneurial traits of Poultry farmers and to determine the distribution of poultry farm entrepreneurs by category, namely; low, average and high potential, across the three agricultural zones. The hypotheses tested were that entrepreneurial traits of poultry farmers were not above average {{and that there was}} no significant variation in poultry farmers’ entrepreneurial potentials across the three agricultural zones. Primary data were collected using copies of a structured questionnaire. By using analysis of variance and test of differences between a test value of 3. 4, major findings were that poultry farmers were above average in three entrepreneurial traits but with significant variation across the zones; that entrepreneurial potential was generally below average, finally, that the three categories of poultry farm entrepreneurs were randomly distributed across the zones. The authors concluded that while there may not be any inherent biases in <b>drawing</b> sample of <b>poultry</b> farmers across the State for development projects purposes, there may be differences in cost implications for farmers’ entrepreneurial development...|$|R
60|$|The Altrurian gave {{a kind of}} gasp, {{and then}} lapsed into a silence that lasted until we came in sight of the Camp farm-house. It stood {{on the crest of}} a road-side upland, and looked down the {{beautiful}} valley, bathed in Sabbath sunlight, and away to the ranges of hills, so far that it was hard to say whether it was sun or shadow that dimmed their distance. Decidedly, the place was what the country people call sightly. The old house, once painted a Brandon red, crouched low to the ground, with its lean-to in the rear, and its flat-arched wood-sheds and wagon-houses stretching away {{at the side of the}} barn, and covering the approach to it with an unbroken roof. There were flowers in the beds along the underpinning of the house, which stood close to the street, and on one side of the door was a clump of Spanish willow; an old-fashioned June rose climbed over it from the other. An aged dog got stiffly to his feet from the threshold stone and whimpered as our buckboard <b>drew</b> up; the <b>poultry</b> picking about the path and among the chips lazily made way for us, and as our wheels ceased to crunch upon the gravel we heard hasty steps, and Reuben Camp came round the corner of the house in time to give Mrs. Makely his hand and help her spring to the ground, which she did very lightly; her remarkable mind had kept her body in a sort of sympathetic activity, and at thirty-five she had the gracile ease and self-command of a girl.|$|R
