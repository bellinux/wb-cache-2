60|$|Before the Longestaffes left London {{to receive}} their new friends the Melmottes at Caversham, a treaty had been made between Mr Longestaffe, the father, and Georgiana, the strong-minded {{daughter}}. The daughter on her side undertook that the guests should be treated with feminine courtesy. This {{might be called the}} most-favoured-nation clause. The Melmottes were to be treated exactly as though old Melmotte had been a gentleman and Madame Melmotte a lady. In return for this the Longestaffe family were to be allowed to return to town. But here again the father had carried another clause. The prolonged sojourn in town was to be only for six weeks. On the 10th of July the Longestaffes were to be removed into the country {{for the remainder of the}} year. When the question of a foreign tour was proposed, the father became absolutely violent in his refusal. 'In God's name where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> money is to come from?' When Georgiana urged that other people had money to go abroad, her father told her that a time was coming in which she might think it lucky if she had a house over her head. This, however, she took as having been said with poetical licence, the same threat having been made more than once before. The treaty was very clear, and the parties to it were prepared to carry it out with fair honesty. The Melmottes were being treated with decent courtesy, and the house in town was not dismantled.|$|E

[...] Political activist Robert B. Choate, Jr. first {{came up with the idea}} of forming a joint congressional committee to probe the hunger problem. [...] McGovern, who had been involved in food-related issues throughout his congressional career and who had been Director of Food for Peace in the Kennedy administration during the early 1960s, thought that confining the committee to just the more liberal Senate would produce better chances for action. [...] McGovern gathered 38 co-sponsors for the committee's creation, a resolution quickly passed the Senate, and McGovern was named the committee's chairman in July 1968. [...] However, the Senate Rules Committee gave essentially no funding to it that year, so it was inactive; in February 1969, McGovern successfully battled the Rules Committee to restore the normally allocated funding and the select committee's operations began.|$|E
40|$|A {{three year}} {{research}} study entitled ‘Improving {{the effectiveness of}} Formative Assessment in Science Teaching’, involving Biosciences and Physical Sciences staff and students at two UK Universities, has been examining the potential for improving student learning by making changes to the way formative assessment and feedback are presented. Whilst initial findings from the research outline similarities and differences in perceptions of the two institutions (see Gibbs 2002; Gibbs, Simpson and Macdonald 2003), this paper focuses {{on the effectiveness of}} written feedback at both universities. The paper presents a more detailed analysis specifically of the perceptions of the levels and relative effectiveness of written feedback. Some key qualities of this feedback, and some examples of inappropriate use are identified, providing insights into possible changes in the nature of, and approach to written feedback to students. The research described in this paper was carried out by the Formative Assessment in Science Teaching (FAST) project during the period 2003 - 2006 and has formed the basis for a workshop organised by the Centre for Bioscience in London (26 th Jan 2006) and again at Wolverhampton (22 nd Feb 2006). The workshop focused on the categories of feedback given to students, including: noting of omissions and use of English, investigated the effectiveness of different types of written feedback, and asked “if a comment is made, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> student to do about it?...|$|E

The Americans quickly realized that the Iraqi is a patriot, one who defends his country, just as his ancestors have done for thousands of years. We are an educated people with a long history, and we are a cultured people. The Americans also did not <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> infrastructure they found in Iraq. They were surprised. They couldn't understand that a dictator like Saddam Hussein had invested {{a large share of}} oil revenues in infrastructure projects, such as highways, modern irrigation canals and industrial plants, which one doesn't find in just any country. The marines were confused by this new realization, as well as by their failure to achieve a swift victory and by the ongoing resistance. It also confounded the American concept, that is, if a sound and credible concept ever existed. No people in the world wishes to live with occupiers, and we Iraqis are no different." [...] Pachachi also commented on the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse [...] "What kind of reaction <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> from <b>the</b> Iraqis? Regardless of age, profession and political affiliation, we are all horrified and furious about these atrocities. I had already heard about the brusque approach taken by the Americans during house searches early on. However, I was completely taken aback by the gruesome scope of the torture and human rights violations that have now come to light. Not just I, but all Iraqis demand a tough investigation and punishment of the perpetrators and the people behind them. We also need guarantees that such atrocities will cease once and for all.

I say, without seeking it cannot be known at all. It can neither be declared from pulpits, nor set down in Articles, nor in anywise [...] "prepared and sold" [...] in packages, ready for use. Truth must be ground for every man by himself out of its husk, with such help as he can get, indeed, but not without stern labor of his own.

40|$|SUMMARY: We review Fermi’s paradox (or the ”Great Silence ” problem), {{not only}} arguably {{the oldest and}} crucial problem for the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI), but also a {{conundrum}} of profound scientific, philosophical and cultural importance. By a simple analysis of observation selection effects, the correct resolution of Fermi’s paradox is certain to {{tell us something about}} the future of humanity. Already more than three quarters of century old puzzle – and a quarter of century since the last major review paper in the field by G. David Brin – has generated many ingenious discussions and hypotheses. We analyze the often tacit methodological assumptions built in various answers to this puzzle and attempt a new classification of the numerous solutions proposed in an already huge literature on the subject. Finally, we consider the ramifications of various classes of hypotheses for the practical SETI projects. Somewhat paradoxically, it seems that the class of (neo) catastrophic hypotheses gives, on the balance, the strongest justification to optimism regarding our current and near-future SETI efforts. Key words. Astrobiology – Extraterrestrial intelligence – Galaxy: evolution – His-tory and philosophy of astronomy If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> unexpected, <b>you</b> will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult...|$|R
