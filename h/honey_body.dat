40|$|Differentiating coffees {{through the}} notion of terroirs allows us to {{determine}} potential areas for specialty coffee production and to characterize the type of coffee in these areas, exploring their potential. The objective of this work was to study spatial variability quality and to characterize and delimit terroirs in coffee crop production in Araponga municipality, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, using sensorial evaluation. The {{data were collected from}} four crops, from altitudes ranging from 770 to 1270 m, with the extract increasing from low to high. In each plot of crops, samples of cherry fruits were collected, dried, benefited, subjected to sensorial analysis and given grades ranging from 0 to 100 points for the global drink quality and relative characteristics of <b>honey,</b> <b>body,</b> acidity, flavor and equilibrium. The spatial variability of the quality was analyzed using the Moran Index. To define coffee production terroirs, average quality grades were compared through separation tests and the individual values of the plots were subjected to an analysis of groupings. The study was efficient in identifying terroirs for mountain coffee culture, therefore allowing coffees to be differentiated as a function of their production locations. Araponga has more than one coffee production terroir characterized by two distinct altitude extracts...|$|E

5000|$|In all {{stinging}} Hymenoptera {{the sting}} is a modified ovipositor. Unlike most other stings, honey bee workers' stings are strongly barbed and lodge {{in the flesh}} of mammals upon use, tearing free from the <b>honey</b> bee's <b>body,</b> killing the bee within minutes. The sting has its own ganglion, {{and it continues to}} saw into the target's flesh and release venom for several minutes. This trait is of obvious disadvantage to the individual but protects the hive from attacks by large animals. The barbs of a honey bee's attack are only suicidal if the skin is elastic, as is characteristic of vertebrates such as birds and mammals; honey bees can sting other insects repeatedly without dying.|$|R

Honey and ginger have been shown to exhibit antioxidant activity which can scavenge ROS. The main aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the antioxidant and antidiabetic effects of gelam honey, ginger, and their combination. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 major groups which consisted of diabetic and nondiabetic rats. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin intramuscularly (55 [*]mg/kg body weight). Each group was further divided into 4 smaller groups according to the supplements administered: distilled water, <b>honey</b> (2 [*]g/kg <b>body</b> weight), ginger (60 [*]mg/kg <b>body</b> weight), and <b>honey</b> + ginger. <b>Body</b> weight and glucose levels were recorded weekly, while blood from the orbital sinus was obtained after 3 weeks of supplementation for the estimation of metabolic profile: glucose, triglyceride (TG), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH) : oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and malondialdehyde (MDA). The combination of gelam honey and ginger did not show hypoglycaemic potential; however, the combination treatment reduced significantly (P< 0. 05) SOD and CAT activities as well as MDA level, while GSH level and GSH/GSSG ratio were significantly elevated (P< 0. 05) in STZ-induced diabetic rats compared to diabetic control rats...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Honey's</b> lifeless <b>body</b> {{would be}} picked up by Hiromi, who {{forcibly}} purges her powers from her and transfers them over to Yuki. The conversion turned Yuki evil, with a will to destroy. After Miki retrieves her, she is revived by Mayumi and Miki's powers were transferred over to her. When she came to, the first person to greet her was Hayami, who didn't have the heart to tell her the truth about everything. She would then run to Professor Kisaragi's mansion to find out the truth for herself. It was there that she finally meets up with Yuki again, this time completely under Hiromi's control. She initially refused to fight her, but after finding the backup limiter, she Flashed, this time with a blue outfit and Kukri weapon similar to Miki's. After Hiromi was killed by Yuki, Honey managed to ultimately destroy her. After the battle was over, Honey decided to help out Hayami, now truly known as the Warrior of Love, Cutie Honey. In the epilogue, it is hinted that both Miki and Yuki [...] "live on" [...] inside Honey as Honey demonstrated fighting techniques similar to Miki's headbutt and Yuki's kick.|$|R
5000|$|In the Bhagavata, {{the text}} speaks of Vaikuntha, adorable {{to all the}} worlds (X.12.26), as the highest realm where Visnu resides (XII.24.14).

The peaceful ascetics who reach that place never return (IV.9.29; X.88.25-6). The residents of Vaikuntha do not have material bodies, but have pure forms (VII.1.34). These forms are like that of Visnu (III.15.14ff.), also known as Narayana. Visnu/Narayana resides in Vaikuntha with Sri, the goddess of fortune, in palaces with crystal walls. The parks there shine like final liberation itself, and contain wish-fulfilling trees, which blossom all the year round.

Yuji returns to see both Yuki's and <b>Honey's</b> lifeless <b>bodies.</b> Their bodies were eventually taken by Hiromi and her husband whose plans were to take Honey's powers and transfer them over to Yuki's body. This process turns her evil with a will to destroy anything in her path.

In the battle with Honey the backup limiter is destroyed. However, still unable to gain control of herself, she kills Hiromi and continues to fight Honey who ultimately destroys her. After her body is destroyed, Yuki comes to Hayami as a spirit with a final request for him to take care of Honey.|$|R

40|$|Nutrient {{sensitive}} insulin-like peptides (ILPs) {{have profound}} effects on invertebrate metabolism, nutrient storage, fertility and aging. Many insects transcribe ILPs in specialized neurosecretory cells at changing levels correlated with life history. However, the major site of insect metabolism and nutrient storage {{is not the}} brain, but rather the fat body, where functions of ILP expression are rarely studied and poorly understood. Fat body is analogous to mammalian liver and adipose tissue, with nutrient stores that often correlate with behavior. We used the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an insect with complex behavior, to test whether ILP genes in fat body respond to experimentally induced changes of behavioral physiology. <b>Honey</b> bee fat <b>body</b> influences endocrine state and behavior by secreting the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vg), which suppresses lipophilic juvenile hormone and social foraging behavior. In a two-factorial experiment, we used RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated vg gene knockdown and amino acid nutrient enrichment of hemolymph (blood) to perturb this regulatory module. We document factor-specific changes in fat body ilp 1 and ilp 2 mRNA, the bee`s ILP-encoding genes, and confirm that our protocol affects social behavior. We show that ilp 1 and ilp 2 are regulated independently and differently and diverge in their specific expression-localization between fat body oenocyte and trophocyte cells. Insect ilp functions may be better understood by broadening research to account for expression in fat body and not only brain.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{the presence of}} the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi in vegetation assemblages impacts on habitat utilisation by the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus). The study took place in coastal heathlands at Cape Riche, Western Australia, between January 2007 and November 2007. Honey possums were radio tracked through an area affected with P. cinnamomi as well as healthy areas {{to determine the extent to}} which habitat utilisation is impacted on. This will then allow for a more robust prediction of how further spread of P. cinnamomi is likely to impact on honey possums in the future. The presence of P. cinnamomi was confirmed by plating samples of dying plants. The areas of P. cinnamomi at the study site are extensive but patchy with ‘islands’ of healthy vegetation assemblages still remaining. A comparison of microclimate at the study site showed that unaffected areas had a larger range of temperatures than affected areas which may be due to differences in wind which is restricted (having a buffering effect) due to dense vegetation in unaffected sites. In affected areas, a greater proportion of the time was recorded where temperature was below 5 C compared with unaffected areas. This could potentially impact on honey possums, which go into torpor during cool weather, and at temperatures below 5 C, have a higher metabolic rate to maintain their body temperature. This means they need to forage for more nectar and pollen during cooler weather in affected areas where foodplants are less abundant. The number of honey possums captured was correlated to season ( 2 = 13. 1, p< 0. 0005) with the largest number of honey possums captured during the summer field trip when more plants were flowering. Honey possum preferred foodplants were identified from pollen collected from captured honey possums. A total of 20 different pollen species were identified from samples, nine of which were identified as important honey possum preferred foodplants as they were found in more significant amounts. Based on pollen, Banksia plumosa subsp. plumosa was identified as the preferred foodplant at the Cape Riche study site followed by Adenanthos cuneatus. Both are common throughout the study area and flower all year. Banksia plumosa subsp. plumosa is susceptible to P. cinnamomi and was only found in unaffected areas whereas Adenanthos cuneatus was found to less susceptible and was prevalent throughout P. cinnamomi affected areas. Honey possums fed on a diverse range of plant species (determined by pollen) during all seasons, except autumn when B. plumosa subsp. plumosa was the most prevalent pollen species collected from honey possums. A total of 18 <b>honey</b> possums (<b>body</b> mass 5. 9 – 16 g) were radio tracked for up to 9 days using radio transmitters weighing 0. 36 g and 0. 9 g (Holohil Systems Ltd, Canada). Radio tracked honey possums demonstrated a particular preference for Banksia plumosa subsp. plumosa which they utilised for food, shelter and as a daytime refuge. Comparison of vegetation structure indicated that sites selected by radio tracked honey possums had significantly denser vegetation between 40 - 140 cm in height compared with randomly selected sites. Significant differences were identified between Phytophthora cinnamomi affected and unaffected locations with vegetation at affected locations being sparser and shorter than that at unaffected sites. This study clearly showed that honey possums are influenced by the presence of P. cinnamomi affected vegetation at Cape Riche. The presence of P. cinnamomi at the study area results in large areas which are generally lacking in susceptible Proteaceous species such as Banksia and food resources tend to be sparse through these areas. Honey possums are capable of moving relatively large distances with estimated distances ranging from 4 m to 1400 m over a period of 30 minutes to 9 days. In areas affected with P. cinnamomi some honey possums fed on less susceptible plant species. Other honey possums moved long distances to healthy unaffected areas with higher densities of preferred foodplants. Further spread of P. cinnamomi is likely to have a serious impact on honey possums as healthy areas become affected and food resources become too limited to sustain honey possum populations...|$|R
