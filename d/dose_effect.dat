40|$|Purpose: In MRI-linac treatments, {{radiation}} dose distributions {{are affected by}} magnetic fields, especially at high-density/low-density interfaces. Radiobiological consequences of magnetic field <b>dose</b> <b>effects</b> are presently unknown and preclinical studies are desirable. This study investigates the optimal combination of beam energy and magnetic field strength needed for preclinical murine studies. Methods : The Monte Carlo code MCNP 6 was used to simulate {{the effects of a}} magnetic field when irradiating a mouse lung phantom with a 1. 0 cm × 1. 0 cm photon beam. Magnetic field <b>dose</b> <b>effects</b> were examined using various beam energies (225 kVp, 662 keV [Cs- 137], and 1. 25 MeV [Co- 60]) and magnetic field strengths (0. 75 T, 1. 5 T, and 3 T). The resulting dose distributions were compared to Monte Carlo results for humans with various field sizes and patient geometries using a 6 MV/ 1. 5 T MRI-linac. Results: In human simulations, the addition of a 1. 5 T magnetic field causes an average dose increase of 49 % (range: 36 % - 60 %) to lung at the soft tissue-lung interface and an average dose decrease of 30 % (range: 25 % - 36 %) at the lung-soft tissue interface. In mouse simulations, no magnetic field <b>dose</b> <b>effects</b> were seen with the 225 kVp beam. The dose increase for the Cs- 137 beam was 12 %, 33 %, and 49 % for 0. 75 T, 1. 5 T, and 3. 0 T magnetic fields, respectively while the dose decrease was 7 %, 23 %, and 33 %. For the Co- 60 beam the dose increase was 14 %, 45 %, and 41 %, and the dose decrease was 18 %, 35 %, and 35 %. Conclusion : The magnetic field <b>dose</b> <b>effects</b> observed in mouse phantoms using a Co- 60 beam with 1. 5 T or 3 T fields or a Cs- 137 beam with a 3 T field fall within the range seen in humans treated with an MRI-linac. These irradiator/magnet combinations are therefore suitable for preclinical studies investigating potential biological effects of delivering radiation therapy {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field.

40|$|Abstract Background The true <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> in flexible-dose {{clinical}} trials may be obscured and even reversed because dose and outcome are related. Methods To evaluate <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> in response on primary efficacy scales from 2 randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose trials {{of patients with}} bipolar mania who received olanzapine (N = 234, 5 – 20 mg/day), or patients with schizophrenia who received olanzapine (N = 172, 10 – 20 mg/day), we used marginal structural models, inverse probability of treatment weighting (MSM, IPTW) methodology. Dose profiles for mean changes from baseline were evaluated using weighted MSM with a repeated measures model. To adjust for selection bias due to non-random dose assignment and dropouts, patient-specific time-dependent weights were determined as products of (i) stable weights based on inverse probability of receiving the sequence of dose assignments that was actually received by a patient up to given time multiplied by (ii) stable weights based on inverse probability of patient remaining on treatment by that time. Results were compared with those by unweighted analyses. Results While the observed difference in efficacy scores for dose groups for the unweighted analysis strongly favored lower doses, the weighted analyses showed no strong dose effects and, in some cases, reversed the apparent "negative <b>dose</b> <b>effect.</b> " Conclusion While naïve comparison of groups by last or modal dose in a flexible-dose trial may result in severely biased efficacy analyses, the MSM with IPTW estimators approach may be a valuable method of removing these biases and evaluating potential <b>dose</b> <b>effect,</b> which may prove useful for planning confirmatory trials. </p...|$|E

I also measured renal mitochondrial 24 -OHase activity in mice fed control and low phosphate diets and representing all five genotypes. I further studied serum AP activity and vertebral bone histomorphometry in the five genotypes. The mutant animals all had uniformly and significantly different values than unaffected littermates.

40|$|CMOS {{integrated}} circuits (ICs) operating in space or other radiation environments can suffer {{from three different}} reliability problems due to the radiation: total <b>dose</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>dose</b> rate <b>effects,</b> and single event effects. The two most significant total-dose reliability problems are subthreshold, gat, end-around leakage current and threshold voltage shift. This article documents the theory, design, implementation, and testing of new, second-layer polysilicon structures that can compensate for radiation-induced, subthreshold, gate, end-around, leakage current. Second-layer polysilicon is available in many commercial, bulk CMOS processes and is normally used for floating-gate devices, such as EEPROMs and FPLAs, and charge-coupled devices such as CCD focal plan arrays. The use of the described structures in CMOS ICs would allow radiation tolerant ICs to be fabricated with commercial, bulk CMOS processors, greatly reducing manufacturing costs {{when compared to the}} cost of fabricating ICs on dedicated, radiation-hardened process lines...|$|R
