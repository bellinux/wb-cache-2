6000|$|Nevertheless, {{dead silence}} reigned {{everywhere}} in the court as the clerk of arraigns put the solemn question, [...] "Gentlemen, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?" ...|$|E

3000|$|Were the {{learning}} activities (such as video demonstrations) helpful {{for you to}} learn the concepts/materials? What kind of activity (activities) <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> most helpful? [...]...|$|R

6000|$|... "Tush, Mabel! The Sergeant {{knows what}} the woods be, and what men--true red men--be, too. There is little need to tell him {{anything}} about it. Well, now you have met your father, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> honest old soldier {{the sort of person}} you expected to find?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My duties keep me here," [...] father answered; [...] "and I cannot {{honestly}} say that I enjoy traveling. I dislike manners and customs that are strange to me; I don't find that hotels reward me for {{giving up the}} comforts of my own house.

6000|$|... "Well, lads," [...] {{said the}} farmer as they {{commenced}} the meal--which {{was a second}} edition of breakfast, tea included, but with more meat and vegetables--"how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> work? pretty hard--eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane," [...] I {{said after}} a few minutes' {{careless}} talk--for I didn't like {{to tell her about}} my wonderful dream,--"where exactly <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> picture of that house hanging over in the corner there?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Just so," [...] said Charnock carelessly. [...] "This is a {{warm place}} for a quiet smoke, and the foreman can't tell how long one ought to stop, {{particularly}} as you're sometimes out at the machine-shop. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> boys meddle with your tools if they come in while you're away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But where, among beasts, do {{you ever}} find any trace of those two sacred human feelings--the love of brother to brother, or of child to father?

6000|$|... "By the way, I {{wonder if}} {{the man who wrote}} it is a {{relation}} of our Fenn. It may be his brother--I believe he writes. You probably remember him when he was here.

6000|$|Coulthurst banged {{his hand}} down on the table. [...] "Then I {{think there will be}} an end of the trouble--and the affair could be {{arranged}} to meet your views. But however <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> way into the Westerhouse country?" ...|$|R

30|$|SYSTEM: Pick {{the big red}} {{building}} block. LISTENER: [inspects a competitor] SYSTEM: Further {{toward the}} left! (contrastive) LISTENER: [inspects the target] SYSTEM: Yes, that one! LISTENER: [grasps the target] SYSTEM: Well done! After finishing a layout, participants filled in a questionnaire assessing their perception and impressions of their interaction with the system. Participants answered 13 questions to judge the interaction in each instructional ambiguity approach. Eight questions were followed by a five-point Likert scale (1 indicating a very good and 5 a poor score), e.g., ``How good/precise <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> spoken instructions?'' or ``How flexible <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> interaction?'' In addition, there were five yes/no questions, such as ``Was the system's feedback confusing?'' to assess if the interaction with the system felt natural. The question ``Were the instructions exhaustive, i.e., {{you were able to}} identify a target upon hearing the instruction?'' checked whether the participants paid attention. In a final questionnaire, they were asked five yes/no questions to compare both interaction strategies and assess user preferences. The experiment lasted between 30 and 45 minutes.|$|R

6000|$|... "A capital idea. Do you {{go there}} often? How ever <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> time for such things?" [...] asked Kitty, busily cutting from a big sheet the {{touching}} picture of a parent bird with a red head and a blue tail offering {{what looked like a}} small boa constrictor to one of its nestlings, a fat young squab with a green head, yellow body, and no tail at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} testing you, and you ring true every time. Well, it {{is a great}} {{responsibility}} that I take upon myself, but I have given Hopkins an excellent hint and if he can't avail himself of it I can do no more. See here, Captain Crocker, we'll do this in due form of law. You are the prisoner. Watson, you are a British jury, and I never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one.

"We can't ignore Tom's {{intimacy}} with them--it amounts to that; {{it will probably}} continue even if it's merely a fancy, and we must seem to know it; whatever comes of it, we can't disown it.

"She's a brick," [...] said Rossmore to the Major; [...] "just {{her father}} all over: prompt to labor with head or hands, and {{not ashamed of}} it; capable, always capable, let the {{enterprise}} be what it may; successful by nature-- don't know what defeat is; thus, intensely and practically American by inhaled nationalism, {{and at the same}} time intensely and aristocratically European by inherited nobility of blood.

6000|$|... 11. Landor. In what respect does Landor show a {{reaction}} from Romanticism? What qualities make Landor's poems stand out so clearly in the memory? Why, for instance, do you think Lamb was so haunted by [...] "Rose Aylmer"? Quote from Landor's poems to illustrate his tenderness, his sensitiveness to beauty, his power of awakening emotion, his delicacy of characterization. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> same qualities in his prose? Can you explain why much of his prose seems like a translation from the Greek? Compare a passage from the Imaginary Conversations with a passage from Gibbon or Johnson, to show {{the difference between the}} classic and the pseudo-classic style. Compare one of Landor's characters, in Imaginary Conversations, with the same character in history.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 former Red Rider lead singer, Tom Cochrane, {{named his}} third album Ragged Ass Road after the street.

[...] and had the chorus [...] "Oh <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> midnight sun" [...] Down on Ragged Ass Road."

60|$|It is the {{interest}}, {{and it is}} the duty, {{and because}} it is the interest and the duty, it is the right of government to attend much to opinions; because, as opinions soon combine with passions, even when they do not produce them, they have much influence on actions. Factions are formed upon opinions, which factions become in effect bodies corporate in the state; nay, factions generate opinions, in order to become a centre of union, and to furnish watchwords to parties; and this may make it expedient for government to forbid things in themselves innocent and neutral. I am not fond of defining with precision what the ultimate rights of the sovereign supreme power, in providing {{for the safety of the}} commonwealth, may be, or may not extend to. It will signify very little what my notions or what their own notions on the subject may be; because, according to the exigence, they will take, in fact, the steps which seem to them necessary for the preservation of the whole: for as self-preservation in individuals is the first law of Nature, the same will prevail in societies, who will, right or wrong, make that an object paramount to all other rights whatsoever. There are ways and means by which a good man would not even save the commonwealth.... All things founded on the idea of danger ought in a great degree to be temporary. All policy is very suspicious that sacrifices any part to the ideal good of the whole. The object of the state is (as far as may be) the happiness of the whole. Whatever makes multitudes of men utterly miserable can never answer that object; indeed, it contradicts it wholly and entirely; and the happiness or misery of mankind, estimated by their feelings and sentiments, and not by any theories of their rights, is, and ought to be, the standard for the conduct of legislators towards the people. This naturally and necessarily conducts us to the peculiar and characteristic situation of a people, and to a knowledge of their opinions, prejudices, habits, and all the circumstances that diversify and color life. The first question a good statesman would ask himself, therefore, would be, How and in what circumstances <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> society? and to act upon them.|$|E
