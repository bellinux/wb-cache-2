5|$|Gyromancer is {{a puzzle}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by PopCap Games {{in collaboration with}} Square Enix. In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told {{through a series of}} cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.|$|E

5|$|The Louisiana Superdome {{was chosen}} as the venue for the Final Four of the 1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The Superdome was {{selected}} over Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky. Throughout the 1970s, the NCAA had considered hosting the Final <b>Four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> domed football stadium, and the 1982 Final Four {{was the first time the}} tournament was held in a domed football stadium since 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Tigers {{won their}} next two games before losing <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row, but {{remained}} competitive in every game, {{largely due to}} the play of Cannon and Taylor. LSU completed the season with a win over their rival team Tulane and a 5–5 record, although they had been predicted to finish last in their conference. At the end of the season, Cannon was included on the Associated Press (AP) Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Sophomore team and the United Press International (UPI) All-SEC second team. He also had the leading kickoff return average in the country (31.2 yards).|$|E

5|$|The {{field for}} the main event {{consisted}} only of 30 trucks {{instead of the usual}} 36, with the top 20 trucks in the owner's points standings guaranteed a spot. To determine the field, two-lap qualifying runs were held, which determined the starting grids for five heat races of eight laps each. The top five fastest qualifiers started on the pole for the heats, and the highest non-locked-in truck were transferred in to the main event until there were 25 trucks in the field. For drivers that did not qualify via the heats, the top <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> last-chance qualifier advance, with the final spot reserved for the most recent series champion, and if that spot is vacant, the fifth-place finisher in the LCQ would qualify for the main event.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not be playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that any move would depend on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Johnson had {{his second}} best {{statistical}} season of his NFL career, reaching a career-high 1,681 receiving yards and 16touchdowns. In Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson helped rally the Lions from a 24-point deficit to a 3430 victory by catching two touchdown {{passes in the}} fourth quarter, including a famous catch in which Johnson beat the Cowboys' triple coverage in the end zone. This performance gave Johnson eighttouchdown receptions through the first four {{games of the season}} and tied Cris Carter for most consecutive games with multiple touchdown receptions with <b>four.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> Week17 game against the Green Bay Packers, Johnson had a then career-best 244receiving yards in a 4541 loss.

5|$|In all, Hutson caught 488 {{passes for}} 7,991 yards and 99 touchdowns. He rushed for three touchdowns, scored two touchdowns on blocked punts, {{and had an}} {{interception}} return touchdown for a career total of 105. He scored at least six receiving touchdowns {{in each of his}} eleven seasons. Hutson led the NFL in receptions eight times, including five consecutive times: 1941 to 1945. He led the NFL in receiving yards seven times, including four straight times: 1941 to 1944. He led the NFL in scoring five times: 1941 to 1945. As of 2016, Hutson still holds the highest career average touchdowns per game for a receiver, at 0.85. Hutson's single season record of 17 touchdown receptions in 1942 stood for 42 years until broken by receiver Mark Clayton in 1984, a year in which Miami's quarterback Dan Marino had more completions (362) than the entire 1942 Packers team's pass attempts (330). His four receiving touchdowns in a game has been surpassed three times and tied several times, but his <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single quarter has yet to be matched. His record 99 touchdown receptions stood for 44 years, well into the modern era. In his eleven-year professional career, Hutson never missed a game due to injury. He invented many pass routes still in use today, including the chair route.|$|E
5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} a colony {{only has a}} single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Maryland {{was again}} named the top-seed, despite having lost to second-seed Johns Hopkins {{during the regular}} season. In the championship game, Hopkins quickly took the lead, led by Hall of Fame attackman Jack Thomas and entered halftime with a 10–4 advantage. In the second half, Maryland outscored them 8–7, but the effort fell short. In 1975, Maryland defeated Hopkins, 19–11, before winning the national title, and won again the following year, 21–13, {{on their way to}} finish as national championship runners-up after an overtime loss to Cornell in the final. In 1977, the Blue Jays edged the Terrapins, 21–20, in the regular season and began a run in the series. Hopkins eliminated Maryland in the tournament semifinals in both 1977 and 1978, before beating them in the 1979 championship game at home in College Park, Maryland. During that game, the Blue Jays were able to limit the Terrapins' second all-time leading scorer and 1979 attackman of the year Bob Boneillo. During the 1970s, Maryland participated in six NCAA title games, including <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row from 1973 to 1976. During that span, the Terps won two national titles and lost four.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{still had}} considerable strength when it entered southeastern Georgia. The winds brought down telephone, telegraph, and electric wires throughout the region, severing communications. Damage in the Sea Islands was extensive, costing an estimated $500,000; by some accounts, the winds were {{more intense than}} in the catastrophic hurricane of 1893, but without the exceptionally high storm surge. The tropical cyclone caused severe damage to the islands' plantations, ruining around {{a third of the}} rice crop, devastating the cotton crop, and killing up to 100 people. Charlton and Camden counties bore the brunt of the storm's force in Georgia, as evidenced by the complete clearing of dense pine forests east of Folkston. This dealt a $500,000 blow to the turpentine industry. Many structures in Folkston were destroyed, including multiple churches, a courthouse, and a school that collapsed with 38 students inside, all of whom safely escaped. In small communities throughout extreme southeastern Georgia, the storm caused widespread destruction of homes and businesses. Six people in Camden County were killed, including <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> logging settlement that was ravaged near the Florida border.|$|E
5|$|Then, in the Madrid Open, Murray {{defeated}} Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori {{to reach}} the final, where he defeated Nadal in straight sets to win his first Masters title on clay and first since 2013. This {{was also the first}} time he had beaten another member of the Big <b>Four</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Tour match since his victory in the final at Wimbledon 2013, going into the match 0–12 against the other members. The defeat saw Nadal slip to seventh in the rankings, his first time outside the Top 5 for more than a decade. Djokovic, returning after skipping Madrid, again defeated Federer in the final for his fourth Masters title of the year in Rome. Nadal suffered his worst European clay-court season in a decade, failing to win a single title and appearing in just one final, whereas Djokovic and Murray entered the second Grand Slam event of the year unbeaten on clay.|$|E
