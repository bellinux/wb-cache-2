5|$|Some critics {{made little}} or no {{distinction}} between Pussy Riot and Voina, incorrectly attributing past actions of Voina to Pussy Riot. In particular, a notorious performance by Voina in St. Petersburg, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> stole a chicken from a supermarket by stuffing it in her vagina, is sometimes cited by detractors of Pussy Riot. However, {{there is no evidence}} that members of Moscow-based Pussy Riot participated in this action.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1889, a range detective {{from the}} Association named George Henderson accused Ella Watson, a local rancher, of {{stealing}} cattle from a fellow rancher {{by the name}} of Albert John Bothwell. The cattlemen sent riders to arrest Ella before apprehending her husband, Jim Averell, as well. Both of them were subsequently hanged from a tree. This gruesome act was one of the rare cases in the Old West <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> was lynched, an event that appalled many of the local residents and paved the way for future conflicts in the war. County Sheriff Frank Hadsell arrested six men for the lynching and a trial date was set. However, before the trial, threats were sent to the witnesses who would testify against the aggressors. One of those witnesses was young Gene Crowder, who mysteriously disappeared under unknown circumstances before the trial. Another, Jim's nephew and foreman Frank Buchanan, disappeared from the county as well after a shoot-out with unknown suspects, and was presumed to be hiding or murdered. Ralph Cole, another nephew of Averell's, died {{on the day of the}} trial from poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Fraternal {{polyandry}} (from the Latin frater—brother), {{also called}} adelphic polyandry, {{is a form}} of polyandry <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> is married to two or more men who are one another's brothers. Fraternal polyandry was (and sometimes still is) found in certain areas of Tibet, Nepal, and Northern India, where polyandry was accepted as a social practice. The Toda people of southern India practice fraternal polyandry, but monogamy has become prevalent recently. In contemporary Hindu society, polyandrous marriages in agrarian societies in the Malwa region of Punjab seem to occur to avoid division of farming land.|$|E
25|$|A similar anointing is {{described}} in the Gospel of Luke as occurring {{at the home of}} one Simon the Pharisee <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who had been sinful all her life, and who was crying, anointed Jesus' feet and, when her tears started to fall on his feet, she wiped them with her hair. Luke's account (as well as John's) differs from that of Matthew and Mark by relating that the anointing is to the feet rather than the head. Although it is a subject of considerable debate, many scholars hold that these actually describe two separate events.|$|E

25|$|Many {{other works}} of bawdy and satirical English {{literature}} of the period deal with the subject. Dildoides: A Burlesque Poem (London, 1706), attributed to Samuel Butler, is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities. Examples of anonymous works include The Bauble, a tale (London, 1721) and Monsieur Thing's Origin: or Seignor D---o's Adventures in London, (London, 1722). In 1746, Henry Fielding wrote The Female Husband: or the surprising history of Mrs Mary, alias Mr. George Hamilton, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> posing as a man uses a dildo. This was a fictionalized account {{of the story of}} Mary Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|The {{minister}} {{moving the}} bill argued that since 1973, the government's intention was {{for people who}} had changed gender/sex {{to live a life}} according to their new gender, including the right to marry. Through an oversight, the law relating to marriage had not been re-aligned with the official policy to recognise sex reassignment surgery. Now that the courts had illuminated this inconsistency after a landmark case <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> sought and won the annulment of her marriage to a trans man (Lim Ying v Hiok Kian Ming Eric), it was necessary to amend the Women's Charter to ensure that the original intent was not undermined. Transgender people were officially granted their wish on 24 January 1996 via an announcement by MP Abdullah Tarmugi without much public fanfare or opposition.|$|E
500|$|Some of Hornung's novels, {{including}} The Shadow of the Rope, No Hero and The Thousandth Woman, are {{notable for}} [...] "portraying {{women in a}} rather modern, favorable light", according to the critic for Contemporary Authors, showing concern for their unequal position in society. Cox identifies a theme of guilt running {{through a number of}} works. Among these is Peccavi, in which a clergyman lives his life trying to atone for an earlier crime; Shadow of the Rope, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> is accused of her husband's murder; and The Thousandth Woman, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> stands by her lover after he is accused of murder.|$|E

50|$|In 1921 {{the film}} was {{submitted}} to the British Board of Film Classification for approval. The censor was very strict regarding the depiction of prostitution in films.

The board rejected the film on 23 March 1921 and the film's distributors- Elijah Day & Sons Ltd- accepted the decision and did not attempt to challenge it. The board specified in its 1921 report that depicting the loss of virginity for any purpose would be grounds for rejection. The film was never screened in Britain though the British Film Institute bought a print of the film in 1937.|$|R

[...] Delacroix's Liberty leads a group of Parisians who have taken up arms, while the subject of The Cross of France stands alone. Brooks used this romantic image of a figure in heroic isolation in both the 1912 portrait of D'Annunzio and her 1914 self-portrait; the subjects are wrapped in dark cloaks and isolated against seascapes.|$|E
500|$|Religion was the {{one area}} of public life in which women could {{participate}} freely; according to Christopher Carey, it was the [...] "only area of Greek life <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> could approach anything like {{the influence of a}} man". Women's religious activities, including responsibility for mourning at funerals and involvement in female and mixed-sex cult activity, were an indispensable part of Athenian society. [...] Both Athenian and non-Athenian women participated in public religious activities.
