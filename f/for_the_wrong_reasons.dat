5|$|Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) {{arrive in}} Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) hastily {{arranged}} wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison (Gary Sweet) is {{surprised to learn}} that his daughter is getting married to a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>reasons.</b> Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fiancé Shawn (Sandy Winton), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>reasons).</b>|$|E

500|$|The episode makes {{prominent}} use of John 11:25–26 {{from the}} Christian Bible, which reads [...] "Who soever liveth and believeth in me shall never die".

500|$|Like cult films themselves, {{magazines}} and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness.
