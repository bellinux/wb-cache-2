40|$|The {{computational}} thermodynamic {{analysis of}} a samarium oxide-based two-step solar thermochemical water splitting cycle is reported. The analysis is performed using HSC chemistry software and databases. The first (solar-based) step drives the thermal reduction of Sm 2 O 3 into Sm and O 2. The second (non-solar) step corresponds {{to the production of}} H 2 via a water splitting reaction and the oxidation of Sm to Sm 2 O 3. The equilibrium thermodynamic compositions related to the thermal reduction and water splitting steps are determined. The effect of oxygen partial pressure in the inert <b>flushing</b> <b>gas</b> on the thermal reduction temperature (TH) is examined. An analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics is performed to determine the cycle efficiency (ηcycle) and solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency (ηsolar−to−fuel) attainable with and without heat recuperation. The results indicate that ηcycle and ηsolar−to−fuel both increase with decreasing TH, due to the reduction in oxygen partial pressure in the inert <b>flushing</b> <b>gas.</b> Furthermore, the recuperation of heat for the operation of the cycle significantly improves the solar reactor efficiency. For instance, in the case where TH = 2280 K, ηcycle = 24. 4 % and ηsolar−to−fuel = 29. 5 % (without heat recuperation), while ηcycle = 31. 3 % and ηsolar−to−fuel = 37. 8 % (with 40 % heat recuperation) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{transient}} movements of solidification fronts {{has been added}} to X-stream, an existing multi-physics simulation program for high temperature processes with flow and chemical reactions. The implementation uses an enthalpy formulation and works on fixed grids. First we show the results of a 2 D tin solidification benchmark case, which allows a comparison of X-stream to two other codes and to measurements. Second, a complete 3 D solar silicon Heat Exchange Method (HEM) furnace, as built by PVA TePla is modeled. Here, it was necessary to model the complete geometry including the quartz crucible, radiative heaters, bottom cooling, inert <b>flushing</b> <b>gas,</b> etc. For one specific recipe of the transient heater power steering, PVA TePla conducted dip-rod measurements of the silicon solidification front position as function of time. This yields a validation of the model when applied to a real life industrial crystallization process. The results indicate that melt convection does influence the energy distribution up to the start of crystallization at the crucible bottom. But from that point on, the release of latent heat seems to dominate the solidification process, and convection in the melt does not significantly influence the transient front shape. © 2011 Elsevier B.

The 1 st {{step of the}} Tb-WS cycle involves thermal reduction of TbO 2 into Tb and O 2, whereas the 2 nd step corresponds {{to the production of}} H 2 through Tb oxidation by water splitting reaction. Equilibrium compositions associated with the thermal reduction and water splitting steps were determined via HSC simulations. Influence of oxygen partial pressure in the inert gas on thermal reduction of TbO 2 and effect of water splitting temperature (TL) on Gibbs free energy related to the H 2 production step were examined in detail. The cycle (ηcycle) and solar-to-fuel energy conversion (ηsolar-to-fuel) efficiency of the Tb-WS cycle were determined by performing the second-law thermodynamic analysis. Results obtained indicate that ηcycle and ηsolar-to-fuel increase with the decrease in oxygen partial pressure in the inert <b>flushing</b> <b>gas</b> and thermal reduction temperature (TH).

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the absence}} of a {{dielectric}} liquid dry electrical discharge machining (DEDM) can result in comparison to traditional EDM in a simpler and environmentally friendly machine. Driven mainly by this reason several efforts {{have been made in the}} past years to understand the erosion mechanism with gaseous fluid and especially with molecular oxygen.

This paper presents measurements of material removal rate in function of different <b>flushing</b> <b>gases.</b> Monitoring the voltage and the current values over the erosion gap effective energy specific values of the material removal rate can be calculated. This data shows that the heat energy from the oxidation has only a little effect on the material removal rate and that the main difference between oxygen and less oxidizing gases is to find in different stability and time efficiency of the process.

40|$|ABSTRACT The EPR Gaseous Waste Treatment System (GWTS) has as {{specific}} roles {{the management of}} the hyrdrogen risk and the radiochemical gas discharges. In order to accomplish these missions, the TEG system is composed of three main types of equipment: - A recombiner filled with a catalyst which removes hydrogen and oxygen from the nitrogen <b>flushing</b> <b>gas</b> stream which is used to sweep the biphasic gas tanks in order to avoid hazard mixtures and ensure the safety conditions. - Three delay beds filled with activated carbon used to retain for a set period of time radioactive noble gases (krypton and xenon) in order to limit the discharges to the environment. - A gel drier filled with silica gel which reduces the humidity of the gas stream entering the delay beds in order to guarantee the optimal performance of activated carbon. This paper initially describes the functional operation of these items of equipment and the theoretical assumptions taken into account in their design. The paper will go on to discuss the qualification tests that have been carried out by EDF in collaboration with the University of Pisa (DIMNP/CPTM). The tests were carried out on several samples of each material (catalyst, silica gel, activated carbon) on a test rig in order to select the best performing product in the EPR normal operating conditions. In overall, the qualification tests performed for EPR GWTS equipments constitute a complete matrix of parametrical tests which can be useful for different scientific and industrial applications. In particular, these tests have also notably enabled EDF, as the designer and future operator, to fully understand the physical behaviour of the materials in various operating conditions (pressure, temperature, humidity, flow rate) so that system design and operating procedures can be optimised...|$|E
40|$|The project HYDROSOL- 3 D aims {{to design}} a 1 MWth plant based on a thermo-chemical water {{splitting}} cycle. The cycle works as follows: In a first step (about 900 °C), water and metal oxide (MO) react {{in such a way}} that the metal oxidizes and thus takes up oxygen from the water, leaving hydrogen as a product gas: H 2 O + MO_RED [...] > H 2 + MO_OX In a second step, the oxidized metal oxide is reduced at higher temperatures (about 1300 °C); oxygen leaves the material and can be carried out by an inert gas flushing stream. This step regenerates the metal oxide so it can be used for water splitting again: MO_OX [...] > MO_RED + O 2 To get a realistic overview of an achievable efficiency of the complete hydrogen generation process it is important to critically examine all loss mechanisms. Some of these can only be studied thoroughly using dynamic modeling approaches. Therefore, a dynamic process model is being established in the commercial software Aspen Dynamics. The core part of the process model is the reactor which had to be created from the ground up (using Aspen Custom Modeler software), since it is not a standard unit operation available in Aspen. Model validation could be carried out based on test campaign results from predecessor project phases. Other loss mechanisms do not need numerical techniques, but can be analyzed based on thermodynamic considerations. One of these is the loss due to preparation of nitrogen which is used as <b>flushing</b> <b>gas</b> in the process. This flushing nitrogen is required to be of high purity for chemical regeneration of the metal oxide to take place.
