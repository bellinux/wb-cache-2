I {{have already}} {{expressed}} in a former paper (1164.), the view by which I hope to associate ordinary induction and <b>electrolyzation.</b> Under that view, the discharge of electric forces by <b>electrolyzation</b> is rather an effect superadded, in a certain class of bodies, to those already described as constituting induction and insulation, than one independent of and distinct from these phenomena.|$|E
6000|$|... 1704 In <b>electrolyzation</b> {{it appears}} that the {{polarized}} particles would (because of the gradual change which has been induced upon the chemical, i.e. the electrical forces of their elements (918.)) rather divide than discharge to each other without division (1348.); for if their division, i.e. their decomposition and recombination, be prevented by giving them the solid state, then they will insulate electricity perhaps a hundredfold more intense than that necessary for their <b>electrolyzation</b> (419, &c.). Hence the tension necessary for direct conduction in such bodies appears to be much higher than that for decomposition (419. 1164. 1344.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1138. Thus {{nitric acid}} {{proves to be}} the best for this purpose; its superiority appears to depend upon its favouring the <b>electrolyzation</b> of the liquid in the cells of the trough upon the {{principles}} already explained (905. 973, 1022.), and consequently favouring the transmission of the electricity, and therefore the production of transferable power (1120.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1154. Large {{or small}} plates.[A]--The {{advantageous}} use of {{large or small}} plates for <b>electrolyzations</b> will evidently depend upon the facility with which the transferable power of electricity can pass. If in a particular case the most effectual number of plates is known (1151.), then the addition of more zinc would be most advantageously made in increasing {{the size of the}} plates, and not their number. At the same time, large increase {{in the size of the}} plates would raise in a small degree the most favourable number.|$|R

Thus {{the three}} very {{different}} modes of discharge, namely, conduction, <b>electrolyzation,</b> and disruptive discharge, agree in producing the important transverse phenomenon of magnetism. Whether convection or carrying discharge will {{produce the same}} phenomenon has not been determined, and the few experiments I have as yet had time to make do not enable me to answer in the affirmative.|$|E
6000|$|... 671. Water, {{from its}} {{constitution}} {{and the nature of}} its elements, and from its frequent presence in cases of electrolytic action, has hitherto stood foremost in this respect. Though a compound formed by very powerful affinity, it yields up its elements under the influence of a very feeble electric current; and it is doubtful whether a case of <b>electrolyzation</b> can occur, where, being present, it is not resolved into its first principles.|$|E
6000|$|... 1642. All these considerations, {{and many}} others, help {{to confirm the}} conclusion, drawn over and over again, that the current is an {{indivisible}} thing; an axis of power, {{in every part of}} which both electric forces are present in equal amount[A] (517. 1627.). With conduction and <b>electrolyzation,</b> and even discharge by spark, such a view will harmonize without hurting any of our preconceived notions; but as relates to convection, a more startling result appears, which must therefore be considered.|$|E
6000|$|... 1013. Three {{pairs of}} zinc and platina plates, fig. 94, {{were able to}} produce a current which could pass an {{interposed}} platina plate, and effect the <b>electrolyzation</b> of water in cell iv. The current was evident, both by the continued deflection of the galvanometer, {{and the production of}} bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen at the electrodes in cell iv. Hence the accumulated surplus force of three plates of zinc, which are active in decomposing water, is more than equal, when added together, to the force with which oxygen and hydrogen are combined in water, and is sufficient to cause the separation of these elements from each other.|$|E
6000|$|... 1167. Again, if {{induction}} be {{an action}} of contiguous particles, {{and also the}} first step in the process of <b>electrolyzation</b> (1164. 919.), there seemed reason to expect some particular relation of it to the different kinds of matter through which it would be exerted, or something equivalent to a specific electric induction for different bodies, which, if it existed, would unequivocally prove the dependence of induction on the particles; and though this, in the theory of Poisson and others, has never been supposed to be the case, I was soon led to doubt the received opinion, and have taken great pains in subjecting this point to close experimental examination.|$|E
6000|$|... 1654. The {{magnetic}} or transverse {{action of}} the current {{seems to be in}} a most extraordinary degree independent of those variations or modes of action which it presents directly in its course; it consequently is of the more value to us, as it gives us a higher relation of the power than any that might have varied with each mode of discharge. This discharge, whether it be by conduction through a wire with infinite velocity (1652.), or by <b>electrolyzation</b> with its corresponding and exceeding slow motion (1651.), or by spark, and probably even by convection, produces a transverse magnetic action always the same in kind and direction.|$|E
6000|$|... 747. But {{when we take}} to our {{assistance}} the law {{of constant}} electro-chemical action already proved with regard to water (732.), and which I hope to extend satisfactorily to all bodies (821.), and consider the quantities {{as well as the}} nature of the substances set free, a generally accurate judgement of the primary or secondary character of the results may be formed: and this important point, so essential to the theory of <b>electrolyzation,</b> since it decides what are the particles directly {{under the influence of the}} current, (distinguishing them from such as are not affected,) and what are the results to be expected, may be established with such degree of certainty as to remove innumerable ambiguities and doubtful considerations from this branch of the science.|$|E
6000|$|... 1032. It {{is quite}} evident, that as water and other {{electrolytes}} can conduct electricity without suffering decomposition (986.), when the electricity is of sufficiently low intensity, {{it may not}} be asserted as absolutely true in all cases, that whenever electricity passes through an electrolyte, it produces a definite effect of decomposition. But the quantity of electricity which can pass in a given time through an electrolyte without causing decomposition, is so small as to bear no comparison to that required in a case of very moderate decomposition, and with electricity above the intensity required for <b>electrolyzation,</b> I have found no sensible departure as yet from the law of definite electrolytic action developed in the preceding series of these Researches (783. &c.).|$|E

6000|$|... 1618. A {{current is}} {{produced}} both by excitement and discharge; and whatsoever the {{variation of the}} two general causes may be, the effect remains the same. Thus excitement may occur in many ways, as by friction, chemical action, influence of heat, change of condition, induction, &c.; and discharge has the forms of conduction, <b>electrolyzation,</b> disruptive discharge, and convection; yet the current connected with these actions, when it occurs, appears in all cases to be the same. This constancy {{in the character of}} the current, notwithstanding the particular and great variations which may be made in the mode of its occurrence, is exceedingly striking and important; and its investigation and development promise to supply the most open and advantageous road to a true and intimate {{understanding of the nature of}} electrical forces.|$|E
6000|$|... 906. A little {{nitric acid}} {{was added to}} the liquid in the vessel r, so as to make a mixture which I shall call diluted nitro-sulphuric acid. On repeating the {{experiments}} with this mixture, all the substances before decomposed again gave way, and much more readily. But, besides that, many which before resisted <b>electrolyzation,</b> now yielded up their elements. Thus, solution of sulphate of soda, acted upon in the interstices of litmus and turmeric paper, yielded acid at the anode and alkali at the cathode; solution of muriatic acid tinged by indigo yielded chlorine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode; solution of nitrate of silver yielded silver at the cathode. Again, fused nitre and the fused iodide and chloride of lead were decomposable by the current of this single pair of plates, though they were not by the former (903.).|$|E
6000|$|... 1686. The polar {{state may}} be {{considered}} in common induction as a forced state, the particles tending {{to return to their}} normal condition. It may probably be raised to a very high degree by approximation of the inductric and inducteous bodies or by other circumstances; and the phenomena of <b>electrolyzation</b> (861. 1652. 1796.) seem to imply that the quantity of power which can thus be accumulated on a single particle is enormous. Hereafter {{we may be able to}} compare corpuscular forces, as those of gravity, cohesion, electricity, and chemical affinity, and in some way or other from their effects deduce their relative equivalents; at present we are not able to do so, but there seems no reason to doubt that their electrical, which are at the same time their chemical forces (891. 918.), will be by far the most energetic.|$|E
6000|$|... 1306. Finally, I beg to {{say that}} I put forth my {{particular}} view with doubt and fear, lest it should not bear the test of general examination, for unless true it will only embarrass the progress of electrical science. It has long been on my mind, but I hesitated to publish it until the increasing persuasion of its accordance with all known facts, {{and the manner in}} which it linked together effects apparently very different in kind, urged me to write the present paper. I as yet see no inconsistency between it and nature, but, on the contrary, think I perceive much new light thrown by it on her operations; and my next papers will be devoted to a review of the phenomena of conduction, <b>electrolyzation,</b> current, magnetism, retention, discharge, and some other points, with an application of the theory to these effects, and an examination of it by them.|$|E
6000|$|... 1349. These {{views of}} the {{decomposition}} of electrolytes and the consequent effect of discharge, which, as to the particular case, are the same with those of Grotthuss (481.) and Davy (482.), though they {{differ from those of}} Biot (487.), De la Rive (490.), and others, seem to me to be fully in accordance not merely with the theory I have given of induction generally (1165.), but with all the known facts of common induction, conduction, and electrolytic discharge; and in that respect help to confirm in my mind the truth of the theory set forth. The new mode of discharge which <b>electrolyzation</b> presents must surely be an evidence of the action of contiguous particles; and as this appears to depend directly upon a previous inductive state, which is the same with common induction, it greatly strengthens the argument which refers induction in all cases to an action of contiguous particles also (1295, &c.).|$|E
6000|$|... 988. In {{concluding}} {{this division}} on the intensity necessary for <b>electrolyzation,</b> I cannot resist {{pointing out the}} following remarkable conclusion in relation to intensity generally. It would appear that when a voltaic current is produced, having a certain intensity, dependent upon {{the strength of the}} chemical affinities by which that current is excited (916.), it can decompose a particular electrolyte without relation to the quantity of electricity passed, the intensity deciding whether the electrolyte shall give way or not. If that conclusion be confirmed, then we may arrange circumstances so that the same quantity of electricity may pass in the same time, in at the same surface, into the same decomposing body in the same state, and yet, differing in intensity, will decompose in one case and in the other not:--for taking a source of too low an intensity to decompose, and ascertaining the quantity passed in a given time, it is easy to take another source having a sufficient intensity, and reducing the quantity of electricity from it by the intervention of bad conductors to the same proportion as the former current, and then all the conditions will be fulfilled which are required to produce the result described.|$|E
6000|$|... 1731. If {{the lateral}} or {{transverse}} force of electrical currents, or {{what appears to}} be the same thing, magnetic power, could be proved to be influential at a distance independently of the intervening contiguous particles, then, as it appears to me, a real distinction of a high and important kind, would be established between the natures of these two forces (1654. 1664.). I do not mean that the powers are independent of each other and might be rendered separately active, on the contrary they are probably essentially associated (1654.), but it by no means follows that they are of the same nature. In common statical induction, in conduction, and in <b>electrolyzation,</b> the forces at the opposite extremities of the particles which coincide with the lines of action and have commonly been distinguished by the term electric, are polar, and in the cases of contiguous particles act only to insensible distances; whilst those which are transverse to the direction of these lines, and are called magnetic, are circumferential, act at a distance, and if not through the mediation of the intervening particles, have their relations to ordinary matter entirely unlike those of the electrical forces with which they are associated.|$|E
6000|$|... 853. Now it is {{wonderful}} to observe how small {{a quantity of}} a compound body is decomposed by a certain portion of electricity. Let us, for instance, consider this {{and a few other}} points in relation to water. One grain of water, acidulated to facilitate conduction, will require an electric current to be continued for three minutes and three quarters of time to effect its decomposition, which current must be powerful enough to retain a platina wire 1/104 of an inch in thickness[A], red-hot, in the air during the whole time; and if interrupted anywhere by charcoal points, will produce a very brilliant and constant star of light. If attention be paid to the instantaneous discharge of electricity of tension, as illustrated in the beautiful experiments of Mr. Wheatstone[B], and to what I have said elsewhere on the relation of common and voltaic electricity (371. 375.), it will not be too much to say that this necessary quantity of electricity is equal to a very powerful flash of lightning. Yet we have it under perfect command; can evolve, direct, and employ it at pleasure; and when it has performed its full work of <b>electrolyzation,</b> it has only separated the elements of a single grain of water.|$|E
6000|$|... 674. But {{the result}} which {{is found to}} be so {{striking}} in the instances quoted is not at all borne out by reference to other cases where a similar consequence might have been expected. It may be said, that my own theory of electro-chemical decomposition would lead to the expectation that all compound bodies should give way {{under the influence of the}} electric current with a facility proportionate to the strength of the affinity by which their elements, either proximate or ultimate, are combined. I am not sure that that follows as a consequence of the theory; but if the objection is supposed to be one presented by the facts, I have no doubt it will be removed when we obtain a more intimate acquaintance with, and precise idea of, the nature of chemical affinity and the mode of action of an electric current over it (518. 524.): besides which, it is just as directly opposed to any other theory of electro-chemical decomposition as the one I have propounded; for if it be admitted, as is generally the case, that the more directly bodies are opposed to each other in their attractive forces, the more powerfully do they combine, then the objection applies with equal force to any of the theories of <b>electrolyzation</b> which have been considered, and is an addition to those which I have taken against them.|$|E
6000|$|... 752. Nitric acid.--When very strong, it {{conducted}} well, and yielded oxygen at {{the positive}} electrode. No gas {{appeared at the}} negative electrode; but nitrous acid, and apparently nitric oxide, were formed there, which, dissolving, rendered the acid yellow or red, and at last even effervescent, from the spontaneous separation of nitric oxide. Upon diluting the acid with its bulk or more of water, gas appeared at the negative electrode. Its quantity could be varied by variations, either in {{the strength of the}} acid or of the voltaic current: for that acid from which no gas separated at the cathode, with a weak voltaic battery, did evolve gas there with a stronger; and that battery which evolved no gas there with a strong acid, did cause its evolution with an acid more dilute. The gas at the anode was always oxygen; that at the cathode hydrogen. When the quantity of products was examined by the volta-electrometer (707.), the oxygen, whether from strong or weak acid, proved {{to be in the same}} proportion as from water. When the acid was diluted to specific gravity 1.24, or less, the hydrogen also proved to be the same in quantity as from water. Hence I conclude that the nitric acid does not undergo <b>electrolyzation,</b> but the water only; that the oxygen at the anode is always a primary result, but that the products at the cathode are often secondary, and due to the reaction of the hydrogen upon the nitric acid.|$|E

The proof, therefore, {{appears to}} me complete, that the {{combination}} of the acid with the oxide, in the former experiment, {{had nothing to do with}} the production of the electric current; for the same current is here produced when the action of the acid is absent, and the reverse action of an alkali is present. I think it cannot be supposed for a moment, that the alkali acted chemically as an acid to the oxide formed; on the contrary, our general chemical knowledge leads to the conclusion, that the ordinary metallic oxides act rather as acids to the alkalies; yet that kind of action would tend to give a reverse current in the present case, if any were due to the union of the oxide of the exciting metal with the body which combines with it. But instead of any variation of this sort, the direction of the electricity was constant, and its quantity also directly proportional to the water decomposed, or the zinc oxidized. There are reasons for believing that acids and alkalies, when in contact with metals upon which they cannot act directly, still have a power of influencing their attractions for oxygen (941.); but all the effects in these experiments prove, I think, that it is the oxidation of the metal necessarily dependent upon, and associated as it is with, the <b>electrolyzation</b> of the water (921. 923.) that produces the current; and that the acid or alkali merely acts as solvents, and by removing the oxidized zinc, allows other portions to decompose fresh water, and so continues the evolution or determination of the current.|$|E

Thus when a liquid dielectric, as chloride of tin, consists of molecules, each composed of a single particle {{of each of the}} elements, then as these can convey equivalent opposite forces by their separation in opposite directions, both decomposition and transfer can result. But when the molecules, as in the bichloride of tin, consist of one particle or atom of one element, and two of the other, then the simplicity with which the particles may be supposed to be arranged and to act, is destroyed. And, though it may be conceived that when the molecules of bichloride of tin are polarized as wholes by the induction across them, the positive polar force might accumulate on the one particle of tin whilst the negative polar force accumulated on the two particles of chlorine associated with it, and that these might respectively travel right and left to unite with other two of chlorine and one of tin, in analogy with what happens in cases of compounds consisting of single proportions, yet this is not altogether so evident or probable. For when a particle of tin combines with two of chlorine, it is difficult to conceive that there should not be some relation of the three in the resulting molecule analogous to fixed position, the one particle of metal being perhaps symmetrically placed in relation to the two of chlorine: and, {{it is not difficult to}} conceive of such particles that they could not assume that position dependent both on their polarity and the relation of their elements, which appears to be the first step in the process of <b>electrolyzation</b> (1345. 1705.).|$|E
6000|$|... 748. Let us apply these {{principles}} {{to the case}} of ammonia, and the supposed determination of nitrogen to one or the other electrode (554. 555,). A pure strong solution of ammonia is as bad a conductor, and therefore as little liable to <b>electrolyzation,</b> as pure water; but when sulphate of ammonia is dissolved in it, the whole becomes a conductor; nitrogen almost and occasionally quite pure is evolved at the anode, and hydrogen at the cathode; the ratio of the volume of the former to that of the latter varying, but being as 1 to about 3 or 4. This result would seem at first to imply that the electric current had decomposed ammonia, and that the nitrogen had been determined towards the positive electrode. But when the electricity used was measured out by the volta-electrometer (707. 736.), {{it was found that the}} hydrogen obtained was exactly in the proportion which would have been supplied by decomposed water, whilst the nitrogen had no certain or constant relation whatever. When, upon multiplying experiments, it was found that, by using a stronger or weaker solution, or a more or less powerful battery, the gas evolved at the anode was a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, varying both in proportion and absolute quantity, whilst the hydrogen at the cathode remained constant, no doubt could be entertained that the nitrogen at the anode was a secondary result, depending upon the chemical action of the nascent oxygen, determined to that surface by the electric current, upon the ammonia in solution. It was the water, therefore, which was electrolyzed, not the ammonia. Further, the experiment gives no real indication of the tendency of the element nitrogen to either one electrode or the other; nor do I know of any experiment with nitric acid, or other compounds of nitrogen, which shows the tendency of this element, under the influence of the electric current, to pass in either direction along its course.|$|E
