500|$|Two {{communications}} specialists, Larry Levine and James Crume, {{said that}} they remembered orders to fire on the refugees, coming to the 2nd Battalion command post from a higher level, probably from 1st Cavalry Division. They recalled the ground fire beginning with a mortar round landing among the refugee families, followed by what Levine called a [...] "frenzy" [...] of small-arms fire. Some battalion veterans recalled front-line company officers ordering them to open fire. [...] "It was assumed there were enemy in these people," [...] said ex-rifleman Herman Patterson. [...] "They were dying down there. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> people screaming," [...] recalled Thomas H. Hacha of the sister 1st Battalion, observing nearby. Others said that some soldiers held their fire.|$|E
500|$|Celine Dion {{performed}} the song {{as part of}} her A New Day... concert at Caesars Palace. The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is the one I had the most kick out of in the studio. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure." [...] Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{could see}} {{distinctly}} the muskets, bayonets, and knapsacks of the men, who wore caps and feathers like {{those used by}} the American soldiers in the last war with Britain; also their officers with their swords and equipage, and heard the clashing and jingling of their instruments of war and could discover the form and features of the men. The most profound order existed throughout the entire army, when the foremost man stepped, every man stepped at the same time: <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> step. When the front rank reached the Western horizon a battle ensued, as we could distinctly hear {{the report of the}} arms and the rush. No man could judge of my feelings when I beheld that army of men, as plainly as I ever saw armies of men in the flesh it seemed as though every hair of my head was alive. This scenery was gazed upon for hours, until it began to disappear." ...|$|E

2500|$|Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page {{talked about}} his love of Indian music, saying: [...] "I went to India after I {{came back from a}} tour with the Yardbirds in the late sixties just so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> music firsthand. Let's put it this way: I had a sitar before George Harrison got his. I wouldn't say I played it as well as he did, though â€¦" [...] The East Indian scales used on the track [...] "Friends" [...] (Led Zep III) [...] "Kashmir" [...] (Physical Graffiti) are {{considered}} fine examples of the influence of the sitar in rock music. The Doors extensively used Indian and near eastern scales in their psychedelic soundscapes. Robbie Krieger's guitar part on [...] "The End" [...] was heavily influenced by Indian ragas and features melodic and rhythmic qualities that suggest a sitar or veena. Fleetwood Mac's Gold Dust Woman features the instrument, as well. Many pop performances actually involve the Electric Sitar, a solid body guitar-like instrument quite different from the traditional acoustic Indian instrument.|$|E
2500|$|With the line-up secured, Red {{entered a}} {{longtime}} association with producer, songwriter, and musician Rob Graves. After they had recorded four demos {{in a garage}} and a nursery that displayed their style of alternative, hard and Christian rock music. Rauch, who had worked as an intern in the same Nashville studio as Graves and supplied them with free equipment, invited Graves {{to listen to their}} music for his opinions. Graves recalled: [...] "It was really rough, all over the map, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> elements were there ... I told them it was really good, it had potential". Graves took them under his wing, and paid for studio time and the production of their first demos at Paragon Studios which happened across two years. Graves then signed Red to a development contract with his independent production company Six Feet Over, which led to a recording deal with Provident Label Group which then assigned them to its Christian label Essential Records after they liked their demo. Essential gave Red the green-light on a full length album. Speaking on their Christian influence, Barnes said: [...] "We are Christians in a band, but if people feel more comfortable and say that we are a Christian band, we do not to shy away from that". Hendrix parted ways with Red before recording began; he was replaced by drummer Hayden Lamb.|$|E
