These currents increase exponentially as threshold voltage scales, creating a serious problem for traditional design approaches. This work {{is based on the}} exclusive use of subthreshold conduction currents to perform circuit operations, turning this problem into an opportunity. It yields a dramatic improvement in power consumption compared to traditional circuit design approaches. This improvement makes it feasible to design extreme low-power circuits with such an approach.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{separate}} determination of two-pole sample volume resistance and contact resistance is suggested. The method is applicable to high-ohmic semiconductor samples: semi-insulating gallium arsenide, detector cadmium-zinc telluride (CZT), etc. The method {{is based on}} near-contact region illumination by monochromatic radiation of variable intensity from light emitting diodes with quantum energies exceeding the band gap of the material. It is necessary to obtain sample photo-current dependence upon light emitting diode current and to find the linear portion of this dependence. Extrapolation of this linear portion to the Y-axis gives the <b>cut-off</b> <b>current.</b> As the bias voltage is known, {{it is easy to}} calculate sample volume resistance. Then, using dark current value, one can determine the total contact resistance. The method was tested for n-type semi-insulating GaAs. The contact resistance value was shown to be approximately equal to the sample volume resistance. Thus, the influence of contacts {{must be taken into account}} when electrophysical data are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Terahertz-frequency quantum cascade lasers (THz QCLs) {{based on}} bound-to-continuum active regions are {{difficult}} to model owing to their large number of quantum states. We present a computationally efficient reduced rate equation (RE) model that reproduces the experimentally observed variation of THz power with respect to drive current and heat-sink temperature. We also present dynamic (time-domain) simulations under a range of drive currents and predict an increase in modulation bandwidth as the current approaches {{the peak of the}} light-current curve, as observed experimentally in mid-infrared QCLs. We account for temperature and bias dependence of the carrier lifetimes, gain, and injection efficiency, calculated from a full rate equation model. The temperature dependence of the simulated threshold current, emitted power, and <b>cut-off</b> <b>current</b> are thus all reproduced accurately with only one fitting parameter, the interface roughness, in the full REs. We propose that the model could therefore be used for rapid dynamical simulation of QCL designs. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LL...|$|R

40|$|Terahertz {{frequency}} quantum cascade lasers (THz-QCLs) are compact solid-state {{sources of}} coherent THz radiation over the frequency range 1 – 5 THz. Due {{to the high}} output power, narrow linewidths and broad range of emission frequencies, QCLs have numerous potential applications as radiation sources for imaging and spectroscopy within biomedical or security scenarios, or as local oscillators in heterodyne mixing schemes. Although THz-QCLs are known to exhibit sub-nanosecond dynamic behaviour, transient laser emission on these time-scales cannot be resolved by commercially-available semiconducting Ge or InSb bolometers, owing to the large detection time-constants. We present a time-domain analysis of fast pulses emitted by a quantum cascade laser operating at ~ 3. 1 THz using superconducting THz detectors made from either NbN or YBa(2) Cu(3) O(7 -δ) (YBCO) thin films. The QCL emission was studied {{as a function of}} the QCL bias voltage and the excitation pulse length. The ultra-fast response of superconducting NbN and YBCO detectors allows the resolution of nanosecond-time-scale dynamic laser effects. This enables to determine the QCL transfer function (output power vs. QCL drive current), based on experimentally studied correlations of the time-dependent emission of radiation with current flow in the QCL, under different QCL bias conditions. From the transfer function, specific QCL parameters were determined including the threshold and <b>cut-off</b> <b>currents.</b> We show that this transfer function differs from that obtained using semiconducting bolometric detectors which respond only to the integrated pulse energy...|$|R
40|$|The ActiGraph {{accelerometer}} {{is commonly}} used to measure physical activity in children. Count cut-off points are needed when using accelerometer data to determine the time a person spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity. For the GT 3 X accelerometer no cut-off points for young children have been published yet. The aim {{of the current study}} was thus to develop and validate count cut-off points for young children. Thirty-two children aged 5 to 9 years performed four locomotor and four play activities. Activity classification into the light-, moderate- or vigorous-intensity category was based on energy expenditure measurements with indirect calorimetry. Vertical axis as well as vector magnitude cut-off points were determined through receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with the data of two thirds of the study group and validated with the data of the remaining third. The vertical axis cut-off points were 133 counts per 5 sec for moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 193 counts for vigorous activity (VPA) corresponding to a metabolic threshold of 5 MET and 233 for VPA corresponding to 6 MET. The vector magnitude cut-off points were 246 counts per 5 sec for MVPA, 316 counts for VPA - 5 MET and 381 counts for VPA - 6 MET. When validated, the <b>current</b> <b>cut-off</b> points generally showed high recognition rates for each category, high sensitivity and specificity values and moderate agreement in terms of the Kappa statistic.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore cut-off values for large WC in adults aged 70 years and older, using previously used and new methods. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Data of 1049 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) (1995 - 1996), aged 70 - 88 y, were used. MEASUREMENTS: Measured BMI and WC, and self-reported mobility limitations. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses showed that the values of WC corresponding to BMI of 25 kg/m 2 and 30 kg/m 2 were higher than the <b>current</b> <b>cut-offs.</b> Cut-offs found in men were 97 and 110 cm, whereas 88 and 98 cm represented the cut-offs in women. Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the accuracy to predict mobility limitations improved when the higher cut-offs were applied. Spline regression curves showed that the relationship of WC with mobility limitations was U-shaped in men, while in women, the risk for mobility limitations increased gradually with increasing WC. However, {{at the level of}} <b>current</b> <b>cut-off</b> values for WC the odds for mobility limitations were not increased.

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} dynamic {{characteristics}} and decaying behaviour of SF 6 arcs during the current-zero period {{is of great}} significance to improving the interruption performance of high voltage circuit breakers and ensuring their reliable operation. The present research was conducted by means of modeling and experiment to provide a better knowledge of the switching process to help the design and optimization of high voltage SF 6 circuit breakers. The {{first part of the}} work concerns the determination of thermophysical properties of SF 6 plasmas under local thermodynamic equilibrium state (LTE). A systematic comparison with transport coefficients obtained using an old data set and experimental test has been performed to check the reliability of the proposed phenomenological approach in evaluating transport cross sections. Properties especially transport coefficients become sensitive to the choice of Debye length definition predominantly due to the different collision integrals affected by the different screening distance. Pressures increase can also influence thermophysical properties due to the inhibited chemical reactions. Moreover, the thermophysical properties under non-equilibrium conditions have been investigated using a two-temperature model. It was noted that the special case with equal electrons and heavy species temperatures produces results agreeing excellently with those obtained by the LTE model. The forms of mass action laws as well as the choice of reaction excitation temperature for molecular ionization used in the calculation can significantly modify the species composition and plasma properties. This model lays the micro-theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of SF 6 plasma formation and evolution mechanism and provides a reliable properties input for non-equilibrium arc behaviour simulation. Following a traditional approach of arc modelling assuming LTE, considerable effort has been devoted to study the arc-shock interaction and its influence on the dynamic characteristics and current zero behaviour of SF 6 arcs in a supersonic nozzle with a hollow contact. It was found that the close coupling between the shock region and its surrounding gas flow greatly influences the aerodynamic and electrical behaviour of a nozzle arc and hence the thermal recovery process. In addition, deceleration of gas flow caused by the shocks and enhanced turbulent cooling brought by the sucked gas interacting with the arc both {{play a significant role in}} the determination of the thermal interruption capability. Possible departure from LTE in a decaying SF 6 arc was studied using a two-temperature hydrodynamic model in a supersonic nozzle under well-controlled conditions. The predicted radial temperature variation presents quite good agreement with test result using emission spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the electron and heavy-particle temperature diverge in cases where the collision energy exchange is ineffective. For the arc decay phase, the two-temperature model gives a lower cooling rate than the LTE model, and hence a higher conductance of the discharge passage at current zero showing the necessity of using a two-temperature model to accurately predict the current interruption capability of SF 6 gas-blast circuit breakers. For thermal recovery phase, considering the chemically non-equilibrium effect, a global kinetic model of decaying SF 6 arcs was established to study the electrons elimination mechanisms around current zero. For dielectric recovery phase, the critical dielectric strength of hot SF 6 are investigated based on a two-term Boltzmann equation solution of electrons energy distribution function. It is noted that the main mechanisms of electrons elimination are the dissociative attachment from 3500 K to 7500 K, electron-molecular ion recombination in the temperature lower than 3500 K. The temperature increase, pressure decrease and departure from chemically non-equilibrium can all contribute to the dielectric strength reduction. The entrainment of PTFE ablation vapour can enhance the dielectric strengh of SF 6 above 2500 K. Finally, this research manufactures a model SF 6 gas blast interrupter and investigates the dynamic characteristics of electrical, light radiation, pressure along together with electrode movement. Arc dynamic characteristics and decaying behaviour of CO 2 and N 2 is compared with that of SF 6 arcs in order to obtain the dominant properties influencing arc quenching. It is noted that the extinction voltage, which decreases with increase in the interrupting current, is related to the conductance decay during current zero period and can be considered as an evaluation of interruption capability. Gas blast can bring a much more rapid variation of arc resistance and a much higher <b>cut-off</b> <b>current</b> before its extinction. SF 6 has a superior interruption capability possibly due to its high thermal conductivity and specific heat...|$|R
