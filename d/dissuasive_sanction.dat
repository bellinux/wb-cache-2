40|$|AbstractFATF Special Recommendation IX (SR IX) {{focuses on}} cross border {{declaration}} or disclosure {{with the objective}} to detect and prevent illicit cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments. In complying with the recommendation, countries are required to i) have measures for detection, ii) ensure that relevant authorities are competent to stop or restrain and iii) ensure that effective, proportionate and <b>dissuasive</b> <b>sanctions</b> are available to deal with any irregularities. However, there are countries which are still struggling {{to comply with the}} special recommendation since it is challenging. Therefore, this study investigates on the compliance ratings of 40 countries on FATF Special Recommendation IX (SR IX) based on Mutual Evaluation Reports issued by Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (also known as APG). Based on the Mutual Evaluation Reports, this study also looks into recommendation and comments given by respective panels. The compliance ratings together with panel's recommendation and comments compiled in this study will be helpful to relevant authorities for their countries’ future improvement. The findings will also highlight on issues related to cross border declaration or disclosure for future research...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} key {{findings of}} the assessment of financial sector regulation and supervision in the Cayman Islands. The assessment reveals {{that in the last}} two years, an extensive program of legislative, rule, and guideline development in the Cayman Islands has introduced an increasingly effective system of regulation, both formalizing earlier practices and introducing enhanced procedures. The implementation of financial regulation and supervision complies broadly with standards in all the areas assessed. However, issues related to resources and potential breaches of operational autonomy affect the regulator and, hence, supervision in all sectors.

5000|$|More specifically, the OECD Convention {{requires}} that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties {{comparable to those}} applicable to their own public officials. It commits Parties to interpret territorial jurisdiction in as broad a manner as possible and to establish nationality jurisdiction if this is in accord with their legal system. Parties are obliged to establish corporate liability (the liability of [...] "legal persons") for foreign bribery, and where a Partys legal system does not provide criminal liability for companies, the Party must apply effective, proportionate and <b>dissuasive</b> non-criminal <b>sanctions</b> to them. Furthermore, countries must facilitate mutual legal assistance and cannot invoke [...] "bank secrecy" [...] to deny mutual legal assistance.

40|$|Weaknesses in the {{enforcement}} of regulation have been targeted by the G- 20 as a priority concern for reform. But enforcement efforts in securities markets have proven difficult and uneven. The recent scandal in the United States, wherein a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard Madoff went undetected by the U. S. authorities {{for more than two}} decades, has once again highlighted the importance of effective enforcement of securities regulation, as well as the challenges that securities regulators around the world face in implementing credible enforcement programs. While in many instances it is individuals who bear the losses, we show that noncompliance with securities law can have serious system-wide impact and that the credibility of the system as a whole rests on the existence of effective discipline-the probability of real consequences for failure to obey the law. This paper explores the elements of enforcement, why it is so challenging, why it is important, and whether its effects can be measured. Through an analysis of the data gathered in the World Bank/IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), the paper examines how enforcement is being carried out around the world and draws conclusions regarding how countries are meeting the challenge of effective enforcement.
