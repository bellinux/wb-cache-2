One {{of the oldest}} known failure modes is ozone cracking caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber.

In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E

40|$|A numerical-experimental {{analysis}} {{of a new generation}} Common Feeding (CF) fuel injection system, equipped with last generation solenoid injectors that feature pressure-balanced pilot-valves, has been developed. The main feature of the CF system is that it removes the accumulator from the high-pressure layout of the standard Common Rail (CR). In the CF apparatus, the high-pressure pump is connected directly to the injectors, and a small accumulation volume is integrated in the pump high-pressure circuit. The hydraulic performance of the CF system, including the injectors with the pressure-balanced pilot-valve, has been compared with that of the standard CR system in terms of injected masses, <b>fuel</b> <b>leakages,</b> high-pressure and injected flow-rate time histories. A previously developed advanced one-dimensional code for CR type systems has been adapted for the simulation of the CF high-pressure layout. Furthermore, electromagnetic, hydraulic and mechanical submodels have been set up for the pressure-balanced pilot-valve simulation. This new pilot-valve configuration is aimed at reducing injector <b>fuel</b> <b>leakages</b> and at improving the dynamic response of the needle to the electrical command. The complete numerical model of the CF system has been validated by means of comparison with experimental data that have been acquired at the hydraulic test bench. Hence, the validated model has been applied to investigate the internal fluid-dynamics of the pressure-balanced solenoid injector, when inserted into the CF setup, as well as the effects of some design modifications in the high-pressure hydraulic circuit of the CF syste...|$|R

[...] The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972. [...] In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million. [...] The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a cost to society of $49.5 million.|$|E

However, the model explicitly accounts for parameter variations that are often unavoidable under realistic testing conditions. These variations include changes in the fuel composition, changes in the fuel mass fluxes and changes in the operation temperature. In addition, internal repeat unit resistances as extracted from current-voltage data are compared with the ohmic and polarisation losses obtained from independent electrical impedance measurements data. Since the data analysis is done in a highly automated fashion, large sets of current-voltage data can be compared and 'normal' data sets can be discriminated from 'abnormal' ones. The model has the potential to accelerate testing by eliminating variations that lead to corruption and unwanted scattering of current-voltage data...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{quantification}} {{and thorough}} {{interpretation of the}} degradation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks under real conditions is critical {{for the improvement of}} its long-term stability. The degradation behavior is often analyzed based on the evolution of currentevoltage (V,I) curves. However, these overall resistances often contain unavoidable fluctuations in the fuel gas amount and composition and hence are difficult to interpret. Studying the evolution of internal repeat unit (RU) resistances is a more appropriate measure to assess stack degradation. RU-resistances follow from EIS-data through subtraction of the gas concentration impedance from the overall steady-state resistance. In this work a model-based approach where a local equilibrium model is used for spatial discretization of a SOFC stack RU running on hydrocarbon mixtures such as natural gas. Since under stack operation, <b>fuel</b> <b>leakages,</b> uneven <b>fuel</b> distribution and varying natural gas composition can influence the performance, they are taken into account by the model.
