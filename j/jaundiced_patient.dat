40|$|Previous {{clinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} an increased incidence of wound dehiscence and incisional hernia formation in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> following major laparotomy. Nearly all of these patients had their wounds closed in layers. In {{order to determine the}} rate of wound failure in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> when a mass closure technique is used, 343 non-jaundiced patients undergoing biliary surgery and 62 <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing surgery have been studied. All the wounds were closed using a mass closure technique and the patients were seen regularly as outpatients. There were no wound dehiscences in either group (incidence 0 %). Twenty seven (7. 9 %) of the non-jaundiced patients and 4 (9. 8 %) of the surviving <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> developed incisional hernias within one year of operation. We conclude that the rate of wound dehiscence in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> can be much reduced using the mass closure technique. The rate of incisional hernia formation in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> following major laparotomy is similar to that found in non-jaundiced patients when this technique is used...|$|R

40|$|Patients with obstructive {{jaundice}} frequently suffer postoperative complications. We {{have investigated the}} relationship of {{obstructive jaundice}} to the neutrophil oxidase response and the "priming " of the response by the cytokines TNFa, interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), IL- 6, and IL- 8. On stimulation with f-met-leuphe (fmlp), the respiratory burst in neutrophils from <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> was greatly increased compared with controls (p < 0. 01), <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> having the highest respiratory burst levels were those with the poorest prognosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effects of cholestatic {{jaundice}} on gut barrier function. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gut barrier failure occurs in animal models of jaundice. In humans, the presence of endotoxemia indirectly implicates failure of this host defense, but this has not previously been investigated in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients.</b> METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with extrahepatic obstructive jaundice and 27 nonicteric subjects were studied. Intestinal permeability was measured using the lactulose-mannitol test. Small intestinal morphology and the presence of mucosal immunologic activation were examined in endoscopic biopsies of {{the second part of the}} duodenum. Systemic antiendotoxin core IgG antibodies and serum interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein were also quantified. Intestinal permeability was remeasured in 9 patients 5 weeks after internal biliary drainage. RESULTS: The median lactulose-mannitol ratio was significantly increased in the <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients.</b> This was accompanied by upregulation of HLA-DR expression on enterocytes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue, suggesting immune activation. A significant increase in the acute phase response and circulating antiendotoxin core antibodies was also observed in the <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients.</b> After internal biliary drainage, intestinal permeability returned toward normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: A reversible impairment in gut barrier function occurs in patients with cholestatic jaundice. Increased intestinal permeability is associated with local immune cell and enterocyte activation. In view of the role of gut defenses in the modern paradigm of sepsis, these data may directly identify an important underlying mechanism contributing to the high risk of sepsis in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAim. Multiorgan {{dysfunction}} {{is often}} encountered in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> and may compromise the postoperative outcome after liver resection for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The {{aim of the}} present study was to elucidate evidence-based medicine regarding the benefit of the available preoperative treatments currently used for the preparation of patients before surgery for hilar CCA. Material and methods. An electronic search using the Medline database was performed to identify relevant articles relating to renal dysfunction, bacterial translocation, hemostasis impairment, malnutrition, liver failure, and postoperative outcome in <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing liver resection for CCA. Results. There is grade B evidence to expand the extracellular water volume and to administer oral synbiotic supplements. Intravenous vitamin K administration is an effective treatment. Perioperative nutritional support should be administered preferably by the enteral route in severely malnourished patients with compromised liver function undergoing extended liver resection (grade A evidence). There is only grade C evidence to recommend a portal vein embolization in patients with CCA when the future remnant liver volume is < 40 %. Conclusions. A simplified scheme that might be useful in the management of patients presenting with obstructive jaundice was presented. Despite surgical technique improvements, preparation of patients for surgery will continue to be one of the major determinants for the postoperative prognosis of <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

And the results were as follows. 1. The author applied the freezing-drying to the histochemical studies on the skin stained by bilirubin and got the satisfactory results. 2. As for the staining condition of bilirubin in the skin of <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient,</b> it was diffuse, but not the paticular region or fiber. 3. Staining the fiber, being chiefly composed by collagen and elastoid, by each solution of cristallin bilirubin, bilirubin soda salt, natural salt-form and ester-form bilirubin and serum of jaundiced patients in the buffer solutions with various pH value, the stainability was the best on the use of ester-form bilirubin and the best pH value was 7. 0, and the deposited bilurbin was easily changed to biliverdin on the shift of pH to alkaline side. 4. Staining the above both fibers by biliverdin as same as bilirubin, it's staining deposition was the same degree with that of bilirubin. 5. Therefore, the staining deposition of skin in jaundice was not in the elastin of elastic fiber as put forward by F. Rosenthal, it was diffusely seen in the whole of skin and it was rather strong in the collagenous fiber than elastoid. Shifting the pH of skin to akaline side, the deposited bilirubin was easlly changed to biliverdin and Verdinikterus was occured from it...|$|E
40|$|Cholangiography in the <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient</b> The {{differentiation}} between intrahepatic or 'medical ' and extrahepatic or 'surgical ' jaundice remains problematical in many patients. A diagnosis {{based only on}} the history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and non-invasive radiological studies may well be in error'. Traditionally, an exploratory laparotomy was performed in patients whose condition showed no spontaneous resolution during a protracted period of observation. This meant considerable delay before the relief of surgical obstruction in some, whereas others with 'medical ' jaundice would be subjected to the increased morbidity and mortality of laparotomy 2 ' 3. A number of techniques have been developed which permit direct cholangiography when the intravenous technique is inadequate.

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} obstructive jaundice {{is associated with a}} high postoperative morbidity and mortality. A correlation was suggested between endotoxins and the observed complications. The mechanism by which endotoxins affect the negative outcome in operated jaundiced patients was, however, not clear, nor was the mechanism of clinically used preventive treatments. Several experiments were therefore performed in rats with biliary obstruction, to investigate whether and how endotoxins are active. The role of endotoxins was studied in a model in which endotoxins were absent. In germfree rats (free of bacteria and thus of endotoxin) the effect of biliary obstruction was studied and compared with biliary obstruction in conventional rats. To substantiate further the role of endotoxin, anti-endotoxin treatments (oral lactulose or internal drainage) were tested in rats with obstructive jaundice undergoing a severe surgical trauma. It is shown that endotoxins are responsible for complications (suppression of cellular immunity, kidney function, mortality) and that these complications can be prevented with an anti-endotoxin treatment.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{consideration in}} the workup of a <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient</b> is the pretest probability of mechanical obstruction. Ultrasound is the first-line modality to exclude biliary tract obstruction. When mechanical obstruction is present, additional imaging with CT or MRI can clarify etiology, define level of obstruction, stage disease, and guide intervention. When mechanical obstruction is absent, additional imaging can evaluate liver parenchyma for fat and iron deposition and help direct biopsy in cases where underlying parenchymal disease or mass is found. Imaging techniques are reviewed for the following clinical scenarios: (1) the patient with painful jaundice, (2) the patient with painless jaundice, and (3) the patient with a nonmechanical cause for jaundice. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals {{and the application of}} a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the early}} postoperative complications after 285 pancreaticoduodenectomies performed {{during the past}} 15 years in the Surgical University Clinic, Mannheim. There were 235 partial (Whipple) and 52 total pancreatectomies performed for pancreatic and periampullary tumors (181 patients) and complicated chronic pancreatitis (104 patients). A total of 92 complications requiring relaparotomy in 42 patients ended fatally in nine patients. The overall operative and hospital mortality rate was 3. 1 %. The most frequent and most dangerous were complications at or around the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis, which occurred 25 times with five deaths. Postoperative hemorrhage was seen in 16 patients; endoscopic treatment in four patients and operation in 12 patients was successful in stopping the bleeding {{in all but one}} patient. Eight biliary fistulae either ceased spontaneously (3 patients) or after operative reintervention (5 patients) without any mortality. Control of these complications depends on four lines of approach: (1) before operation: optimal preparation of the <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient</b> including endoscopic transpapillary decompression of the common duct; (2) during operation: a meticulous and standardized technique is mandatory; (3) after operation: continuous observation in the surgical intensive care unit is essential for the timely detection of possible complications; and (4) early reintervention can salvage the great majority of these patients with deleterious complications...|$|E

40|$|The {{putative}} {{role of the}} cytokines interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis {{factor in}} the pathophysiology of the complications and mortality after surgery in jaundiced patients was studied in a murine model. Cytokine serum levels were determined in mice with experimental biliary obstruction. As {{an indicator of the}} activation status of macrophages, cytokine release by mononuclear phagocytes obtained from such mice was assessed. Following surgery, interleukin- 6 levels increased to 2 to 3 ng/ml after 3 to 4 hr, but declined rapidly afterward to levels of 60 pg/ml after 10 days. After 12 days, substantial interleukin- 6 levels were observed in jaundiced mice (100 pg/ml), whereas levels in sham mice further decreased (p less than 0. 001). The cytokine tumor necrosis factor was frequently present in the serum of jaundiced mice. After 22 days, when killed, all jaundiced mice showed significant tumor necrosis factor levels (p less than 0. 001). This was in contrast to sham mice in which tumor necrosis factor was never detected. The presence of an activated state of macrophages in jaundiced mice was concluded from the observed high spontaneous cytokine release and significantly higher release after stimulation (p less than 0. 05).

40|$|Intraoperative {{ultrasonography}} (LUS) {{has been}} introduced in order to overcome {{the limits of the}} preoperative imaging modalities (notably, ultrasonography and computed tomography), both in pancreatic cancer diagnosis and staging. The authors' experience encompasses 32 cases, selected according to the following criteria: lesions that could not be detected both preoperatively and at surgical exploration; lesions detected but not properly characterized, requiring differential diagnosis between cancer and pancreatitis; tumoral lesions with a perspective of radical surgery, in which the preoperative judgment of resectability had to be verified. In the only case of the first group, I. US allowed the identification of a small cancer in a <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient.</b> In the 11 cases of the second group, I. US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsý showed three cancers; however, among the other 8 lesions classified as pancreatitis there was one false negative diagnosis (a tumoral mass with liver metastases was demonstrated by computed tomography 6 mo later). Regarding the intraoperative staging of the proven cancers (20 cases of the third group; 4 cases of the first and second groups), I. US changed the planned surgical approach in 9 cases (showing vascular involvement or detecting liver metastases and enlarged lymph nodes not seen preoperatively); in 12 cases it confirmed the possibility of radical surgery. Finally, in the remaining 3 cases, I. US provided dubious information: only vascular dissection during surgery could achieve a correct evaluation, ruling out vascular involvement and thus allowing tumor resection. © 1992 Humana Press Inc...|$|E
40|$|Background. Routine {{preoperative}} biliary drainage {{in cases}} of jaundice secondary to pancreatobiliary malignancy {{is associated with a}} significant risk of complications, failure and stent occlusion. It may be possible to avoid biliary drainage in those patients who are not deeply jaundiced. Aims. To measure presenting serum bilirubin and its rate of increase in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. To predict the urgency with which surgery should be performed to avoid preoperative biliary drainage. Patients and methods. Prospective data collection for all pancreatic and periampullary malignancies over a period of 18 months was carried out. Serum bilirubin levels before successful drainage were recorded. Rates of increase in bilirubin and the number of days for bilirubin to reach different thresholds were calculated. Results. Of 111 patients, 66 (59 %) had resectable disease on imaging investigations. Median serum bilirubin on presentation was 160 µmol/l. Median increase was 13. 1 µmol/l/day or approximately 100 µmol/l/week. The predicted number of days for bilirubin levels to reach a variety of thresholds varied significantly. For a patient presenting with a serum bilirubin of 160 µmol/l, the mean number of days for it to rise to 200 µmol/l, 300 µmol/l, 400 µmol/l and 500 µmol/l was 3, 13, 22 and 31 days, respectively. Conclusions. There is a variable window of opportunity in jaundiced patients with pancreatic and periampullary malignancy during which surgery may be performed to avoid biliary drainage procedures, depending on the threshold for operating on the <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient...</b>|$|E

40|$|To quantitate {{the effects}} of biliary {{decompression}} on hepatic functional reserve before operation in patietns with obstructive jaundice, we developed a new method of maximal hepatic removal of indocyanine green in the bile (ICG Bmax). This was calculated from the peak ICG concentration in the bile and the peak concentration time after its administration via antecubital vein using regression analysis. This study involved 13 normal controls and 26 <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients.</b> ICG Bmax of the normal controls indicated more than 0. 5. Among the <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients.</b> 17 showed an ICG Bmax value of more than - 0. 5 early during biliary decompression and 87 % of them satisfactorily tolerated further radical operation.

Six of the nine patients whose ICG Bmax was less than - 0. 5 prior to operation suffered severe postoperative complication, and three of whom died from hepatic failure.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Guidelines {{suggest that}} all {{patients}} with choledocholithiasis {{should have a}} coagulation screen prior to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This study aims to establish the incidence of deranged coagulation in such patients and its relationship with bleeding complications. Methods: Analysis of consecutive patients undergoing ERCP procedures at two NHS sites was undertaken. Exclusion criteria were anti-coagulation use, bleeding disorders or incomplete data. Demographic data, pre-procedure bilirubin and prothrombin time (PT), ERCP procedural information, and bleeding complications were recorded for each. The cohort was divided into jaundice and non-jaundiced groups. Statistical analysis was performed using the student's t-test, Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. Results: 793 patients (419 jaundiced; 374 non-jaundiced) were included. PT was significantly higher in the jaundiced group (greater by 2 (1. 35 – 2. 64) seconds; p  16. 8  s 5. 9 per cent of the non-jaundiced group had prolonged PT, with 1 patient having a PT > 16. 8  s. There were 5 major, and 32 minor bleeding complications with no differences between groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transjugular {{intrahepatic}} portosystemic shunting (TIPS) {{has become}} an effective treatment for the complications of portal hypertension. We assessed the feasibility and outcome of TIPS in liver transplant recipients. METHODS: During the period from December 1992 to January 1998, eight adults presenting recurrent hepatitis C virus (five patients) and hepatitis B virus (one patient) infection, veno-occlusive disease (one patient), and secondary biliary cirrhosis (one patient) had TIPS because of refractory ascites (five patients), bleeding esophageal varices (one patient), refractory hepatic hydrothorax (one patient), retransplantation (two patients), and redo-biliary surgery (one patient). RESULTS: In two patients, the procedure was difficult due to cavo-caval implantation. Ascites, hydrothorax, and variceal bleeding were controlled in all patients. Moderate to severe encephalopathy developed in four patients; two patients had worsening of their existing encephalopathy. Three of five patients treated with cyclosporine needed a drastic dose reduction due {{to the development of}} severe side effects. No long-term survivor developed shunt stenosis or occlusion. Two patients did moderately well at 6 and 14 months, respectively; the former died due to chronic rejection while waiting for a retransplantation. Three did well at 14, 36, and 28 months, respectively; the latter patient died of liver failure 32 months after TIPS. One <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient</b> died after 1. 5 months due to necrotic pancreatitis. Two patients died after 4 and 8. 5 months, respectively, due to liver failure; the latter was doing well until 7 months after TIPS. CONCLUSIONS: TIPS is feasible in transplant recipients in cases of decompensated allograft cirrhosis, of allograft veno-occlusive disease or when retransplantation or redo-biliary surgery are scheduled in the presence of portal hypertension. At transplantation, the surgeon should keep in mind the eventuality of a later TIPS procedure. Close immunosuppression monitoring is warranted because modified metabolization of cyclosporine (and probably tacrolimus) may cause serious side effects...|$|E
40|$|Making a {{diagnosis}} {{is always a}} challenge for the clinician who faces a <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patient.</b> A diagnosis provides a basis for prognosis, and guides therapeutic action. Modeling of the diagnostic process provides {{an understanding of the}} contributing elements. In addition, diagnostic models can be applied to real world situations. This can be useful when the model supports or complements the clinician on particular tasks. In that way, the diagnostic model becomes a diagnostic aid. Computers can often be successfully used to implement diagnostic models, hence the term 'computer assisted diagnosis'. The performance of diagnostic aids is always an important issue. Most diagnostic aids are developed at one place, whereas they are used at an other place. In the development of diagnostic models, one often models features that are characteristic to the local patient population. These features may be different for patients elsewhere. There is a chance {{that there will be a}} decline in performance of the diagnostic aids due to these differences, and that adjustment procedures are required. These are the crucial questions addressed in this thesis. The symptom jaundice is a good starting point to model diagnostic processes. There is a reasonable consensus regarding the diagnostic categories. Diseases underlying jaundice can have serious consequences for the patient. Jaundice also is a relatively frequent symptom. These properties, together with practical, historical and organizational motives explain our choice of jaundice. Two retrospective data collections on jaundiced patients admitted to the department of Internal Medicine of Dijkzigt hospital are used throughout this thesis. A first series included 100 patients, whereas a second contained 214 patients. With these data collections at hand, we could answer the questions formulated. Especially the second data collection provided detailed information on the diagnostic parameters of the patients. There we also recorded the referral patterns. These data confirm that Dijkzigt hospital operates as a hospital with many secondary and tertiary referrals. The implementation of the data collections will be outlined in chapter 2, whereas chapter 3 present some background data on the patient populations...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{function}} in obstructive jaundice in man: Cholangiocarcinoma model. Renal function {{with respect to}} water clearance and renal hemodynamics was studied in 15 patients with obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma. The results were {{compared with those of}} the control normal subjects. There was no change in renal {{function in}} the patients with mild to moderate jaundice, with total serum bilirubin from 8. 0 to 15. 1 mg/dl. Increased urinary sodium excretion and decreased free water and negative water clearances were observed in the patients with severe jaundice with total serum bilirubin from 27. 0 to 40. 4 mg/dl and normal serum albumin. Renal blood flow was normal, but creatinine clearance was decreased. In severely <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> with serum bilirubin from 30. 5 to 40. 1 mg/dl and hypoalbuminemia urinary sodium excretion, free water clearance, negative water clearance, renal blood flow and creatinine clearance were decreased. There was salt and water retention in this group. The findings suggest that in severe jaundice there is inhibition of sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. ADH and increased hydraulic conductivity of the collecting tubules possibly contribute to decreased free water clearance. In severely <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients</b> with hypoalbuminemia this salt losing effect is converted to salt retention by increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 51 -year-old patient with a history of liver cirrhosis, who {{presented}} with jaundice (total bilirubin 50 mg/dl [855 µmol/l], direct bilirubin 20 mg/dl [342 µmol/l]) and life-threatening hypophosphataemia (serum phosphate 0. 5 mg/dl [0. 16 mmol/l]), accompanied by inappropriate phosphaturia. The patient also manifested hypouricaemia (serum uric acid 1. 7 mg/dl [101 µmol/l]) with renal uric acid wasting and renal glycosuria. This generalized proximal tubular defect may occasionally be seen in deeply <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients.</b> Therefore, serum phosphate levels should be closely monitored in these patients...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} {{was made of}} the value of: (i) the demonstration of intestinal alkaline phosphatase in plasma for the differentiation of intrahepatic from post-hepatic jaundice in 122 jaundiced patients; and (ii) the demonstration of an intermediate molecular mass gamma glutamyltransferase in plasma for the identification of post-hepatic cholestasis in 74 <b>jaundiced</b> <b>patients.</b> The first test had a diagnostic sensitivity of only 32 % with a specificity of 86 %; the second test had a sensitivity of 50 % and specificity of 75 %. It is concluded that neither procedure is worth while...|$|R
