We use TCAD simulations to confirm, predict and explain the behavior we have observed in previous experimental studies. These simulations have been developed for 90 nm technology node <b>Flash</b> floating <b>gate</b> memories, but they are fully compatible with highly scaled devices. The use of interface traps in the simulation enables to reproduce the increase in the drain current consumption and the decrease in the programming efficiency after endurance degradation.

40|$|A {{backside}} illuminated CCD {{imaging sensor}} for reading out image charges from wells of {{the array of}} pixels is significantly improved for blue, UV, far UV and low energy x-ray wavelengths (1 - 5000. ANG.) by so overthinning the backside as to place the depletion edge at the surface and depositing a thin transparent metal film of about 10.

The metal is selected {{to have a higher}} work function than that of the semiconductor to so bend the energy bands (at the interface of the semiconductor material and the oxide film) as to eliminate wells that would otherwise trap minority carriers. A bias voltage may be applied to extend the frontside depletion edge to the interface of the semiconductor material with the oxide film in the event there is not sufficient thinning.

40|$|In {{this work}} the authors study {{nanocrystal}} memory cells, {{focusing on a}} peculiar characteristic of these devices: the programming window measured in subthreshold region is larger than that measured in linear region. For converse, floating <b>gate</b> <b>flash</b> memory cells with a similar structure feature the same programming window in linear and subthreshold regions. To understand {{the cause of the}} difference observed in the nanocrystal memory cells, the authors perform two dimensional technology computer aided design simulations. They well reproduce the experimental results, indicating that the difference observed in nanocrystal memories is due to the localization of the charge into specific regions of the oxide above the channel, i. e., the nanocrystals. On the other hand, when the charge is uniformly stored in the oxide above the channel (as in the case of floating <b>gate</b> <b>flash</b> memory cells), this difference disappears...|$|R

40|$|A new physics-based {{model of}} leakage current {{suitable}} for MOS and <b>Flash</b> memory <b>gate</b> oxide {{is presented in}} this paper.

Spatial positions and energetic levels of traps have been randomly generated within the oxide by a random number generator which has been integrated into the model. Using this model, statistical simulations of leakage currents measured from both MOS and Flash EEPROM memory tunnel oxides have been carried out. In this way, experimental leakage current distributions can be directly reproduced, thus opening a wide range of useful applications in MOS and Flash EEPROM memory reliability prediction...|$|R

This top-down strategy requires a limited set of experimental measurements and provides, in a fast "one-shot" approach, a complete disturb assessment, including the effects of new failure mechanisms.

It was found that program disturb similar to the conventional stacked <b>gate</b> <b>flash</b> cell could be happened due to different amounts of charges stored in the two floating gates (FGs). Fortunately, it can be reduced significantly using the special memory array structure with the half-voltage programming technique, which employs the additional half-voltage bias on the control gates of unselected cells to prevent band-to-band tunneling generated hot holes injecting into the FGs. Simulation results indicate the new DFG flash cells are promising and practical for future multilevel flash memories. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
