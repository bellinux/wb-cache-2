40|$|Musculoskeletal pain {{associated}} with nonspecific {{changes in the}} vertebral structures and paravertebral muscles {{is the most common}} type of back pain. There is an association between back pain and education level, low physical activity, smoking intensity, and the frequency of bending and weight lifting during work; hereditary predisposition is also important. On examining a patient, it is important to rule out pain caused by a serious problem: severe somatic diseases, vertebral damages of specific etiology (injuries, neoplasms, infectious and inflammatory processes), compression damages, and psychogenic diseases. Adjacent joint diseases frequently imitate verterogenic pain. In back pain, there are most commonly three major clinical syndromes: vertebral, myogenic, and radicular. Neurological and orthopedic examinations are one of the most informative diagnostic techniques for musculoskeletal pain. Most patients with musculoskeletal pain do not need neuroimaging. Psychological factors are of great importance in the chronization of pain. Among non-drug treatments, early patient activation, walking, and swimming play a vital part; a <b>fixing</b> <b>belt</b> may be used in the acute phase. Adequate manual therapy is highly effective. Medical therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in combination with myorelaxants, as well as therapeutic blocks. Psychotherapeutic procedures, therapeutic exercises, and antidepressants are used to treat chronic pain...|$|E
50|$|In 1932, a {{temporary}} wooden tower, almost {{as high as}} the original, was built. The tower was finished in September 1934. A German optical device - a 1.76 m high, <b>fixed</b> <b>belt</b> lens - was installed in the new wooden tower. The light source was a Swedish-made, acetylene device. Depending on the distance, the light was either green or white.|$|R

25|$|With Kei {{car sales}} {{shrinking}} overall and the Cervo losing market share, sales were dropping precipitously. In February 1987 the second-generation Cervo received its {{third and final}} update. The Turbo was discontinued and the lineup rationalized to two versions, the sporty CS-G with a 5-speed manual and the lower grade CS-D with either a 4-speed manual or the 2-speed automatic. As further rationalization, all models now had roll-type safety belts (hitherto, CS and CS-D versions had come with <b>fixed</b> <b>belts),</b> front disc brakes and air conditioning.|$|R
5000|$|The {{overburden}} is then {{delivered to}} the discharge boom, which transfers the cut earth to another machine for transfer to a spreader. This may be a <b>fixed</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor system or a mobile conveyor with crawlers {{similar to those found}} on the BWE. Mobile conveyors permanently attached to the excavator take the burden of directing the material off of the operator. [...] The overburden can also be transferred directly to cross-pit Spreader, which reaches across the pit and scatters overburden at the dumping ground.|$|R

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of load assumptions for {{the calculation of}} bulk material handling equipment {{is one of the}} research projects currently undertaken by the University of Magdeburg and the University of Newcastle. This research topic also includes the detailed analysis of the conveyor belt deflection under realistic load conditions. The aim of the project, described in this article, was to develop a Finite Element simulation model for the deflection analysis of a belt conveyor using load data for the bulk material calculated by a coupled Discrete Element simulation. As the first step, static load conditions for <b>fixed</b> <b>belt</b> lengths were analysed in the research work. The paper will explain the FEM procedures for the modelling of the belt behaviour and the working principle of a coupled FEM-DEM analysis as well as the verification of the FEM results via experimental tests...|$|R
