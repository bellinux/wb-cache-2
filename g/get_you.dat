25|$|The economy rate is more {{important}} in one-day cricket and Twenty20 matches than in Test match cricket. The shorter forms of the game (ODI and T20) demand that bowlers (and fielders) restrict the flow of runs from the opposition to give their team {{a better chance of}} finishing the game with more runs on the board. In Tests, however, the priority when in the field is to bowl the opposition out and take all ten wickets in both the innings. A bowler's economy rate is normally calculated from their career record, but one might also calculate it for a specific period of time, such as a calendar year or the duration of a World Cup tournament. In one day matches, a career economy rate of less than five runs per over is good. Conceding too many quick runs in a Test match is sure to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> taken off by your captain and replaced with another bowler, while taking a wicket in limited overs matches invariably slows the run rate. Like many aspects of cricket, economy rate vs bowling average vs bowling strike rate is a matter of finding a good balance. In Twenty20 matches, anything under seven runs per over is considered to be good.|$|E

[...] He remarked that the song [...] "with its hypnotic ’la la la’ refrain and the deceptively uncomplicated, catchily repetitive beats and synth-sound, marked yet another clearly defined image transformation from the camp-infused Light Years to an emphasis upon a cool, machine-like sexuality, a trait clearly identifiable within the promotional video for ’Can’t <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Out of My Head.’" [...] Similarly, Everett True from The Guardian wrote that the song continued the [...] "change in the marketing and public perception of Kylie" [...] and her transition from the [...] "homely girl-next-door" [...] to [...] "a much more flirtatious, sophisticated persona" [...] that started with the release of [...] "Spinning Around" [...] in 2000.

[...] In 2011, Minogue's official website posted a special article marking the song's 10th anniversary on 8 September, the release date of [...] "Can't <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Out of My Head" [...] in Australia.
