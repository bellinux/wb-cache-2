40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. A common feature of Britain's staple industries during the sixty years to 1939 was {{a rejection of the}} new production technologies adopted by their main overseas competitors. This project investigated the extent to which 'path dependence' accounts for the failure of these industries to adopt the new production technologies, via a case study of the British coal industry. One of Britain's most important nineteenth century staple industries, coal mining experienced a particularly severe interwar decline. Meanwhile, it remained less mechanised than most of its major competitors, including some countries where geological conditions were regarded as less favourable. The project assessed the extent to which 'technical interrelatedness' impeded modernisation through complementarities between different items of plant, which reduced the profitability of modernising any one stage of the production process. These problems were magnified by the extremely high costs of modernising certain stages of production. Such problems were compounded by 'institutional interrelatedness' arising from Britain's fragmented mineral royalty system. The project analysed whether any significant 'lock-in' to prevailing technologies existed, the mechanisms through which any lock-in occurred, and the efficiency losses arising therefrom.

40|$|Although {{longwall}} mining productivity can far exceed that of room-and-pillar mining, the total methane emissions per extracted volume associated with longwall sections are generally {{higher than those}} for continuous miner or pillar removal sections. Increased face advance rates, increased productivities, increased panel sizes, and more extensive gate road developments have challenged existing designs for controlling methane on longwalls. Methane control research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently examined a number of practices designed to maintain concentrations in mine air within statutory limits and consistently below the lower explosive limit. These included a reservoir modeling approach to predict methane inflows in gate road entries. The outputs sug 2 that emission rates in the gate roads decreased {{with the use of}} shielding boreholes and increased degasification time. Also, mining perpendicular to the face cleats liberated more gas into the mine workings, emissions were almost a linear function of Langmuir pressure and volume, and emissions were inversely related to sorption time constant. Subsequent simulations predicted changes in methane drainage using in-seam boreholes. The results showed that longer degasification times resulted in lower face emission rates. Premining degasification produced more methane than that produced during panel extraction, a fact attributed to the already decreased methane content of the coalbed. This work concluded that longer premining degasification periods would be more advantageous to the operator. The industry trend toward increasing longwall face width can produce increased methane emissions from the face due to a higher volume of cut coal on the <b>face</b> <b>conveyor.</b> Two methods were used to estimate face methane levels on longer faces. In the first method, segmented methane data were extrapolated for greater face widths. The second method estimated emissions contributions from the shearer, <b>face</b> <b>conveyor,</b> panel belt, longwall face, and ribs, and summed these for wider panels.

The mining {{production}} systems, {{both for}} underground and open pit extraction consist mainly {{in a string}} of equipment starting with the winning equipment (shearer loader, in case of underground longwall mining or bucket wheel excavator in case of open pit mining), hauling equipment (armored <b>face</b> <b>conveyor</b> in longwall mining or the on-board belt conveyor in case of excavators), main conveying equipment (belt conveyor in both cases), transfer devices, stock pile or bunker feeding equipment. This system of mainly serially connected elements is characterized by the throughput (overall amount of bulk coal respectively overburden rock produced), which is dependent on the functioning state of each involved equipment, and is strongly affected also by the process inherent variability due to the randomness of the involved processes (e. g. the cutting properties of the rock). In order to model and simulate such production systems, some probabilistic methods are applied arising from the artificial intelligence approach, involving unit operations and equipment, as the overall system as a whole, namely the Monte Carlo simulation, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and the Load Strength Interference methods.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of desired work inside the long tunnel drilling, rating of electrical drives at tunnel face has significantly increased. Due to the high rating concentration of electrical drives at tunnel face significant voltage must be required which is need of an hour to finish the work in given time interval and to avoid the various dangers. Therefore, planning of electrical power distribution is required and voltage drop across each electrical drives must be taken into account. While power planning drill machine, Armored <b>Face</b> <b>Conveyors</b> (AFC), Shearer, breaker, Stage loader, face lightning, etc. must be given due importance as starting power required to them is very high. Breakaway torque of the AFC is not maintained because of low power, so it is required to start constantly requiring high power as well as it will heat the environment, which is often hazardous. In order to provide the required power drop and reduce the dangers, some alternative methods must be used. In the present investigation voltage drop compensation technique is developed by providing with optimization of position of transformer. Even though the voltage drop cannot be maintained in such cases boosting transformer with the power thyristor with tap changing is used to control the power instead of tap changer mechanism. In order to operate the various drives in long drilling tunnel and finish the work in desired period one must know the various parameters involved in the system.

30|$|Figures  13 and 14 {{show the}} {{comparison}} of the measured results of the WSZ and the SPZ. It can be concluded that errors exist between the theoretical calculation results and the measured data. In particular, {{in the case of}} the WSZ, obvious errors appear between the theoretical calculations and the measured results. It can be explained through the following aspects. First, the location of the observation station may cause errors. When Fig.  7 shows the working face progress to 16  m, it can be seen from the layout plan in the Fig.  9 that the layout observation station that the observation station should be placed in the working <b>face’s</b> <b>conveyor</b> gateway as required by the real situation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the range of WSZ obtained from the layer observation is not fully reliable. When the working face progresses to 16  m, the theoretical calculation result is 12.9  m. In this case, the third observation station is 9  m in front of the working face and the fourth observation station is 17  m in front of the working face. It can be found that obvious errors exist between the real location and the calculated location. However, bed-separation phenomenon is found at the third observation station and its real location is 3.9  m from the calculated location, which may cause the errors. In the whole WSZ, the observation errors are highly related to the layout of the observation station. Secondly, due to the fact that the theoretical calculations need some parameters, the parameters have to be obtained through onsite observation, which is also a factor contributing to the errors between the theoretical calculations and the observed data. Thirdly, errors may also exist in the process of obtaining the TCOED. As a key parameter, the TCOED is obtained through FLAC numerical simulation. However, the model of numerical simulation has been simplified which is different from the main roof in real geological conditions, particularly in terms of the changes of the roof thickness, the minor fracture development, and the roof’s physical characteristics. These factors may cause errors in obtaining the TCOED, which finally contribute to the errors between the theoretical calculations and the measured data.|$|R
40|$|Longwall mining is the {{dominant}} form of underground coal mining methods in Australia. As production increases {{there is also a}} need for increased face ventilation rate for gas dilution and dust mitigation. The behaviour of gas emission and respirable dust in a longwall face is a complex process {{because of the nature of}} longwall operations. The generation, dispersion and transport of airborne dust and gas are governed mainly by the spatial velocity and the movement pattern of the ventilation air. To understand the gas and dust behaviour in a complex longwall mining environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of various dust control techniques, numerical modelling has become a necessity to supplement laboratory experiments and field studies. Three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed based on a longwall face extracting a medium seam (3. 2 m) to investigate the aerodynamics of methane gas emitting from drum cutting actions, and respirable dust from different sources. The model was developed to incorporate key features on the longwall, including the shearer, armoured <b>face</b> <b>conveyor</b> (AFC), chocks, outbye facilities and dust control devices.

40|$|Unpredictable {{fracture}} of round steel link chains reduce the economic {{efficiency of the}} machines they are used in and increase the hazard potential for the operating personnel. In order to reduce such incidents appropriate measures for early detection are needed to determine an optimum time of repair or replacement. By steadily increasing strain, the currently applied, discontinuous and manually performed control processes does not present a satisfactory solution. They should be supplemented with new, {{the current state of}} the art considering approaches. This thesis addresses these issues and depicts the evaluation results of an individually developed measurement system for chains including the acquisition and processing of lifetime related variables. The focus hereby lies on standardized round steel link chains, which are preferably used in mining or in the hoisting equipment. Relevant damages to chains can be largely attributed to mechanical overstress of the base material. Typical damage patterns are fatigue fractures and forced fractures that are favoured depending on the environmental conditions, through wear and corrosion. As well-proven approach to estimate the remaining lifetime, the method of calculation of service strength was established. In adaptation to the use case chain, a component specific S-N curve and a nominal-stress-time-curve associated to collective stress are required. Subsequently, both are linked by the linear damage accumulation hypothesis. The chain specific S-N curve was created on the basis of previous trials of WBK Seilprüfstelle. The conducted dynamic fatigue trials respect a wide range of standardized chain sizes and rely on two different load assumptions. Thus a weighted consideration of the real load conditions is possible. By using the two parametric Markov counting algorithm, the collective normal stress will be calculated. Essential for this is an accurate load-time-curve that comprises of the real surrounding conditions precisely. For an accurate determination of the replacement state, the generated collective must represent the complete history of the chain link. This important requirement can only be achieved by a constantly working measurement system, which is directly connected to the focused link over the entire service life. A market research concerning established and free accessible measurement systems for chains revealed no satisfactory solution also complying with the elaborate chain specific requests. For this purpose, the development of a customized measurement system was focus of the public funded research project i-MaSS (integrated machine sensor system). For the integration of the miniaturized and energy-efficient prototypes in the chain strand, customized adapters are required. With regard to the minimal installation space available a conceptual division respective to the layout took place here. For chains with a wire gauge ≥ 30 mm (preferable mining chains) the developed adapter element looks like a stud chain link with a borehole in the middle. Wire gauges < 30 mm (e. g. hoisting chains) can not house the measurement systems directly as a consequence of the filigree geometry. In this regard an alternative solution was designed which can be mounted in the flow of force at the end of the chain strand. The testing of each adapter variant was performed on different test rigs for mining and hoisting chains separately. For the considered use case mining chain static test series were carried on a horizontally operating tension testing machine; dynamic analyses on a close to reality but unloaded armoured <b>face</b> <b>conveyor</b> test bench. The results obtained depict a linear and reproducible transmission behaviour of the complete measurement chain. The for chain hoists designed concept was trialled on a seven meter high test tower under realistic conditions. Hereby, the performed static and dynamic test series reveal a satisfying transmission behaviour, which is furthermore repeatable and analytically traceable. All test bench trials achieved acceptable results for both developed measurement concepts. Therefore, they can be used as a practicable tool for determining the load-time-curve of adequate quality. In conjunction with the deduced and for chains adapted calculation of service strength, it is now possible to estimate the remaining life time of standardized round link chains of different size more precisely...|$|E
40|$|The {{interacting}} multiple model (IMM) estimator {{is well-known}} as a cost-effective hybrid-state estimation scheme that has found application in (among other things) {{the detection of}} manoeuvering targets, robot navigation, probabilistic data association, and medical applications. Prima facie the IMM seems also to be a natural framework for fault detection and isolation (FDI) on plant where the dynamic behaviour undergoes describable structural change on the occurrence of faults. But for {{a small number of}} papers that have stated this potential, this application has not been exploited and, to date, no substantive experimental exploration of the efficacy of the the approach for FDI has been published. This thesis looks to bridge this gap. The overarching narrative of the thesis is the detection and isolation of faults on longwall mining systems and, in particular, a key piece of longwall infrastructure known as the armoured <b>face</b> <b>conveyor</b> (AFC). The purpose of the AFC is to transport sheared coal away from the coal-face. While longwall mining has many advantages, the process is limited by two characteristics: (i) the process is serial so that if one part of the system fails the whole system must usually stop; and (ii) breakdowns are frequent and the time-to-repair is usually long. AFC faults are a major contributor to the total downtime making their timely identification and isolation a powerful lever in increasing longwall productivity. Several of the faults that occur on longwall AFCs, in particular faults associated with the electrical machines that drive the conveyor, have the characteristic that when they occur, they discretely change the dynamic behaviour of the system. In this sense they look to be well suited to detection by an IMM approach. The IMM-FDI strategy explored here uses a family of plant-models, with each model describing a particular mode of operation. The members of the family are a normal operation mode and a number of fault modes. The reference plant model is based around a dynamic model that comprises two connected AC induction machines that serve as an abstraction of a real AFC. The dominant dynamics are the coupled electro-mechanical dynamics of the motors. The system faults correspond to changes in the model resulting from (i) a stator inductance fault, (ii) stator resistance fault, (iii) current probe sensor malfunction, (iv) a stator open circuit fault, and (v) an encoder malfunction. The FDI scheme works by performing continuous state propagation over each model, combined with discrete switching between alternate models using a standard IMM framework. As part of its workings, the IMM algorithm produces an estimate of the probability of each mode being the actual mode. The mode with the highest probability (on a moving average basis) is considered to be the working mode of the system, leading to the identification of the fault. The approach is explored in simulation and on a lab-scale AFC system that is able to replicate the electrical machine faults described above. In simulation the IMM-FDI technique demonstrated good discrimination capability between the faults of the fault set and was shown to be robust to incorrectly modelled fault magnitudes. When applied to the lab-scale AFC rig, the IMM-FDI scheme successfully isolated the stator inductance, current sensor, and stator open circuit faults, in addition to the normal operating regime. The incipient measurement fault could not be detected, while the stator resistance fault produced a number of false alarms. The main contribution of the thesis is the demonstration that IMM can be used for practical FDI. Like all model based FDI frameworks, the robustness of the scheme is critically dependant {{on the quality of the}} plant models in the family of failure modes. A useful next-step in this work would be to apply these ideas to an operational longwall and establish the performance of the system...|$|E
40|$|In {{underground}} coal mining, dust {{is produced}} at the <b>face,</b> at <b>conveyors,</b> at transfer points, {{and by the}} normal movement of workers and machines. The coarse coal dust particles settle rapidly. However, the fine coal particles remain airborne much longer, and the ventilating air can move this fine dust relatively long distances into the returns before settling. This fine dust is called float coal dust. It generally consists of particles of coal that pass a 200 -mesh sieve (particles smaller than 75 micrometers). Generalized rock dusting is currently the primary means of defense against coal dust explosions in U. S. mines. 30 CFR 75, Subpart E (Combustible Materials and Rock Dusting), {{requires the use of}} rock dust in bituminous coal mines (30 CFR 75. 402). The regulations state that rock dust shall be distributed upon the top, floor, and sides of all underground areas of a coal mine in such quantities that the incombustible content of the combined coal dust, rock dust, and other dust shall be not less than 65 %, and the incombustible content in the return air courses (where the dust is expected to be finer) shall be no less than 80 % (30 CFR 75. 403). These incombustible concentrations assume that the coal and rock dust are not layered, but are intimately mixed. Float coal dust is a serious explosion hazard if it accumulates on top of the rock dust and is not mixed thoroughly with the rock dust. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 2002992...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} recent development of a longwall simulation tool for analyzing shearer operations and estimating hourly and annual production output. In most cases longwall mining refers to underground coal extraction processes. Coal is mainly used for electricity and steel production. Therefore, the coal resource made a major contribution to the Total Primary Energy Supply - having an approximately one quarter share right after the oil, which provided nearly {{one third of the}} consumed energy in 2005. Compared to other fossil fuels, coal has the largest amount of proven mineral resources, which makes the average global coal production last for at least 137 years as estimated in 2006. Coal consumption is predicted to increase from 5. 3 Gt by approx. 1. 8 % per year on an average within the next 24 years. As parts of the expected amounts of mineral resources will be proven global coal mining is predicted to continue even for the next 160 - 190 years. Coal mining is divided into surface mining (approx. 40 %) and underground operations (approx. 60 %) which are drilling and blasting, room and pillar with continuous miners as well as shearer and plow longwall systems. Almost one third of the coal coming from deep mines is extracted by longwalls. Their main advantage is high productivity combined with low fatality numbers. Longwalls’ share is expected to increase as safety and productivity is getting more and more important. Shearer longwall systems consist of the Shearer to extract and load the coal onto the Armored <b>Face</b> <b>Conveyor</b> (AFC), the AFC for conveying the coal to the main gate and the roof supports to protect miners and machinery from falling rock. Currently, there are five common shearer cutting methods which differ in cutting height and cutting web per shearer’s pass. This results in different capacities and mass flows on the conveyor belts. According to those cutting methods, the Excel based algorithm divides the shearer movement into single steps along the coal face by calculating extracted masses and consumed time whilst taking possible bottle-necks into account like e. g. the cutting motor power. Finally the ratio of extracted coal and cycle time represents the capacity of the longwall system on an hourly basis. Considering the longwall crews’ schedule as well as machine availability, an annual output is estimated. This simulation tool is able to uncover system bottle-necks and it provides the user with expected production increase if one bottle-neck is removed. Additionally, it visualizes coal load on the belts which enables users to analyze their conveying systems. A second implemented shearer simulates two parallel running longwalls conveying coal on one common belt. The second machine can be operated in an automatic mode that corresponds to the first longwall’s coal load reaching optimized belt utilization. The software was calibrated and verified in a coal mine of the Appalachian-Region. The following figures were calibrated: specific required energy for cutting and loading the coal, required pulling forces at the face and friction factors of upper and lower AFC races. The verification procedure contained a comparison of real and virtual shearer movements as well as a comparison of the real and calculated amount of coal coming from one shearer’s pass. As a result of this study, a negligible difference of less than 6 % was detected in calculated and real mine data over an almost six week period. With regards to most of the evaluation criteria, the software performance is either good or excellent, particularly the distinguished precision. Only disadvantages are a less flexible algorithm and some unfavourable settings regarding maintenance and software extension while working with Excel. Fields of further software development are the shearer drum design, the roof support, the ventilation system and the longwall development which can be limiting factors to the shearer speed. The algorithm should also be updated for the latest inventions of cutting very large seams by utilizing Longwall Top Coal Caving methods and mining very low seams with longwall plow systems. Object oriented programming is regarded as the new software basis which tends to match better than Excel does regarding flexibility and user-friendly interfaces. To summarize: the described simulation tool is unique and can save {{a lot of time and}} money. It has outstanding capabilities in uncovering improvement potentials of shearer longwall systems that can be achieved only by changing cutting methods instead of installing bigger motor power...|$|E
