2500|$|... 2008: DuckDuckGo {{was founded}} by Gabriel Weinberg, an {{entrepreneur}} who previously launched Names Database, a now-defunct social network. Initially self-funded by Weinberg, DuckDuckGo is now advertising-supported but the user has the option to disable ads. The search engine is written in Perl and runs on nginx, FreeBSD and Linux. DuckDuckGo is built primarily upon search APIs from various vendors. Because of this, TechCrunch characterized the service as a [...] "hybrid" [...] search engine. At the same time, it produces its own content pages, and thus is similar to Mahalo, Kosmix and SearchMe. Weinberg explained {{the beginnings of the}} name with respect to the children's game duck, duck, goose. He said of the origin of the name, [...] "Really it just popped in my head one day and I just liked it. It is certainly influenced/derived from duck duck goose, but other than that there is no relation, e.g.,a metaphor." [...] DuckDuckGo has been featured on TechCrunch's <b>Elevator</b> <b>Pitch</b> Friday and it was a finalist in the BOSS Mashable Challenge.|$|E

5000|$|An [...] "elevator pitch" [...] is a {{short summary}} of the plan's {{executive}} summary. This is often used as a teaser to awaken the interest of potential investors, customers, or strategic partners.

50|$|In 2006, the <b>elevator</b> (<b>pitch</b> control) {{system in}} Tucker's {{aerobatic}} aircraft broke during a practice aerobatic flight, {{forcing him to}} bail out over an empty farm field in Coushatta, Louisiana. He was uninjured, but the aircraft he was flying was destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The {{name is a}} {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} rudder and elevator. In a conventional aircraft tail configuration, the rudder provides yaw (horizontal) control and the <b>elevator</b> provides <b>pitch</b> (vertical) control.|$|R
50|$|The {{controls}} are two-axis, with a side-stick that laterally activates the rudder to induce roll and which longitudinally activates the <b>elevator</b> for <b>pitch</b> control. No rudder pedals are installed and the wing construction is greatly simplified by {{the elimination of}} ailerons.|$|R
50|$|Each summer (in the Northern hemisphere) or winter (in the Southern hemisphere), {{the major}} American {{broadcast}} television networks - including ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC - receive about 500 brief <b>elevator</b> <b>pitches</b> each for new shows from writers and producers. That fall, each network requests scripts for about 70 pitches and, the following January (which would be {{winter in the}} Northern hemisphere and summer in the Southern hemisphere), orders about 20 pilot episodes. Actors come to Los Angeles from within the area or elsewhere in the United States {{and around the world}} to audition for them. By spring (Northern hemisphere)/fall (Southern hemisphere), actors are cast and production crews assembled to produce the pilots.|$|R

50|$|Similar issues {{occur with}} the <b>elevator</b> and <b>pitch</b> control. Without extra design {{measures}} to ensure adequate control response, {{any attempt to}} make a last-minute correction to the flight path is likely to prove too little too late, making a last-minute landing abort and fly-around difficult and dangerous.|$|R
50|$|Montgomery devised {{different}} control {{methods for}} his gliders, including weight shifting for roll and an <b>elevator</b> for <b>pitch</b> (1884). Subsequent designs used hinged, pilot-operated trailing edge flaps {{on the wings}} (1885-1886) for roll control, and later, full wing warping systems for roll (1903-1905) and for both pitch and roll (1911).|$|R
50|$|RC Helicopters {{usually have}} at least four controls: roll - cyclic <b>pitch,</b> <b>elevator</b> (fore-aft cyclic <b>pitch),</b> rudder (yaw) and pitch/throttle (collective pitch/power). For simple flight, the radio is usually {{configured}} such that pitch is around −1 degree at 0% throttle stick, and somewhere around 10 degrees at 100% throttle stick. It is also necessary to modulate the throttle {{in conjunction with the}} pitch so that the model maintains a constant rotor speed. This is beneficial for consistent and smooth flight performance.|$|R

It’s important to develop and practice an effective pitch so you are ready to use it under fire. When you step onto an elevator with Warren Buffett or Bill Gates, you want to be prepared! This worksheet will help you create an amazing pitch by using the “High Five” method of What, Who, Wow, Why and When. Note: As you develop your pitch, use words and pictures to engage both your right- and left-brain functions while stimulating your creative juices!
