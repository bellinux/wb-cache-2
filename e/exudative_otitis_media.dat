Although its cause {{is not yet}} {{perfectly}} established, the pathology, often a sequel of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (AOM), is mainly characterized by persistent fluid in the middle ear cavity. Twenty-two children with a diagnosis of SOM were treated daily for 90 days with an oral formulation containing the oral probiotic Streptococcus salivarius K 12 (Bactoblis®). After treatment, the children were evaluated for AOM episodes and subjected to tone audiometry, tympanometry, endonasal endoscopy, otoscopy, and tonsillar examination. Subject compliance and probiotic tolerability and side effects have also been evaluated. Our results indicate a good safety profile, a substantial reduction of AOM episodes, and a positive outcome from the treatment {{for all of the}} clinical outcomes tested. We conclude that strain K 12 may have a role in reducing the occurrence and/or severity of SOM in children. From our perspective, this study constitutes a starting point toward the organization of a more extensive placebo-controlled study aimed at critically appraising our preliminary observations.

Twenty-eight histologically {{confirmed}} {{cases of}} porcine leptomeningitis were examined retro-spectively, with {{focus on the}} pathology of the inner and middle ear, brain, and vestibulocochlear nerve. Tissues were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry for Streptococcus suis serotype 2 antigen, and the bacteriologic results were recorded. <b>Exudative</b> <b>otitis</b> interna was diagnosed in 20 / 28 pigs (71 %). The lesions primarily affected the perilymphatic ducts, with consistent involvement of the scala tympani. Perineuritis of the vestibulocochlear nerve was seen in all but four of the ears affected with otitis interna. Immunohistochemically, S. suis serotype 2 antigen was demonstrated in the leptomeningeal, perineural, and labyrinthine exudates in 11 cases. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> was diagnosed in 10 / 28 pigs (34 %), but evidence of extension to the inner ear was not observed.

The classifications of the location of the remnants of lymphoid tissue and the extent of scarring in the nasopharynx are given. The subject of this work is to trace the relationship of postoperative nasopharyngeal changes with recurrent EOM. Objective: To study the immediate and long-term results of different methods of surgical treatment of hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue in children with <b>exudative</b> <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Materials and Methods: This paper presents information on the results of treatment of 62 children of 5 – 7 years suffering from <b>exudative</b> <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Observations were carried out in two groups of patients. The first group included 28 children previously undergone adenoidectomy, with the signs of recurrent exudative otitis. The second group included 34 children with exudative otitis previously untreated surgically. The task of the investigation is to study the effectiveness of endonasal and extranasal methods of surgical removal of nasopharengeal lymphoid tissue with a minimum probability of scar obliteration of the mouth of the Eustachian tube. Results and discussion: The priority method in nasopharengeal surgery in children is extranasal access with shaver technology in conjunction with cold plasma surgery. The using of these methods gives a clear visualization of the operating field under conditions of moderately bleeding wound. On the other hand, endonasal approach is associated with traumatization of the nasal mucosa with incomplete volume visualization of the surgical field. This combination can result in a longer healing of the surgical wound, the formation of adhesions of the nasal cavity and scarring in the nasopharynx. Complete visualization of the operating field significantly affects the long-term results of EOM treatment in childhood.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess changes in incidence of consultation rates, antibiotic prescription, and referral rates for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in children over the years 1995 - 2003. METHODS: A cohort study including all children aged 0 to 13 years within the research database of the Netherlands University Medical Center Utrecht Primary Care Network covering the period 1995 - 2003. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> diagnoses were recorded according to the International Classification of Primary Care codes and antibiotic prescription according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> incidence rates were calculated as episodes per 1000 person-years. Antibiotic prescription and referral rates were calculated per 100 <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> episodes. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2003, the overall general practitioner consultation rates for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion declined by 9 % and 34 %, respectively. In children aged 2 to 6 years and those aged 6 to 13 years, the incidence rates of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion declined by 15 % and 41 % and 40 % and 48 %, respectively. In children < 2 years of age, the incidence rates of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 46 % and 66 %, respectively. Antibiotic prescription rates for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 45 % and 25 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> is {{a complex}} and multifactorial {{condition}} with four defined stages: myringitis, acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> secretory (serous) <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants, mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. The rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation {{has been associated with}} the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> In acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> the major organisms, present are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> these organisms, plus Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. The microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> is almost identical with that in acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Empirical therapy can be given in most instances of acute and serous <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> However, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromized and in instances of chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. The growing resistance of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> By adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. Management of chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. where present...|$|R

The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes.

Diagnosing children with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> is difficult, often leading to overprescription of antibiotics as they are beneficial only for children with acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> This underscores the need for an accurate and automated diagnostic algorithm. To that end, we design a feature set understood by both otoscopists and engineers based on the actual visual cues used by otoscopists; we term this the <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> vocabulary. We also design a process to combine the vocabulary terms based on the decision process used by otoscopists; we term this the <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> grammar. The algorithm achieves 89. 9 % classification accuracy, outperforming both clinicians who did not receive special training and state-of-the-art classifiers. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> with {{effusion}} (serous <b>otitis</b> <b>media)</b> is characterised by {{an accumulation}} of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. Serous <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{is the most common}} cause of hearing loss in children in the developed world. Hearing loss may be affected speech, cognitive, and psychological development of the childeren. In addition, <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion is not only seen in children, this sign may present with signs of nasopharyngeal diseases. For this reason, especially in childhood <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion should be treated by early diagnosis. [Archives Medical Review Journal 2013; 22 (2. 000) : 194 - 208...|$|R
40|$|Acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with {{effusion}} {{are common}} childhood disorders, {{a source of}} significant morbidity, and {{a leading cause of}} antibiotic prescription in primary health care. Although effective treatments are available, some shortcomings remain, and thus better treatments would be welcome. Recent discoveries within the field of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> research relating to its etiology and pathogenesis have led to further investigation aimed at developing novel treatments.

40|$|Allergy and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with {{effusion}} {{are often}} considered as comorbidities. Evidence {{points to a}} role for allergy in the pathogenesis of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion in reports of increased prevalence of allergy in patients with <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion and presence of late-phase allergic-response inflammatory mediators and cytokines in the middle-ear effusion of allergic subjects. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Many speculations have been made, but well-controlled studies to prove the efficacy of anti-allergic medication {{in the treatment of}} <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion are lacking. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of glucocorticosteroids in allergic patients with <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculous <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> {{is a rare}} extra-pulmonary {{presentation}} of tuberculosis. Tuberculous <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> is usually associated with pulmonary tuberculosis or tuberculosis involving nasopharynx and oropharynx.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> with {{effusion}} is {{a common}} disorder in children which may either resolve spontaneously or cause undesirable complications especially if associated with persistent hearing loss. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion contributes to hearing loss, poor speech acquisition and learning difficulties. There has not been any retrievable study done to show the magnitude of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion and its complication in our country. Aim: This study aimed at determining the prevalence of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion among preschool children in Kinondoni district, Dar-es-salaam. Materials and Methods: This {{study was conducted in}} Kinondoni district, Dar-es- salaam in Tanzania among 541 preschool children aged 2 to 6 years. Random sampling method was used. Otoscopic examination was done by the principal investigator using pneumatic otoscope. Diagnosis of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion was reached by findings of the ear drum with exclusion of features of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Tympanometry was conducted by research assistant and type B curve was regarded as diagnostic for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion. EPI-INFO version 6. 04 d computer programme was used to analyze the data and relationships were tested at 5 % tolerable error. Results: Out of 541 preschool children screened, 24 % had <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion in one or both ears. Fifteen percent had bilateral <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion while 4. 8 % had right and 4. 3 % had left <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion respectively. Of the screened female children, 26. 5 % had <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion which was slightly higher than males (21. 7 %). The prevalence of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion was higher (24. 5 %) among children aged 5 to 6 years as compared to prevalence of 22. 5 % among children aged 2 - 4 years. Both pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometer detected <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion in 17. 8 % of children aged 2 to 4 years while 14. 3 % of children aged 5 to 6 years were detected by pneumatic otoscope and 14. 1 % were detected by tympanometer. The pneumatic otoscopy was found {{to be as good as}} tympanometry in diagnosing <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion and it's sensitivity was found to be 97. 7 % and specificity was 99. 5 %. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion among preschool children in Kinondoni district in Dar-es-salaam was noted to be high. The prevalence was higher among children aged 5 to 6 years and in females. Pneumatic otoscopy was as good as tympanometry in diagnosing <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion...|$|R
