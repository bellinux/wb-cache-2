40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of past climatic {{fluctuations}} on the distribution and population-size dynamics of cold-adapted species is essential for predicting their responses to ongoing global climate change. In spite of the heterogeneity of cold-adapted species, two main contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain their responses to Late Quaternary glacial cycles, namely, the interglacial contraction versus the interglacial expansion hypotheses. Here, we use the cold-adapted plant Primula farinosa to test two demographic models under {{each of the two}} alternative hypotheses and a fifth, null model. We first approximate the time and extent of <b>demographic</b> <b>contractions</b> and expansions during the Late Quaternary by projecting species distribution models across the last 72 ka. We also generate genome-wide sequence data using a Reduced Representation Library approach to reconstruct the spatial structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of lineages within P. farinosa. Finally, by integrating the results of climatic and genomic analyses in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework, we propose the most likely model for the extent and direction of population-size changes in P. farinosa through the Late Quaternary. Our results support the interglacial expansion of P. farinosa, differing from the prevailing paradigm that the observed distribution of cold-adapted species currently fragmented in high altitude and latitude regions reflects the consequences of postglacial contraction processes.

Consequently, there is value in investigating the connectivity of populations of species inhabiting different environments in order to evaluate dispersal as a potential strategy for persistence {{in the face of}} climate change. Here, we begin to investigate the processes that shape genetic variation within American pika populations from the northern periphery of their range, the central Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. At these latitudes, pikas inhabit sharp elevation gradients ranging from sea level to 1500 m, providing an excellent system for studying the effects of local environmental conditions on pika population genetic structure and gene flow. We found low levels of neutral genetic variation compared to previous studies from more southerly latitudes, consistent with the relatively recent post-glacial colonization of the study location. Moreover, significant levels of inbreeding and marked genetic structure were detected within and among sites. Although low levels of recent gene flow were revealed among elevations within a transect, potentially admixed individuals and first generation migrants were identified using discriminant analysis of principal components between populations separated by less than five kilometers at the same elevations. There was no evidence for historical population decline, yet there was signal for recent <b>demographic</b> <b>contractions,</b> possibly resulting from environmental stochasticity. Correlative analyses revealed an association between patterns of genetic variation and annual heat-to-moisture ratio, mean annual precipitation, precipitation as snow and mean maximum summer temperature. Changes in climatic regimes forecasted for the region may thus potentially increase the rate of population extirpation by further reducing dispersal between sites. Consequently, American pika may have to rely on local adaptations or phenotypic plasticity in order to survive predicted climate changes, although additional studies are required to investigate the evolutionary potential of this climate change sensitive species...|$|R

Altitudinal gradients represent assemblage of environmental, especially climatic, variable factors that influence the plant distributions. Global warming that triggered upward migrations has therefore impacted the alpine plants on an island. In this study, we examined the genetic structure of Juniperus morrisonicola, a dominant alpine species in Taiwan, and inferred historical, demographic dynamics based on multilocus analyses. Lower levels of genetic diversity in north indicated that populations at higher latitudes were vulnerable to climate change, possibly related to historical alpine glaciers. Neither organellar DNA nor nuclear genes displayed geographical subdivisions, indicating that populations were likely interconnected before migrating upward to isolated mountain peaks, providing low possibilities of seed/pollen dispersal across mountain ranges.

Individuals were genetically typed Lit six microsatellite loci using multiplex PCR amplification. Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found for the total population of wild boar in Portugal. Wild boar population genetic structure was assessed using Bayesian methods, Suggesting the existence of three subpopulations (North, Centre and South). Tests were conducted to detect the presence of potential migrants and hybrids between subpopulations. After exclusion of these individuals, three sets of wild boars representative of respective subpopulations were distinguished and tested for the effects of recent bottlenecks. Genetic distances between pairs of subpopulations were quantified using F(ST) and R(ST) estimators, revealing a variation of 0. 138 - 0. 178 and 0. 107 - 0. 198, respectively.

However, recent evidence has revealed a weak predictive power of this model for terrestrial species in insular and coastal settings. We investigated the Pleistocene EC dynamics and their evolutionary consequences on temperate species using the Maltese archipelago and its endemic lizard Podarcis filfolensis as a model system. The evolutionary and demographic history of P. filfolensis as inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear sequences data does not conform to the EC model predictions, supporting (i) demographic and spatial stability or expansion, rather than contraction, of the northern and southern lineages during the last glacial period; and (ii) a major role for allopatric differentiation primed by sea-level dynamics, rather than prolonged demographic stability, {{in the formation of the}} observed genetic diversity. When combined with evidence from other Mediterranean refugia, this study shows how the incorporation of Pleistocene sea-level variations in the EC model accounts for a reverse demographic and range response of insular and coastal temperate biotas relative to continental ones. Furthermore, this cross-archipelago pattern in which allopatric diversity is formed and shaped by EC cycles resembles that seen between isolated populations within mainland refugia and suggests that the EC model, originally developed to explain population fluctuations into and out-of refugia, may be appropriate for describing the demographic and evolutionary dynamics driving the high genetic diversity observed in these areas. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Over three days, more than 300 residents of the village of Shillington and the local area took part in the excavations in 23 different locations throughout the present village. The results provided new evidence {{for the development of the}} area now occupied by the village, which mostly lies alongside a small stream, from the prehistoric period onwards. The landscape was used by humans in the prehistoric period, apparently favouring the area nearer the small brook running west of the prominent hill which dominates the land around the parish. One test pit near this stream produced convincing evidence for undisturbed settlement remains in the immediate vicinity. Small quantities of pottery of Roman date came from five different sites, two of them away from the Brookside area hinting at a pattern of settlement or agricultural land use moving beyond the lower lying zones. No evidence was found for any activity dating to the period between the 5 th – 9 th centuries AD, but Saxo-Norman pottery of 10 th – 11 th century date was found in two distinct concentrations, suggesting more than one hamlet present, possibly part of a nucleated pattern of settlement, at this time. The high medieval period saw settlement at these sites grow and that at three other ‘ends’ appear, indicating a pattern of mixed dispersed and nucleated settlement. This growth ceases in the late medieval period, with Shillington particularly badly affected in this period of widespread <b>demographic</b> and settlement <b>contraction</b> compared to many settlements in the eastern region.

In the California flora, relatively little attention has been given to the evolutionary history of paleoendemics from a molecular perspective, yet they number among some of the world's most iconic plant species. Here, we address questions of demographic change in Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia) that is restricted to a narrow belt of groves in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We ask whether the current distribution is a result of northward colonization since the last glacial maximum (LGM), restriction of a broader range in the recent past (LGM) or independent colonizations in the deeper past. Genetic diversity at eleven microsatellite loci decreased with increasing latitude, but partial regressions suggested this was a function of smaller population sizes in the north. Disjunct populations north of the Kings River were divergent from those south of the Kings River that formed a single cluster in Bayesian assignment tests. Demographic inferences supported a <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction</b> just prior to the LGM as the most likely scenario for the current disjunct range of the species. This contraction appeared to be superimposed upon a long-term decline in giant sequoia over the last 2 million years, associated with increasing aridity due to the Mediterranean climate. Overall, low genetic diversity, together with competition in an environment to which giant sequoia is likely already poorly adapted, will pose major constraints on its success in the face of increasing aridity...|$|E

The polecat is now recovering and expanding throughout Britain, but introgressive hybridization with feral ferrets has been reported, which could be masking the true range of the polecat and introducing domestic genes into the species. We used a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region and 11 microsatellite loci to characterize the frequency and extent of hybridization and introgression between the two species and assess whether the 19 th-century decline corresponded to a genetic bottleneck in the polecat. The proportion of admixture detected in the wild was high (31 %) and hybrids were more frequently found outside Wales, suggesting that hybridization is more likely to occur along {{the eastern edge of the}} polecat's range expansion. The patterns observed in the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data show that introgression was mediated by crosses between male polecats and female ferrets, whose offspring backcrossed with polecats. No first-generation (F 1) hybrids were identified, and the broad range of observed admixture proportions agrees with a scenario of past extensive hybridization between the two species. Using several different methods to investigate demographic history, we did not find consistent evidence for a genetic bottleneck in the British polecat, a result that could be interpreted {{as a consequence of}} hybridization with ferrets. Our results highlight the importance of the Welsh polecat population for the conservation and restoration of the genetic identity of the British polecat...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} {{of higher education}} institutions (HEIs), dispersed in different locations throughout the country, {{is probably one of}} the most striking features associated with the expansion of this level of education in Portugal in the last 40 years. This phenomenon is particularly relevant since the level of qualification of the Portuguese active population remains small. The presence of HEIs causes very diverse effects of economic and social nature, which should be addressed as a whole (over the whole period of their occurrence). In confronting objectives of economic rationality and improvement of the qualification of Portuguese population, particularly of young people, it is important to discuss the possibility of a network of HEIs, at the same time, efficient and promoting territorial cohesion. In 2006, the OECD has pointed to the decline in demand associated with, among other factors, a sharp <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction,</b> in conjunction with the {{existence of}} an excess in installed supply, particularly in certain areas, in this level of education.

It is clear that the design of a network of HEIs is always political. Nevertheless, this decision making should be based on assumptions of a technical nature. A discussion of these assumptions is the goal we want to achieve with this paper. ...|$|E

Over three weekends, more than 300 residents of the village of Meldreth and the local area took part in the excavations in 32 different locations throughout the present village. The results provided new evidence {{for the development of the}} area now occupied by the village, which mostly lies alongside a small stream, from the prehistoric period onwards. Parts of the area appears to have been quite intensively used by humans in the prehistoric period, with unusually large volumes of Bronze Age pottery recovered from at least four different sites likely to be indicative of settlement and/or burial. Pottery of Roman date favours the south of the present village, and suggests settlement took the form of a dispersed scatter of small settlements such as farmsteads surrounded by arable fields to the north. No evidence was found for any activity dating to the period between the 5 th – 9 th centuries AD, but Saxo-Norman pottery was found widely, with particular concentrations on the manorial site of Topcliffe as well as in the south of the village around Flambards moated site. The absence of any Thetford ware from Meldreth suggests that this activity is likely to be post-Conquest in date and that the medieval settlement originates in this period rather than earlier. The high medieval period sees the settlement extend westwards, probably laid out in the 12 th or 13 th century over former arable, with apparently new settlement sites founded at Chiswick and North End. This growth ceases in the late medieval period, although Meldreth does not appear to be as badly affected in this period of widespread <b>demographic</b> and settlement <b>contraction</b> as many settlements in the eastern region.

We used mitochondrial DNA haplotypic and microsatellite genotypic data to investigate levels of genetic variation and reconstruct the history of replicate invasions on three continents in a globally invasive bird, the monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus). We evaluated whether {{genetic diversity}} at invasive sites could be explained by (i) the native source populations from which they were derived and (ii) demographic bottlenecks during introduction. Genetic data indicated a localized source area for most sampled invasive populations, with limited evidence for admixing of native source populations. This pattern largely coincides with historical data on pet trade exports. However, the invasive populations are genetically more similar than predicted from the export data alone. The extent of bottleneck effects varied among invasive populations. The observed low genetic diversity, evidence of <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction</b> and restricted source area do not support the hypothesis that invasion is favoured by the mixing and recombining of genetic variation from multiple source populations. Instead, they suggest that reduced genetic variation through random processes may not inhibit successful establishment and invasion in this species. However, convergent selection across invasive sites could also explain the observed patterns of reduction and similarity in genetic variation and/or the restricted source area. In general, the alternative explanation of intraspecific variation in invasive potential among genotypes or geographic areas is neglected, but warrants more attention as it could inform comparative studies and management of biological invaders.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We employed a combined approach of molecular phylogeography and species distribution modelling (SDM) {{to predict the future}} responses of these two species to climate change, utilizing evidence of responses from the past. Genetic data for C. sibirica shows a significant phylogeographical signal (N ST > F ST, P< 0. 05) and <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction</b> during the glacial-interglacial cycles in the Pleistocene. This forest species would likely experience range reduction, though without genetic loss, in the face of future climate change. In contrast, SDMs predict that C. songorica, a steppe species, should maintain a consistently stable potential distribution under the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the future climatic conditions referring to its existing potential distribution. Molecular results indicate that the presence of significant phylogeographical signal in this steppe species is rejected and this species contains a high level of genetic differentiation among populations in cpDNA, likely benefiting from stable habitats over a lengthy time period. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Evidence from the molecular phylogeography of these two species, the forest species is more sensitive to past climate changes than the steppe species. SDMs predict that the forest species will face the challenge of potential range contraction in the future more than the steppe species. This provides a perspective on ecological management in arid Eastern Central Asia, indicating that increased attention should be paid to montane forest species, due to their high sensitivity to disturbance...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is {{first of its}} kind for Kerala, being the first migration study that covers the entire state and encompasses both measurement as well as analysis of the various types and facets of migration. Migration has been the single-most dynamic factor in the otherwise dreary development scenario of Kerala {{in the last quarter of}} the twentieth century. Kerala is approaching the end of the millennium with a little cheer in many people's homes, a major contributing factor for which has been migration. Migration has contributed more to poverty alleviation in Kerala than any other factor, including agrarian reforms, trade union activities and social welfare legislation. The study shows that nearly 1. 5 million Keralites now live outside India. They send home more than Rs. 4, 000 million a year by way of remittances. Three-quarters of a million former emigrants have come back. They live mostly on savings, work experience, and skills brought with them from abroad. More than a million families depend on internal migrants'earnings for subsistence, children's education and other economic requirements. Whereas the educationally backward Muslims from the Thrissur-Malappuram region provide the backbone of emigration, it is the educationally forward Ezhawas, Nairs and Syrian Christians from the former Travancore-Cochin State who form the core of internal migration. The paper also analyses the determinants and consequences of internal and external migration. It offers suggestions for policy formulation for the optimum utilization of remittances sent home by the emigrants and the expertise brought back by the return migrants. Migration in Kerala began with demographic expansion, but it won't end with <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction.</b> Kerala has still time to develop itself into an internally self-sustaining economy. The prevailing cultural milieu of Kerala in which its people believe that anything can be achieved through agitation and any rule can be circumvented with proper political connections, must change and be replaced by a liberalised open economy with strict and definite rules of the game. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} project addresses three observations: {{the degree}} to which researchers routinely use data collected only on survivors, ignoring that who is included in samples is pre-determined by non-random mortality; that historical mortality gaps between blacks and whites have generated a cumulative <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction</b> among blacks that constitute a non-trivial vanishing electorate; and that differences in infant mortality rates (IMRs) between blacks and whites strongly correlate with the party that controls the presidency. I used data from several sources including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Multiple Causes of Death, MIDUS, and the U. S. Census Bureau among others. Because researchers are always dealing with samples truncated by non-random mortality, paradigms in social research like the relationship between age and participation are partially spurious. I find that the effect that age exerts on participation is mediated by mortality rates linked to differences in SES because, as time progresses, low-SES individuals (i. e., low-level participants) die younger than high-SES individuals (i. e., high-level participants). I also set forth a model for the impact of racial mortality gaps on the total vote lost among blacks (1970 - 2004). Because the dead cannot vote or voice opinions, excess deaths exacerbate the imbalance of socio-political power, especially between blacks and whites, where health differences are most pronounced. I show that the total number of excess deaths among blacks is large enough to affect the outcome of presidential elections. And, finally, I investigate the fluctuations of national and black and white IMRs associated with the political party in power. Party differences in policy preferences lead to different results in many aspects of social development, of which health is no exception. Results show that {{a good portion of the}} comparative international underperformance of the U. S. for IMR as well as of persistent black-white disparities in IMR is related to variations imparted under Republican presidents between 1965 and 2010...|$|E
40|$|Bedevilling {{the ongoing}} debate {{about changes in}} real-incomes in late-medieval western Europe, {{especially}} during the so-called ‘Golden Age of the Labourer’, is the very troubling issue of ‘wage-stickiness’. The standard and long-traditional explanation for this supposed ‘Golden Age’ of rising real wages is that sharp fall in population – with the Black Death (from 1348), subsequent waves of bubonic plagues, and other forces for <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction</b> up to the late 15 th century – dramatically altered the land:labour ratio in ways {{that led to a}} pronounced rise in the marginal productivity of labour, which in turn forced up real wages. This simplistic model assumes (1) that rising real wages in the agrarian sector were transmitted to other sectors (whether or not they also experienced rising labour productivity); (2) that changes in the marginal revenue product of labour did not diverge or vary from changes in its marginal productivity; and (3) that wages were flexible, downwards as well as upwards. Though one might readily provide evidence that the MRP of various kinds of labour, in England and the cross-Channel Low Countries (Flanders), did not in fact continually rise as this model predicts, the focus of this paper is instead upon the behaviour of money wages, with widespread nominal ‘wage-stickiness’, in relation to changes in the price-index and cost of living, in both of these countries. For England, the cost-of-living index is measured by the well known Phelps Brown & Hopkins ‘basket of consumables’ index; and for Flanders, it is measured by one that I have constructed from Flemish price data, using the same weights as in the PBH index. 	For both countries, the evidence indicates that, while money wages for most craftsmen and labourers did rise following the Black Death – though by no means for all labourers [...] such a rise did not in all cases keep pace with the inflationary rise in prices that both countries endured for almost 30 years after the Black Death. In England, furthermore, where most craftsmen and workers had suffered a fall in money wages in the two decades before Black Death, the post-Plague rise in money wages did not regain the level of the 1320 s until the 1360 s. In the later 14 th century, however, first England and then Flanders experienced an equally dramatic deflation, one that endured into {{the first quarter of the}} 15 th century. It was during this deflationary era that real wages finally did rise substantially – and chiefly because nominal money wages remained fixed, while the cost of living fell sharply. The rest of this paper analyses the various institutional, social, and other factors that help to explain the widespread prevalence of money-wage stickiness over very long periods, in England and the Low Countries. For England, the most significant institutional factor to be considered is the role of the 1351 Statute of Labourers, which tried to fix wages at the unusually low level that had pertained on the eve of the Black Death. No comparable wage legislation was imposed in Flanders; and yet the behaviour of real wages there did not significantly differ from those in England. 	It must also be noted that, in the early to mid 15 th century, some money wages did slowly rise, while deflation continued – thus indicating other forces at work to increase real wages; but in Flanders the resumption of short-term inflations, from the 1420 s to early 1440 s, with coinage debasements, tended to eliminate these gains, especially for woollen textile workers, those employed in Flanders’ major manufacturing industry. 	The question posed in the title, ‘did money matter’, is a very important one; for the almost equally important focus of this paper is that the late-medieval inflations and deflations (including the pronounced deflation preceding the Black Death) were essentially monetary, and not demographic, phenomena. ...|$|E
40|$|This Working Paper {{is about}} Videsha Malayalikal, or Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs). It {{provides}} the size, trend, geographical distribution, socio-economic composition of migrants, and remittances sent {{back by the}} migrants. The situation with respect to migration in 2004 is compared with that in 1999. The main focus of the study is, however, {{the analysis of the}} social and economic consequences of emigration on Kerala society. What have been the macroeconomic consequences of emigration? What are its impacts on human resources development, employment, unemployment and household consumption patterns? To what extent has the large-scale emigration from the state been beneficial to the Kerala society? Has emigration been a factor in Kerala's high unemployment rate? During the five-year period 1999 - 04, the number of emigrants increased from 13. 6 lakh to 18. 4 lakh, and the number of Non-Resident Keralites (emigrants plus return emigrants) increased from 21. 0 lakh to 27. 3 lakh. The Gulf region has not been the only, although still a very dominant, destination of Kerala emigrants of 2004; Kerala emigrants have spread their wings over a larger number of countries during 1999 - 04, including countries in Europe, America and South East Asia. Within the Gulf region itself, significant realignments have taken place. Saudi Arabia has lost some of its charm and United Arab Emirates has emerged, as the preferred destination. Remittances to Kerala from abroad increased from Rs 13. 65 thousand crore in 1999 to Rs 18. 46 thousand crore in 2004. As a result of remittances, the per capita state income in Kerala has increased by Rs 5, 678. The increase has been, however, as much as Rs 10, 654 in Thrissur district, Rs 7, 681 in Pathanamthitta district and Rs 7677 in Malappuram district. Foreign remittances to the state have been 7 times of what the state received from the Government of India as budget support, 15 times the receipts from cashew export, and 19 times the receipt from marine export. They have formed 1. 8 times the annual budget of the state. However, the proportion of remittances to State Domestic Product has shown a slight decrease from 25 percent in 1999 to 22 percent in 2004. * * * * * * The KMS had emphasized the beneficial effects of emigration, on per capita income, education, employment, housing, household amenities and consumer durables. In the early stages of Kerala emigration, the beneficial effects over-shadowed the adverse effects. Now that Kerala emigration has come of age, secondary effects, which are not so beneficial, are beginning to appear. In this study, we have emphasized the emerging negative impacts of emigration more than the positive impacts. The first and the foremost among the negative impacts has been on the unemployment rate. The paper gives an unorthodox view of the relationship between emigration and unemployment. A point of view, which this study puts forth is that emigration is a causative factor in the high unemployment rate prevailing in the state. An equally important "adverse" consequence is the emergence of "replacement migration". Emigrants from Kerala have converted Kerala itself into a "Gulf" for many a migrant worker from other states in India. By accepting low wages and poor living conditions, these outside workers are taking away a lot of work, which otherwise could have gone to Kerala workers. Replacement migration is a consequence of emigration, and is having significant effect on unemployment and wage rates in Kerala. It is nullifying some of the potentially positive spin-off effects of emigration. The greatly increased disposable income in the Kerala households had its effect on the consumption pattern in the state. Higher levels of consumption, however, have not helped industrialization in Kerala, as most of the goods Kerala consumes come from outside the state. The potential spin-off effects of remittances on employment are benefiting workers outside Kerala more than workers in Kerala. Consumerism is draining the state of the development potential of its remittance receipts. It is leading many a Kerala family to financial ruin and even to suicide. Consumerism, brought about by emigration, has gone amok in the state with minimum positive impact on its employment situation. The increasing economic and political clout of the "new rich", who became rich because of emigration and the Gulf connection, is creating a climate of resentment against them among some communities in Kerala. The Chief Minister of Kerala was being accused of antiminority mentality for his alleged observation that minority communities were cornering undue benefits using their newly acquired wealth power and high level connections, both being the consequences of emigration. This study has shown that minority communities have undoubtedly benefited much more than the majority community have, from emigration. Justified or not, such expression of resentment against the "new rich" of the minority communities by the "old rich" is another of the adverse effects of emigration. * * * * * * Five years ago we thought that Kerala's Gulf connection was a passing phase in its history. Today we think otherwise. Not only has Gulf emigration become well entrenched, some of the second-generation emigrants are settling in the host country on a permanent basis too*, and others are spreading their wings to a much wider spectrum of countries. Migration is here to stay {{for a long time to}} come. The process of <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction</b> at work in Kerala would be the only major obstacle for Kerala emigration to take off to higher orbits. It is important that Kerala takes policy measures to see that emigration is kept at a sustainable level, and too much of its brain power is not drained off to other countries, and too much of its remittances are not drained off to other states. A policy for moderating brain drain and better and more productive utilization of remittances for Kerala's development is essential. One way to do this is through educational reforms, taking into consideration the emerging remittances-induced job opportunities in the state. Not that emigration and remittances are not creating new job opportunities; there exists, however, considerable mismatch between skill requirements for these jobs and skill availability among the new crop of SSLC holders and plus two graduates. Ways and means should be found to bridge this gap. At this stage of Kerala's Gulf connection, there is every justification for exposing our youngsters more to the Gulf countries. There is every justification for introducing Gulf studies in our schools and colleges. Today we can make out a strong case for our students to learn much more about Gulf geography, Gulf history, Gulf politics and Gulf language. Taking into consideration the emerging wide-spread impact of replacement migration on Kerala's employment sector, especially on unemployment and wage rates, we urge that a high level research on the magnitude and characteristics of replacement migration in the state be undertaken on an urgent basis. This has to be a major project in view of its importance and technical requirements. In the KMS, we suggested that, migration has become so important a development factor that, Kerala should develop a formal migrationmonitoring system. We now argue that Kerala should have an institute of its own to monitor migration and its impact on Kerala society, a Migration Monitoring Institute. How important that migration is carefully monitored and researched in Kerala? To realize the importance, compare the magnitude of remittances in 2003 with the total Kerala Government expenditure in 2003.

40|$|This Working Paper {{embodies the}} results of the Kerala Migration Survey (KMS) 2011. It is the fifth in the series of {{comprehensive}} studies on international and internal migration from Kerala being undertaken by the Centre for Development Studies since 1998. Over the years, some broad patters on migration have emerged from these studies. Some of these are enumerated in this abstract. Migration Trends The number of Kerala emigrants (EMI) living abroad in 2011 is estimated to be 2. 28 million, up from 2. 19 million in 2008, 1. 84 million in 2003 and 1. 36 million in 1998. The increase during inter-survey periods shows a decreasing trend. The increase could vanish much before 2015 and the migration trend could very well slope downward. The number of Kerala emigrants who returned and living in Kerala (REM) in 2011 is estimated to be 1. 15 million. There was a small {{decrease in the number of}} return emigrants during 2008 - 11. It was 1. 16 million in 2008. Kerala migrants living in other states in India (OMI) in 2011 is estimated to be 931, 000, up from 914, 000 in 2008. The increase was not very substantial, less than 2 percent. Kerala out-migrants who returned and are now living in Kerala (return out-migrants) are estimated to be 511, 000 in 2011. The corresponding number was 686, 000 in 2008, 994, 000 in 2003 and 959, 000 in 1998. There was a consistent decline in the number of return out-migrants. More and more Kerala migrants in the other states in India tend to stay back in their host state or move abroad instead of returning to their native state. Geographic Aspects of Migration: Northward Shift If demography is destiny, as is often claimed by demographers, Kerala’s destiny is moving northwards. Several relevant elements of Kerala’s demography have shown a steady northward shift. Over the years, the centre of population has moved northward. In recent years, population growth has become much higher in the state’s north than in its southern region. The origin of emigration from Kerala is moving to its north. More and more remittances are ending up in the north. In recent years more of the developments in education and health have taken place in the north than in the south. In 1998, only 33. 4 percent of Kerala’s population with secondary or higher levels of education lived in the north (Malappuram to Kasaragod) and the remaining 66. 6 percent lived in the south and central regions of the state. By 2011, the corresponding proportions were 39. 0 in the north and 61. 0 in the other regions. The proportion in the north has increased by 5. 6 percentage points, whereas the proportion in the south and central regions decreased by the same percentage. Similarly, in 1998, the north accounted for only 33. 4 percent of employed persons, but by 2011, the corresponding proportion increased to 39. 0 percent. In 1998, only 15. 6 percent of population in the north was employed in the private sector of the economy, but by 2011, as much as 32. 4 percent of the north’s population was employed in the private sector. The corresponding percentages in the self-employment sector were 32. 8 per cent in 1998 and 36. 0 percent in 2011. Religious Aspects Emigration from Kerala is dominated by Muslims whose share of the emigrants from the state (44. 3 percent) continued to remain very much higher than their share in the population (26. 5 percent). On the other handout-migrants from the state are mostly Hindus, whose share of out-migrants (64. 6 percent) continued to remain very much higher than their share in the population (56. 8 percent). Corresponding to 100 households, there are 59. 1 emigrants in Muslim households, but only 18. 1 emigrants in Hindu households and 29. 0 emigrants in Christian households. Among the Muslims, 53. 3 percent of the households had at least one emigrant or return emigrant. However, among the Hindu households, only 19. 6 percent of the households had a non-resident Keralite. The Christians are not far from the Hindus in this matter. Among them only 21. 3 percent had one or more non-resident Keralites. Remittances Remittances from emigrants abroad to Kerala in 2011 were estimated to be approximately Rs 49, 695 crores compared with Rs. 43, 288 crores in 2008. Remittances were Rs. 63, 315 per household in 2011 compared with Rs. 57, 227 in 2008. Increase in remittances during 2008 - 11 (15 percent) was much larger than increase in the number of emigrants (4 percent). Muslim households received Rs. 23, 089 crores as remittances from abroad in 2011. This amounts to 46. 5 percent of the total remittances. Hindus received Rs 18, 089 crores or 36. 4 percent of the total. The Christian community received Rs. 8, 508 crores or 17. 1 percent. Although the total remittances to the state are relatively very large, only a small fraction (17. 1 percent) of the households in Kerala received them; more than 80 percent of the Kerala households did not receive any remittances in 2011. There are, however, large differentials by religion. The corresponding proportion was as low as 11. 4 percent among the Hindus, 14. 4 percent among the Christians but as high as 36. 6 percent among the Muslim households. Impact of Migration The macro-economic impact of emigration and remittances are very significant. Emigration and the ensuing remittances continue to remain the single most dynamic factor in Kerala’s economic scenario. Remittances were 31 percent of the state’s domestic product. The per capita income in the state is Rs 52, 000 without taking into consideration remittances, but would be Rs 68, 000 if remittances were taken in to consideration. The economic benefits that the state receives from these annual remittances are huge, but they have to be balanced with the losses in the matter of human resources. At present, there is acute scarcity of qualified workers in every field in the state. More than 30 percent of persons with higher educational qualifications are now living abroad. More than 25 to 30 of percent of workers in high skill occupations are now living outside the state. The negative impact of this drain on Kerala’s economy is yet to be fully quantified in financial terms. Equally pertinent is the drain of funds that go into educating Kerala’s youth outside the state. This amount was roughly about Rs 1703 crores in 2011, or 3. 4 percent of the annual remittances to the state. Migration is also having a negative impact on income distribution in the state. As the early emigrants from the state were mostly construction workers, there was a general feeling that emigration contributed to income equality. However, a more recent comparison of the employment and educational characteristics of the emigrants with those of the non-migrants show that this may not be true any longer. In recent years, the relatively better-off persons emigrate and improves their income level and consequently emigration contributes inequality. More direct information on the relation between emigration and income is provided by the data on the possession of red and blue ration cards by Kerala households and also by the data on enrolment in RSBY. These data show that emigrants come from the relatively richer households, and that emigration would have contributed to increased inequality in Kerala society. Migration Prospects Trends emerging from these studies, some directly related to emigration and others related to determinants of emigration, support the conclusion that emigration from Kerala seems to be approaching an inflexion point in history. Kerala’s Gulf connection is edging towards a turning point. Emigration from Kerala in 2011 is more or less at the same level it was in 2008, indicating that 2011 is not far from the inflexion point in the history of emigration from Kerala. Many of the major centres of emigration in Kerala are already experiencing a decline in the number of emigrants and/or emigrants per household. The experience of Pathanamthitta district could be seen as forerunner of things to come in Kerala. In Pathanamthitta district, the number of emigrants was 98, 000 in 1998, 134, 000 in 2003, and 121, 000 in 2008 but only 91, 000 in 2011 – lower than the number in 1998. Emigrants per household was 33. 1 in 1998, 44. 3 per cent in 2003 and 37. 4 percent in 2008 but only 28. 4 percent in 2011. The point of inflexion in emigration trend in Pathanamthitta district was as early as 2003. Supporting evidence is provided by the trends in the factors related to migration – <b>demographic</b> <b>contraction</b> of young working age population in Kerala, dwindling wage differentials between Kerala and the Gulf region, competition from other Indian states in India and other countries abroad, and above all, the rapidly increasing cost of emigration. All these trends point towards emergence of an era of decreasing trend in emigration from Kerala. Kerala’s Gulf connection could reach its inflexion point in a matter of 4 - 5 years...|$|E
