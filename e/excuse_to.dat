5|$|The new {{legislation}} was {{guaranteed by the}} Russian Empire, giving it another <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> interfere in the Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed. Russia was the party most determined to form the Permanent Council, which it saw as further means to control the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|During the 1830s, the Mexican {{government}} wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As {{the pendulum}} swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted. In June, {{a small group}} of settlers in Texas used the political unrest as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> rebel against customs duties, in an incident known as the Anahuac Disturbances. The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.|$|E
5|$|In {{a dispute}} {{over the use of}} the forces {{defending}} the Harpers Ferry garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and Abraham Lincoln and General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck, who were looking for an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> get rid of him, immediately accepted. They replaced Hooker early on the morning of June 28 with Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, then commander of the V Corps.|$|E

50|$|The song's narrator {{has just}} been left by his girlfriend. He {{searches}} the house to dig up poor <b>excuses</b> <b>to</b> call like a stack of mail, toothpaste, and empty CD cases. In the second verse {{he is on the}} phone having tracked her down in a bar. The contrast between his sitting home finding <b>excuses</b> <b>to</b> call and her laughing in a bar exemplifies his longing and desperation.|$|R
5|$|Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set {{its first}} {{production}} shipment {{for the games}} in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> limit shipment and keep the demand high.|$|E
5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E

5|$|In 1017, Maymandi and Mahmud {{agreed to}} invade Khwarazm, then under native Iranian Ma'munid dynasty. According to Ghaznavid sources, {{the reason for}} Mahmud's {{invasion}} of the region was to avenge {{the murder of his}} brother-in-law Ma'mun II, but according to modern sources he used the latter's death as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> expand Ghaznavid rule over the Oxus River. In the same year, the Ghaznavid army deposed the Ma'munid ruler Abu'l-Harith Muhammad, and Altun Tash was appointed as the governor of the region.|$|E
5|$|In Asgard, Loki betrays {{and kills}} Laufey, {{revealing}} his true {{plan to use}} Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created {{in the wake of}} the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E

5|$|Itachi debuts in Part I after Hiruzen's death, when he {{uses his}} {{infiltration}} of Konoha to hunt down Naruto Uzumaki as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> secretly check on Sasuke's wellbeing. After engaging with Kakashi and some of Konoha's forces, he reveals Akatsuki's goal to gather the Jinchuriki of the nine tailed beasts. Itachi also learns that Naruto is {{under the protection of}} Jiraiya and sets up a trap to lure the experienced ninja away to grab the boy. However, as Jiraiya comes to Naruto's aid, Itachi finds himself facing Sasuke and directs his brother back on the path of getting stronger by defeating him before he and Kisame fall back.|$|E
5|$|Moondram Pirai {{depicts a}} young woman whose mental state regresses {{to that of a}} child {{following}} an accident. Sexuality and the repression of desire are dominant motifs, similar to Balu Mahendra's previous film Moodu Pani (1980). The film also explores the possibility of unresolved sexual tension between the protagonists. Critic K. Jeshi compares Moondram Pirai to other films based on physical and mental disabilities like Sethu... (1999), Pithamagan (2003), Perazhagan (2004), Chandramukhi (2005), Anniyan (2005) and Ghajini (2005). When asked about the reason amnesia was chosen for a disability, Mahendra said the disorder is used as a camouflage and as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> portray relationships in the film.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, the Soviets staged the {{shelling}} of Mainila, {{an incident in}} which Soviet artillery shelled area near the Russian village of Mainila and then announced that a Finnish artillery attack had killed Soviet soldiers. The Soviet Union demanded that the Finns apologize for the incident and move their forces 20–25 kilometres from the border. The Finns denied any responsibility for the attack and rejected the demands, calling for a joint Finnish-Soviet commission to examine the incident. The Soviet Union claimed that the Finnish response was hostile, and used it as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from the non-aggression pact.|$|E

5|$|On 3 June 1944, Braun's sister Gretl Braun married SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein, {{who served}} as Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's liaison officer on Hitler's staff. Hitler used the {{marriage}} as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> allow Braun to appear at official functions, as she could then be introduced as Fegelein's sister-in-law. When Fegelein {{was caught in the}} closing days of the war trying to escape to Sweden or Switzerland, Hitler ordered his execution. He was shot for desertion in the garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|The 1881 {{world tour}} of King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii was {{his attempt to}} save the Hawaiian culture and {{population}} from extinction through the importation of a labor force from Asia-Pacific nations. His efforts brought the small island nation {{to the attention of}} world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaii there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> see the world. The 281-day trip gave him the distinction of being the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe, just as his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a state dinner at the White House.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, {{who did not know}} that the countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.|$|E

5|$|The {{pursuing}} crowd arrives, {{but they}} are soon turned around {{on the subject of}} Whacking Day by Bart's newfound knowledge. It turns out that the day was actually invented in 1924 as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> beat up the Irish. Principal Skinner is impressed with Bart's efforts and welcomes him back to the school, but then realizes in horror that the bullies are still in the utility basement. While the bullies are spending the time talking about their feelings, Principal Skinner and Willie race to the school with the mountain bikes to avoid a potential lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The two-year truce was now {{close to}} expiry and the Lombards asked the Byzantines {{to respect the}} {{alliance}} which had been established between them. The Emperor found an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> break the new alliance with the Gepids by claiming they had again ferried Slav raiders. He put together an army with renowned commanders in its ranks such as Germanus' sons Justin and Justinian, Aratius, the Herulian Suartuas, and Amalafrid, brother-in-law of Audoin. A revolt that erupted in Ulpiana diverted {{the bulk of the}} army; only a force under Amalafrid reached the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a common}} belief among the Poles that most Jews were Bolsheviks and Communists, in league with the enemy of the Polish state, Soviet Russia. The Polish army stated that any Jews it killed were militants and {{collaborators}} engaged in actions against the Polish army. Having been fired at from Jewish homes, Polish soldiers took this as an <b>excuse</b> <b>to</b> break into many Jewish homes and stores, beating the Jews and robbing them, desecrating synagogues, arresting hundreds, depriving them of food and drink for days and deporting them from the city; such abuses were, however, not supported by – and even specifically forbidden by – the Polish high command.|$|E
50|$|This pig has {{outstanding}} performances regarding laziness. He seemingly never {{cares about}} their troubles and works, and always finds <b>excuses</b> <b>to</b> procrastinate their expedition. Every time {{four of them}} arrive another country the local people always ardently welcome them with bumper food and accommodation because {{they come from the}} Great Tang Empire, which was both culturally and economically influential to all the surrounding areas at that time. Zhu Bajie hence tends <b>to</b> find <b>excuses</b> <b>to</b> persuade his master to stay several more days for better abodes and food due to his greediness.|$|R
