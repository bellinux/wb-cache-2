5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfish</b> were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> are {{distributed}} across {{all but the}} Indian and Antarctic continents with centers of diversity in the southeastern Appalachian Mountains in the Northern Hemisphere and in south– east Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. There are currently over 640 described species of <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> {{with an average of}} 5 – 10 species still being described each year. <b>Freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> can serve as keystone species in aquatic habitats, but a few species are also significantly invasive and can cause impressive damage to the fragile <b>freshwater</b> habitat. <b>Crayfishes</b> inhabit caves, burrows, streams, lakes and strong burrowers can even be found in terrestrial habitats where they have burrowed to the water table or where rainfall is sufficiently abundant to provide the needed moisture. The <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes,</b> like the habitats in which they are encountered, are generally endangered to some degree and conservation efforts would do well to focus on them as key elements of the freshwater ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{rate at which}} complete mitogenomes are being sequenced and their increasing use for phylogenetic studies {{have resulted in a}} bioinformatic bottleneck in preparing and utilising such data for phylogenetic analysis. Hence, we present MitoPhAST, an automated tool that (1) identifies annotated protein-coding gene features and generates a standardised, concatenated and partitioned amino acid alignment directly from complete/partial GenBank/EMBL-format mitogenome flat files, (2) generates a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using optimised protein models and (3) reports various mitochondrial genes and sequence information in a table format. To demonstrate the capacity of MitoPhAST in handling a large dataset, we used 81 publicly available decapod mitogenomes, together with eight new complete mitogenomes of Australian <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes,</b> including the first for the genus Gramastacus, to undertake an updated test of the monophyly of the major groups of the order Decapoda and their phylogenetic relationships. The recovered phylogenetic trees using both Bayesian and ML methods support the results of studies using fragments of mtDNA and nuclear markers and other smaller-scale studies using whole mitogenomes. In comparison to the fragment-based phylogenies, nodal support values are generally higher despite reduced taxon sampling suggesting there is value in utilising more fully mitogenomic data. Additionally, the simple table output from MitoPhAST provides an efficient summary and statistical overview of the mitogenomes under study at the gene level, allowing the identification of missing or duplicated genes and gene rearrangements. The finding of new mtDNA gene rearrangements in several genera of Australian <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> indicates that this group has undergone an unusually high rate of evolutionary change for this organelle compared to other major families of decapod crustaceans. As a result, <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> are likely to be a useful model for studies designed to understand the evolution of mtDNA rearrangements. We anticipate that our bioinformatics pipeline will substantially help mitogenome-based studies increase the speed, accuracy and efficiency of phylogenetic studies utilising mitogenome information.

Species from the genus Engaeus, commonly known as the land crayfish, are also found in Australia. Engaeus species are not entirely aquatic, because they spend most of their lives living in burrows. Australia has seven species of freshwater crab from the genus Austrothelphusa. These crabs live burrowed into the banks of waterways and can plug their burrows, surviving through several years of drought.

40|$|The <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> are a {{group of}} decapod {{crustaceans}} that have {{played a critical role}} in a diversity of biological studies, from physiology, to ecology, neurobiology, conservation, and evolution. Central to many of these fields of study is the dependence on a robust taxonomic framework for accurate communication relating to species diversity and associated attributes. Despite a huge body of taxonomic work since Linnaeus, there has never been a single, comprehensive taxonomic summary of all the species of crayfish of the world. There has also been an abundance of recent taxonomic work in terms of new species descriptions and taxonomic insights gained from a variety of phylogenetic studies. Here we gather diverse taxonomic and phylogenetic information into a single resource. We develop an updated classification system that includes all the crayfishes worldwide and taxonomic changes to better reflect the current phylogenetic knowledge of the group. We also include all the fossil crayfish taxa for a complete classification of extant and extinct crayfishes. Our classification results in two superfamilies (Astacoidea and Parastacoidea), five families, 38 genera, and 669 species (692 including distinct subspecies). We provide a checklist of all species and include validated taxonomic authorities, type localities, figure references, and synonyms. We also provide arguments for our revised classification. The updated and complete classification aims to provide a robust framework for future studies of the <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> of the world...|$|R

25|$|These {{remaining}} {{canals and}} their ecosystem was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, {{with the purpose}} of saving them. An important part of this ecosystem is a juniper tree called a “ahuejote” that is native to the shallow waters of the lake/canals. These stem erosion, act as wind breakers and favor the reproduction of a variety of aquatic species. Some of these endemic species include a <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfish</b> called an acocil, and the Montezuma frog. However, the most representative animal from these waters is the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). This amphibian was used as a medicine, food and ceremonial object during the Aztec empire. It was considered to be an incarnation of the god Xolotl, brother of Quetzalcoatl. It has been studied due to its abilities to regenerate limbs and other body parts. It can also reach sexual maturity as a larva, which no other amphibian can do. While mostly aquatic, it does have limited ability to breathe air. As of 2003, there were only 600 axolotls known to exist in the wild. Most of the threat to the species is loss of habitat and pollution, but the introduction of non-native fish such as tilapia has also had disastrous effects on the population of this and other species. Conservation efforts include research and environmental education. The Grupo de Investigación del Ajolote en Xochimilco (GIA-X) is a nonprofit research group dedicated to the preservation of the axolotl, which is in danger of extinction. It works to better understand the creature {{as well as with the}} local community to protect what is left of its habitat. In addition to species that live in the area year round, the wetlands here host about forty percent of the migratory bird species that arrive to Mexico, roughly 350, use the wet areas around Xochimilco for nesting. Many of these come from the United States and Canada. However, much of this habitat has been urbanized. About 700 species have been found in the area overall. Some of the migratory species include pelicans, storks, buzzards and falcons.|$|E

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology and}} life {{history of the}} Tasmanian <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes</b> in the endemic genera Astacopsis and Parastacoides were studied {{in the field and}} laboratory from April 1985 to May 1987. A. gouldi and A. franklinii are open water species associated with riverine and lacustrine habitats from highlands to coastal plains. The burrowing, semiterrestrial P. tasmanicus occurs in wet heathlands, water courses and highland lakes in the wetter cooler, western half of the state. The three species were studied in representative, relatively undisturbed habitats. The habitats of all three species were typified by low water temperatures, high rainfall and fluctuating water levels. Reproductive morphology and anatomy of Astacopsis and Parastacoides was described in detail. Male and female gonads differ from those of northern hemisphere crayfishes, resembling anatomically the gonads of the Palinuridae. The male gonopores show considerable complexity and variation among genera. Female genitalia undergo significant changes in morphology at the onset of sexual maturity. Sexual dimorphism is developed to a greater degree in Astacopsis than in Parastacoides. Secondary sexual characters are more numerous in females of both genera and perform important functions in spawning and incubation of eggs. Data on seasonal reproduction, growth, population structure and density were obtained from regular sampling and mark recapture programs. Size at maturity and reproductive condition were determined by changes in reproductive morphology and gonad condition. In both genera males reach sexual maturity at a smaller size than females. Females, upon reaching maturity, exhibit a biennial breeding and molting cycle which is a unique strategy, apparently a result of the cooler climate conditions in Tasmania. In Astacopsis, mating and spawning take place in autumn, eggs are carried over winter, hatch mid to late the following summer and young remain attached until late summer to early autumn. Parastacoides mates and spawns in autumn, eggs are carried over winter, hatch early the following summer and postlarvae remain attached until mid summer. The larval development and morphology of Astacopsis and Parastacoides was described. Marked differences between the two genera were found and the "primitive" larval development of Astacopsis differed significantly from that described for other <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes.</b> Growth rates, although faster in juveniles, are relatively slow in adults of both genera. In reproductive adults of both sexes, molting frequency is low (apparently biennial). This results in maturity being reached late and at a relatively large size as well as in overall longer life spans as compared to most other <b>freshwater</b> <b>crayfishes...</b>|$|R

Fishes of the Margaret River have previously been examined by Morgan et al. (1998) and Morgan & Beatty (2003) with the monitoring of the functioning of the two fishways on the river documented in Morgan & Beatty (2004, 2007) and Beatty & Morgan (2008).
