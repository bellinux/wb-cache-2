40|$|Apparatus is {{provided}} which controls humidity in a gas. The apparatus employs a porous interface that is preferably a manifolded array {{of stainless steel}} tubes through whose porous surface water vapor can pass. One side of the porous interface is in contact with water and the opposing side is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>gas</b> whose humidity is being controlled. Water vapor is emitted from the porous surface of the tubing into the gas when the gas is being humidified, and water vapor {{is removed from the}} gas through the porous surfaces when the gas is being dehumidified. The temperature of the porous interface relative to the gas temperature determines whether humidification or dehumidification is being carried out. The humidity in the gas is sensed and compared to the set point humidity. The water temperature, and consequently the porous interface temperature, are automatically controlled in response to changes in the gas humidity level above or below the set point. Any deviation from the set point humidity is thus corrected...|$|E
40|$|The optimal {{configuration}} of the expansion process of a heated ideal gas inside a cylinder for maximum work output with a movable piston and time-dependent heat conductance is determined in this paper. The heat conductance of cylinder walls is not a constant, but depends on the time-dependent heat transfer surface area of the walls <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>gas.</b> Euler-Lagrange formalism is applied to obtain the optimal process that maximizes the work output of the working fluid with fixed initial energy, initial volume, final volume and total time allowed for the expansion.

Numerical examples for the optimal configurations with time-dependent heat conductance are provided, and the obtained results are compared with those obtained with constant heat conductance.

40|$|A Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) {{system is}} {{employed}} {{to measure the}} two-phase mist flow behavior including flow velocity field, droplet size distribution, droplet dynamics, and turbulence characteristics. Based on the droplet measurements made through PDPA, a projected profile describing how the air-mist coolant jet flow spreads and eventually blends into the hot main flow is proposed. This proposed profile {{is found to be}} well supported by the measurement results of the turbulent Reynolds stresses. The coolant film envelope is identified with shear layers characterized by higher magnitudes of turbulent Reynolds stresses. In addition, the separation between the mist droplet layer and the coolant air film is identified through the droplet measurements—large droplets penetrate through the air coolant film layer and travel further into the main flow. With the proposed air-mist film profile, the heat transfer results on the wall presented in Part 1 are re-examined and more in-depth physics is revealed. It is found that the location of optimum cooling effectiveness is coincided with the point where the air-mist coolant stream starts to bend back towards the surface. Thus, the data suggests that the “bending back” film pattern is critical in keeping the mist droplets close to the surface, which improves the cooling effectiveness for mist cooling.

40|$|The {{release of}} {{chlorine}} (Cl) and sulfur (S) during biomass torrefaction and pyrolysis {{has been investigated}} via experiments in two laboratory-scale reactors: a rotating reactor and a fixed bed reactor. Six biomasses with different chemical compositions covering {{a wide range of}} ash content and ash-forming elements were torrefied/pyrolyzed in the temperature range of 150 – 500 °C. The relative release of chlorine and sulfur was calculated based on mass balance and analysis of the biomass before and after torrefaction. In selected cases, measurement of methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl) in the gas from straw torrefaction has furthermore been conducted. The release of chlorine from straw was first observed at 250 °C and peaked with about 60 - 70 % at 350 °C. Analysis of the released gas showed that most of the chlorine was released as methyl chloride. Increasing the straw content in the reactor resulted in a lower fractional release of Cl, probably due to more reactive sites is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>gas</b> phase Cl species leading to secondary binding of Cl to the solid product. Almost complete release of chlorine was observed for woody biomass at 350 °C.

A significant sulfur release (about 60 %) was observed from the six biomasses investigated at 350 °C. The initial sulfur content in the biomass did not influence the fraction of sulfur release during torrefaction...|$|E
40|$|Local {{measurements}} are of primary {{importance for the}} characterization of gas-liquid two-phase flows, both for processes control and numerical modeling validation. It is a very active research field due to {{the increasing number of}} applications in the thermohydraulics of heat exchangers, nuclear plants, chemical processes and oil industries. This paper presents the local measurements in a vertical upward air-water flow using the electrical resistivity double probe technique. The test section was a 80 mm i. d. and 160 cm long Plexiglas pipe. Five different gas superficial velocities, ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 10 m/s, were used in combination with two liquid superficial velocities of 0 and 0. 10 m/s. A resistivity double probe was employed for measurements of the radial profiles of void fraction, bubble frequency, bubble interface velocity, interfacial area concentration and Sauter mean diameter. The electrical resistivity probe method consists of a instantaneous measurement of the local electrical resistivity in the two-phase flow by means of a sensor electrode. Since the circuit is opened or closed depending on whether the sensor tip is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>gas</b> or liquid, the probe behaves in principle like a switch, yielding a two-stage signal. However, to obtain a true square wave type signals, a proper threshold voltage has {{to be used as a}} triggering criterion. Herein the signal conditioning is discussed and the influence of the threshold level is analyzed. With a probe with two sensors displaced axially, the bubble interface velocity could be determined from the time delay which gave maximum correlation between the sensor responses. These values of gas velocity in conjunction with void fractions could be integrated to give average gas superficial velocities. Values determined in this manner were compared to values from the inlet gas flowrate measurements and showed an average deviation of less than 6 % for bubbly flow...|$|E
40|$|Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) {{are widely}} used as {{hydraulic}} barriers because of their low saturated hydraulic conductivity and sealing capacity. However, with increasing interest in their use {{as a component of}} cover systems for landfills as well as in mining applications, the capability of GCLs to minimise gas emissions, when under an unsaturated condition, are of some concern. This research work has been undertaken to enhance general understanding of the unsaturated behaviour of GCLs and specifically, the effectiveness of unsaturated GCLs to minimise gas migration. In this investigation, the hydration (adsorption and desorption) state of bentonite in GCLs was controlled by vapour phase contact with solutions held at various relative humidity (RH) states under stress and no stress conditions. Gas permeability tests were conducted on three GCLs while monitoring gravimetric water content and total suction under different hydration conditions. A gas flow unified measurement system (UMS-G) for sequential measurement of gas diffusion and gas permeability of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) was developed and validated both experimentally and numerically. A series of gas diffusion and gas permeability tests were performed sequentially on two partially hydrated GCLs using UMS-G under a range of gravimetric water contents and hydration conditions. An experimental column study was conducted to understand the hydration (due to infiltration of rainfall water), dehydration (caused by solar radiation or heat) and gas flow through a defected geomembrane (GMB) /GCL composite liner where the GMB contains a defect. Results indicated that RH, applied stress, GCL bentonite form (powdered or granular) and the mineralogy of the bentonite component of the GCL, all play key roles in the hydration/dehydration behaviour with time when GCL specimens were in equilibrium with water vapour. The gas permeability was strongly influenced by gravimetric water content, total suction and applied stress. The UMS-G measured GCL gas diffusivity and gas permeability decreased with the increase of water content and applied stress. The differences in the form of bentonite and GCL structures (scrim reinforced vs non-scrim reinforced) had significant effects on the variation of gas diffusivity and permeability. The hydration behaviour of GCL underlying a defective GMB in a model composite liner was largely influenced by the bentonite form of the GCL, applied rainfall amount and rainfall events. Gas diffusion and gas permeability of GCL part of the composite liner and gas leakage rate of defective GMB/GCL composite liner were influenced by average GCL gravimetric water content and average GCL wet surface area. Uniformly hydrated GCL tended to give lower gas diffusion and permeability than non-uniformly hydrated GCL. Gas diffusion coefficient and gas permeability of GCLs were also influenced by wetting and drying cycle due to the formation of cracks in dehydrated bentonite. The results highlighted that the adjacent layers of GCL in cover system should have sufficiently high gravimetric water content to hydrate the total surface area and thickness of GCL uniformly before coming <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>gas.</b> It also should be ensured that there is enough cover above the GCL to prevent it from subsequent drying. The results presented here can be useful for design engineers and regulatory agencies to improve the design of landfill and mine tailing cover system...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{sensor control}} is {{potentially}} {{one of the}} most important techniques of tomorrow for the environment. All over the world cars are preferred for transportation, and accordingly the number of cars increases, unfortunately, together with pollutants. Boilers and powerplants are other sources of pollutants to the environment. Metal-Insulator-Silicon Carbide (MISiC) Field-effect sensors in car applications and boilers have the potential to reduce the amount of pollutants. These devices are sensitive to several gases in exhaust and flues gases, such as hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and ammonia (for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) application). These applications require specific and long term stable sensors. The car industry for instance wants sensors that will stand at least 240 000 km. This thesis presents studies of the active layers in MIS Fieldeffect gas sensors. Fundamental studies of the sensor mechanism has been performed in ultra high vacuum, UHV, to understand the gas response mechanism in more detail, and to find out how the sensing mechanism is affected by the catalytic active gate material. The influence of four different insulating layers was studied at atmospheric pressure. The catalytic layer has also been altered to metal oxide nanoparticles with or without impregnation of catalytic metals. Nanoparticles are potential candidates to be used as the gate material for high temperature, long-term stable FET sensor devices. The combination of catalytic metals and metal oxides may prevent reconstruction of the metal. The use of nanoparticles will increase the number of triple points (catalytic material and insulator <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>gas),</b> which are crucial e. g. for the ammonia sensitivity. Another challenging aspect of nanoparticles is the possibility to get selectivity to different gases based on the particle size. The goal is to find new sensitive, selective and more long term stable materials, which meet the requirements above. From the UHV studies we learned that the two catalytic active metals Pt and Pd, do behave in a similar way, although there are some quantitative differences. Values for the heat of adsorption on both the Pd and Pt surfaces are estimated as well as the dipole moments for the adsorbates on the insulator surface. The insulators play an important role in the sensing mechanism, since the adsorption of hydrogen atoms (or protons) that are detected by the sensor occur on the insulator surface. By changing the insulator material the saturation response of the sensors is affected. It was shown that Al 2 O 3 gave a higher saturated response to hydrogen in Pt-MIS capacitors at 140 °C as compared to Ta 2 O 5, SiO 2, and Si 3 N 4. We have tested wet synthesized ruthenium dioxide and ruthenium nanoparticles, which are electrically conducting and catalytically active sensing material. RuO 2 is especially interesting as a high temperature material since it is already oxidized. Both materials show a sensitivity pattern comparable to porous platinum. The temperature dependence of the gas response indicates a higher catalytic activity of the RuO 2 as compared to Ru nanoparticles. Nanoparticles synthesized by aerosol technology provide several advantages like a good adhesion of the particles to the substrate, many possible material combinations and efficient methods for particle separation according to size. The methods to use this technology for sensing materials in MISiC sensors are now under development and some preliminary results are obtained.
