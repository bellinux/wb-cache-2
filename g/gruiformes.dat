25|$|The endemic kagu, agile {{and able}} to run quickly, is a flightless bird, but {{it is able to}} use its wings to climb {{branches}} or glide. It is the surviving member of monotypic family Rhynochetidae, order <b>Gruiformes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The limpkin {{is placed}} in its own {{monotypic}} family, Aramidae, which is in turn placed within the crane and rail order <b>Gruiformes.</b> It had been suggested that the limpkin {{was close to the}} ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae, based upon shared bird lice. The Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based upon DNA–DNA hybridization, suggested that the limpkin's closest relatives were the Heliornithidae finfoots, and Sibley and Monroe even placed the species in that family in 1990. More recent studies have found little support for this relationship. More recent DNA studies have confirmed a close relationship with particularly the cranes, with the limpkin remaining as a family close to the cranes and the two being sister taxa to the trumpeters.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of the Inaccessible Island rail in the larger rail family (Rallidae) {{has been a source}} of uncertainty. Lowe thought that its closest relatives may have been black crake of Africa, or perhaps an early offshoot of the genus Porphyrio (swamphens), a conclusion based mostly on similarities of plumage. He did concede that it was difficult to assign the rail to any relatives. American paleontologist Storrs Olson suggested [...] in 1973 that it was related to the [...] "Rallus assemblage", which included the genera Rallus and Hypotaenidia (now lumped with Gallirallus), based on the structure of the skeleton. In particular he suggested it was part of a pro-Rallus group that included the Indian Ocean genus Dryolimnas, and the Australasian Lewinia. Olson suggested the pro-Rallus rails have a relict distribution and would have been present in Africa and South America, from where the ancestors of the Inaccessible Island rail came from. The most recent study to include the genus, in 1998, compared the morphology of the rails and other <b>Gruiformes</b> and placed it in the crake clade, subtribe Crecina. Its exact position was uncertain but it appears to be basal within that clade, and perhaps the sister taxon to the genus Laterallus, a genus of small crakes found mostly in South America.|$|E
40|$|Avian haemophili demonstrating {{in vitro}} satellitic growth, also {{referred}} to as the V-factor or NAD requirement, have mainly been classified with Avibacterium paragallinarum (Haemophilus paragallinarum), Avibacterium avium (Pasteurella avium), Avibacterium volantium (Pasteurella volantium) and Avibacterium sp. A (Pasteurella species A). The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the taxonomic position of 18 V-factor-requiring isolates of unclassified Haemophilus-like organisms isolated from galliforme, anseriforme, columbiforme and <b>gruiforme</b> birds as well as kestrels and psittacine birds including budgerigars by conventional phenotypic tests and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. All isolates shared phenotypical characteristics which allowed classification with Pasteurellaceae. Haemolysis of bovine red blood cells was negative. Haemin (X-factor) was not required for growth. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis including bootstrap analysis showed that six isolates were related to the avian 16 S rRNA group and were classified as Avibacterium according to 16 S rRNA sequence analysis. Surprisingly, the other 12 isolates were unrelated to Avibacterium. Two isolates were unrelated to any of the known 16 S rRNA groups of Pasteurellaceae. Two isolates were related to Volucribacter of the avian 16 S rRNA group. Seven isolates belonged to the Testudinis 16 S rRNA group and out of these, two isolates were closely related to taxa 14 and 32 of Bisgaard, whereas four other isolates were found to form a genus-like group distantly related to taxon 40 and one isolated remained distantly related to other members of the Testudinis group. One isolate was closely related to taxon 26 (a member of Actinobacillus sensu stricto). The study documented major genetic diversity among V-factor-requiring avian isolates beyond the traditional interpretation that they only belong to Avibacterium, underlining the limited value of satellitic growth for identification of avian members of Pasteurellaceae. Our study also emphasized that these organisms will never be isolated without the use of special media satisfying the V-factor requirement...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as <b>Gruiformes.</b> Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true <b>Gruiformes.</b> The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (Rhynochetidae) and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages.

Burhinus are best placed in Charadriiformes. They resemble bustards (family: Otididae) and have been previously classified with them in <b>Gruiformes.</b> Their placement in <b>Gruiformes</b> is considered convergent evolution, as both orders have the same lifestyle and biotopes.

5000|$|Traditionally, {{a number}} of wading and {{terrestrial}} bird families that {{did not seem to}} belong to any other order were classified together as <b>Gruiformes.</b> These include 14 species of large cranes, about 145 species of smaller crakes and rails, as well as a variety of families comprising one to three species, such as the Heliornithidae, the limpkin, or the trumpeters.Other birds have been placed in this order more out of necessity to place them somewhere; this has caused the expanded <b>Gruiformes</b> to lack distinctive apomorphies.

50|$|The {{traditional}} order <b>Gruiformes</b> {{was established}} by the influential German avian comparative anatomist Max Fürbringer (1888). Over the decades, many ornithologists suggested {{that members of the}} order were in fact more closely related to other groups (reviewed by Olson 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). For example, it was thought that sunbittern might be related to herons and that seriemas might be related to cuckoos. Olson and Steadman (1981) were first to correctly disband any of the traditional <b>Gruiformes.</b> They recognized that the Australian plains-wanderer (family Pedionomidae) was actually a member of the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) based on skeletal characters. This was confirmed by Sibley and Ahlquist (1990) based on DNA-DNA hybridization and subsequently by Paton et al. (2003), Paton and Baker (2006) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006). Sibley and Ahlquist furthermore removed button-quails (Turnicidae) from the Gruifomes based on large DNA-DNA hybridization distances to other supposed <b>Gruiformes.</b> However, {{it was not until the}} work of Paton et al. (2004) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006) that the correct placement of buttonquails within the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) was documented on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of multiple genetic loci. Using 12S ribosomal DNA sequences, Houde et al. (1997) were the first to present molecular genetic evidence of gruiform polyphyly, although apparently they were not convinced by it. However, on the basis of numerous additional sequence data, it has been shown decisively that the traditionally recognized <b>Gruiformes</b> consist of five to seven unrelated clades (Fain and Houde 2004, Ericson et al. 2006, Hackett et al. 2008).|$|E
50|$|Dynamopterus velox is a prehistoric bird, {{known from}} a single large right humerus {{recovered}} in France. The humerus shares anatomical features with living cuckoos (though is much larger). It has also been classified in the suborder Cariamae in the <b>Gruiformes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Aramus paludigrus is an {{extinct species}} of limpkin, {{semi-aquatic}} birds related to cranes (order <b>Gruiformes),</b> which are similar.

5000|$|They {{have been}} placed in the <b>Gruiformes</b> but this is not entirely certain. It was also {{proposed}} to ally them with the Galloanserae (Weber & Hesse, 1995). Studies of morphology and DNA sequences place them variously close to and far off from the kagu of New Caledonia, as well as the trumpeters; however, on first discovery of fossils, they were mistaken for ratites, specifically small moa. Its morphological closeness to the kagu {{may be the result of}} convergent evolution, although New Zealand's proximity to New Caledonia and shared biological affinities (the two islands are part of the same microcontinent) has led some researchers to suggest they share a common ancestor from Gondwana. The Gondwanan sunbittern is most likely the closest living relative of the kagu, and these two may also be reasonably close to the mesites, yet other [...] "odd gruiforms" [...] from the Southern Hemisphere, but do not seem to be close to the <b>Gruiformes</b> proper (i.e. cranes, rails and allies. See e.g. Fain & Houde, 2004).On the other hand, should the adzebills be closer to the trumpeters, placement in the <b>Gruiformes</b> is likely to be correct even if the kagu and sunbittern are split off.|$|E
50|$|Eogruids {{are almost}} universally {{accepted}} to be <b>Gruiformes</b> within the crane-limpkin-trumpeter line, Gruoidea, the exception being Olson 1985 which declared {{them to be}} stem-ostriches, a study whose proposals are not taken seriously; any similarities between eogruiids and ostriches are purely convergent in nature.|$|E
50|$|Ardeae is a clade that {{of birds}} that {{contains}} Eurypygimorphae and Aequornithes, named in 2014 by genome analysis.

50|$|Gastornis and {{its close}} {{relatives}} were long {{considered to be}} members of the order <b>Gruiformes.</b> However, the traditional concept of <b>Gruiformes</b> has since been shown to be an unnatural grouping. Beginning in the late 1980s and the first phylogenetic analysis of gastornithid relationships, consensus began to grow that they were close relatives of the lineage that includes waterfowl and screamers, the Anseriformes. Recognizing the apparent close relationship between gastornithids and waterfowl, some researchers classify gastornithids within the anseriform group itself. Others restrict the name Anseriformes only to the crown group formed by all modern species, and label the larger group including extinct relatives of anseriformes, like the gastornithids, with the name Anserimorphae. Gastornithids are therefore sometimes placed in their own order, Gastornithiformes.|$|E
5000|$|Cranes are a family, Gruidae, of large, long-legged and long-necked {{birds in}} the group <b>Gruiformes.</b> There are fifteen species of crane in four genera.

50|$|Saemundssonia is a genus {{of chewing}} lice {{belonging}} to the family Philopteridae.

50|$|Telmatornis {{from the}} Navesink Formation - also Late Cretaceous - is {{traditionally}} {{allied with the}} Charadriiformes and/or <b>Gruiformes.</b> However, a cladistic analysis of the forelimb skeleton found it highly similar to the great crested grebe and unlike the painted buttonquail (now {{known to be a}} basal charadriiform lineage), the black-necked stilt (a more advanced charadriiform), or the limpkin (a member of the Grui suborder of <b>Gruiformes),</b> namely in that its dorsal condyle of the humerus was not angled at 20°-30° away from long axis of the humerus. The analysis did not result in a phylogenetic pattern but rather grouped some birds with similar wing shapes together while others stood separate. It is thus unknown whether this apparent similarity to grebes represents an evolutionary relationship, or whether Telmatornis simply had a wing similar to that of grebes and moved it like they do.|$|E
