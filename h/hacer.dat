25|$|Charly García formed {{his first}} post-Sui Generis band, La Máquina de <b>Hacer</b> Pájaros, which began Garcia's explorations of symphonic and {{progressive}} rock. Other symphonic and progressive bands of renown would be Torax, Ave Rock, Anacrusa, and Materia Gris.|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of symphonic rock, Crucis was joined at the top by the {{popularity}} of Espíritu; the two are generally seen as the most well-known outfits of the symphonic rock period. La Máquina de <b>Hacer</b> Pájaros efforts were impressive as well, their first album featuring many {{of the elements of}} good prog: intricate ensemble work, good individual performances, great melodies, dynamic contrast, and interesting arrangements.|$|E
25|$|And {{even more}} bands ceased to be. After two {{successful}} albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, La Máquina de <b>Hacer</b> Pájaros hung up, as did Invisible, leaving as a legacy {{three of the}} greatest albums in Argentine rock's history: Invisible, Durazno Sangrando and Jardin de los Presentes. Pastoral, {{one of the last}} acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did ALAS. With the country gripped by World Cup mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the disco craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out 'the death' of Argentine rock.|$|E

After receiving critical responses to his statement, Syntek apologized and mentioned {{he was only}} joking. Mexican television host and comedian Adal Ramones also joked about pisco sour, {{in reference to the}} 2009 Chile–Peru espionage scandal, on November 17, 2009. Ramones, a fan of Peruvian Pisco, when asked about the espionage, asked what Chileans were spying on in Peru, suggesting it might be how to make a pisco sour (in Spanish: [...] "¿Qué quieren espiar los chilenos? ¿Cómo <b>hacer</b> pisco sour?").|$|E

2500|$|In 1977 Charly García got {{together}} with his friend David Lebón, an ex member of Luis Alberto Spinetta's famous band Pescado Rabioso, to write songs in Brazil. There Charly re-encountered Oscar Moro, the drummer of his former band [...] "La Máquina De <b>Hacer</b> Pájaros" [...] {{and they decided to}} invite him to help compose new material. The trio soon decided that instead of selling their songs like they had originally planned, they would play them themselves in a new band. Now all they needed was a bass player. Pedro Aznar was a lesser known bassist who had once been a member of progressive rock group [...] "ALAS". He also happened to be a friend of Moro's, who knew of Aznar's ability with the funk and jazz bass. Moro brought Aznar into the group and they began to prepare themselves.|$|E

The Estonian version of the song [...] "Jätke võtmed väljapoole" [...] was performed by Anne Veski.

It was her only entry to the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 9, where she remains a one-hit wonder.
