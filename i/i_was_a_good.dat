Milian traveled to Romania for filming, and later discovered that her then-boyfriend Nick Cannon had cheated on her while she was away.

2500|$|In August {{that same}} year Muralitharan {{produces}} his career-best test match figures of 16 for 220, in the one-off test against England. In England's second innings Muralitharan bowled a marathon 54.2 overs to pick up 9 for 65 runs, the other wicket being a run out. Ben Hollioake becomes his 200th test wicket. Sri Lanka won by ten wickets, their first Test victory in England. After breaking the world record for the most test wickets in 2007, Muralitharan commented that his 1998 performance at the Oval against England, was his career highlight. He stated [...] "Everyone thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> bowler then and I didn't look back from there." ...|$|E

If not, all professions of {{religion}} will avail me nothing. If not, let me confess my sins to God, and repent and amend at once, {{whatever it may}} cost me. The fulfilling these plain duties is the true test of my faith, the true sign and test whether I really believe in God and in Jesus Christ our Lord. Do I believe {{that the world is}} Christ's making? and that Christ is governing it? Do I believe that these plain family relationships are Christ's sacred appointments? Do I believe that our Lord Jesus was made very man of the substance of His mother, to sanctify these family relationships, and claim them as the ordinances of God His Father? ...|$|R

2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E

40|$|Are there good {{grounds for}} {{thinking}} that the moral values of action are {{to be derived from}} those of character? This ‘virtue ethical’ claim is sometimes thought of as a kind of normative ethical theory; sometimes as form of opposition to any such theory. However, the best case to be made for it supports neither of these claims. Rather, it leads us to a distinctive view in moral epistemology: the view that my warrant for a particular moral judgement derives from my warrant for believing that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moral judge. This view seems to confront a regress-problem. For the belief that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moral judge <b>is</b> itself <b>a</b> particular moral judgement. So it seems that, on this view, I need to derive my warrant for believing that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moral judge from my warrant for believing that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> judge of moral judges; and so on. I show how this worry can be met, and trace the implications of the resulting view for warranted moral judgement. Garrett Cullit...|$|R

50|$|Instead {{of having}} one {{self-concept}} (e.g., <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> parent), self-affirmation theory posits that individuals flexibly define {{who they are}} using various roles (e.g., <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> parent, child, and worker). Having a flexible sense of self allows individual to offset weaknesses in one domain, by highlighting the strengths in another domain. That is, if someone perceives threat to one domain, {{he or she can}} accommodate this threat by upholding a value in another domain. Self-affirmations can come from many sources.
