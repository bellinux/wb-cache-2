The consequences of the solar dynamics on the formation of spectral features in solar atmosphere regions are discussed. Data mainly from the solar ultraviolet measurement of emitted radiation (SUMER) <b>instrument,</b> showing <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> non-stationary processes, are presented. These data are compared to the predictions of numerical models of the chromosphere and transition region.

40|$|Magnetic {{clouds are}} a subset of interplanetary coronal mass ejections {{characterized}} by a smooth rotation in the magnetic field direction, which is interpreted as a <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a magnetic flux rope. Suprathermal electron observations indicate that one or both ends of a magnetic cloud typically remain connected to the Sun as it moves out through the heliosphere. With distance from the axis of the flux rope, out toward its edge, the magnetic field winds more tightly about the axis and electrons must traverse longer magnetic field lines to reach the same heliocentric distance. This increased time of flight allows greater pitch-angle scattering to occur, meaning suprathermal electron pitch-angle distributions should be systematically broader {{at the edges of}} the flux rope than at the axis. We model this effect with an analytical magnetic flux rope model and a numerical scheme for suprathermal electron pitch-angle scattering and find that the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> a magnetic flux rope should be observable with the typical pitch-angle resolution of suprathermal electron data provided ACE's SWEPAM <b>instrument.</b> Evidence <b>of</b> this <b>signature</b> in the observations, however, is weak, possibly because reconnection of magnetic fields within the flux rope acts to intermix flux tubes...|$|R

The white blank periods for the LEP-e measurements in panel (h) correspond to the loss-cone measurements (Kazama et al. 2017). During this period, the satellite performs conjugate observations with ground instruments, and the LEP-e instruments measure the electron flux variations inside the loss cone to identify the precipitation of auroral electrons. Sometimes, these three <b>instruments</b> observe <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> injections in which energy dispersions are observed from a few keV to a few hundred keV electrons. It is expected that electrons injected from the night side drift to the morning side where the satellite observes them.|$|R

40|$|The {{concern of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the risk <b>of</b> forgery <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> In the context <b>of</b> {{negotiable}} <b>Instruments.</b> The allocation <b>of</b> the said risk is submitted to represent {{one of the most controversial}} matters among the existing legal systems. It is believed that the issue under consideration has represented a major obstacle to the adoption of an acceptable unification of the law <b>of</b> negotiable <b>instruments.</b> The main task of this thesis is to propose an efficient allocation of the risk of the forgery <b>of</b> <b>signatures.</b> The scope <b>of</b> this enquiry is confined to the forgery of two forms <b>of</b> <b>signatures,</b> namely, that <b>of</b> the proprietor of a blank document and that of the payee or indorsee <b>of</b> a negotiable <b>instrument.</b> The forgery <b>of</b> such <b>signatures</b> is submitted to represent the major incident of the problem of risk allocation in the context <b>of</b> negotiable <b>Instruments.</b> Its involvement affects the currency of such documents and ultimately, it affects the determination of the property right <b>of</b> negotiable <b>instruments,</b> as well as the enforcement of the incorporated contractual promises and undertakings. In formulating the proposed allocation of the risk of the forgery <b>of</b> <b>signatures,</b> this thesis takes into account economic considerations, as well as the considerations relevant to the institution <b>of</b> negotiable <b>Instrument</b> So The theory underlying such an attitude is firstly, to reconcile with recent developments in the law, secondly to accommodate the needs of modern society and thirdly, to promote the efficiency of a significant finance <b>instrument.</b> The promotion <b>of</b> the efficiency <b>of</b> negotiable <b>instruments</b> would necessarily promote the efficiency of the market. Finally, this thesis examines the attitude of the major existing legal systems in allocating the forgery <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> in the context <b>of</b> negotiable <b>instruments.</b> In particular, it examines the attitude of the Anglo-American and the Continental Geneva legal systems. It examines the theories underlying such an attitude. It examines the validity of the advanced theories. It examines the compatibility of the attitude of the said legal systems with the considerations underlying the institution <b>of</b> negotiable <b>Instruments</b> as well as those underlying economic reality. Ultimately, this thesis determines the most compatible legal system with the proposed risk allocation rule...|$|R

In this paper, we briefly review the FTS design, operation, and data reduction, and describe {{in detail the}} approach taken to relative calibration (removal <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>signatures)</b> and absolute calibration against standard astronomical sources. The calibration scheme assumes a spatially extended source and uses the Herschel telescope as primary calibrator. Conversion from extended to point-source calibration is carried out using observations of the planet Uranus. The model of the telescope emission is shown to be accurate to within 6 per cent and repeatable to better than 0. 06 per cent and, by comparison with models of Mars and Neptune, the Uranus model is shown to be accurate to within 3 per cent. Multiple observations {{of a number of}} point-like sources show that the repeatability of the calibration is better than 1 per cent, if the effects of the satellite absolute pointing error (APE) are corrected. The satellite APE leads to a decrement in the derived flux, which can be up to similar to 10 per cent (1 sigma) at the high-frequency end of the SPIRE range {{in the first part of}} the mission, and similar to 4 per cent after Herschel operational day 1011. The lower frequency range of the SPIRE band is unaffected by this pointing error due to the larger beam size. Overall, for well-pointed, point-like sources, the absolute flux calibration is better than 6 per cent, and for extended sources where mapping is required it is better than 7 per cent...|$|R
