25|$|In 1788, Pierre-Simon Laplace used Cassini's ephemerides {{and those}} {{produced}} by other astronomers {{in the preceding}} century to create a mathematical theory explaining the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. The ratios of the orbital periods of the inner three Galilean moons are simple integers: Io orbits Jupiter twice every time Europa orbits once, and four times for <b>each</b> <b>revolution</b> by Ganymede; this is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Laplace resonance. Laplace also found that the slight difference between these exact ratios and reality was due to their mean motions accounting for the precession of the periapse for Io and Europa. This resonance was later found to {{have a profound effect on}} the geologies of the three moons.|$|E

30|$|Given {{a variety}} of {{scientific}} interest described in Section 2, the optimal observation mode changes as the geometrical relationship among Akatsuki, Venus, the Earth and the sun changes. The observation modes we have prepared are roughly classified into the following six groups. These observations are conducted sequentially in <b>each</b> orbital <b>revolution.</b>|$|R
25|$|These stars, {{known as}} neutron stars, are {{extremely}} small—on {{the order of}} radius 10km, no bigger than {{the size of a}} large city—and are phenomenally dense. Their period of rotation shortens dramatically as the stars shrink (due to conservation of angular momentum); observed rotational periods of neutron stars range from about 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per second) to several seconds. When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation <b>each</b> <b>revolution.</b> Such neutron stars are called pulsars, and were the first neutron stars to be discovered. Though electromagnetic radiation detected from pulsars is most often in the form of radio waves, pulsars have also been detected at visible, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily {{due to the fact that}} it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine (although at the actual output shaft, there is only one power pulse per revolution, since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does, as can be seen in the animation below, making it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of the same displacement; this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor, since only one face is working for each output shaft revolution). The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine, although this name also applies to other completely different designs, primarily aircraft engines with their cylinders arranged in a circular fashion around the crankshaft. All parts rotate consistently in one direction, as opposed to the common reciprocating piston engine, which has pistons violently changing direction. The four-stage cycle of intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust occur <b>each</b> <b>revolution</b> at each of the three rotor tips moving inside the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing, enabling the three power pulses per rotor revolution. The rotor is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter.|$|E
500|$|From {{the surface}} of Amalthea, Jupiter would look enormous: 46 degrees across, it would appear roughly 92 {{times larger than the}} full moon. Because Amalthea is in {{synchronous}} rotation, Jupiter would not appear to move, and would not be visible from one side of Amalthea. The Sun would disappear behind Jupiter's bulk {{for an hour and a}} half <b>each</b> <b>revolution,</b> and Amalthea's short rotation period gives it just under six hours of [...] Though Jupiter would appear 900 times brighter than the full moon, its light would be spread over an area some 8500 times greater and it would not look as bright per surface unit.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanical {{efficiency}} was {{improved by}} reversing {{the action of}} the push rod. The firing impulse was generated at a low point of the cam instead of at the lobe of the cam as in Saulnier's patent. Thus the force on the rod was exerted by tension rather than compression, (or in less technical language, the trigger motor worked by being [...] "pulled" [...] rather than [...] "pushed") which enabled the rod to be lighter, minimising its inertia so that it could operate faster (at least in early versions of the gear, <b>each</b> <b>revolution</b> of the cam wheel produced two firing impulses instead of one). A single firing lever engaged the gear and fired the gun in one action, rather than the gear having to be [...] "turned on" [...] and then fired, as with some earlier gears.|$|E
2500|$|Firstly, {{a method}} of {{determining}} {{the position of the}} propeller at a given instant was required. Typically, a cam, driven either directly from the propeller shaft itself, or from some part of the motor revolving at the same speed as the propeller, generated a series of impulses {{at the same rate as}} the propeller's revolutions. There were exceptions to this, some gears placed the cam within the gun trigger mechanism itself, and the firing impulses were sometimes timed to occur at every two, or three revolutions of the propeller, or, especially in the case of hydraulic or electric gears, at the rate of two or more for <b>each</b> <b>revolution.</b> The diagrams in this section assume, for simplicity's sake, one impulse for one revolution, so that all synchronized rounds are [...] "aimed" [...] at a single spot on the propeller disc.|$|E
2500|$|In {{practice}} {{it was found}} that it was necessary for the gun to be fired in semi-automatic mode. At <b>each</b> <b>revolution</b> of the propeller a firing impulse was transmitted to the gun, which effectively [...] "pulled the trigger", to fire a single shot. The majority of these firing impulses would catch the gun in the course of its firing cycle, that is when it was [...] "busy" [...] ejecting a spent round or loading a fresh one, and would be [...] "wasted"; but eventually the firing cycle was completed, and the gun was ready to fire. It then had to [...] "wait" [...] for the next impulse from the gear, and on receiving this it fired. This delay between being ready to fire and actually firing inevitably slowed the rate of fire in comparison with a free-firing machine gun, which fires the moment it is ready to do so; but provided the gear functioned correctly the gun could fire fairly rapidly through the whirling propeller blades without striking them.|$|E
40|$|A {{system is}} {{provided}} for determining tracking error in a propeller or rotor driven aircraft by determining {{differences in the}} aerodynamic loading on the propeller or rotor blades of the aircraft. The system includes a microphone disposed relative to the blades during the rotation thereof so as to receive separate pressure pulses produced by each of the blades during the passage thereof by the microphone. A low pass filter filters the output signal produced by the microphone, the low pass filter having an upper cut-off frequency set below the frequency at which the blades pass by the microphone. A sensor produces an output signal after <b>each</b> complete <b>revolution</b> of the blades, and a recording display device displays the outputs of the low pass filter and sensor so as to enable evaluation of the relative magnitudes of the pressure pulses produced by passage of the blades by the microphone during <b>each</b> complete <b>revolution</b> of the blades...|$|R

50|$|For example, if a {{machinist}} {{wanted to}} index (rotate) his workpiece by 22.5 degrees {{then he would}} turn the hand crank two full revolutions plus one-half of a turn. Since <b>each</b> full <b>revolution</b> is 9 degrees and a half-revolution is 4.5 degrees, the total is 22.5 (9 + 9 + 4.5 = 22.5).

In Fig. 2 the original hemispherical mirror is shown broken up into three different sectors, BB', CC', and DD'; so that with the same velocity of revolution the periods of light and darkness will be produced in quicker succession.

60|$|The view {{just given}} further explains, as I believe, a fact {{observed}} by Mohl (p. 135), namely, that a revolving shoot, {{though it will}} twine round an object as thin as a thread, cannot do so round a thick support. I placed some long revolving shoots of a Wistaria close to a post between 5 and 6 inches in diameter, but, though aided by me in many ways, they could not wind round it. This apparently {{was due to the}} flexure of the shoot, whilst winding round an object so gently curved as this post, not being sufficient to hold the shoot to its place when the growing surface crept round to the opposite surface of the shoot; so that it was withdrawn at <b>each</b> <b>revolution</b> from its support.|$|E
