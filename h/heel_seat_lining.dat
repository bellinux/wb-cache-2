40|$|A shoe wearer's comfort {{is related}} to the shape of the footbed of a shoe. Even though the footbed shape is {{important}} in footwear design, there exists no methodology to evaluate the existing guidelines used in last making. Thirty-two females participated in an experiment where <b>heel</b> <b>seat</b> length, <b>heel</b> <b>seat</b> inclination and <b>heel</b> height were investigated using the profile assessment device. The dependent variables were plantar pressure and perceived feeling of each participant. The results show that perceived feel is best for wedge angles of 4 degrees and 5 degrees at a heel height of 25 mm, 10 degrees and 11 degrees at a heel height of 50 mm and 16 degrees and 18 degrees at a heel height of 75 mm. A regression model was derived and this explained approximately 80 % of the variation of perceived feeling with the contact area, peak plantar pressure and percentage of force acting on the forefoot region. Both heel wedge angle and <b>heel</b> <b>seat</b> length {{play an important role in}} the perceived feel of high-heeled shoes. This study, in relation to the load-bearing heel part of a shoe, highlights the importance of good footbed design. The findings can be used to design footwear with enhanced comfort. close 71...|$|R

50|$|It was {{originally}} built in 1958 as the University of Tennessee Armory-Fieldhouse to accommodate larger on-campus crowds. It originally housed 7,800 {{people in the}} elongated building, with permanent seating in the west end and temporary <b>seating</b> <b>lining</b> {{the rest of the}} arena, which was also used for the ROTC, indoor track, and other events. However, by the mid-1960s the fieldhouse was already becoming obsolete for its size. A $500,000 gift from industrialist William B. Stokely was the impetus for an expansion to the final size of 12,700 in 1966, when the building was renamed for Stokely and his family. Permanent seating was installed on the other three sides, including balcony seating on the north and south sides. The arena had originally been designed to expand to 12,000 people in the original layout.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Graco {{acquired}} Century, a {{car seat}} manufacturer and introduced the SnugRide infant car seat, {{which has become}} America’s top-selling infant car <b>seat</b> <b>line.</b> Century actually introduced the travel system where a car seat could fit on a stroller for easy transportation. That same year, Graco was acquired by Rubbermaid (the company became Newell Rubbermaid in 1999). In 2002, Graco launched the TurboBooster, a booster seat designed to help parents stay in compliance with many states’ passage of laws requiring children {{to stay in a}} car seat longer. In 2007, the company purchased established German baby product brand, Teutonia. The same year, the Nautilus&reg; 3-in-1car seat debuted, earning the “Best Bet” designation from Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Then, in 2008, Graco acquired Aprica Kassai&reg;, the number one selling baby brand in Japan. In 2014, Graco acquired American baby brand, Baby Jogger.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{pointing}} out and mark the various kind of defects (mainly scars, wrinkles and fire brandings) of tanned calf leathers used in many industrial areas (e. g. household couches and car <b>seats</b> <b>lining</b> ones). In the first experiments here presented the authors try to use the same inspection method previously successfully applied to quality control of hands-made satin glasses, that is a two-dimensional wavelet-based de-noising technique of high resolution images of the leather under inspection; according to multiresolution analysis, this method produces a suitable number of decomposition levels of the image, then it carries out a thresholding operation on details and finally, using the threshold levels estimated considering the actual noise level, it assesses and mark the various kind of defects. The final aim of the work is the realization of an automatic and in-line computer vision system for leather analysis capable to accurately inspect and mark the defective areas of the analyzed leather specimens before they enter the production chain...|$|R
