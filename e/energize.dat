5|$|By 1920, due {{in large}} part to the city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to <b>energize</b> a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E
5|$|Thoughts {{of a new}} way {{to improve}} the {{nighttime}} environment began in summer 2011 when the new Cedar Fair CEO, Matt Ouimet was in the park one night and thought they should add more lights and excitement. The goal was to create a new show that would <b>energize</b> the main midway with bright lights and music. Matt Ouimet first mentioned the show at a conference in January 2012. Details of Luminosity were first announced at the PointBuzz winter tour of Cedar Point on February 25, 2012. The 3,600 square foot screen used for American Portrait and Hot Summer Lights was taken down on February 28 because it was not needed for the new show. On April 13, Cedar Point officially announced Luminosity. The show debuted on June 1 for previews and its grand opening was held on June 8.|$|E
5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at {{the two sides of the}} road so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would <b>energize</b> the millstone to produce as much as one day meal for him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E

For example: A higher-voltage distribution level circuit may feed several lower-voltage distribution circuits through transformers. If the higher voltage circuit is de-energized, but if lower-voltage circuits connected remain <b>energized,</b> the higher voltage circuit will remain <b>energized.</b> Another problem can arise when de-energized wires become <b>energized</b> through electrostatic or electromagnetic induction from <b>energized</b> wires in close proximity.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine, experimentally, if distinguishing characteristics exist between the beads formed on <b>energized</b> and non-energized wires exposed to various thermal insults. Most of research published in the literature has not tested <b>energized</b> and non-energized wires under the same thermal conditions. The tests in this study were conducted using convective, radiative and combined convective/radiative thermal exposures. Wires were tested in both <b>energized</b> and non-energized states. <b>Energized</b> wires were tested under "load" and "no load" conditions. Beads formed on both the <b>energized</b> and non-energized wires as results of thermal exposure. Beads were analyzed externally and internally with stereo microscope, SEM/EDS, and a metallurgical microscope. No clear trends or distinguishing visual or microscopic characteristics between the beads formed on <b>energized</b> and non-energized wires were found. The bead analysis methods used during this research showed that {{it is not possible to}} distinguish between the beads formed on <b>energized</b> and non-energized wires exposed to various thermal insults...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{current study}} was {{attempted}} to investigate the effect of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treated <b>energized</b> water on chicken. The total 4200 chicks were equally divided into two groups i. e.  control and treated. The biofield treated <b>energized</b> water was provided to the treated chicks, while the control chicks were drunk with standard drinking water. During the experiment the parameters such as mortality, body weight, food intake etc. were assessed in both control and <b>energized</b> water treated birds. The mortality rate was reduced in the <b>energized</b> water treated chicks as 54. 55 % in week 1, 42. 11 % in week 6, and 39. 13 % in week 4, {{as compared to the}} control chicks. Moreover, the average body weight was increased by 12. 50 % in week 1 as compared to the control chicks. The feed conversion ratio was gradually decreased which indicated that the <b>energized</b> water treated chicks took less feeds while the body weight was increased in comparison to the control chicks. Besides, the <b>energized</b> water treated birds showed statistically significant (p< 0. 007) with 15. 47 % increase in the edible meat weight as compared to the control chicks. Moreover, the feather, skin and internal organ weight were significantly reduced by 21. 22 % (p< 0. 001) of <b>energized</b> water treated chicks as compared to the untreated chicks.

40|$|Increasing {{reliance}} on deep-water renewable energy has increased {{concerns about the}} effects of the electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by submarine power cables on aquatic organisms. Off southern California, we conducted surveys of marine organisms living around <b>energized</b> and unenergized submarine power cables and nearby sea floor during 2012 – 2014 at depths between 76 and 213 [*]m. In general, EMFs declined to background levels about one meter from the cable. We found no statistical difference in species composition between the fish assemblages along the <b>energized</b> and unenergized cables. The natural habitat community statistically differed from both <b>energized</b> and unenergized cable communities. Within species (or species groups), we found no differences in densities between <b>energized</b> and unenergized cables. Total fish densities were significantly higher around the cables than over the natural habitat. We found that invertebrate communities were structured by habitat type and depth and, similar to the fishes, there was no statistical difference between the <b>energized</b> and unenergized cables. Individually, the densities of four invertebrate species or species groups (Metridium farcimen, Luidia spp., unidentified black Crinoidea, and Urticina spp.) differed between <b>energized</b> and unenergized cables, but this difference was not significant across all depth strata.

Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the EEA. For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.|$|E
