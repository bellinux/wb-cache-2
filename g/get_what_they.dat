5|$|The Masons {{lived in}} a colonial Virginia that had few roads, as most {{commerce}} was carried on Chesapeake Bay or along the waters of its tributaries, such as the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. Most settlement took place near the rivers, through which planters could trade with the world. Thus, colonial Virginia initially developed few towns, since estates were largely self-sufficient, and could <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> needed without the need to purchase locally. Even the capital, Williamsburg, saw little activity when the legislature was not in session. Local politics was dominated by large landowners like the Masons. The Virginia economy rose and fell with tobacco, the main crop, which was raised mostly for export to Britain.|$|E

By teaching these animals a gestural (human made) American Sign Language-like language, the animals {{have been found to}} use the new signs on their own to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need. The recent experiments on animal language are perhaps the most sophisticated attempt yet to establish human/animal communication, though their relation to natural animal communication is uncertain.|$|E

It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want. There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.|$|E

They also suffer from the general sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death.

25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may have}} {{undesirable}} consequences {{for people with}} negative self-views (depressed people and those who suffer from low self-esteem). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to gravitate toward partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of self-worth, or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek therapy, returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there. Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deserve from their employers (see: workplace bullying).|$|E

500|$|A socialist {{from his}} {{undergraduate}} days, Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition. In History (1947) he commented that [...] "Magic {{is a way}} of making people believe they are going to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to want what they get." [...] Archaeologist Colin Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal minded on social issues, but thought that although Childe deplored racism, he did not entirely escape the pervasive 19th century view on distinct differences between different races.|$|E

J.D. breaks the moment asking her who was the best singer in her head, much {{to the rest of}} the staff's (and especially Dr. Cox's) dismay. J.D. reflects in voiceover that in musicals everyone <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, but in reality, after having made a choice we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she wishes she spent more time with her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music in her head.|$|E

[...] Drysdale responded that Bavasi {{did the same thing}} with him, using Koufax against him. Drysdale's first wife, Ginger Drysdale, suggested that they negotiate together to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. They demanded $1 million ($ today), divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 ($ today) each for each of the next three seasons. Both players were represented by an entertainment lawyer, J. William Hayes, which was unusual during an era when players were not represented by agents. At the time, Willie Mays was Major League Baseball's highest paid player at $125,000 ($ today) per year and multi-year contracts were very unusual.|$|E
500|$|Marjorie Gilberg, {{executive}} director of the anti-teenage violence group Break the Cycle, commented that [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] can teach listeners about the dangers of abusive relationships if interpreted correctly. She believed that because popular culture often depicts what is socially acceptable, people may accept such violence more easily. She added, [...] "One problem, though,... is that the song reflects myths about domestic violence—myths that lead to blaming the victim." [...] Gilberg said the victim is often accused of being as guilty as the partner but wants to be loved, not abused. Terry O'Neill, a feminist {{and the president of the}} National Organization for Women, criticized the lyric, [...] "But your temper's just as bad as mine is / You're the same as me", saying it is a typical excuse used by abusive men for aggression and that [...] "it's only 2-year-olds and violent men who use violence to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want."

500|$|Keith Baxter {{compared}} Welles to Falstaff, {{since they}} were both perpetually short of money, often lied and cheated people to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> needed and were always merry and fun loving. Film scholar Jack Jorgens also compared Welles to Falstaff, stating that [...] "to a man who directed and starred in a masterpiece and has since staggered through three decades of underfinanced, hurried, flawed films, scores of bit parts, narrations, and interviews which debased his talent, dozens of projects which died for want of persistence and financing, {{the story of a}} fat, aging jester exiled from his audience and no longer able to triumph over impossible obstacles with wit and torrential imagination might well seem tragic." [...] When Joss Ackland played Falstaff on the stage in 1982, {{he said that he was}} more inspired by Welles than by Welles's performance as Falstaff, stating that [...] "like Falstaff, I believe he could have achieved so much, but it was frittered away." [...] Kenneth S. Rothwell has called Hal's rejection of Falstaff allegorical to Hollywood's rejection of Welles. Welles had become deeply depressed in the late 1950s after the disappointment of making Touch of Evil, his intended Hollywood comeback.|$|E

"The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] is {{the most}} obvious {{reference}} to Frankenstein made by the series, although traces of the story are seen elsewhere in the first season episode [...] "Young at Heart" [...] and the sixth season episode [...] "The Beginning". In addition, the series' overarching mythology revolves around shadowy Syndicate leaders who salvage alien spacecraft for their own technological use and create human-alien hybrids. The episode contains themes relating to motherhood and sexuality. According to film studies writer Linda Badley, this episode, and season four's [...] "Home", foreshadow Scully's impending motherhood and her realization, in following episodes [...] "Christmas Carol" [...] and [...] "Emily", {{that she has been}} used to create a human-alien hybrid, Emily. Diane Negra, in her book Off-White Hollywood: American Culture and Ethnic Female Stardom, points out that while The Great Mutato impregnates both Shaineh Berkowitz and Elizabeth Pollidori without their consent or knowledge, it is [...] "an oversimplification" [...] to label the monster as a rapist, because both Berkowitz and Pollidori [...] "desire for children through unconventional means".

Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ...

Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life.
