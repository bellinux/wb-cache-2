40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the uterus to the inhibition of contractions by salbutamol, diltiazem or nifedipine was assessed in the ovariectomized, post-partum rat by dose-response curves following bolus intravenous (i. v.) administration. These tests were performed before (day 1), immediately after a 20 h i. v. infusion of salbutamol, diltiazem, nifedipine or appropriate control infusate (day 2) and after a further 20 h infusion of saline (day 3). In a further group of animals sensitivity to nifedipine was assessed before and after a 20 h infusion of salbutamol. Uterine contractions were monitored throughout infusions. Infusion of salbutamol (2 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1) produced an initial marked inhibition of uterine contractions, an effect which was not maintained despite continued infusion. Contractions reappeared after 2 h of infusion and reached pre-infusion levels by 5 h. The dose-response curve to salbutamol <b>on</b> <b>day</b> 2 was shifted more than 100 fold to the right compared with <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>day</b> 1.
