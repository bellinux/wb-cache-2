50|$|The <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> {{explosion}} was {{an industrial}} accident {{that took place}} on August 9, 1999 in Calgary, Alberta and caused two fatalities. The <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> refinery was located at 5805 17th Ave. S.E., near {{the eastern edge of}} Calgary and immediately south of the residential community of Penbrooke.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} decades, Stemco began designing and manufacturing new products {{for use in}} the commercial trucking industry, such as <b>hub</b> <b>oil</b> seals, hubodometers and other products which have become standard additions to OEM truck component manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|The vessel, {{which was}} more than two metres in {{diameter}} and nine metres in length, was fabricated in 1963 and decommissioned in 1971. <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> purchased it in 1985, but the tank sat unused for another six years until Hub switched its fuel recycling operation from a one-step to a two-step recovery system.|$|E
50|$|During this time, {{numerous}} {{public meetings}} {{were held to}} keep the community up to date with <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil’s</b> remediation plans. From these meetings, a permanent Stakeholder Group (composed {{of members of the}} community, the regulating agencies and elected officials) was established to ensure that the reclamation plan was acceptable and complete.|$|R
50|$|In April 2008, Alberta Environment {{approved}} <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil’s</b> Remediation and Reclamation plan. The plan {{includes the}} presently operating water containment system, a proposed 1.2 metre clay cap over the site, and extensive groundwater and soil vapour monitoring, testing and reporting {{for the next}} 10 years. The plan also calls for continued reporting to Stakeholders as the Company proceeds with development of the site {{to ensure that they}} are kept current.|$|R

50|$|STEMCO {{manufactures}} {{a variety}} of high-performance wheel-end, steering, suspension and braking components used by the heavy-duty trucking industry. Its products are generally used on commercial tractor-trailers and include <b>hub</b> <b>oil</b> seals, axle fasteners, hub caps, wheel bearings, mileage counters, king pin kits, suspension kits, brake friction, lightweight brake drums, foundation brake parts and automatic brake adjusters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> is {{committed}} to redeveloping the site to the highest-and-best-use. One development being considered is a technology incubation centre as proposed in the Report commissioned by the Government of Alberta entitled Task Force on Value-added and Technology Commercialization. The Report recommended {{the creation of new}} product commercialization centres. Such facilities and services would help Alberta start-up and growth-oriented firms develop new products and services. Examples of sectors of focus would include: green technology, life sciences, advanced materials, nano-technology and geomatics.|$|E
50|$|The riding has {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} environmental problems in recent years caused by heavy industry. Soil contamination from the old oil refinery in Lynwood Ridge has created a ghost town of houses in limbo. Canadian Pacific Railway has also been to blame for heavy soil contamination affecting residents along the tracks in Ogden by a chemical known as Trichloroethylene used as a track degreaser. In 1999 the <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> refinery just east of Erin Woods exploded raining contamination on the neighbourhood. The riding also has a quarantined site where the Inglewood Refinery used to be for soil contamination problems.|$|E

50|$|The Kalmacoff family’s {{roots are}} in Kamsack, Saskatchewan where Jake Kalmacoff Sr. built a {{conventional}} crude oil refinery in the ‘30s which also re-refined used lube oil for the Air Force during World War II, and was designated {{essential to the}} war effort. His son, Jake Kalmacoff Jr. moved to Calgary {{with his family in}} 1958 and acquired the dormant Monarch Refinery in what was then the Village of Hubalta, Alberta. It had been built in 1939, but only operated for 2 years before being shut down. Jake Jr. applied similar re-refining technology that the family had developed during the war, and named the business <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> Company Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|C S Martin {{was asleep}} {{at a nearby}} house on Penworth Place {{at the time of}} the first explosion. He remembers it vividly. [...] "Since I was three years old, I grew up in Penbrooke and at one point, I lived on Penrith Crescent less than a {{kilometer}} from the blast site. The people in the community always talked about the smells coming from <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil.</b> Many people suffered from frequent headaches, and symptoms not unlike those from the community of Lynwood Ridge. The morning of the blast, I was in bed, and was wakened by the sound of Thunder. I looked out my bedroom window, and the sky was blue, but I thought nothing of it. Moments later, my mother banged on the door and told me to wake up, as she thought <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> had exploded; as she always thought it would. We drove to a pedestrian bridge over train tracks close to a mobile home park close to the blast, and from that vantage point about 35 feet above the horizon, we could see the damage and feel the intense heat from the flame. Later, a very large radius including this bridge, and up to 100 feet from my home were evacuated. My family decided to head south to my Aunt & Uncle's house on Riverside Crescent which I later bought from them in 2011. Safely evacuated, all we could do was watch on the news to see if any more tanks had ruptured and wiped out the community. The fire burned out, and we returned home to find fallout for weeks to come. That day faded into nothing more than a memory." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the fire, <b>Hub</b> <b>Oil</b> {{remained}} operational on {{a reduced}} basis (collection, storage and dispatching) until 2001, {{at which time}} the Company voluntarily shut down the business {{with the intention of}} promoting urban renewal. The site was cleared of all unusable structures and damaged oil tanks. Extensive soil, groundwater and soil vapor testing was begun immediately by WorleyParsons Komex and continues to this day. In 2003, a groundwater treatment system was voluntarily installed to prevent possible offsite migration of contaminants. At no time has the Company been under a directive from Alberta Environment as a result of non-compliance under the Environmental Enhancement and Protection Act. Under questioning in the legislature in June 2007, Minister of the Environment Rob Renner stated, “Hub Oil is working with Alberta Environment, with the various stakeholders... As long as they continue to own that land, as long as they put in place the necessary provisions to ensure that any contamination does not go beyond the land in question, they’re not in contravention of our legislation.” ...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out on a high side scroll compressor having a fixed scroll equipped with a circular oil groove on its thrust surface. Oil is supplied to the oil groove through an intermittent opening from a high pressure oil reservoir formed inside the orbiting scroll <b>hub.</b> <b>Oil</b> in the groove is then delivered to both suction and back pressure chambers by pressure differentials and viscous pumping action of the orbiting scroll base plate. Mathematical modeling of this oil groove system has been incorporated into main compressor performance simulation program for optimum oil groove design. Pressure in the oil groove can be controlled by changing the oil passage area and oil groove configuration. With an enlarged oil passage, pressure in the oil groove increases due to increased flow rate, but pressure increase in the back pressure chamber is not that large, resulting in reduced friction loss at the thrust surface between the two scrolls. On the other hand, by increasing the oil passage area, oil content in the refrigerant flow increases, and the orbiting scroll stability could be negatively affected by oil groove pressure increase. Considering all these factors, EER could be improved by about 3. 6 % at ARI condition by optimum oil groove design...|$|E
