30|$|In {{addition}} to the required computer science courses, students are also required to complete a number of criminology courses. The criminology curriculum includes courses that focus on criminological theories, crime investigation techniques, and research methodologies in criminology. The capstone course offered in the criminology department for the major is criminal justice system responses to cybercrime. This course explores {{the various types of}} criminal conduct associated with computers and the World Wide Web. Additionally, it covers digital forensics, theories of <b>digital</b> <b>crime</b> and terrorism, and policy implications and laws related to cybercrime. Furthermore, the criminology capstone course covers in detail the prominent forms of computer crime and the legal issues that emerge in confronting those crimes. That class has been organized in part around Taylor et al.'s (2011) <b>Digital</b> <b>Crime</b> and Digital Terrorism, and one appealing feature of that text is its attention to the global and international nature of much computer crime [16]. Many computer crimes involve actions that cross international boundaries and this text meticulously describes the legal issues that surround both computer and cyber crimes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Event {{reconstruction}} plays {{a critical}} role in solving physical crimes by explaining why a piece of physical evidence has certain characteristics. With digital crimes, the current focus has been on the recognition and identification of digital evidence using an object’s characteristics, but not on the identification of the events that caused the characteristics. This paper examines digital event reconstruction and proposes a process model and procedure {{that can be used for}} a <b>digital</b> <b>crime</b> scene. The model has been designed so that it can apply to physical crime scenes, can support the unique aspects of a <b>digital</b> <b>crime</b> scene, and can be implemented in software to automate part of the process. We also examine the differences between physical event reconstruction and digital event reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Digital {{forensics}} plays {{a crucial}} part {{in the investigation of}} crimes involving electronic equipment. Masses of digital evidence collected at a crime scene will have to be analyzed by digital forensics experts in an attempt to discover how a <b>digital</b> <b>crime</b> was committed and by whom. This is a labour-intensive and timeconsuming process which can be improved using specially designed digital tools. This paper proposes an open-source forensics platform that may be used as a base for other digital forensics projects. The proposed forensics platform may be used by researchers as a base to develop digital forensics research prototypes and by industry to conduct digital investigations after it has become apparent that a <b>digital</b> <b>crime</b> has been committed. This aim of proposed platform project is enable researchers to develop forensic prototypes more rapidly and help to ensure the quality of the forensics tools making use of the platform.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we examine the}} {{challenges}} arising from the growth of <b>digital</b> <b>crime,</b> particularly the problems faced by investigators. The interaction between technological change and criminality is well recognised for crime in general, but certain aspects of <b>digital</b> <b>crime</b> mark a significant shift both in {{the ways in which}} crime is enacted, and the consequent investigative response. This chapter explores some of the more general technological and social factors that have accompanied and possibly contributed to these changes. The remaining chapters consider particular aspects in more detail. 1. 1 Technology and crime Throughout history, general technological developments have continually created new opportunities for criminal activity, which in turn have driven the development of new technologies. Both the pre-modern and modern eras provide clear examples of such interactions. For example, in the 12 th century, the techniques employed for counterfeiting currency closely matched the technological development of reliable methods to produce genuine currency. Similarly, bank robbers in the early 20 t...|$|E

40|$|As <b>digital</b> <b>crimes</b> have risen, so has {{the need}} for digital forensics. Numerous {{state-of-the-art}} tools {{have been developed to}} assist digital investigators conduct proper investigations into <b>digital</b> <b>crimes.</b> However, <b>digital</b> investigations are becoming increasingly complex and time consuming due to the amount of data involved, and digital investigators can find themselves unable to conduct them in an appropriately efficient and effective manner. This situation has prompted the need for new tools capable of handling such large, complex investigations. Data mining is one such potential tool. It is still relatively unexplored from a digital forensics perspective, but the purpose of data mining is to discover new knowledge from data where the dimensionality, complexity or volume of data is prohibitively large for manual analysis. This study assesses the self-organising map (SOM), a neural network model and data mining technique that could potentially offer tremendous benefits to digital forensics. The focus {{of this study is to}} demonstrate how the SOM can help digital investigators to make better decisions and conduct the forensic analysis process more efficiently and effectively during a digital investigation. The SOM’s visualisation capabilities can not only be used to reveal interesting patterns, but can also serve as a platform for further, interactive analysis.

40|$|Most <b>digital</b> <b>crimes</b> involve finding {{evidence}} on the computer and then linking this evidence to a suspect. This is usually done using login information from the computer.

40|$|Measuring {{how much}} {{cybercrime}} exists is typically done by first defining cybercrime and then quantifying how many cases fit that definition. The drawback is that definitions vary across countries and many cybercrimes are recorded as traditional crimes. An {{alternative is to}} keep traditional definitions of crime and quantify the amount of associated {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) that each contains. This research established how much ICT was used a) in the three phases of the ‘crime script’ (i. e. ‘before’, ‘during’ and ‘after’), b) during the criminal investigation and c) in the apprehension of the suspect(s) and d) whether <b>digital</b> <b>crimes</b> differ from traditional crimes in terms of the relationships between the victim and the offender or in terms of the physical distance between them. Residential and commercial burglary, threats and fraud were investigated and 809 incidents from the Police Department of East Netherlands were studied. It was found that ICT does not affect all ypes of crime equally: 16 % of the threats and 41 % of all frauds have partial digital modus operandi (MO). To commit burglaries, however, offenders hardly ever use ICT. In 2. 9 % of the residential burglaries, however, bank cards were stolen and later used to steal money from a bank account. For commercial burglary there was no associated ICT. <b>Digital</b> <b>crimes</b> differ from traditional crimes in a number of ways: the geographical distance between the victim and the offender is larger; digital threats occur relatively more often between expartners and digital frauds occur more often between business partners compared to traditional fraud. The study found that physical tools are more often linked to apprehension than digital ones. The regression models, however, showed digital and physical tools to be equally strong at predicting apprehension. The main findings show that ICT plays a greater role in traditional crime than expected on the basis of previous research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{rapid growth}} of {{computer}} storage, new technologies, anti-forensics and hacking tools, as well as cheaper and easily accessible powerful computing equipment, has led to <b>digital</b> <b>crimes</b> becoming more frequent and often more sophisticated. These challenges have led to digital examinations becoming increasingly time-consuming and laborious, resulting in an urgent need for the automation of digital forensic analysis. In addition to in-depth analysis of particular digital devices, it is often necessary to establish that two devices and hence their owners are linked. This need arises, for example, when a suspect is apprehended and the investigator needs to establish grounds for the detention of a suspect. This paper proposes a methodology and a software solution to automate the detection of information linkage between two or more distinct digital devices...|$|R
