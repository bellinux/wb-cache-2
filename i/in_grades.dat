Rats in Group B–D were given with 60 mg/kg streptozotocin through intraperitoneal injection. Rats in Group C were given with 100 mg/kg resveratrol and rats in Group D were given with 20 mg/kg resveratrol. The caspase– 3 expression levels and apoptosis ratios of LEC among each group were observed; the degrees of lens opacity in Group B–D after 12 weeks were compared. ResultsThere were significant differences in caspase– 3 expression levels, apoptosis ratios of LEC among groups at 4 w, 8 w and 12 w (P< 0. 05). After 12 weeks, in Group B the degree of lens opacity was as follow: 0 (0. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> I, 3 (37. 50 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> II, 2 (25. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> III, 2 (25. 00 %) grade IV, and 1 (12. 50 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> V; <b>in</b> Group C: 2 (25. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> I, 4 (50. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> II, 2 (25. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> III, 0 (0. 00 %) grade IV, and 0 (0. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> V; <b>in</b> Group D: 1 (12. 50 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> I, 4 (50. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> II, 2 (25. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> III, 1 (12. 50 %) grade IV, and 0 (0. 00 %) <b>in</b> <b>grade</b> V.
