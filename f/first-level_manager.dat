40|$|Corporate {{leadership}} training programmes designed for <b>first-level</b> <b>managers</b> generally include sessions on communication. However, these are often limited to themes such as performance management and influencing staff. Experienced <b>first-level</b> <b>managers</b> {{may also be}} responsible for developing novice managers yet they generally receive no training {{in the types of}} interpersonal and communicative skills that accompany this educational role. This paper asks how this educational role is performed in the workplace. Drawing on interactional data collected from one Global 500 organisation, the paper uses discourse analysis to identify the interpersonal skills and discursive resources deployed by one supervising manager as she prepares a novice for his new role and responsibilities. The paper also examines the supervising manager's own self-reflexive discourse, exploring the characteristics that make her an effective 'educator'. Finally, the paper represents the repertoire of discursive resources deployed by this supervising manager in her educational role as a two-dimensional communicative model to promote interest in discourse-based training and development, and to stimulate further research. 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{enactment}} of safety routines in a transshipment port. Research on work safety and reliability has largely neglected the role of the workers’ knowledge in practice in the enactment of organisational safety. Theworkers’ lack of compliance with safety regulations represents an enduring problem that often involves <b>first-level</b> <b>managers,</b> who are willing to turn a blind eye toward divergent practices. The CHAT conceptual vocabulary and theoretical model is used to explore this issu...|$|R
40|$|Organizations {{that include}} a manufacturing, {{assembly}} and/or material processing (MAMP) functions have become increasingly complex, competitive, and dynamic. These organizations demand increased emphasis on recruiting, developing, and retaining management talent to gain a competitive edge. This paper uses a modified Delphi triangulation approach to identify and categorize first-level MAMP management competencies perceived to be important by three critical stakeholder groups – an expert MAMP upper management panel, <b>first-level</b> MAMP <b>managers</b> who have been employed between one to three years, and business management faculty members. The results identify 14 knowledge, skill, and value-based competencies and three higher-order factors as essential components within the MAMP management function. There was considerable consistency in {{the perceptions of the}} three groups in evaluating the importance of these competencies, with the exception that <b>first-level</b> <b>managers</b> placed greater importance on technical skills for daily MAMP activities than upper management...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{appraisal}} {{ratings of}} 125 <b>first-level</b> <b>managers</b> were analyzed {{to investigate the}} degree to which the criteria used to evaluate the overall job performance of black managers differs from that used to evaluate white managers. The performance appraisal form included items that measured both the social behavior dimen-sion and task/goal accomplishment dimension of job performance. The appraisal ratings of both groups on each dimension were correlated with measures of overall job performance and promot-ability. Results indicated that social behavior factors are more highly correlated with the overall job performance of black ratees than for white ratees. Implications of these results for both black managers and organizations are discussed. There is considerable evidence to suggest that although good progress has been made in the representation of blacks in entry-level management positions, there con-tinues to be little progress in movement of black man-agers to positions of significant authority and respon...|$|R
40|$|Are {{organizational}} {{factors that}} support entrepreneurial action supportive for all? We use the literatures on corporate entrepreneurship and managerial levels {{to propose that}} managers differ in structural ability {{to make the most}} of their organizational environment. Using a sample 458 managers and moderated Poisson regression analysis we found that the relationship between managers' perceptions of the organizational environment and the number of entrepreneurial ideas implemented varied across managers of different structural levels. Specifically, (1) the positive relationship between managerial support and entrepreneurial action is more positive for senior and middle level managers than it is for lower- (first) level managers, and (2) the positive relationship between work discretion and entrepreneurial action is more positive for senior and middle level managers than it is for <b>first-level</b> <b>managers.</b> These findings suggest that managerial level provides a structural ability to "make more of" organizational factors that support entrepreneurial action.

40|$|Excerpt} Social {{exchange}} theory {{sheds light}} on the reciprocal relationship between perceptions of an organization’s enabling environment, capacity, and organizational motivation and staff willingness to maximize individual and collective performance. Yet, until recently, human resource specialists introduced cleaner, whiter, or more “colory” practices by administrative circular or order, typically after a modicum of consultation. Top-, middle-, and <b>first-level</b> <b>managers</b> would enforce adherence to the line. Organizations are communities, the members of which want worthwhile jobs that inspire them. Naturally, a committed and willing workforce brings substantial benefits. Some time ago, we recognized that formal relationships cannot by themselves be expected to conduce these entirely: implicit employer–employee exchanges matter. Belatedly, we concede that perceptions of an organization’s rules, ethos, and capabilities, not just the experience staff have of human resource practices, drive levels of effort and associated degrees of job satisfaction. More and more, organizations say {{they are looking for}} win–win solutions that match their needs with those of personnel: they examine the question of motivation with a fresh sense of purpose and conviction. Better still, high-performance organizations marshal and direct substantial resources to build effective behaviors and relationships, often in concert with human resource divisions. Engaging staff has come of age: in the 21 st century, the concept affirms the importance of flexibility, change, and unremitting improvement in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the impact of resources, accountability, {{management}} practices and organisational culture on the implementation of a policy (in this case, a domestic violence policy/program) within an Australian state police department. The paper argues that successful implementation requires a synergy between the established goals and beliefs, the level of resources and accountability provided to support the implementation process, and a performance-based rather than process-oriented type of management practice. The findings suggest that successful implementation of policies requires that senior and lower managers must be in congruence in relation to the stated goals and objectives of a new policy. This is because the role of senior managers is to determine the goals and resources that accompany a new policy. On the other hand, if <b>first-level</b> <b>managers</b> perceive a lack of synergy between a written policy and the supporting implementation variables (funding), then it is likely that, {{to the extent that they}} have power, they will use it to maintain the status quo. A limitation of the study is that the implementation of only one program was examined and it is hoped that future research is able to further generalise these findings. The implication of these findings for police management is that the past method of increasing accountability to ensure the successful implementation of an under-resourced policy is unlikely to be successful. This is because of the unwritten cultural messages (about the real agenda of a policy) that flow through the hierarchy when a new policy is not accompanied by adequate resources â especially if the police culture is unsympathetic to the goals of the policy...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find factors {{affecting}} employees' organizational commitment within the case organization as well as point out some strengths and weaknesses the company has in this area. The company studied is Finnish multinational industrial company. The sample of this qualitative study consisted of nine Finnish <b>first-level</b> <b>managers</b> from different segments of this company. The data was collected using theme interviews and qualitative attitude approach. Therefore, the analysis was also conducted in two separate ways. The data from theme interviews was analyzed using thematic content analysis while the analysis of the data from qualitative attitude approach followed the principles of that method concentrating on explanations of stance taking. As a result of this study, the factors affecting the organizational commitment in this organization can be divided into three categories. The first one consist matters directly linked to the company itself. The second category has factors linked to the work community. Finally, the third is formed by factors related to the work characteristics. Company's strengths lie in its' interesting field of business and variety opportunities it can offer for employees globally. To improve organizational commitment it should pay attention to its' human resource practices. From the findings it can be stated that employees' organizational commitment is a complex matter. Even though the company has important role in it, the factors regarding the organization are not only ones affecting this. It was strongly indicated that the work community and the characteristics of one's work has major impact on one's organizational commitment. However, organization and the culture create the premises for these to be good...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{leadership}} {{research has}} focused on managers’ characteristics and behavior, their leadership style and its implications for a business’s success. In contrast, this dissertation examines how working conditions in the workplace affect first-level managers’ everyday work, their possibilities to practice leadership, and consequently their leadership style. The theoretical framework guiding the dissertation is a gender analysis with a doing gender perspective and the methodology is a case study. Two workplace organizations in a Swedish municipality are studied: a male-dominated manufacturing industry and a female-dominated elderly care service. The empirical materials consist of twenty-six semi-structured interviews, primarily with male and female <b>first-level</b> <b>managers,</b> but also with their immediate supervisors. In addition, the materials include a questionnaire and organizational documents. The results show that organizational structure and culture have implications for managers’ working conditions and consequently the leadership style they are willing and able to implement. The sex ratio among employees did not have any implications for which type of leadership informants described in their everyday practices. The ideal leadership and the everyday leadership practices portrayed by informants entail being explicit, controlling and rational managers who are able to make decisions and carry forth extensive structural changes. Their narratives reveal an authoritarian and task-oriented leadership style that has its roots in early industrialism. Leadership is strongly marked by masculinity, and even though women and men describe practicing the same type of leadership in their everyday work, their ideas about gender depict two complete opposites in which women and femininity is subordinated to men and masculinity. This indicates a divergence between the gender we think and the gender we do. Nonetheless, sex ratio among employees has implications for the level of sexism. While informants in both workplace organizations described gender discrimination, only those in the manufacturing industry described experiencing sexual harassment...|$|R
