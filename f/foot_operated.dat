25|$|The Mears Newz was {{published}} by Swift Lathers, its founder and editor. Lathers was well-skilled in English and grammar, benefiting from training by his mother, an English teacher. Lathers worked as a stringer for a Detroit newspaper, where he grew to dislike the constant editing of his writing by others. He was then motivated {{to start his own}} newspaper where no one else could edit his writing. Moving from the Detroit area to Mears in 1909, Lathers started The Mears News (he initially spelled the word News in the name with an s) and believed it was his life's calling to report on items related to Mears, his adopted hometown. His simple meager lifestyle sacrificed personal financial gain to keep his newspaper going. Lathers wrote all his own stories and reports. He printed the newspapers on a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> printing press. Lathers would hand deliver the newspapers himself locally.|$|E
2500|$|Control of the Aircar {{was also}} unusual. [...] A column mounted wheel moved the ailerons and {{fore and aft}} motion of the column {{operated}} the elevators as normal. [...] Turns were made by banking. The trim tab on the fin compensated for propeller torque and was directly linked to the throttle. Instead of a rudder bar, a pedal operated the flaps used for takeoff and landing. [...] The wheel brakes were also <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> and the nosewheel was steered with the control column wheel. At takeoff, the flaps were initially retracted and the aircraft accelerated; at the appropriate speed the flaps were lowered and the Aircar left the ground. With elevators up this [...] "zoom" [...] was rapid but ended in level flight, whilst with them down the zoom was gentler {{and turned into a}} steady climb. [...] Landings were made from a low speed approach with flaps extended; throttled back, the Aircar adopted a horizontal attitude, the elevator only controlling the sink rate.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{retrospective}} study of 25 <b>feet</b> <b>operated</b> for an overriding second toe deformity, {{whether or not}} associated with hallux valgus deformity and metatarsalgia. The surgical technique of a medial sliding and decompressive Weil osteotomy is described. All patients, operated between January 2002 and December 2007 for this condition in our institution, were reviewed clinically and radiologically. The mean AOFAS score improved with 47. 6 points from 45. 9 to 93. 5. The theoretical advantages of such a translation Weil osteotomy are discussed trying to clarify the previously described pathologic anatomy of this condition...|$|R
40|$|Between 1977 and 1992, 42 {{patients}} were seen who had 51 <b>feet</b> <b>operated</b> upon for bunions {{in which the}} surgery failed. A total of 105 procedures were done on these 51 feet until the patients either achieved satisfactory cor-rection (N = 28) or they declined (N = 14) further surgery. An analysis of these failures and review of literature revealed 12 anatomic variations and 7 secondary factors that were seen in association with surgical failure. These findings were correlated with published criteria and our experience with various bunion procedures to advance general indications and contraindications for specific bunion procedures...|$|R

5000|$|Like drummers {{from other}} rock music genres, metal drummers use a drum kit, a {{collection}} of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player with drumsticks held in both hands and the <b>feet</b> <b>operating</b> pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. Many metal drummers extend their kits from the basic [...] "snare drum, bass drum, toms and cymbals" [...] pattern, adding more drums, more cymbals, and many other instruments. In some styles of music particular extensions are normal, for example double bass drums in heavy metal music.|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to define}} the role and place of joint-sparing {{surgical}} interventions into the anterior foot in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Subject and methods. Eighty-six patients, the majority (n = 84) of young and middle-aged women, mainly with minimal disease activity, late-stage RA, and moderate limitation of functional capacity were examined and treated. One hundred and thirty arthrodeses of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ), 80 resections of {{the heads of the}} second-to-fifth metatarsal bones, and 58 Weil osteotomies were performed. Results. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to assess arthrodesis of the first MPJ and resection of the second-to-fifth metatarsal bones (n = 141). This comparison shows higher scores for the operated limb in the postoperative period, but these changes cannot suggest the complete function of the <b>feet</b> <b>operated</b> on. Arthrodesis of the first MPJ and Weil osteotomy of the second-to-the first metatarsal bones were assessed by the AOFAS scale (n = 141). While assessing this surgical technique versus the previous method, there was an increase in scores for the second-to-fifth toes to almost normal values, which is in favor of the practically complete function recovery in the <b>feet</b> <b>operated</b> on. Conclusion. The Weil-osteotomy group showed the preservation and partial salvage of osteotomized heads, which promoted the recovery of swinging function of the foot. The new procedures made it possible to prevent recurrent valgus and hammer toe deformities and callus formation in the late postoperative period, to improve quality of life, and to reduce the time of rehabilitation and the length of hospital stay...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{introduce}} {{a new set of}} modifications and present the results from 48 patients (a total of 60 <b>feet</b> <b>operated),</b> who underwent this modified Wilsonâs osteotomy for the correction of Hallux Valgus. Patients were of an average age of 52 years old (from 21 to 75 years of age) and were followed up for a mean of 12 months post-operatively. Patient evaluation was made with the symptom scoring system as presented by Kataraglis et al., with the final outcome being satisfactory in all of the cases. This set of modifications introduced to the original Wilsonâs osteotomy, proved to offer a stable, predictable and satisfactory outcome in all cases and we strongly recommend it...|$|R

50|$|The gearbox {{of the car}} {{was also}} novel, having dual {{epicyclic}} gears and being bolted directly to the engine. This allowed four speeds, with direct drive in top gear. All the gears were helical, and enclosed in an oil bath, making for very silent transmission. Reverse gear was built into the rear axle, as was the <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> brake drum, all of which was housed in a substantial aluminium casing.|$|E
50|$|Scissors or shears are hand {{operated}} cutting instruments. For people without hands, {{there is also}} the option of using a specially designed <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> style. They consist of a pair of metal blades connected {{in such a way that}} the blades meet and cut. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, thin plastic, cloth, rope, and wire. Scissors can also be used to cut hair and food.|$|E
50|$|The rear axle, {{like the}} gearbox and engine, was housed in an {{aluminium}} case. In {{addition to the}} normal function of providing a differential, it also provided the reverse gear, and contained the rear brake (<b>foot</b> <b>operated).</b> Reversing is achieved by changing which of the large bevel gears (these days known as crown wheels) engages with the drive {{on the end of}} the propshaft. Like the gearbox, all gears within the axle are helical cut.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{different}} surgical techniques to treat peroneal tendon dislocations, transposition of the peroneal tendons under the calcaneofibular ligament has been used at the Orthopadisches Spital of ViennaIAustria since 1975. The method was first described by Platzgummer in 1967. After dividing the calcaneofibular ligament and removing the fatty tissue {{in the space between}} this ligament, the pos-terior talofibular ligament, and the lateral capsule of the subtalar joint, the peroneal tendons are placed behind the lateral rnalleolus and under the calcaneofibular ligament, which is reconstructed by suture to create an efficient retainment. Of 17 <b>feet</b> <b>operated</b> on, 13 were available for follow-up in 12 patients. Dislocation was idiopathic in three and traumatic in 10 feet. Criteria for evaluation were patientâs satisfaction, absence of pain and swelling, and stability of tendon retention and of ankle and subtalar joints. Of the 13 <b>operated</b> <b>feet,</b> 11 showed an excellent result and two showed a good result. In the results graded as âgood, â occasional pain and swelling occurred in both feet of a patient belonging to the idiopathic group...|$|R
