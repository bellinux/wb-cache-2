As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher <b>emissivity</b> in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and <b>emissivity)</b> than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the universe, {{hydrogen}} is mostly {{found in the}} atomic and plasma states, with properties quite {{different from those of}} molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high <b>emissivity</b> (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift z=4.|$|E

25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There {{is no way of}} determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron <b>emissivity</b> may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given <b>emissivity</b> can have, but for many years there was no particular reason to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{suggests}} {{approaches to}} simulate scaling effects of thermal emission from non-isothermal pixels with a typical three-dimensional structure. We simulate effective <b>emissivities</b> of various V-shaped valleys by using our Monte Carlo method under the isothermal assumption. An analytical formula of the effective <b>emissivities</b> is derived based on photon rebounding between surfaces in the valleys. The {{comparison between the}} simulated and the analytically modelled effective <b>emissivities</b> shows that the analytical formula is highly accurate. After simulating effective <b>emissivities</b> of the V-shaped valley under several non-isothermal conditions, {{we find that the}} structure and component temperature difference of a pixel cause the scaling effects of thermal emission of the pixel. The results, therefore, prove that Planck’s law has to be corrected for remote sensing to estimate land surface temperature with high accuracy. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Emissivities</b> were {{calculated}} from the Nimbus 5 electrically scanning microwave radiometer (ESMR) over 25 km grid cells for the southern Great Plains includin the western two-thirds of Kansas and Oklahoma and northwest Texas. These <b>emissivities,</b> normalized for seasonal temperature changes, were in excellent agreement with theory and measurements made from aircraft and truck sensors at the 1. 55 cm wavelength of ESMR. These <b>emissivities</b> were related to crop moisture conditions of the winter wheat in the major wheat producing counties of the three states. High correlations were noted between emissitivity and an antecedent precipitation index (API) used to infer soil moisture for periods when the soils were essentially bare. The <b>emissivities</b> from ESMR were related through API and actual crop condition reports to progress of fall planting, adequacy of crop moisture for stand establishment, and periods of excessive moisture that necessitated replanting. Periods of prolonged frozen soil in the winter were observable at several grid points.

25|$|Certain {{pyrotechnic}} compositions, {{for example}} MTV, give a great flame emission upon combustion and yield a temperature-dependent signature {{and can be}} understood as gray bodies of high <b>emissivity</b> (~0.95). Such payloads are called blackbody payloads. Other payloads, like iron/potassium perchlorate pellets, only yield a low flame emission but also show temperature-dependent signature. Nevertheless, the lower combustion temperature as compared to MTV results in a lower amount of energy released in the short-wavelength IR range. Other blackbody payloads include ammonium perchlorate/anthracene/magnesium and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) binder.|$|E

In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured. It should be noted that an accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the <b>emissivity,</b> particularly its spectral and angular dependence.|$|E
