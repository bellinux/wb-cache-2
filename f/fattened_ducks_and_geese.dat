40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, {{investigations}} of Toxoplasma gondii infection in poultry (chickens, <b>ducks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese)</b> {{have been reported}} worldwide, including China. However, {{little is known about}} the prevalence of T. gondii infection in poultry in northeastern China. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine the prevalence of T. gondii infection in slaughtered chickens, <b>ducks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> in Shenyang, northeastern China. Methods In the present study, the seroprevalence of T. gondii in 502 adult chickens, 268 adult <b>ducks,</b> <b>and</b> 128 adult <b>geese</b> was surveyed using the modified agglutination test (MAT). Results The seroprevalences of T. gondii were 5. 8 %, 7. 8 %, and 4. 7 % in chickens, <b>ducks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese,</b> respectively. Prevalence was higher in free-range groups (11. 2 %, 12. 3 %, and 8. 9 %) than caged groups (4. 7 %, 7. 5 %, and 6. 0 %), and there was a statistically significant difference only between free-range chickens and caged chickens, but no significant difference was found between free-range <b>ducks,</b> <b>geese</b> <b>and</b> caged <b>ducks,</b> <b>geese.</b> Conclusions The present study shows the prescence of T. gondii infection in slaughtered chickens, <b>ducks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> in Shenyang, northeastern China, which suggests that consumption of poultry meat in Shenyang may pose a potential threat to human health and should be given attention. </p...|$|R

Bird flu virus in Europe – a hidden danger H 5 N 1 could become endemic {{in parts of the}} region – Virus search in domestic <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> crucial The avian influenza virus H 5 N 1 could become entrenched in poultry, <b>and</b> domestic <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> in parts of Europe, warns FAO. The agency stresses that healthy domestic <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> may transmit the virus to poultry and play a more important role in the persistence of the virus in the region than previously thought. H 5 N 1 surveillance in countries with significant domestic <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> populations should be urgently increased. FAO’s warning followed the detection of H 5 N 1 in diseased young domestic ducks by German scientists. Wild ducks {{at the mouth of the}} Danube New chapter “It seems that a new chapter in the evolution of avian influenza may be unfolding silently in the heart of Europe, ” says FAO’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Joseph Domenech. “If it turns out to be true that the H 5 N 1 virus can persist in apparently healthy domestic <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> populations, then countries need to urgently reinforce their monitoring and surveillance schemes in all regions with significant <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> production for the presence of H 5 N 1. ” “Europe should prepare for further waves of avian influenza outbreaks, most probably in an east-west direction, if the virus succeeds in persisting throughout the year in domestic waterfowl. This heightens the need for increased surveillance and monitoring of possible virus circulation in domestic <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> geese,” Domenech adds. cont’d on Page...|$|R
