25|$|Derek Gregory argues {{the long}} {{trajectory}} through history of British and American colonization {{is an ongoing}} process still <b>happening</b> <b>today.</b> In The Colonial Present, Gregory traces connections between the geopolitics of events happening in modern-day Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq and links {{it back to the}} us-and-them binary relation between the Western and Eastern world. Building upon the ideas of the other and Said's work on orientialism, Gregory critiques the economic policy, military apparatus, and transnational corporations as vehicles driving present day colonialism. Emphasizing ideas of discussing ideas around colonialism in the present tense, Gregory utilizes modern events such as the September 11 attacks to tell spatial stories around the colonial behavior happening due to the War on Terror.|$|E

2500|$|Hanson {{has argued}} that China is an {{increasingly}} aggressive power that is set upon eventually dominating East Asia.

Hanson claimed that Japan, {{as a result of}} late nineteenth-century Meiji era reforms, had become powerful {{at the same time the}} United States had temporarily retreated into isolationism which allowed Japan to embark upon an imperialistic foreign policy; that the same thing was <b>happening</b> <b>today</b> with China and the United States under the leadership of Barack Obama. Along these lines, Hanson has cited China for attempting to create its version of [...] "Greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere", which would incorporate all of East Asia.|$|E
