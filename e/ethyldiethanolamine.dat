40|$|Nitrogen mustards are {{a public}} health concern because of their extreme {{vesicant}} properties and the possible exposure of workers during the destruction of chemical stockpiles. A sensitive, rapid, accurate, and precise analysis for the quantitation of ultratrace levels of N. <b>ethyldiethanolamine</b> (EDEA) and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) in human urine {{as a means of}} assessing recent exposure to the nitrogen mustards bis(2 -chloroethyl) ethylamine and bis(2 -chloroethyl) methylamine, respectively, was developed. The method was based on solid-phase extraction, followed by analysis of the urine extract using isotope-dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with TurbolonSpray ~ ionization and multiple-reaction monitoring. The method limits of detection were 0. 41 ng/ml, for EDEA and 0. 96 ng/ml, for MDEA in I mt of urine with coefficients of variation < 10 % for both compounds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the {{formation}} rates of chemical species such as CO 3 /HCO 3, amine/protonated amine, and carbonate/protonated carbonate {{in the course of}} CO 2 absorption at room temperature and concentration changes after CO 2 release upon heating at 93 Â°C for 30 min for aqueous solutions of 12 kinds of tertiary alkanolamines using 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. A positive linear correlation was found between the CO 2 capture rates of alkanolamines having a normal hydroxyalkyl group and their pKa values. The CO 2 capture rates of alkanolamines having a branched hydroxyalkyl group were lower than those in this relationship. The CO 2 release amount of each tertiary amine increased with decreasing pKa, as a general trend. N- <b>ethyldiethanolamine</b> (EDEA) showed the largest CO 2 release amount and a moderately high rate of CO 2 absorption...|$|E
