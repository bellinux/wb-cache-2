The phenomenon of small arms and light weapons (SALW) proliferation owes to historical factors, porous borders, and the prevalence of regional armed conflicts that offer markets for <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> and is compounded by poor arms management and control measures within the region. The effects of SALW on the social, economic, and political arenas in Uganda and in other {{states in the region}} are enormous. Ad hoc measures and the lack of regional consensus in implementation allow <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> to <b>flow</b> to homegrown terrorists. Although not the only cause of homegrown terrorism, SALW have remained a significant driver in creating a fragile security environment in which homegrown terrorism thrives. This thesis addresses the causes and effects of SALW proliferation in Uganda and the Great Lakes region. Specifically, it explores the nexus between homegrown terrorism and SALW proliferation. The study concludes by providing policy recommendations to combat homegrown terrorism and the effects of SALW proliferation in Uganda and the Great Lakes region. Major, Ugandan Arm...|$|R

40|$|Surveying {{public opinion}} In July 2006, {{following}} {{a series of}} crossborder incursions by Hezbollah into Israeli territory and the capture of two Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) personnel, Israel initiated a 24 -day bombing campaign in Southern Lebanon. 1 During the campaign, Israel fired more than 100, 000 shells from land and sea positions, destroying much of Southern Lebanon’s physical infrastructure and displacing an estimated one million civilians. 2 An initial estimate put the number of Lebanese deaths—mostly civilian—at between 1, 000 and 1, 200, with more than 4, 000 additional nonfatal casualties. In response, Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets into Northern Israel, killing dozens of Israeli civilians and wounding hundreds more. 3 The 2006 war was the most serious encounter between Israeli forces and Hezbollah since the latter’s formal establishment in 1985, raising a number of critical questions about security and arms holdings in Southern Lebanon. While Hezbollah was the de facto security provider in Southern Lebanon, it was unclear {{the extent to which}} their military actions were supported by the local population, or whether the 2006 war in fact increased southerners’ favourable perception of Hezbollah. Further, although knowledge of <b>illicit</b> <b>arms</b> <b>flows</b> to Hezbollah was widespread, the conflict was the first significant, extended engagement in which the extent of Hezbollah’s weapons capacity and reach was revealed. How would the conflict affect further weapons procurement by armed groups and individuals in Southern Lebanon? Quantitative and qualitative research on arms, armed groups, and security provision in Southern Lebanon is extremely limited.
