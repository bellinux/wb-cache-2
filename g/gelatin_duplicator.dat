Materials and Methods: Forty circular patterns were made with an elastic <b>gelatin</b> <b>duplicator.</b> These were divided into four groups (n = 10) for pouring the investment: G 1, Begoform (Bego); G 2, Ducera Lay Superfit (DeguDent GmbH); G 3, Duravest (Polidental), and G 4, Refrax Magnum (CNG). Refractory dies were subjected to the degassing process for gas and metal oxide elimination, and the testing was done with the application of two layers of VM 7 ceramic. These layers were sinterized in accordance with the manufacturer′s recommendation and then glazed. For the control group, 10 additional VM 7 ceramic discs were made without the use of any investment die. The ceramic′s control color and the tested groups were analyzed with the aid of a portable colorimeter (Minolta CR- 10) in the CIELab. The color change (ΔE) of the specimens from the tested groups was obtained, and the data were submitted to one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey′s test. Results: All tested groups had a color change from the control group. G 1 (5, 3) and G 2 (5, 3) were those that showed the greater color change and did not show statistical differences between themselves; G 3 (3, 3) and G 4 (3, 1) were those that showed the least color change from control group and did not show statistical differences between themselves. Conclusion: Once all investments present a perceptible color change from the control group, color selection should be done with a laboratory-produced color scale...|$|E
