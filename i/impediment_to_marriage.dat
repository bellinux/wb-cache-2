2500|$|In {{the midst}} of Lanfranc's {{scholastic}} and controversial activities Lanfranc became a political force. Later tradition told {{that while he was}} Prior of Bec he opposed the non-canonical marriage of Duke William with Matilda of Flanders (1053) and carried matters so far that he incurred a sentence of exile. But the quarrel was settled {{when he was on the}} point of departure, and he undertook the difficult task of obtaining the pope’s approval of the marriage. In this he was successful at the same council which witnessed his third victory over Berengar (1059), and he thus acquired a lasting claim on William's gratitude. In assessing this story it may well be relevant that no reputable source can tell what the exact <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> was. In 1066 Lanfranc became the first Abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Étienne at [...] Caen in Normandy, a monastery dedicated to Saint Stephen which the duke had supposedly been enjoined to found as a penance for his disobedience to the Holy See.|$|E
60|$|The other matter {{concerned}} his matrimonial affairs. No sooner did he {{find himself}} King of France than he applied to Rome for {{the dissolution of}} his marriage with Jeanne de Valois, the daughter of Louis XI. The grounds he urged were threefold: Firstly, between himself and Jeanne there existed a relationship of the fourth degree and a spiritual affinity, resulting {{from the fact that}} her father, Louis XI, had held him at the baptismal font--which before the Council of Trent did constitute an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> Secondly, he had not been a willing party to the union, but had entered into it as a consequence of intimidation from the terrible Louis XI, who had threatened his life and possessions if not obeyed in this. Thirdly, Jeanne laboured under physical difficulties which rendered her incapable of maternity.|$|E

40|$|Legal {{provisions}} on interfaith marriages offer {{a privileged}} observation {{point on the}} interaction of different legal systems {{in a context of}} migrations, minorities, and law and religion. Even within the Muslim communities in Scotland, predominantly South Asian, multiple and fluid identities compete and seek different arrangements within a legal system that refuses to consider elements of Islamic law as law, or relevant <b>to</b> law. <b>Impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> by disparity of faith can be a good case in point, and open up the debate on the boundaries of competing definitions of law. This paper explores the adaptation and transmigration of Islamic regulations on interfaith marriages among the Muslim communities in Scotland. Islamic <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> by disparity of faith have somehow guaranteed the religious endogamic principle in Muslim-majority contexts; what happens when borders are crossed and South Asian communities find themselves in a Scottish context? In order to follow this adaptation and transmigration, we need to embark on a journey through time and space. I suggest to depart from the single rule on interfaith marriages produced by modernity (I), follow a leisurely meander along the modern/classical divide (II), tour the welcoming highlands of Scots law (III), and observe how our modern rule has taken root in quite a distinct environment (IV), before landing with some super-hybrid final considerations (V) ...|$|R
50|$|While the Council of Trent is {{best known}} as a Counter-Reformation Council, neither the Lutheran Church nor the Church of England broke with the Roman Catholic Church on the {{requirement}} of publication of banns (or the equivalent) before marriage.

The break between some Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church was over what would constitute an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> (the Church of England, for example, recognised remarriage after divorce in some circumstances), rather than over the means by which impediments to marriage should be identified.|$|E

5000|$|In Catholic canon law, the {{impediment}} of raptus specifically prohibits {{marriage between}} a woman abducted {{with the intent}} to force her to marry, and her abductor, as long as the woman remains in the abductor's power.

50|$|Canon law {{stipulates}} canonical <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage.</b> A diriment <b>impediment</b> prevents {{a marriage}} from being validly contracted {{at all and}} renders the union a putative marriage, while a prohibitory impediment renders a marriage valid but not licit. The union resulting is called a putative marriage. An invalid marriage may be subsequently convalidated, either by simple convalidation (renewal of consent that replaces invalid consent) or by sanatio in radice ("healing in the root", the retroactive dispensation from a diriment impediment). Some impediments may be dispensed from, while those de jure divino (of divine law) may not be dispensed.|$|R
40|$|The <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the {{contracting}} {{of marriage}} are those circumstances expressly stipulated {{by the law}} whose existence incapacitates the contracting of marriage.

However, the provisions in the Civil Code only bring under regulation as an impediment the prohibition of marriage between the persons who suffer from temporary lack of judgment. Art. 277 paragraph 3 in the Civil Code stipulates the prohibition of the civil partnerships between people of different or same sex. the Family Code, the new Civil Code, <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> the contracting of marriage, the existence of a previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the prohibition of marriage between blood relatives; the prohibition of marriage between relatives by adoption; the prohibition of marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; the prohibition of marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; the prohibition of marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; the prohibition of same-sex marriage...|$|R
25|$|In {{the modern}} State of Israel, the law {{concerning}} matters of marriage, divorce, and personal status, is partially {{under the jurisdiction}} of religious courts. For example, there is no civil marriage in Israel. The Jewish religious regulations concerning mamzerim are thus also the national laws imposed on Jews living in Israel, including secular Jews. Because of the severe <b>impediments</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> which mamzer status accords in Jewish law, Israeli civil law has taken the position that the paternity of a child born within a marriage cannot legally be challenged in civil courts, in order to avoid creating a body of evidence that might be used to declare the child a mamzer, or create difficulties for a future marriage.|$|R
50|$|One {{particular}} theory {{mentioned by}} Peter Parkes is an Arab folk-analogy that breast milk {{is supposed to}} be “transformed male semen” that arises from Hertiers Somatic Scheme. There is no evidence that Arabs ever considered a mother's milk to be ‘transformed sperm’. Another suggested analogy is that breast milk was a refinement of uterine blood. It is also suggested since that milk is of the woman, her moods and dispositions are transferred through the breast milk. Parkes mentions that milk-kinship was “further endorsed as a canonical <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> by several eastern Christian churches”. This indicates that this procedure was widely practiced among numerous religious communities, not just Islamic communities, in the early modern Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The {{applicants}} are a same-sex couple {{living in}} Vienna, Austria. On 10 September 2002 they requested the Office for matters of Personal Status (Standesamt) {{to proceed with}} the formalities to enable them to contract marriage. By decision of 20 December 2002 the Vienna Municipal Office (Magistrat) refused the applicants’ request. Referring to Article 44 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch), it held that marriage could only be contracted between two persons of opposite sex. According to constant case-law, a marriage concluded by two persons of the same sex was null and void. Since the applicants were two men, they lacked the capacity for contracting marriage.The applicants then lodged an appeal with the Vienna Regional Governor (Landeshauptmann), which was also dismissed. In his decision of 11 April 2003, the Governor confirmed the Municipal Office’s legal view. In addition he referred to the Administrative Court’s (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) case-law according to which it constituted an <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> if the two persons concerned were of the same sex.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Second Lateran Council (1139) {{seems to}} have enacted the first written law making sacred orders a diriment <b>impediment</b> <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> for the {{universal}} Church." [...] Celibacy was first required of some clerics in 1123 at the First Lateran Council. Because clerics resisted it, the celibacy mandate was restated at the Second Lateran Council (1139) and the Council of Trent (1545-64). In places, coercion and enslavement of clerical wives and children was apparently involved in {{the enforcement of the}} law. “The earliest decree in which the children clerics were declared to be slaves and never to be enfranchised freed {{seems to have}} been a canon of the Synod of Pavia in 1018. Similar penalties were promulgated against wives and concubines (see the Synod of Melfi, 1189 can.
