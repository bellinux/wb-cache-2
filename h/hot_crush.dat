The {sup 182 }W isotope provides a tag {{for the analysis of}} neutron resonance line shape from which the temperature may be calculated. The material was specified to have 1. 8 atom percent W, with W-rich regions no larger than 1 {micro}m in size. Both the composition and W distribution were critical to the experiment. Another challenge to the processing was the very small quantity of {sup 182 }W material available for the synthesis of the alloy. Therefore, limited fabrication routes were available for evaluation. Several synthesis and processing routes were explored to fabricate the required alloy components. First, precipitation of W onto Mo powder using ammonium metatungstate was investigated for powder synthesis followed by uniaxial hot pressing. Second, mechanical alloying (MA) followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and warm forging was attempted. Finally, arc-melting techniques followed by either <b>hot</b> rolling or <b>crushing</b> the alloyed button into powder and consolidation were pursued. The results of the processing routes and characterization of the materials produced will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect of {{tailoring}} the properties of a <b>hot</b> stamped axial <b>crush</b> rail consisting of a top hat cross-section on its crash response. The tailored hot stamping (THS) process is considered, in which the forming tool is partitioned into zones that are either cooled or heated. The local die temperature controls the quench rate within the part, such that the formed part will have zones of differing hardness (strength) and ductility levels. In the current work, four configurations of THS rails were formed: a non-tailored configuration using conventional room temperature tooling and three tailored configurations in which one-half of the rail was quenched while the other half was formed in tooling that was heated at different temperatures (in the range 400 - 700 ˚C). Micro-hardness measurements confirmed that THS {{can be used to}} form an axial crush member that contains tailored properties along its length. The asformed parts exhibited a Vickers hardness of ~ 475 HV in zones formed in cooled tooling, ~ 280 HV in zones formed in tooling that was heated to 400 ˚C and ~ 215 HV in zones that were formed when the die set was heated to 700 ˚C. The formed parts were then welded in pairs along their flanges and axially crushed under dynamic and quasi-static conditions. The non-tailored, fully hardened components did absorb the highest energy (25. 8 kJ), but exhibited extensive tearing and fracture. The force-displacement and energy absorption curves from the crush experiments showed that the tailored configurations absorbed less energy (21. 6 - 25. 7 kJ), but were less susceptible to buckling and had excellent repeatability in its crash response. Tailored regions with higher temperature tooling and/or graded tooling temperature distributions exhibited the least damage and absorbed the highest energy amongst the tailored configurations. Numerical models of the THS process and subsequent crash response were developed using the Åkerström material model in LS-Dyna to model the forming and the constitutive models of Bardelcik et al. to simulate the crash behavior. The predicted micro-hardness distributions in the components with bainite or martensite as-formed phases were very accurate (usually within 10 %), whereas predictions for ferrite-containing components were within 15 % of the measured hardness. The crash models were able to accurately predict the energy absorption of rails that were formed in cooled and 400 ˚C tooling. They were less accurate for dynamic crush of rails that contained ferrite. Overall, tailoring was found to {{have a positive effect on}} the energy absorption of a <b>hot</b> stamped axial <b>crush</b> member. Future work should focus on improving the hot stamping and crash models so they can accurately account for {{the effect of}} ferrite. Furthermore, a non-axial, angled offset crush should also be performed to more thoroughly investigate the effects of tailoring...|$|R

Sunstreaker ignored Hot Rod's warning about Scorponok's army and stormed into {{the building}} so Hot Rod painfully wired himself to send a distress signal. When Sunstreaker's real head was later disabled by Hunter, the Headmaster clones shut down, which Hot Rod explained to Grimlock. The group was surprised by the arrival of Shockwave, but Ultra Magnus had heard Hot Rod's distress call and {{was on his way to}} Earth. After Scorponok knocked out Sludge and Grimlock tended to him, the remaining Dynobots offered Hot Rod a lift aboard the Monsterbots' ship. He refused though, and made it back into Machination HQ to take care of something [...] "personal". He eventually found Scorponok's real head. Hunter also showed up and let Hot Rod know how to disable it, but before he could do so, Scorponok grabbed him. Before Scorponok could <b>crush</b> <b>Hot</b> Rod's head, the Dynobots showed up and began to battle Scorponok. Hot Rod told Swoop which wires to sever, and he did just that, reducing Scorponok to a catatonic state. Ultra Magnus arrived took everyone back aboard his ship, which later docked with the Ark-32. Within 3 days, Hot Rod was fully repaired, with a new body form design.|$|R

The oil contained in the most readily processed UOF's being properly <b>hot</b> drained and <b>crushed</b> is approximately 12 % to 14 % by weight. This oil will be pyrolized {{at a rate of}} 98 % resulting in additional fuel gas of 68 % and a condensable hydrocarbon fraction of 30 %, with the remaining 2 % resulting as carbon being added into the burden. Based upon the writer's collected information and assessment, {{there appears to be no}} operational problems relating to the recycling of UOF's to the blast furnace. One steel plant in the US has been routinely charging UOF's at about 100 tons to 200 tons per month for many years. Extensive analysis and calculations appear to indicate no toxic consideration as a result of the pyrolysis of the small contained oil (in the 'prepared' UOFs) within the blast furnace. However, a hydrocarbon condensate in the ''gasoline'' fraction will condense in the blast furnace scrubber water and may require additional processing the water treatment system to remove benzene and toluene from the condensate. Used oil filters represent an additional source of high quality iron units that may be effectively added to the charge of a blast furnace for beneficial value to the operator and to the removal of this resource from landfills...|$|R

I know of women now inhabiting palaces, waited on at every turn by servants, with carriages, horses, jewels, laces, Cashmeres, enough for princesses, who are eaten up by care. One lies awake all night on account of a wrinkle in the waist of her dress; another is dying because no silk of a certain inexpressible shade {{is to be found}} in New York; a third has had a dress sent home, which has proved such a failure that life seems no longer worth having. If it were not for the consolations of religion, one doesn't know what would become of her. The fact is, that care and labor are as much {{correlated}} to human existence as shadow is to light; there is no such thing as excluding them from any mortal lot. You may make a canary-bird or a gold-fish live in absolute contentment without a care or labor, but a human being you cannot. Human beings are restless and active in their very nature, and will do something, and that something will prove a care, a labor, and a fatigue, arrange it how you will. As long as there is anything to be desired and not yet attained, so long its attainment will be attempted; so long as that attainment is doubtful or difficult, so long will there be care and anxiety. When boundless wealth releases woman from every family care, she immediately makes herself a new set of cares in another direction, and has just as many anxieties as the most toilful housekeeper, only they are of a different kind. Talk of labor, and look at the upper classes in London or in New York in the fashionable season. Do any women work harder? To rush from crowd to crowd all night, night after night, seeing what they are tired of, making the agreeable over an abyss of inward yawning, crowded, jostled, breathing <b>hot</b> air, and <b>crushed</b> in halls and stairways, without a moment of leisure for months and months, till brain and nerve and sense reel, and the country is longed for as a period of resuscitation and relief! Such is the release from labor and fatigue brought by wealth. The only thing that makes all this labor at all endurable is, that it is utterly and entirely useless, and does no good to any one in creation; this alone makes it genteel, and distinguishes it from the vulgar toils of a housekeeper. These delicate creatures, who can go to three or four parties a night for three months, would be utterly desolate if they had to watch one night in a sick-room; and though they can exhibit any amount of physical endurance and vigor in crowding into assembly rooms, and breathe tainted air in an opera-house with the most martyr-like constancy, they could not sit one half-hour in the close room where the sister of charity spends hours in consoling the sick or aged poor." ...|$|R
40|$|A natural {{pesticide}} from tephrosia Cue: When {{insect pests}} strike a crop, farmers like to act quickly, {{to prevent the}} whole crop being lost. Spraying a chemical pesticide is frequently their first thought, a way of hitting the problem hard and easing their fears of a lost harvest. But chemicals do have disadvantages. They are expensive, and farmers may have to travel some distance to buy them. They can also store up problems for future seasons, by killing the beneficial insects and soil organisms that help to maintain a healthy and productive field. There is also the danger to human health, if chemicals are used incorrectly, or without proper equipment. An alternative approach is for farmers {{to make their own}} environmentally friendly pesticides, using locally available plants and resources. For example, it is possible to kill aphids and caterpillars using a pesticide made from the leaves of a shrub which is found throughout Africa. Godfrey Kiyoge, training manager at the Katende Harambee Training Centre in Kampala, explained more to Pius Sawa. IN:	?If we want to say kill aphids ? OUT:	? they are environmentally friendly. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 34 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Godfrey Kiyoge, explaining the benefits of a natural pesticide made using leaves of the tephrosia plant. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Kigoye	If we want to say kill aphids, we want to kill caterpillars that always attack our cabbages and other crops, you can only go and get tephrosia. Tephrosia {{is a kind of a}} shrub which grows there in the field. So you just get the leaves, you crush them, you measure the amount that you have got. If we have got, say, one jug of crushed tephrosia, you put in five jugs of water. That is enough, do not further dilute. Then you get five hundred grams of <b>hot</b> chilli, you <b>crush</b> it, you boil it to the boiling point, then remove it from the fire. You get a piece of soap, thirty grams of soap, equivalent to a matchbox. This time we do not use blue soap which is acidic, we just use yellow soap, laundry soap, and then you dissolve it in the solution, you leave it to cool, then you spray on crops. Sawa	And can you say this tephrosia is available everywhere in Africa where any rural farmer can access it? Kigoye	I can say in Africa here, tephrosia is everywhere and is a shrub which grows in the bush there. Sawa	And how long does it take to prepare this chemical? Kigoye	To prepare this it takes only 30 to 50 minutes but because we lack preservatives it takes two days and then it expires. Sawa	Which means a farmer in a rural place can manufacture a pesticide in the morning and he uses it within two days? Kigoye	Within two days, yes, he can or she can use it. We are trying, we are doing research to see how we can preserve the pesticide for a longer period of time. We have come up with a solution, we can use bottlebrush in Luganda they call it nyamba laztonya If you add in that bottlebrush it can last something like five days or more, but we are still doing more research on this so that we can get a pesticide that can last maybe two weeks. Sawa	And what amount of pesticide should one spray on a crop? Kigoye	Amount, I can say it depends on the size of the crop. If it?s a cabbage you just need something like a 100 mls. Sometimes also we can use local ways because some farmers could not afford to buy spray pumps or what. So you can get a broom and than you dip it in the solution and then you sprinkle on the plant. When you are doing that, you make sure that, you know some of these insects hide inside the leaves. They are not on top, they know that they are thieves. So when you are spraying, you just apply at the behind side of the leaf so that you can kill the aphids and other caterpillars. These animals or insects they are categorised in three. We have the chewing pests, we have the sucking pests and then we have the stinging pests. So when you are applying this kind of solution you have to understand what type of pests are attacking the crops. If it?s a stinging pest, they always attack or they always hide inside the leaves and they always stick on the leaves so what you do you just smear or you just sprinkle. You put the leaves upside down and then you sprinkle the solution. Sawa	How many times should you keep on applying to the crop? Kigoye	It depends on, if it is a rainy season you need to repeat at least every three, four days but if it is in the drought season you just spray once in a week. Sawa	How has this pesticide helped a person who cannot, maybe who does not know it, how can it help someone? Kigoye	It can help someone, if you do not have enough money to purchase say these toxic chemicals, the ambushes, the dimethoates, every farmer can afford, they are cheap. Secondly they improve on soil fertility. Some of these, the residues you get out of this when you put it somewhere they decompose and form fertiliser. It is not like the other toxic chemicals where you put them. Yes, they can serve the purpose for that particular period but in the long run they kill the natural, all the soil-living organisms. So they are very cheap and then they are environmentally friendly. End of trackHow to make a natural pesticide from tephrosia, chilli and soa...|$|R
