The polymers were produced in the presence of varying amounts of water so as to generate porous structures of the hydrogels through a phase separation polymerization process.

The morphology of these hydrogels was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porous structure of the hydrogels was future evaluated by the polymer volume fraction at the equilibrium state at various temperatures. The swelling properties of hydrogels were also studied. These include the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR) and the normalised volume change at different temperatures, the swelling kinetics, and the deswelling kinetics. Based on the porosities and the swelling properties, their responsiveness to the temperature changes, nine hydrogels were selected for the assessment of drug loading capacity and drug diffusion properties using a conventional anti-inflammatory drug, predinisolone 21 -hemisuccinate sodium salt.

At very high pH values, where PDMAEMA is uncharged while PAA is highly charged, the Janus nanoparticles were very stable in solution. However, below a pH of 4, when PAA is uncharged and PDMAEMA is positively charged, they formed finite clusters. At intermediate pH values, they found that the Janus nanoparticles were unstable due to dipolar interaction between the positively and negatively charged hemispheres.|$|E

The dust produced by mechanical rubbing along with problems due to friction and uneven roller pressure lead to defects in the display. Therefore a novel method for aligning polymers films by irradiation with polarised light has been attempted. Anisotropy introduced into the films by selective irradiation affects liquid crystal alignment. The polymers {{used in this study}} are poly (vinyl cinnamate), poly (9 - anthraceneoate <b>ethyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> and poly (p-azidobenzoate <b>ethyl</b> <b>methacrylate).</b> Poly (vinyl cinnamate) is a classical photoresist polymer which undergoes a [2 + 2] photocycloaddition in the presence of UV light. Poly (9 -anthraceneoate <b>ethyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> and poly (p-azidobenzoate <b>ethyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> are both novel polymers which have the potential to undergo photo-crosslinking reactions. Poly (9 -anthraceneoate <b>ethyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> contains an anthracene-terminated side chain which dimerises under the influence of UV light introducing anisotropy into the system. Poly (p-azidobenzoate <b>ethyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> contains an azido group which when irradiated with polarised light loses nitrogen to yield nitrenes which can combine to form azobenzene species.

We had previously shown that for a 70 % DMAEMA copolymer of Mn about 10 K at a pH of 7. 5 there is a surface phase transition from a layer about 20 Å thick to one about 40 Å thick and that the adsorbed layer at the higher concentration has a layered cross-sectional structure with the most Hydrophobic part of the polymer forming a central layer rather than the outer layer in contact with air, as would be expected. The present work shows that copolymers containing 80 % DMAEMA (about the same Mn) and 70 % DMAEMA (Mn about 20 K) form the same layered structure at the surface. The 80 % DMAEMA copolymer is more surface active than the 70 % copolymer, and this parallels the tendency to aggregate into micelles in bulk solution. The increase in molecular weight from 10 K to 20 K decreases the surface activity of the 70 % DMAEMA copolymer. Addition of electrolyte enhances the formation of the layered structure at the interface but tends to equalize the surface activities of the three copolymers. Other surprising features are the increase of surface activity with increasing polyelectrolyte block size when the block is the larger component and the apparent suppression of ionization in the surface region...|$|R
40|$|Thermoresponsive polymer-coated {{surfaces}} {{based on}} poly(2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) <b>ethyl</b> methacrylate-co-oliog(ethylene glycol) <b>methacrylate)</b> [P(MEO(2) MA-co-OEGMA) ] allow switching between cell attachment and detachment. Here, we investigate the temperature-dependent surface {{interactions between the}} polymer coating and a colloidal probe in an aqueous medium by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) force-distance measurements. The analysis of the adhesion forces from AFM retraction curves indentifies two kinds of regimes for the copolymer at temperatures below and above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Whereas at 25 degrees C the surface interactions with the polymer in the swollen state are dominated by repulsive forces, at 37 degrees C the surface interactions switch to attractive forces and a stronger adhesion is detected by AFM. Running several healing/cooling cycles repeatedly shows that switching the surface properties provides reproducible adhesion force values. Time-dependent measurements give insight into the switching kinetics, demonstrating that the cell response is coupled to the polymer kinetics but probably limited by the cellular rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|Microencapsulates with defined {{core shell}} {{structures}} {{are of interest}} for applications, such as controlled release and encapsulation, because of the feasibility of fine-tuning individual functionalities of different parts. Here, we report a new approach for efficient and scalable production of such particles. Eudragit RS (a co-polymer of <b>ethyl</b> acrylate, methyl <b>methacrylate,</b> and a low content of methacrylic acid ester with quaternary ammonium groups) {{was used as the}} main shell component, with silica as the core component, formed upon a single-step spray-drying assembly. The method is capable of forming uniform core shell particles from homogeneous precursors without the use of any organic solvents. Evaporation-induced self-assembly attained the phase separation among different components during drying, resulting in the core shell spatial configuration, while precise control over particle uniformity was accomplished via a microfluidic jet spray dryer. Direct control over shell thickness can be achieved from the ratio of the core and shell ingredients in the precursors. A fluorescent compound, rhodamine B, is used as a highly water-soluble model component to investigate the controlled release properties of these microencapsulates, with the release behaviors shown to be significantly dependent upon their architectures.
