5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E

25|$|Upper {{pitchers}} {{are much}} larger, growing up to 15cm high and 10cm wide. Wings {{are reduced to}} ribs that run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the pitcher. The greatly expanded peristome may reach 3.5cm in width in aerial pitchers. The lid does not cover the mouth completely, being narrowly ovate. It is up to 5cm long and 2cm wide. The crater-like glands {{on the underside of}} the lid may be up to 1.5mm wide. These glands are so large that they are visible as swellings on the upper surface of the lid. The spur is simple and up to 1cm long. Pitchers range in colour from light green to dark purple throughout and may be lightly speckled. The most common form of this species has green pitchers with a red peristome.|$|E
25|$|In Santa Cruz, {{close to}} the epicenter, 40 {{buildings}} collapsed, killing six people. At the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, the Plunge Building was significantly damaged. Liquefaction also caused damage in the Watsonville area. For example, sand volcanoes formed in a field near Pajaro {{as well as in}} a strawberry field. The Ford's department store in Watsonville experienced significant damage, including a crack <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the building. Many homes were dislodged if they were not bolted to their foundations. There were structural failures of twin bridges across Struve Slough near Watsonville. In Moss Landing, the liquefaction destroyed the causeway that carried the Moss Beach access road across tidewater basin, damaged the approach and abutment of the bridge linking Moss Landing spit to the mainland and cracked the paved road on Paul's Island. In the Old Town historical district of the city of Salinas, unreinforced masonry buildings were partially destroyed.|$|E
25|$|In colonial times, a {{judge in}} Singapore dressed {{in a manner similar}} to some of his {{counterparts}} in the United Kingdom. He wore a long scarlet robe with a grey cape or mantle and a black scarf around his shoulders, a white wing-collared shirt, and bands (a linen collar made of two rectangular pieces tied at the throat). Subsequently, the ordinary and ceremonial dress worn by judges was adapted from two of the various forms of court dress of English courts. On 9 January 1993, at the Opening of the Legal Year, the Chief Justice announced that judges would henceforth wear a lightweight black robe over an ordinary white shirt with a turn-down collar and a tie. The difficulty of obtaining shirts with wing collars and the growing sense that the traditional gown was inappropriate for the judiciary of an independent republic were cited as reasons for this change. On ceremonial occasions such as the Opening of the Legal Year, Supreme Court judges wear red robes with a black strip around the collar and extending <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the robe. The black strip on the Chief Justice's robe is edged with gold.|$|E

500|$|All Nepenthes {{pitchers}} share several basic characteristics. [...] Traps {{consist of}} the main pitcher cup, which is covered by an operculum or lid that prevents rainwater from entering the pitcher and displacing or diluting its contents. A reflexed ring of hardened tissue, known as the peristome, surrounds {{the entrance to the}} pitcher (only the aerial pitchers of N. inermis lack a peristome). [...] A pair of fringed wings run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> lower traps and these presumably serve to guide terrestrial insects into the pitchers' mouth. [...] Accordingly, the wings are greatly reduced or completely lacking in aerial pitchers, for which flying insects constitute the majority of prey items.|$|E
500|$|Breed {{specific}} markings include large, symmetrical dark patches {{incorporating the}} ears, eyes and cheeks, {{and a dark}} cape over the dorsal part of the neck and shoulders. The face should have a white blaze extending from the poll to the muzzle. The muzzle itself should be dark. The classic Jacob face {{is often referred to}} as [...] "badger-faced", consisting of black cheeks and muzzle with a white blaze running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the face. In addition to these markings, random spots may occur on the rest of the body and legs (including the carpi, hocks, and pasterns). Certain markings are common in particular lines: large muzzle markings, lack of leg markings, lack of muzzle markings, etc.|$|E

Immediately after being cast, Peirce took Swank to a hairdresser, where her lower-back length hair was cut and dyed chestnut brown. When {{she saw her}} then-husband, Chad Lowe, again, he barely recognized her. Swank prepared for the role by dressing and living as a man {{for at least a}} month, including wrapping her chest in tension bandages and putting socks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her trousers as Brandon Teena had done. Her masquerade was convincing; Swank's neighbors believed the [...] "young man" [...] coming and going from her home was Swank's visiting brother. She reduced her body fat to seven percent to accentuate her facial structure and refused to let the cast and crew see her out of costume. Swank earned $75 per day for her work on Boys Don't Cry, totaling $3,000. Her earnings were so low that she did not qualify for health insurance.|$|E

2500|$|The headdresses worn by {{the women}} {{are perhaps the most}} {{spectacular}} and elaborate items of Akha dress.
