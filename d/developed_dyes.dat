40|$|To {{answer the}} demands of {{scientific}} and medical imaging issues, the family of nucleic acid fluorescent dyes is constantly enlarging. Most of the <b>developed</b> <b>dyes</b> reveal high qualities in bulk solution assays but are inefficient to produce a strong and sufficiently stable signal to enable the application of single-molecule techniques. Therefore, we tested 12 novel monomeric and homodimeric cyanine dyes for potential single DNA molecule imaging. Although their qualities in bulk solutions have already been described, nothing was known about their behavior on a single-molecule level. All 12 dyes demonstrated strong emission when intercalated into single DNA molecules and stretched on a silanized surface, which makes them the perfect choice for fluorescent microscopy imaging. A comparison of their fluorescence intensity and photostability with the most applicable dyes in single-molecule techniques, fluorescent dyes YOYO- 1 and POPO- 3, was carried out. They all exhibited a strong signal, {{comparable to that of}} YOYO- 1. However, in contrast to YOYO- 1, which is visualized under a green filter only, their emission permits red filter visualization. As their photostability highly exceeds that of similar spectrum POPO- 3 dye, the studied dyes stand out as the best choice for a broad range of solid surface single-molecule applications when yellow to red DNA backbone fluorescence is needed...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{networks}} {{are responsible for}} complicated responses to stimuli and behavior. Understanding these networks involves recording the changes in transmembrane electrical potential from small subcellular locations such as dendritic spines, to large networks of neurons. This dissertation represents a concerted effort toward the development of small molecule probes with fluorescent intensities responsive to the transmembrane electrical potential of neurons. Fluorescent voltage sensitive molecules termed VoltageFluors (VF) are capable of undergoing photo-induced electron transfer (PeT). Previous work demonstrated that when embedded within a membrane of interest, the local electric field modulates the extent of PeT, and thus the fluorescence intensity as well. This thesis presents efforts toward rationally improving the voltage sensitivity of VF dyes through tuning the driving force for electron transfer and optimizing the structure of bridges. Optimization led to a significant improvement in voltage sensitivity of newly <b>developed</b> <b>dyes</b> epitomized by VF 2. 1 OMe. H with a 48 % ∆F/F per 100 mV demonstrated in HEK cells. This voltage sensor was to record voltage changes across neuronal systems from leech ganglia to mouse brain slices with high fidelity as well. In addition to sensitivity improvements, VF dyes were developed with a Cy 5 -like acceptor for far red fluorescence imaging in biology, The most sensitive dye in this class, VF Red, showed a 25 % ∆F/F per 100 mV in HEK cells and could effectively be used with optical activity activators for all optical stimulation and recording of electrical activity in neurons. Further improvements to recording voltage changes in biological systems included work toward reducing background fluorescence and generating a higher {{signal to noise ratio}} by generating non-fluorescent VF dyes by chemical reduction. These molecules were then subjected to selective reoxidation back to fluorescent VF dyes solely where oxidizing protein was present. Both fluorescein and cy 5 -based VF dyes were shown to undergo a degree of oxidation in vitro upon addition of oxidizing proteins. These efforts represent significant improvements to VF dyes toward improved optical sensor of voltage across many neuronal systems...|$|E
40|$|The colour formers used in {{carbonless}} {{copying paper}} consist of admixtures of {{primary and secondary}} dyes. Work {{was carried out in}} this programme both on retarding the photofading of the primary dyes and on improving the reactivity of the clay minerals towards the development of the secondary dye. The photolytic fading behaviour of S primary dyes were examined both in solution and on solid clay surfaces, and the intermediacy of singlet oxygen in the fading processes of the dyes examined by the DPBF trapping method. The retardation of dye fading was accomplished using bis(dithiocarbamato) nickel(II) complexes and it was found that some hydroxy-possessing species conferred improved photo-stability upon the <b>developed</b> <b>dyes,</b> especially towards fluorans, and to a lesser degree towards phthalides. The dark development of carbazolyl blue was examined on a series of cation exchanged and acid activated clays. There appeared to be two main mechanisms governing S-RB development in the dark; the first was catalysis by co-ordination to the Lewis acid sites on the clay edges, whilst the second was a redox process probably associated with the Fe 3 cations present in the clays. Several treatments were applied to modify common commercial days. It was found that introducing Fe 3 and Cu 2 into the clay profoundly improved the reactivity of the day to the secondary leuco dye. Cation exchange of clay with some transition metal ions such as CO 2 and Ni 2 also showed a beneficial effect on the colour formation. The Langmuir isotherm type plots were used to examine cation adsorption behaviour for 9 types of montmorillonite clays. It was found that cation exchange of clay occurs at at least two different sites; the tetrahedral silica layer sites and the intact montmorillonite interlayer cation exchange sites. It was also found that the silica layer sites are the predominant ones responsible for S-RB development, with interlayer sites providing a much lesser contribution. Adsorption of aquated metal salts makes virtually no further contributions to the leuco dye reaction...|$|E
50|$|Color film is {{much more}} complex due to {{multiple}} layers of emulsion and dye. The negative consists of three emulsion layers sensitive to the primary colors (red, green, and blue) each {{with a layer of}} <b>developing</b> <b>dye</b> beneath it of the complementary color (cyan, magenta, and yellow). Once light exposed the negative, the reagent is spread between the negative and positive and the <b>developing</b> <b>dye</b> layer migrates to the positive surface where it forms the photo. Emulsion layers exposed to their respective color block the complementary dye below it, reproducing the original color. For example, a photo of a blue sky would expose the blue emulsion, blocking all the yellow dye beneath it and allowing the magenta and cyan dye layers to migrate to the positive to form blue.|$|R

40|$|Gap {{junctional}} {{communication between}} microglia was investigated at rat brain stab wounds and in primary cultures of rat and mouse cells. Under resting conditions, rat microglia (FITC-isolectin-B 4 -reactive cells) were sparsely {{distributed in the}} neocortex, and most (95 %) were not immunoreactive for Cx 43, a gap junction protein subunit. At brain stab wounds, microglia progressively accumulated over several days and formed aggregates that frequently showed Cx 43 immunoreactivity at interfaces between cells. In primary culture, microglia showed low levels of Cx 43 determined by Western blotting, diffuse intracellular Cx 43 immunoreactivity, and a low incidence of dye coupling. Treatment with the immunostimulant bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the cytokines interferon-γ (INF-γ) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) {{one at a time}} did not increase the incidence of dye coupling. However, microglia treated with INF-γ plus LPS showed a dramatic increase in dye coupling that was prevented by coapplication of an anti-TNF-α antibody, suggesting the release and autocrine action of TNF-α. Treatment with INF-γ plus TNF-α also greatly increased the incidence of dye coupling and the Cx 43 levels with translocation of Cx 43 to cell–cell contacts. The cytokine-induced dye coupling was reversibly inhibited by 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid, a gap junction blocker. Cultured mouse microglia also expressed Cx 43 and <b>developed</b> <b>dye</b> coupling upon treatment with cytokines, but microglia from homozygous Cx 43 -deficient mice did not <b>develop</b> significant <b>dye</b> coupling after treatment with either INF-γ plus LPS or INF-γ plus TNF-α.

Mees, a recent graduate of London University, was placed in charge of new product development, and soon introduced panchromatic plates sensitive to longer wavelengths. To allow photography using particular wavelengths of light, Mees <b>developed</b> <b>dyed</b> gelatin filters which were placed between the plate or lens and the subject matter. These colored filters, later known as Wratten filters, began with yellow filters dyed with tartrazine (CAS # 1934-21-0), but were soon available in many more colors.

40|$|The {{challenges}} in modern biological imaging applications are two-fold: (i) to develop better methods of imaging, and (ii) <b>develop</b> <b>dyes</b> that {{are suitable for}} these methods. This dissertation deals with the design and synthesis of dyes mainly by modification of known dyes to make them suitable for modern biological applications. Towards this aim, novel ways of derivatizing BODIPY dyes are explored. One method involves extending the conjugation via phenyl acetylene units, pushing fluorescence wavelengths near 600 nm. A different approach deals with C-H functionalization of BODIPY in which the fluors are functionalized with acrylate units, extending their fluorescence to the red. The BODIPY <b>dyes</b> <b>developed</b> are then incorporated in through-bond energy transfer cassettes. We examine the factors affecting energy transfer efficiencies by synthesizing analogs of the cassettes and also studying the electrochemical behavior of the donor and acceptor parts. The concept of through-bond energy transfer is incorporated into conjugated polymers by random incorporation of BODIPY dyes into polyfluorenes. The ideal ratio of fluorene to BODIPY parts {{was found to be}} 4 : 1. The BODIPY doping agents result in dispersed emissions when excited the polyfluorene polymers. Concurrently, the polyfluorene backbone acts as an energy harvester for the BODIPY dyes, in effect increasing their molar absorptivities. Finally the use of BODIPY dyes as photodynamic therapeutic agents was examined. We found that BODIPY dyes are efficient at producing reactive oxygen species when halogens are attached directly on the BODIPY core. Furthermore, the mechanism of cell death by using such agents was elucidated. Attachment of the most promising agent to polyglutamic acid is done to promote the EPR effect. Lastly we develop a potentially new type of PDT agent that absorbs strongly above 800 nm, permitting its use in deep tissue PDT...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. For the {{evaluation}} of marginal adaptation in class V composite restorations, several methods have been <b>developed.</b> <b>Dye</b> penetration tests, however, are {{to be the most}} widely used due to their ease of application and low costs. In previous works, the advantages of using en-face optical coherence tomography investigation in this research direction were demonstrated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to underline the need to increase the scattering of the adhesive layers in order to facilitate the imagistic interpretations. Material and Methods. En-face Optical Coherence Tomography was employed to investigate 20 class V cavities samples. Standardized class V cavities, prepared in human extracted teeth, were flled with Premise (Kerr) composite. In 10 samples a normal adhesive (OptiBond Solo Plus) was applied, while in the other 10 both the normal and the improved adhesive were used. The specimens were thermocycled. The interfaces were examined by Optical Coherence Tomography method (OCT) combined with the confocal microscopy (CM). Results. Using the normal adhesive could lead to errors in evaluation of the interfaces between the dental structures and dental fllings, when OCT is employed. However, when an adhesive with an improved scattering was used, the differences between the aeric inclusions and the adhesive layer are obvious. Conclusions. An adhesive with improved scattering properties is recommended in an OCT investigation of microleakage for class V composite restorations...|$|R
40|$|During World War I a {{recently}} <b>developed</b> <b>dye</b> method of measuring plasma volume (1) was em-ployed, {{to a limited}} extent, {{in the investigation of}} hemorrhagic and traumatic shock in wounded soldiers. Those studies (2 to 4) showed that shock was associated with varying degrees of re-duction in the measurable total blood volume. It was assumed that this reduction resulted in a de-creased venous return to the heart, which ac-counted for diminished blood flow and death in vascular collapse. It was also felt that severity of shock as judged clinically was proportional to the degree of blood volume reduction. Cannon (5) summarized the results of these investigations in 1923. There was little change in this concep-tion of the fundamentals of shock for several years, and, as might be expected, little improvement in the therapy of shock. Blalock(6) concluded that the decrease in blood pressure in experimental traumatic shock was due to loss of blood into damaged areas, or to hemorrhage into the intestinal tract (7). Moon (8) on the basis of pathological observations on dogs dying in prolonged shock (peritonitis) con-cluded that increase in capillary permeability per-mitting the leakage of plasma from the vascular bed was chiefly responsible for loss in blood vol-ume.
