The start of the young manager's career looked to be promising, with the club winning four out of its first five games, a surge that saw the team {{rise to the top}} position of the La Liga table. Despite looking impressive in Europe, Los Che then hit a poor run of form in the league that saw them dip as low as seventh in the standings. Amid the slump reports emerged of massive <b>internal</b> <b>debt</b> at the club, exceeding €400million, with reports claiming the players had not been paid in weeks. The team's problems were compounded when they were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Dynamo Kyiv on away goals. After a run where Valencia took only five points from ten games in La Liga, an announcement was made that the club had secured a loan that would cover the players' expenses {{until the end of the}} year. This announcement coincided with an upturn in form, and the club won six of its next eight games to surge back into the critical fourth place Champions' League spot. However, Los Che were then defeated by fourth place contenders Atlético Madrid and Villarreal in two of the last three matches of the campaign, subsequently finishing sixth in the table and failing to qualify for the following season's Champions League.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{relationship}} between fiscal policy, aggregate public sector debt sustainability, and debt relief. In particular, we develop a methodology to compute the fiscal policy path that is compatible with aggregate debt sustainability in the post-HIPC era (Highly Indebted Poor Countries relief initiative). This model explicitly considers the role of domestic debt, and quantifies the extent to which future debt sustainability depends on the availability of concessional loans at subsidized interest rates. The working of the model is illustrated for the cases of Honduras and Nicaragua. Both countries differ markedly in terms of the burdens of their external and <b>internal</b> <b>debts.</b> The results from our simulation analysis indicate that unless Nicaragua receives substantial concessional aid in the future, its public sector debt is likely to become unsustainable. In the case of Honduras, our simulation exercise shows that under reasonable parameters the country's fiscal stance as of 2001 is sustainable. Public Sector, Fiscal Policy, NFP...|$|R
60|$|The {{existence}} of the great war debts is a menace to financial stability everywhere. There is no European country in which repudiation may not soon become an important political issue. In the case of <b>internal</b> <b>debt,</b> however, there are interested parties on both sides, {{and the question is}} one of the internal distribution of wealth. With external debts this is not so, and the creditor nations may soon find their interest inconveniently bound up with the maintenance of a particular type of government or economic organization in the debtor countries. Entangling alliances or entangling leagues are nothing to the entanglements of cash owing.|$|E
60|$|The final {{consideration}} influencing the reader's attitude to this proposal must, however, depend on his {{view as to}} the future place in the world's progress of the vast paper entanglements which are our legacy from war finance {{both at home and}} abroad. The war has ended with every one owing every one else immense sums of money. Germany owes a large sum to the Allies, the Allies owe a large sum to Great Britain, and Great Britain owes a large sum to the United States. The holders of war loan in every country are owed a large sum by the State, and the State in its turn is owed a large sum by these and other taxpayers. The whole position is in the highest degree artificial, misleading, and vexatious. We shall never be able to move again, unless we can free our limbs from these paper shackles. A general bonfire is so great a necessity that unless we can make of it an orderly and good-tempered affair in which no serious injustice is done to any one, it will, when it comes at last, grow into a conflagration that may destroy much else as well. As regards <b>internal</b> <b>debt,</b> I am one of those who believe that a capital levy for the extinction of debt is an absolute prerequisite of sound finance in everyone of the European belligerent countries. But the continuance on a huge scale of indebtedness between Governments has special dangers of its own.|$|E
60|$|But {{there are}} two errors in it. First of all, Germany's annual savings, after what she has {{suffered}} in the war and by the Peace, will fall far short {{of what they were}} before, and, if they are taken from her year by year in future, they cannot again reach their previous level. The loss of Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and Upper Silesia could not be assessed in terms of surplus productivity at less than $250,000,000 annually. Germany is supposed to have profited about $500,000,000 per annum from her ships, her foreign investments, and her foreign banking and connections, all of which have now been taken from her. Her saving on armaments is far more than balanced by her annual charge for pensions now estimated at $1,250,000,000,[132] which represents a real loss of productive capacity. And even if we put on one side the burden of the <b>internal</b> <b>debt,</b> which amounts to 24 milliards of marks, as being a question of internal distribution rather than of productivity, we must still allow for the foreign debt incurred by Germany during the war, the exhaustion of her stock of raw materials, the depletion of her live-stock, the impaired productivity of her soil from lack of manures and of labor, and the diminution in her wealth from the failure to keep up many repairs and renewals over a period of nearly five years. Germany is not as rich as she was before the war, and the diminution in her future savings for these reasons, quite apart from the factors previously allowed for, could hardly be put at less than ten per cent, that is $200,000,000 annually.|$|E

40|$|Cotton is {{the first}} export crop in Mali with 84, 370 billion Fcfa in 2010 (INSTAT, 2010), but the {{production}} of this crop has huge problems due to external factors (prices of inputs and seed cotton) and internal (within payment to producers, <b>internal</b> <b>debts</b> of cooperatives). To boost cotton production during the years 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12, the government had maintained the level of fertilizer subsidy at 50 % of normal price on the market. In addition to this level of subsidy, the incentive price of 255 Fcfa / kg was fixed to the producer and the National Union of Cotton Producers Cooperative Societies (NU-CPCS) facilitated the clearance of the <b>internal</b> <b>debts</b> of cooperatives. Despite the fall in world prices after 2011 / 12, the price of cotton seed remains little changed. The price stayed at 255 CFA francs / kg in 2012 / 13 and got back to 250 CFA francs / kg in 2013 / 14. The objective of this work is to analyze the effects of incentives factors cotton production {{with a view to}} the privatization of CMDT subsidiaries Surveys were conducted with a sample of 240 farms selected from the four zones of the CMDT zones based on two villages subsidiary during the years of 2008 / 09, 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12. The results showed a positive trend in production (mainly due to an increase in the area) and in the income of cotton producers with a higher reimbursement rate of input credits under cultivation. The analysis of the Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) the Nominal protection coefficients (NPC) and the Effective (CPE) showed an improvement in thèse variables in 2011 / 12 with the incentive policy. An analysis of the determinants of the supply of cotton showed that only two variables were significant: the price cottonseed and payment period. The incentive factors are influenced by fiber market in 2011 / 12 which took a downward trend from the campaign. This incentive policy being favored by the market of fiber which is very unstable, it would be necessary to create conditions in which the producer can benefit from the price obtained on the quality of fiber to maintain the incentive policy for producers. For the privatization of Cotton Company, an upgrade of this company is necessary {{with the support of the}} Malian state. But this upgrade should not affect too much the selling price of sale of cotton that can bring new companies in a situation of too long term recovery of capital invested (long period of investment recovery).
