5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to <b>desensitize</b> patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E

40|$|Two {{potential}} {{mechanisms for}} terminating delayed hypersensitivity (DH) reactions {{have been examined}} in <b>desensitized</b> guinea pigs. Lack of macrophage responsiveness to lymphokines was sought as {{an explanation for the}} reduced ability of these animals to express delayed hypersensitivity. Skin-reactive factor was injected into the skin of <b>desensitized</b> guinea pigs and a control group of similarly immunized animals. The resulting inflammatory reactions were similar in size and intensity in both groups indicating normal macrophage responsiveness in the <b>desensitized</b> state. Passive cellular transfer of DH responses to <b>desensitized</b> animals was markedly less successful than transfer to normal animals. However, cells from <b>desensitized</b> guinea pigs did transfer DH responsiveness to normal animals. These data support the concept of a humoral suppressant of cellular immunity, perhaps acting as a feedback inhibitor, produced when guinea pigs are <b>desensitized...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{different}} immunologic {{activities of}} lymph node and spleen cells {{as compared to}} peritoneal exudate cells were studied in temporarily <b>desensitized,</b> DNCB-contact-sensitive guinea pigs. Lymph node (and spleen) lymphocytes: (a) transfer contact sensitivity to syngeneic recipients when harvested {{at the time of}} unresponsiveness; (b) are only temporarily inactivated in tolerant recipients by the <b>desensitizing</b> procedure; (c) enter the lymph node (or spleen) compartments in a higher proportion than peritoneal exudate cells; (d) are not susceptible to inactivation in vitro; and (e) are not permanently <b>desensitized</b> when released into the circulation by an intravenous injection of Bordetella pertussis vaccine. These results indicate that the resistance of primed lymph node cells to the <b>desensitizing</b> procedure may account for the reappearance of contact sensitivity in <b>desensitized</b> guinea pigs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Effect of <b>desensitizing</b> {{agent in}} post-extracoronal {{bleaching}} on shear bond strength of composite resin. The dentinal hypersensitivity {{is a common}} condition among patients after extracoronal bleaching treatment that usually needs the application of <b>desensitizing</b> agent. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the composite resin restoration shear bond strength with and without <b>desensitizing</b> application after extracoronal bleaching using 40 % of H 2 O 2. Twenty one extracted permanent human incisor teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 each. Group I was with the application of 40 % H 2 O 2 without any <b>desensitizing</b> agent. Group II was with the application of 40 % of H 2 O 2 with <b>desensitizing</b> agent and group III served as the control. The teeth were immersed in artificial saliva and stored in 37 °C incubator for 7 days. The teeth were restored using composite resin. After restoring the shear bond strength of composite resin was tested using a universal testing machine. Result and conclusion. there is no significant difference between bleaching group with and without <b>desensitizing</b> agent. The application of <b>desensitizing</b> agent after extracoronal bleaching did not impact the composite resin shear bond strength...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTooth {{sensitivity}} is a common, painful dental condition. Consumer dental products, mostly dentifrices, play {{an important}} role in sensitivity treatment. The objective of this review is to describe a new mouthwash-based <b>desensitizing</b> technology. DataBackground literature concerning <b>desensitizing</b> products is reviewed. Potassium salts are the most commonly used active ingredients in <b>desensitizing</b> dentifrices. Clinical studies show that while potassium salt dentifrices are generally effective; most formulations require several weeks to exert their <b>desensitizing</b> effect. Recently, a new <b>desensitizing</b> dentifrice containing the amino acid arginine was introduced. This dentifrice acts to occlude the dentinal tubules, and has been shown to be highly effective in multiple clinical studies. This arginine-containing dentifrice has also been shown to provide instant relief of sensitivity pain when applied directly to the sensitive tooth surface. In contrast to dentifrices, there are few <b>desensitizing</b> mouthwashes available. Building on the success of the arginine-based dentifrice, an arginine-based mouthwash formula was developed and tested. SourcesPublished studies in peer-reviewed publications. Study selectionControlled and blinded clinical studies to provide evidence of efficacy. In vitro studies are included to indicate the mechanism of action. This review includes studies testing the new arginine-based <b>desensitizing</b> mouthwash. ConclusionClinical findings indicate that this new <b>desensitizing</b> mouthwash, based on the Pro-Argin™ mouthwash technology effectively reduces sensitivity symptoms and can be used alone or as a adjunct to the use of the arginine-containing dentifrice in the home treatment of tooth sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Currents {{activated}} by extracellular ATP were studied in single voltage- clamped bullfrog atrial cells. Rapid application of ATP elicited currents carried through two different conductance pathways: a rapidly <b>desensitizing</b> conductance reversing near - 10 mV, and a maintained, inwardly rectifying conductance reversing near - 85 mV. ATP activated the <b>desensitizing</b> component of current with a K 1 / 2 of approximately 50 microM and the maintained component with a K 1 / 2 of approximately 10 microM. Both types of current were {{activated by}} ATP {{but not by}} adenosine, AMP, or ADP. The <b>desensitizing</b> current was selectively inhibited by alpha, beta-methylene ATP, and the maintained, inwardly rectifying current was selectively suppressed by extracellular Cs. The <b>desensitizing</b> component of current was greatly reduced when extracellular Na was replaced by N-methylglucamine, but was slightly augmented when Na was replaced by Cs. GTP, ITP, and UTP were all ineffective in activating the <b>desensitizing</b> current, and {{of a variety of}} ATP analogues, only ATP-gamma-S was effective. Addition of EGTA or BAPTA to the intracellular solution did not obviously affect the <b>desensitizing</b> current. Fluctuation analysis of currents through the <b>desensitizing</b> conductance suggested that current is carried through ionic channels with a small (less than pS) unitary conductance...|$|R

25|$|Most horses do {{not object}} to mane pulling, and willingly stand for the process. To make it more {{comfortable}} for the horse, a groom should pull the mane out of the crest in an upwards direction, rather than sideways or down. An application of Orajel or clove oil on {{the roots of the}} mane can help <b>desensitize</b> the area during the pulling process. It is also recommended that pulling is performed right after exercise, when it is thought that the mane comes out more easily because the pores are open. Using a mane pulling device such as the ManePuller may also be considered because it tends to be quicker and therefore less stressful for the horse (and groom).|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine is a {{very strong}} H1 {{receptor}} inverse agonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15mg dose of mirtazapine to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to <b>desensitize</b> and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, pruritus, nausea, and insomnia in afflicted individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, mirtazapine has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and mydriasis are still sometimes seen in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|GABRD encodes the δ subunit of the GABA receptor, {{which is}} a subunit {{yielding}} receptors which do not <b>desensitize</b> and are localized outside of the synapse. There are three mutations in this gene associated with JME, E177A, R220C, and R220H, all located in the N-terminus of the protein. The last of these mutations is also present in normal controls. Receptors containing the E177A mutation have greatly decreased current compared to wild-type. This {{is not the case}} for the R220C mutation but is similar to the R220H mutation, though to a lesser extent than the E177A mutation. More recent study has found that the E177A mutant also has greatly decreased desensitization compared to wild-type receptors. Receptors containing only E177A or R220H mutants, versus heterozygotes, had significantly decreased surface expression compared to wild-type or heterozygotic receptors. These mutants also have decreased single-channel open times compared to wild-type. It should be noted, however, that these mutations are very rare as causes of JME.|$|E

We have purified β-receptors from <b>desensitized</b> and untreated turkey erythrocytes and have compared {{the abilities of}} these two receptors to couple with pure turkey erythrocyte Gs in a reconstituted system. Functional receptor-Gs coupling was assessed by measuring hormone-dependent (i) Gs, activation by GTPγS and (ii) GTPase activity. While in membranes prepared from <b>desensitized</b> cells, receptor-Gs, coupling was clearly reduced, this effect was absent when coupling of purified <b>desensitized</b> receptor was measured.

40|$|Mice with delayed {{hypersensitivity}} induced by infection with Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG were <b>desensitized</b> {{by a single}} large dose of specific antigen (old tuberculin, OT) or a nonspecific interferon stimulus (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Subsequent challenge of the <b>desensitized</b> animals revealed only a homologous hyporeactivity, that is, mice <b>desensitized</b> with OT showed decreased type II and migration inhibitory factor (MIF) responses to the specific antigen, which were unaffected by desensitization with LPS. Conversely, mice <b>desensitized</b> with LPS showed a decreased type I interferon and MIF response to LPS, which was unaffected by desensitization with OT. These results suggest that type I interferon and its accompanying low-titered MIF activity are produced by cell populations different from those that produce type II interferon and its accompanying high-titered MIF activity...|$|R

500|$|The Cleveland Bay is a {{versatile}} horse {{and is still}} used today for many tasks, including driving and farmwork. In the 1920s, Cleveland Bays replaced black Hanoverians in the British royal stables, and both the Cleveland Bay and Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred crosses are used as royal carriage horses today. The horses are used as heavy hunters, as they are powerful and able to carry a man weighing [...] for {{a full day of}} hunting over large obstacles and through heavy clay. When crossed with Thoroughbreds, the resulting progeny are lighter and faster, but still strong and heavy of bone. When show jumping was first beginning as a sport during the mid-19th century, Cleveland Bays were among the initial stars. Two mares, Star and Fanny Drape, were two of the top performers.

40|$|In {{comparison}} with controls, membranes isolated from pigeon erythrocytes exposed to isoproterenol exhibit decreased adenylate cyclase activity. Fluoride and guanosine- 5 ’-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (GTPyS) activations are lowered in <b>desensitized</b> membranes and in Lubrol PX extracts of membranes previously treated with isoproterenol and GMP to remove GDP {{bound to the}} guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G-protein). The decreases are not due to changes in Kact for either GTPyS or isoproterenol. The affinity and number of [3 H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites in <b>desensitized</b> membranes {{are similar to those}} found in control membranes. No functional differences are found between G-proteins solubiized from control and <b>desensitized</b> pigeon erythrocyte membranes as determined in reconstitution experiments with cyc membranes. This laboratory recently has described [J. Biol. Chem. 256 : 1459 - 1465 (1981) ] techniques to monitor conforma-tional changes in pigeon erythrocyte G-protein mediated by guanine nucleotides and hormone-receptor interactions. These involve partial tryptic digestion and peptide map-ping of the cholera toxin-labeled Mr 42, 000 subunit of the G-protein. This procedure, carried out on control and <b>desensitized</b> membranes, demonstrates (a) that isoproterenol has a diminished ability to alter the conformation of the G-protein in <b>desensitized</b> membranes, (b) that a lag in the conformational change induced by GTPyS in {{the presence or absence of}} isoproterenol is observed in <b>desensitized</b> preparations, and (c) that the fraction of G-proteins found in the GTPyS-specific conformation is significantly decreased in <b>desensitized</b> versus control membranes incubated with GTP-yS with or without isoproterenol.
