5000|$|This {{game has}} been {{analyzed}} by P. Straffin, who {{showed that it}} is a draw so long as both players can see 2-ply ahead, i.e. see the results of their move and of what their opponent would do in response. In particular, any win in Pong Hau K'i must go through the position shown on the left (or a symmetrically equivalent position). In this position, with Red to move, they have two choices: (1) They can move their top piece West along the top edge; or (2) They can move their bottom piece North along the left edge. In case (1), the game continues. But in case (2), the game will almost surely end quickly. If Blue then moves their bottom piece to the left, they win. If they are foolish enough to move their center piece instead, then Red wins by moving their top-right piece to the center. Thus with [...] "2-ply lookahead", player Red can see the result of their (bad) move of the bottom piece (the <b>first</b> <b>ply),</b> realize that Blue then has a winning move (the second ply), and hence Red will choose to not make that move.|$|E

For composite materials which are weak in transverse shear, failure may initiate at any inner lamina or interface and may remain undetected and unattended to. Such latent damages may progress gradually and lead to a sudden total ply failure. An iterative method is adopted using the various failure theories to predict the <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure load. After the <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure, the stiffness of the failed element is totally discarded from the laminate and the remaining laminate is considered for further analysis. The developed finite element code is validated through solution of a benchmark problem.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on scaling effects in composite materials {{has demonstrated that}} the stress levels at <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure and ultimate failure of composite laminates are dependent {{on the size of}} the laminate. In particular, the thickness dimension has been shown to be the most influential parameter in strength scaling of composite coupons loaded in tension. Geometrically and constitutively scaled laminates exhibit decreasing strength with increasing specimen size, and the magnitude of the strength-size effect is a function of both material properties and laminate stacking sequence. Some of the commonly used failure criteria for composite materials such as maximum stress, maximum strain, and tensor polynomial (e. g., Tsai-Wu) cannot account for the strength-size effect. In this paper, three concepts are developed and evaluated for incorporating size dependency into failure criteria for composite materials. An experimental program of limited scope was performed to determine the <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure stress in scaled cross-ply laminates loaded in tension. Test specimens were fabricated of AS- 4 / 3502 graphite-epoxy composite material with laminate stacking sequences of [0 deg n/ 90 deg n/o deg n]subT where n= 1 - 6. Two experimental techniques were used to determine <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure, defined as a transverse matrix crack in the 90 deg ply: (1) step loading with dye penetrant x-ray of the specimen at each load interval, and (2) acoustic emission. The best correlation between <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure analysis and experimental data was obtained using a modified Weibull approach which incorporated the residual thermal stress and the outer ply constraint, as well as the ply thickness effect. Finally, a second set of experiments was performed to determine the tensile response and ultimate failure of the scaled cross-ply laminates. The results of these experiments indicated no influence of specimen size on tensile response or ultimate strength...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present paper {{deals with}} the <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure {{analysis}} of laminated composite plates under linearly varying temperature through {{the thickness of the}} laminate. The plate element has been modeled as an eight noded isoparametric quadratic plate bending element based on Reissner-Mindlin’s assumption for the transverse shear deformation. The deflection and stress resultants obtained in the present study are compared with those available in published literature. The stress level causing the failure of the weakest layer has been detected, based on various stress interactive failure criteria viz. Tsai-Wu and Hoffman’s criteria. The temperature of the outermost layer has been computed at the stress level of that weakest ply failure. A parametric study has been carried out on the basis of different lamination schemes and boundary conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study investigates {{initiation}} and {{propagation of}} damage zones in the composite plates of an adhesively bonded single-lap joint in tension at the mesoscale level. A set of material degradation rules {{is applied to}} the mechanical properties of each failed ply of the plates based on the Hashin failure criterion. The von Mises stress concentrates along the free edges of the adhesive layer and the corresponding lower and upper plate regions and peaks along the free edges of the adhesive–plate interfaces. Consequently, the damage initiates at the lower plate interface to the adhesive layer and propagates in the <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> along this adhesive free edge, and then spreads through the neighboring plies of the lower plate in a similar failure mechanism. The damage in the lower plate occurs in the matrix, delamination, and fiber–matrix failure modes, and the first ply-failure loads decrease significantly with increasing ply fiber angle. Tension tests showed that the adhesive joints with ply lay-ups between [0] 10 and [15] 10 fails through the adhesive layer, and the lower plates with larger fiber angles break along the free edge of the lower plate– adhesive interface whereas the adhesive layer is still intact. The adhesive failure is interfacial around the adhesive free edges and is through the adhesive {{in the middle of the}} overlap region in the joints with the ply lay-ups [0] 10. Although a similar failure mechanism is observed in the ply lay-up [15] 10, the damage zones in the <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> of the lower plate in which the matrix and fibers are damaged, are distributed in the overlap region.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} method to improve the impact damage {{tolerance}} of thermoset resin matrix composites by exploiting thermoplastic material impact resistance properties. Two configurations of thermoplastic/thermoset multilayer composites are considered: (a) thermoplastic material is used on sample surface as shock absorber and (b) thermoplastic film is inserted in between thermoset layers to act as interlayer. We aim at increasing adhesion strength between thermoplastic and thermoset resin matrix. We show that mode I critical strain energy release rate, determined by the wedge double cantilever beam fracture test, increases significantly when a third amorphous polymer interlayer compatible with both thermoplastic and thermoset resin is inserted. The analysis of scanning electron microscope fracture surfaces helps us to clarify the adhesion mechanism involved. The high adhesion between thermoplastic and thermoset resins obtained with this method, together with the ability of thermoplastics to dissipate the impact damage in the <b>first</b> <b>plies</b> ensure the reliability of this stacked configuration.

Numerical simulation accurately predicts the stress distribution and load-carrying capacity of the T-joint obtained from experimental tests.

40|$|Woven polymer-based {{composites}} {{are currently}} {{used in a}} wide range of naval applications. Use of composite materials in critical applications requires that dynamic material behavior be fully characterized. Composite material behavior is generally well understood in the linear regime, and can be predicted with sufficient confidence up to the point of <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure. However, the mechanical behavior beyond <b>first</b> <b>ply</b> failure is not characterized by a validated theory that can account for material nonlinearity, strain rate dependence, and progressive failure. The objective of this work is to develop and validate a progressive failure approach that can be used for woven polymer-based composites subjected to dynamic loads. The theory is implemented in a commercial finite element program with a user material subroutine that defines the constitutive theory and implements the progressive failure methodology. A deformation based failure criterion, intended for large strain analysis of woven composites, is also proposed. The progressive failure approach is validated using basic tension and open hole tension tests. The tests are performed using digital image correlation, which provides the complete non-uniform strain and displacement fields. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data. ...|$|E
