25|$|An {{open draw}} {{for the first}} round took place on 24 June, after {{all but one of}} the {{participants}} were known. This made sure that some teams did not have the advantage of knowing who they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> against longer than others. The matches were scheduled to be played on the weekend of 7 July and 8.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{just over}} a week before Tyrone's Ulster final {{appearance}} against Down, Canavan's father, Seán, died. It {{came as a shock}} to Canavan, who had thought his father (who was already in hospital) was getting better. He decided to play in the match, stating that he knew, subconsciously [...] " [...] was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> in the Ulster final all along and Daddy certainly wouldn't have wanted [...] to do anything but play." ...|$|E
500|$|It was teasingly {{suggested}} that Isaacs prove {{his devotion to}} Kermode and Mayo's Film Review by having his character say [...] "ukulele" [...] onscreen, which {{was a case of}} [...] "Challenge accepted!" [...] The line, [...] "He's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> the ukulele in heaven", was uttered, while examining a corpse whose fingers had been badly mangled. [...] "When I did that I got a note from the editing room going, 'What the f— are you talking about?'" [...] says the actor. [...] "I said, 'You have to keep the line in. If I can ever wield my big stick as a producer, I'm telling you I want the ukulele line left in!'" [...] The line was kept in the episode.|$|E

50|$|The female lead <b>was</b> {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> by Shirley MacLaine {{but she was}} {{not available}} due to commitments on Sweet Charity and campaigning for Robert F. Kennedy. Catherine Deneuve was cast instead.|$|R
500|$|For either team {{to play in}} the {{national}} title game, that team had to end up ranked No. 1 or No. 2 {{at the end of the}} regular season. Since the Bowl Championship Series was formed in 1998, 9of the 14teams were unbeaten going into the championship game. [...] The only time {{the national}} champion has not been unbeaten during that stretch was in 2003 when LSU and USC claimed a share of the title as each finished with one loss. [...] Ohio State tackle Kirk Barton would later say [...] "There’ll probably be two undefeated teams at the end of the road and if you’re not one of them you’re probably not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> for the championship. So you’ve got to treat every game like it’s the Super Bowl. You only get one opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2006, Carson joined Charlton Athletic on {{loan for}} the 2006–07 season, after Charlton failed {{in a bid}} for Norwich City goalkeeper Robert Green. Carson {{explained}} that [...] "Liverpool {{want me to get}} some experience and then hopefully I can go back next season and be challenging Pepe [...] for the number one spot. There were a couple of Championship clubs interested but I need to be playing Premiership football because Robert Green, Ben Foster and Chris Kirkland are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> week in, week out so I need to be performing." [...] He played in 36 of 38 Premier League matches, missing only the two matches against Liverpool due to the terms of his loan deal. Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006–07, his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year, the first loan player ever to receive the award.|$|E
500|$|Finishing the {{recording}} of the song, Shakur felt very positively about the track, saying the [...] "song is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> in every club., every country. Deejays are calling from everywhere, wanting {{to get a piece}} of this." [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] appeared first as a B-side, on the single [...] "How Do U Want It", by Shakur featuring The Outlawz. On June 4, 1996 under the label Death Row Records, [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] was released on compact disc, 12-inch, and a 45 RPM. The original cover for the single had Puffy's head on a snake's body, and Biggie's head on a pig's. It also appeared posthumously on several compilations, including the 2004 release of Shakur's last recorded live performance, [...] [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] was also remixed on Nu-Mixx Klazzics. Upon its release, [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] received frequent radio airplay, which was attributed to the public interest in the ongoing feud and radio stations' desire to garner high ratings. However, some radio stations, such as the Los Angeles-based KPWR, refused to play it. The follow-up to [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] was the song [...] "Bomb First (My Second Reply)".|$|E

5000|$|The role of Rafi <b>was</b> {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> by Sandra Bullock.

500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E
2500|$|I {{thoroughly}} {{enjoyed it}} and the preparation has been great. The big thing {{that came out of}} it was that I played at three Test grounds I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> on and got to experience them before this big series coming up. Lord's was my home ground there for Middlesex and I played at The Oval as well and Edgbaston. It couldn't have really worked out any better. The big thing was just going over there to experience the whole different culture really, the weather, the wickets and the bowlers as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Texas's loss made it {{unlikely}} that Texas would repeat as National Champions. Since the Bowl Championship Series was formed in 1998, 11 of the 16 teams were unbeaten going into the game. [...] The only time the national champion has not been unbeaten during that stretch was in 2003 when LSU and USC claimed {{a share of the}} title as each finished with one loss.

50|$|The part of Sir William Gull <b>was</b> {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>played</b> by Nigel Hawthorne, {{but when}} his cancer prevented him from working on the film he was replaced by Ian Holm.

2500|$|The Titans {{were the}} first NFL team to play a preseason game, in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on August 9, 2009. Ringer played his NFL debut there. Ringer {{discussed}} the game earlier, saying, [...] "I am very excited. I have never even been to an NFL game as a fan, so my first experience I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> in one, I {{am looking forward to}} it." [...] Ringer had 4 carries for 14 yards, along with 2 catches for 9 yards, while the Titans won 21-18. On August 15, in a preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Ringer lead the team in rushing with 7 attempts for 51 yards, including a 36 yard touchdown run. The Titans won 27-20. Ringer said of the run, [...] " [...] I saw a linebacker prepare to blitz, and I thought the offense was going to check out of the play. But as the cadence kept going, I realized we were going to run into that blitz". In a 10-30 loss against the Dallas Cowboys, the first game in Cowboys Stadium, Ringer again led the team in rushing, this time with 33 yards on 5 attempts. He had what would have been a 17-yard touchdown run called back due to a penalty. He also had 2 catches for 6 yards, and averaged 34 yards on two kickoff return.|$|E
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially if you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
2500|$|While most of {{the songs}} from The Leak were {{strictly}} for the street, {{it was said that}} there would be two or three that would actually go on the album with a little remixing. For instance, [...] "Jamie Foxx, who has had #1 album, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>playing</b> the piano and singing on 'Live in the Sky', and Pimp C's vocals will be added to 'Front, Back, Side to Side,' which already features T.I. and Bun B and is a remake of UGK's 1994 hit of the same name. In an interview with MTV T.I. said that he was actually still recording songs for King and said he'll be making music right up to the deadline. On February 6, 2006 T.I. churned out roughly 65 tracks but only selected the hottest joints. In another interview with MTV, [...] T.I. stated that [...] "the album King is like 'Trap Muzik' on steroids". [...] He also stated that everything you loved about his albums in the past has been reincarnated and hit with some nuclear sewage that made that shit mutate into something of catastrophic proportions. On February 21, 2006 T.I. talked about one of the songs that would be on the album that one was one of the more popular songs off T.I.'s The Leak CD is [...] "Live in the Sky", on which he sings the hook [...] "Life's ups and downs, they come and go." [...] Well, on his album King, T.I. will feature a reworking of the piano-driven song with Jamie Foxx singing the hook and playing the keys. T.I. stated that It's dedicated to his cousin Toot, who died right before Trap Muzik came out. [...] He also stated that [...] "the song was also dedicated to his homeboy Jay-Ru, who died right before I'm Serious came out. T.I. stated it's about people's misperceptions of T.I. and his life by saying [...] "How I feel, it's the exact opposite. It's a lot more problems than people may realize. I had to show them my life is not all that it's cracked up to be".|$|E
