5|$|Items {{from the}} hoard {{have been on}} display almost {{continuously}} since the treasure was received at the British Museum. Some items were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at Ipswich Museum in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important items went on permanent display at the British Museum <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard, and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. Some items from the Hoxne Hoard were included in Treasure: Finding Our Past, a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A perspex reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes {{in which it was}} deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of the different types of items with sample items inside. It is now part of the permanent display in London, along with other items laid out more traditionally.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E

25|$|In 1795 Didelot {{created the}} ballet La Métamorphose for Lyon, and in 1796 he revised {{the work as}} Flore et Zéphire. The ballet premiered in London at the King's Theatre in 1796, {{ultimately}} ushering <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> important—but brief—era in ballet subsequently known as the Pre-Romantic.|$|E
25|$|A {{new method}} of {{producing}} glass, {{known as the}} cylinder process, was developed in Europe during the early 19th century. In 1832 this process {{was used by the}} Chance Brothers to create sheet glass. They became the leading producers of window and plate glass. This advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption, thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings. The Crystal Palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> innovative structure.|$|E

In 1858, President Hart resigned and was succeeded by Nicholas Harper Maguire. In September 1900, the school moved to its third location <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> larger building located at Broad, Green, Fifteenth, and Brandywine Streets. During the formal dedication on November 22, 1902, Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, addressed the students.|$|R

Construction of the theatre began shortly after the announcement. The theatre is contained within Sound Stage 18, which was occupied by Nickelodeon Studios from 1990–2005. The sound stage was home to shows such as Slime Time Live, Figure It Out, and Double Dare 2000. In 2005, the sound stage was used for Where Evil Hides, a haunted house for Universal's Halloween Horror Nights: Tales of Terror event. The theatre is located between the Hard Rock Cafe and the main entrance to Universal Studios Florida.|$|E

500|$|Eastman {{also points}} to Hazlitt's focus on the {{underlying}} unity of the plays. Hazlitt may not have done this as well as Coleridge (who, Eastman thought, was better at suggesting avenues of approach for others to find unity in Shakespeare's plays), [...] "Yet the demonstrations of unity in Cymbeline and Othello and King Lear make us see what otherwise we might not." [...] Eastman also rescues Hazlitt's political commentary, which, however abrasive it might be, [...] "opens such questions" [...] for general discussion, [...] "so that {{the politics of the}} plays enters into the arena of interpretation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> dignified way." ...|$|E
500|$|The glass {{industry}} was a principal employer and a generator of wealth for its owners. Well known for glass production throughout the Arab world, Western travellers to Palestine in the 19th century provided {{descriptions of the}} Hebron {{glass industry}} as well. For example, Ulrich Jasper Seetzen noted during his travels in Palestine in 1807-09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron, while later, <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>New</b> <b>and</b> Complete History of the Holy Bible as Contained in the Old and New Testaments (1844), Robert Sears writes, [...] "The population of Hebron is considerable: the inhabitants manufacture glass lamps, which are exported to Egypt.

Benigno gave the performance a [...] "B+", while Michael Slezak of TVLine gave it an [...] "A−" [...] and praised their [...] "powerful, evocative voices". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman was not impressed and characterized it as [...] "Lite FM snooze that {{does nothing to}} showcase these Broadway belters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> exciting way", and Amy Lee of The Huffington Post named it [...] "pretty bland".

500|$|After the war, Lang's {{primary cause}} {{was that of}} church unity. In 1920, as {{chairman}} of the Reunion Committee at the Sixth Lambeth Conference, he promoted an [...] "Appeal to all Christian People", described by Hastings as [...] "one of the rare historical documents that does not get forgotten with the years". It was unanimously adopted as the Conference's Resolution 9, and ended: [...] "We... ask that all should unite <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> great endeavour to recover and to manifest to the world the unity of the Body of Christ for which He prayed." [...] Despite initial warmth from the English Free Churches, little could be achieved in terms of practical union between episcopal and non-episcopal churches, and the initiative was allowed to lapse. Historically, the Appeal is considered the starting-point for the more successful ecumenical efforts of later generations.|$|E

2500|$|A related claim, {{especially}} in the UK, is that the cannabidiol/THC ratio has decreased {{over the past few}} decades, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>and</b> presumably more dangerous form of cannabis that never existed before (since CBD is thought to attenuate some of the negative side effects of THC). [...] While there is little to no reliable data before 2005 on such ratios in the UK, making comparisons to the past impossible, the US data going back to the 1970s shows little to no clear trend, and there have always been strains with extremely low ratios. Ratios are also known to vary widely between strains and growing/harvesting methods.|$|E
