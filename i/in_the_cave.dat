5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Ramachandran {{was an avid}} fan {{of action}} heroes like Errol Flynn, John Barrymore, and Douglas Fairbanks.

5|$|A {{man from}} Glastonbury {{is engaged to}} a girl from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks the witch into the cave and she hides in a dark corner {{near one of the}} {{underground}} rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it at the dark parts of the cave where the witch was hiding. The blessed water immediately petrifies the witch, and she remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> to this day.|$|E
5|$|Although Kwee was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of realism in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes {{a degree of}} mysticism, {{as evidenced by the}} apparent connection between the statue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and the eruption of Krakatoa. Indeed, in many of his writings (both fiction and non-fiction), Kwee exhibited an interest in the occult; this includes writing detailed depictions of Therese Neumann, a fasting girl from Germany; and Omar Khayyám, a Persian Sufi mystic, philosopher and poet. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo finds the mystical elements (and the fact that no Hindu-era statues with inscriptions have been found) detract from the overall value of the novel.|$|E

25|$|They have {{distinctive}} styles {{which do}} not compare with the Gupta period sculptures of North India. <b>In</b> these <b>caves,</b> <b>the</b> carvings of {{the faces of the}} human figures are oval shaped with high cheekbones. The body looks slim with tapering limbs. They have several striking mythological scenes carved in relief. Vishnu rescuing the earth, Vishnu taking three strides, and Gaja Laksmi and Durga are all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adi-Varaha <b>Cave.</b> Mahishasura Mardhini is in Durga Cave. Krishna lifting mountain is seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pancha-Panadava <b>cave.</b> <b>The</b> relief carving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pallava <b>caves</b> is generally shallower than <b>the</b> Deccan <b>caves.</b> <b>The</b> main figures are slender, delicate and elegant. Their hair dresses and crowns are simple and they show no jewellery. Another particular feature noted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> is that <b>the</b> lingas are individual carvings and in prismatic shape.

Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Walter Skinner's (Mitch Pileggi) office, Mulder {{begins to}} doubt once more {{that they are}} free at all, asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once users know they are hallucinating. Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves his point by {{shooting}} Skinner in the chest; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds. Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Mulder sticks his hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them to the safety of an ambulance. Once inside the ambulance, Mulder and Scully weakly hold hands.|$|E
5000|$|San rock {{paintings}} are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls of <b>the</b> sacred <b>caves.</b> These paintings show that communities of hunter-gatherers lived inside these <b>caves.</b> <b>The</b> artwork <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> {{is described as}} having a 'spiritual dimension' as the art displays trance experiences, unrealistic appearing animals, and other strange figures. The trances were achieved through rhythmic dancing and clapping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b> <b>The</b> trance {{is described as a}} 'feeling of transformation into the spiritual realm' where the people have the ability to fight evil spirits with the protection of animal power. Ancient {{paintings are}} still visible, however they are continuously being eroded by natural elements and cattle. Newer symbols written in English are also found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b> Many of these tell the stories of how HIV/AIDS has caused destruction <b>in</b> many of <b>the</b> local communities.|$|R

5|$|Diving at Wookey resumed {{in early}} June 1946 when Balcombe used his {{homemade}} respirator and waterproof suit {{to explore the}} region between the resurgence and first chamber, {{as well as the}} underground course of the river between the third and first chambers. During these dives, the Romano-British remains were found and archaeological work dominated the early dives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> The large ninth chamber was first entered on 24 April 1948 by Balcombe and Don Coase. Using this as an advance dive base, the 10th and then 11th chambers were discovered. The way on, however, was too deep for divers breathing pure oxygen from a closed-circuit rebreather. The cave claimed its first life on 9 April 1949 when Gordon Marriott lost his life returning from the ninth chamber. Another fatality was to occur in 1981 when Keith Potter was drowned on a routine dive further upstream.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Willson {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. From 1910 to 1919, he served on the Harvard University Board of Overseers. In 1914, he was {{a candidate for the}} Senate seat of Johnson Camden. It was the state's first senatorial election since passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, meaning the seat would be filled by popular vote rather than by a vote of the legislature. The seat had originally belonged to former governor Bradley, who had died in office. Governor McCreary appointed Camden to fill the unexpired term, but Camden had agreed not to seek re-election so that J. C. W. Beckham could run for the seat. In the Republican primary, Willson defeated Richard P. Ernst. In the general election, the unpopularity of Willson's gubernatorial administration combined with the overwhelming popularity of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, ensured that Beckham won the seat by more than 32,000 votes. This campaign was Willson's last. He died on August 24, 1931, and is buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cave</b> Hill Cemetery in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{described}} in 1903 by Guillaume Grandidier from subfossil material collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar. The Hypogeomys material {{was similar to the}} living Hypogeomys antimena, but distinct enough for Grandidier to recognize it as a separate species, different in size and some morphological details. Grandidier described another subfossil Hypogeomys species in 1912, H.boulei, but the material that species was based on was later identified as the enigmatic mammal Plesiorycteropus. In 1946, Charles Lamberton illustrated another femur (upper leg bone) of H.australis; the origin and current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown. In 1996, Steven Goodman and Daniel Rakotondravony reviewed the distribution of Hypogeomys and confirmed that H.australis is a distinct species. H.australis and H.antimena are classified together within the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E
