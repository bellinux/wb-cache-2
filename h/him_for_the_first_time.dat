5|$|When I met <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> {{he was a}} {{few years}} younger than I am now, and I was barely on the edge of manhood. He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E
5|$|As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses {{worn by the}} Parthian kings {{changed over}} time. The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign show <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The former {{captain of}} the Black Pearl is resurrected during this film; however, he does not appear until the final shot before the credits. Having met his demise in the {{previous}} installment, Barbossa is resurrected by Tia Dalma and agrees to rescue Jack Sparrow {{in order to save}} the Black Pearl. For this role, Rush was uncredited to keep his return a surprise. The DVD commentary said that not even the cast of the movie knew that Rush would return his character, and that the expressions on the characters' faces when seeing <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in three years were real.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match of the 1922–23 season, Woodfull scored 74 {{run out and}} four not out as Victoria scraped past the Marylebone Cricket Club by two wickets. The next match against New South Wales was Woodfull's first against Victoria's arch-rivals. Woodfull made 47 in the first innings before being {{dismissed}} by Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey. After exactly 300 first-class runs, a bowler had dismissed <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> He then made an unbeaten 84 to steer his team to a seven-wicket victory. He showed a liking for the South Australian bowlers, scoring 0, 115, 123 and 94 not out as Victoria won both of their matches against the aforementioned team. He ended his first full season with 598 runs at 74.75. Despite this, Victoria lost the Sheffield Shield to New South Wales on scoring difference; both teams had finished equal on points.|$|E
5|$|Summer invites Ryan {{to a party}} {{after the}} show, and Ryan convinces Seth to join <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> Seth is {{introduced}} to the sex-, drug-, and alcohol-fueled side of Newport. He experiences the wildness of a party for the first time, while Ryan flirts with Marissa. Luke takes a girl to the beach. Later at the party, Ryan rebuffs an intoxicated Summer, but Seth misinterprets the encounter and reveals Ryan's real background. Seth walks down the beach, and is bullied {{by a group of}} water polo players that includes Luke. Ryan defends Seth by punching Luke, but Luke's friends intervene and beat up Ryan and Seth. After returning to the Cohens, Ryan sees that Marissa's friends left her passed out on her drive; he carries her to the Cohens' pool house to sleep. When Kirsten finds Seth and Ryan asleep in the pool house the next morning, she is unhappy with Ryan's new influence and insists to Sandy that Ryan leaves.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} game, the Xbox {{exclusive}} Halo 4, Cortana wakes the Chief when forces from an Ex-Covenant splinter faction attack {{the remains of}} the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn, then crashes with him on Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins showing strange signs and behavior: vocal and graphic glitches, irrational behavior and a tendency to become irritable or angered. Their cause is soon revealed: Cortana's operation beyond her seven-year lifespan and her interaction with the Halo installations and the Flood have caused her to become Rampant, a state of over-knowledge that makes AIs 'think' themselves to death. Helped by the Master Chief and kept safe from the captain of the Infinity, who wishes to delete her, she helps in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans, and stops his scheme to convert all of humanity into his mechanical Promethean army using the Composer. In doing so, she has to fragment her various rampant personalities and upload them into the system, which first brings down the shields around the central core, then enables her to save Master Chief from the Didact. In a final act of love, she shields the Master Chief when he destroys the Composer, then, using the last of her energy to manifest as a solid hologram, she bids a final farewell to the Chief, managing to touch <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

He's big, but he has a really good swing. It's not like a big guy. It's short, compact. It's not just the home runs. The guy has a pretty good idea how to hit.|$|E
25|$|Early in his top {{division}} career Kisenosato {{was involved}} in some controversial bouts with yokozuna Asashōryū. He defeated <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in September 2006, and was awarded the Outstanding Performance Prize. Shaken by this, Asashōryū responded in the next tournament by leaping to the side at the tachi-ai and employing a highly unusual leg kicking technique called ketaguri. Afterwards Asashōryū was criticised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee for using this rare move. In March 2007 Kisenosato slapped Asashōryū around the face during their match. Asashōryū was so riled by this that he gave Kisenosato a small kick in the back after the bout was over, which prompted much criticism from the Japanese media.|$|E
25|$|The fifth set {{would turn}} out to be an {{historic}} battle. Both players were dominant on serve throughout the first sixteen games without a single break point opportunity to be had. A moment of crisis arrived for Federer with him serving at 8-8 down 15-40, but he rallied to deny Roddick the opportunity to serve for the match. There was not another break opportunity until Roddick served at 14-15 and Federer broke <b>him,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in the entire match, to win a record shattering fifteenth Grand Slam championship. This set remains the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam final. It is the only time in Grand Slam final history where a player has lost despite only having their serve broken once.|$|E

25|$|In 1969–70, when Australia toured South Africa, Gleeson's {{value was}} such that he insured his right hand for A$10,000. Gleeson took 18 wickets in two first class matches against provincial team {{at the start of}} the tour and then another five in the First Test at Cape Town, and five in the second innings in the Third Test in Johannesburg. Most of the South Africans were seeing <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> and {{struggled}} to understand his action. It was Barry Richards, the most junior of them, who claimed to have worked him out. Not once in seven innings did Gleeson, who took 19 wickets at 38.94 in the series, dismiss Richards, as South Africa took a 4–0 series win.|$|E
25|$|One rainy night, {{the girls}} are waiting for Tatsuo's bus and grow worried when he doesn't arrive on the bus they expect him on.

Totoro is delighted at both the shelter and the sounds made upon it by falling raindrops. In return, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds. A bus-shaped giant cat halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it, taking the umbrella. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives.|$|E
