50|$|Engine V-01 {{was first}} run on 12 October 1956 on <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> 2 in {{building}} complex 62 under reduced load for about 2.5h. Pushing the engine under full load {{was not possible}} at this time, the reason being the use of non-heat-resistant materials as those were not available domestically.|$|E
50|$|Virtually {{none of the}} old airport area {{exists as}} it did prior to European settlement. Only the {{foundations}} of the Eagle Farm Settlement survive, having been covered with fill in 1942.

50|$|TradeCoast Central is a fully {{integrated}} masterplanned corporate office park and industrial {{community on the}} former Eagle Farm Brisbane Airport site adjacent to the Gateway Arterial Motorway. Three notable heritage sites lie within Trade Coast Central, the convict era Eagle Farm Agricultural Establishment, Women's Prison and Female Factory and the World War Two Allison <b>Engine</b> <b>Testing</b> <b>Stands.</b>|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{features of the}} six open <b>engine</b> <b>testing</b> <b>stands</b> constructed in 1942 are the six reinforced concrete walls which separated the <b>testing</b> <b>stands</b> and provided a degree of protection against excessive noise or a propeller malfunction. Stands 1 to 4, numbered from the north, have been constructed on a raised concrete platform 40 cm above ground level. Parts of its flooring have been raised higher above the general level of the platform. They indicate the positions where each engine stand and its respective control cabin would have stood.|$|R

50|$|The DB 604 was a {{completely}} new Daimler-Benz engine design featuring a perfectly square stroke ratio of 135 mm x 135 mm. The short stroke ratio enabled the relatively high engine speed of 3,200 rpm. The first engine tested in 1939 on the <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> achieved a power output of 1,725 kW (2,350 hp).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to just perform aerodynamic measurements proving correct <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> functionality, {{as well as to}} test oil circulation on a completed engine. Yet, {{the decision was made to}} let the engine freely run on its own power. After five start attempts, ignition was achieved, the jet carefully reaching 6200rpm. No disruptions were recorded.|$|E
50|$|The Allison <b>Engine</b> <b>testing</b> <b>stands</b> site {{is part of}} Brisbane's TradeCoast Central at the old Brisbane {{airport site}} in the suburb of Eagle Farm, where new and rebuilt World War II Allison V-12 in-line liquid cooled aero <b>engines</b> were <b>tested</b> {{in the open air}} prior to fitting into {{reassembled}} WW2 aircraft, notably the P38-Lightning, Curtis Kittyhawk and Bell Airacobra. The masonry sections of the remains, being buildings and dividers between the <b>engine</b> <b>testing</b> bays, are largely intact. The engines were refurbished in the General Motors Holden (GMH) Breakfast Creek facility. Many of the workers in the GMH facility were women.|$|R
5000|$|Information {{gathered}} {{through the}} sensors is often processed and logged through data acquisition systems. Actuators allow for attaining a desired engine state (often {{characterized as a}} unique combination of engine torque and speed). For gasoline engines, the actuators may include an intake throttle actuator, a loading device for the engine such as an induction motor. The <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stands</b> are often custom-packaged considering requirements of the OEM customer. They often include microcontroller-based feedback control systems with following features: ...|$|R
50|$|First they {{operated}} {{from the}} buildings of HV-18 (Hauptverwaltung 18, {{which was established}} earlier, in 1951/1952), until construction work for the engine development works started {{in the summer of}} 1955. A new design and administration building, almost identical to the one in Dresden located at Factory 801, was constructed. Two large assembly and manufacturing plants, several <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stands</b> (with their characteristic towers), large underground tanks intended for test runs, other halls and social facilities, plus housing for the workers were finished.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its release Ducati claimed that the 1199 Panigale was the world's most {{powerful}} production twin-cylinder engine motorcycle, with [...] at 10,750 rpm, and [...] torque at 9000 rpm on an <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand.</b> With a claimed dry weight of 164 kg and a kerb weight of 188 kg. Ducati said the 1199 had the highest power-to-weight and torque-to-weight ratios of production motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engineering}} and development work of the second-generation engine was done in-house, by Virgin Galactic. The work began on the new formulation for the hybrid engine in 2013, and by May 2014—when SNC's involvement with SS2 propulsion using the first-generation rocket motor was ended—the new engine formulation had already completed full-duration burns of over 60 seconds in ground tests on an <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{automotive}} industry also uses drive shafts at testing plants.At an <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> a drive shaft {{is used to}} transfer a certain speed or torque from {{the internal combustion engine}} to a dynamometer.A [...] "shaft guard" [...] is used at a shaft connection to protect against contact with the drive shaft andfor detection of a shaft failure.At a transmission test stand a drive shaft connects the prime mover with the transmission.|$|E
50|$|On January 29, 1920, President Wilson {{appointed}} pioneering flier and aviation engineer Orville Wright to NACA's board.

NACA researchers pursued this mission through the agency's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels, <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>stands,</b> and flight <b>test</b> facilities.
