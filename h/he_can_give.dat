5|$|Elephants {{have been}} the subject of {{religious}} beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, near the Niger Delta, buried their leaders with elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> people success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human. In Islamic tradition, the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant. Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.|$|E

She tells the butler that she has said goodnight to her uncle and that he doesn’t want to be disturbed. The two leave.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta's normal {{speaking}} voice {{does not}} bear any resemblance to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin {{to his chest}} and is said to [...] "let his I.Q. go". While in this state, he has ad-libbed several of Homer's least intelligent comments, such as the line [...] "I am so smart, s-m-r-t" [...] from [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] (season five, 1993) which was a genuine mistake made by Castellaneta during recording. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and he tries to visualize a scene so that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, [...] "except, maybe, by a die-hard fan".|$|E

The Black Guardian reminds Turlough of their bargain, and says that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> up the diamond, or sacrifice the Doctor to gain both Enlightenment and the TARDIS. Turlough hurls the diamond at the Black Guardian, who vanishes in screams and flames. The Doctor points out that Enlightenment was not the diamond, but the choice itself.|$|E
500|$|When Mears went to {{audition}} for the role, he was asked, [...] "Why do we need an actor {{as opposed to just}} a guy in a mask?" [...] Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work, in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> the character more life on camera.|$|E

As the group is ready to leave, Zauriel appears, dismisses Batman and Deadman, and follows through on his promise to erase the Phantom Stranger from existence. Wonder Woman and her team track Pandora to the prison where Lex Luthor is held. Pandora approaches Luthor, hoping that he can open the box. Before she can give it to him, Wonder Woman and her group arrive to retrieve the box. Upon touching the box, Wonder Woman is apparently possessed just as Superman was.|$|E

[...] In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that [...] "the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time {{on this side of the}} Atlantic." [...] Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote [...] "When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give,</b> for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all.

500|$|Kelsey Grammer {{initially}} expected Sideshow Bob to be {{a one-time}} role, and calls him [...] "the most popular character I've ever played". Grammer usually joins the show's [...] "table readings" [...] (wherein cast members read each script {{together for the}} first time), and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh. In a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying [...] "his voice is so rich." [...] Writer George Meyer commented that [...] "writing for Kelsey is great, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give.

500|$|Except for {{the short}} film I Am That Change whose music was {{composed}} by Sai Karthik, Sukumar chose Devi Sri Prasad to compose the soundtrack and background score for the films he directed. Sukumar worked with cinematographer R. Rathnavelu for Arya, Jagadam, and 1: Nenokkadine. When Raju asked Sukumar about the budget to be allotted to Arya, Sukumar said that he first wants Rathnavelu on board. In an interview to The Hindu in March 2012, Rathnavelu said, [...] "Sukumar's speciality is <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> you five different ways to solve every problem you encounter.

Because of their friendship with Sukumar, neither Rathnavelu nor Prasad charged any remuneration for his maiden production venture Kumari 21F. For Arya 2, he collaborated with R. D. Rajasekhar.

500|$|Castellaneta is {{most famous}} {{for his role as}} Homer Simpson on the longest running {{animated}} television show The Simpsons. The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson rather than hire more actors. Homer's voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not [...] "get enough power behind that voice" [...] and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions. He tried to find something easier, so he [...] "dropped the voice down", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest, and is said to [...] "let his IQ go."

500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|E

Dissatisfied with the stone that serves as his throne, he commands the other turtles to stack themselves beneath him so that he can see farther and expand his kingdom. However, the stacked turtles are in pain and Mack, the turtle at the very bottom of the pile, is suffering the most. Mack asks Yertle for a respite, but Yertle just tells him to be quiet. Then Yertle decides to expand his kingdom and commands more and more turtles to add to his throne. Mack makes a second request for a respite because the increased weight is now causing extreme pain to the turtles {{at the bottom of the}} pile, as well as hunger. Again, Yertle yells at Mack to be quiet. Then Yertle notices the moon rising above him as the night approaches. Furious that something [...] "dares to be higher than Yertle the King", he decides to call for even more turtles in an attempt to rise above it. However, before <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> the command, Mack decides he has had enough. He burps, which takes away Yertle's throne and tosses the turtle king off the turtle stack and into the water, leaving him [...] "King of the Mud" [...] and freeing the others.|$|E

The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{thought it was a}} [...] "confident finale" [...] to the fifth season, which [...] "had seen the series become progressively more surreal and self-aware." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that he thought the episode ended the season with a [...] "high note", and that Homer’s insensitive gossiping about his relationship [...] "presents lots of good bits. It completes this excellent year well." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was [...] "This is a place of learning, not a house of hearing about things!", which Homer tells his class after they demand him to reveal more secrets about him and Marge. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A−, and commented that episodes focusing on the relationship between Homer and Marge can [...] "never fail", and there are [...] "numerous opportunities for some classic Homer-isms" [...] in the episode. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. One-time Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] his fifth favorite episode of the show, and commented that Homer's line to Marge, [...] "I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence," [...] is [...] "so sweet, because he's right!" [...] It was placed at number seven on MSNBCs top ten The Simpsons episodes list. They felt the episode embodied Homer's qualities of being [...] "stupid, good-natured and mildly pathetic, [...] from his conversations with his brain [...] to his final proclamation that the one thing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> Marge that no one else can is 'complete and utter dependence'." ...|$|E
