50|$|Three {{men were}} {{required}} to manage a furnace. One maintained the fire and added <b>cold</b> <b>shot,</b> a second man removed heated shot from the furnace, and the third man cleaned them. Special tools {{were required to}} handle heated shot: an iron fork {{was used to remove}} heated shot from the furnace, then the shot was placed on a stand and cleaned by rubbing off any loose surface scales with a rasp. A pair of tongs with circular jaws were used to pick up and handle the shot at the furnace. To carry the shot to the cannons, hot shot ladles were used. The ladles had an iron cup for the shot with one or three handles. Round shot less than 24 lb weight size could be carried by one man with a single-handle ladle, while larger shot needed a three-handle ladle, carried between two men like a stretcher.|$|R

5000|$|Otis, {{primarily}} {{known as}} a guitarist, also sings and plays a multitude of other instruments. While growing up with and being heavily influenced by many blues, jazz and R&B musicians in his father Johnny's immediate circle, Otis began to gravitate towards the popular music of his generation such as Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix, and Arthur Lee of the band Love. In 1969, Al Kooper asked Otis to be the featured guest on the second installment (Kooper Session) of the Super Session album series that had previously included Stephen Stills and Mike Bloomfield. Kooper and the then-fifteen-year-old Otis recorded the whole album over one weekend in New York. Immediately returning to Los Angeles, Otis, along {{with his father and}} singer Delmar [...] "Mighty Mouth" [...] Evans, performed on the album <b>Cold</b> <b>Shot,</b> released in 1969 on the Los Angeles-based Kent label. Another obscure album this three-man team recorded was the extremely rare and risque Snatch & The Poontangs, on which Otis recorded tracks under the pseudonym [...] "Prince Wunnerful".|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} Sr {{addition}} and pressure increase on the microstructure and casting defects of a low-pressure die cast (LPDC) AlSi 7 Mg 0. 3 alloy have been studied. Metallographic and image analysis techniques {{have been used}} to quantitatively examine the microstructural changes and the amount of porosity occurring at different Sr levels and pressure parameters. The results indicate that an increase in the filling pressure induces lower heat dissipation of the liquid close to the die/core surfaces, with the formation of slightly greater dendrite arms and coarser eutectic Si particles. On the other hand, the increase in the Sr level leads to finer microstructural scale and eutectic Si. The analysed variables, within the experimental conditions, do not affect the morphology of eutectic Si particles. Higher applied pressure and Sr content generate castings with lower amount of porosity. However, as the filling pressure increases the flow of metal inside the die cavity is more turbulent, leading to the formation of oxide films and <b>cold</b> <b>shots.</b> In the analysed range of experimental conditions, the design of experiment methodology and the analysis of variance {{have been used to}} develop statistical models that accurately predict the average size of secondary dendrite arm spacing and the amount of porosity in the low-pressure die cast AlSi 7 Mg 0. 3 alloy...|$|R
5000|$|A hot shot furnace was {{typically}} a free-standing brick structure with special iron racks and grates, varying in size {{according to the}} number of round shot they were to heat and the number of cannon they served - a large furnace might hold 60 or more round shot. They were commonly 6 to 8 ft wide, and anything from 8 to 30 ft in length. A brick chimney was situated at one end with a firebox located in the front or side of the opposite end. The interior of the furnace was lined with fire brick and had sloping iron rails sized to hold round <b>shot.</b> <b>Cold</b> round <b>shots</b> were placed in the furnace and allowed to roll down the inclined rails in rows. The first shots halted over the firebox at the low end and were heated [...] "cherry red", approximately between 800 and 900 C. When they were removed, the next shots rolled down to take their place and be similarly heated. Care had to be taken not to over-heat the shot as any that were hotter than [...] "cherry red" [...] were likely to become misshapen, and jam in the bore of the gun.|$|R

This pa-per reviews residual-stress-based life extension techniques and published work on the use of these techniques in aerospace applications.

Time-dependent quasi-one-dimensional and axisymmetric numerical simulations of complete shock tube flow are compared with experimental pressure traces recorded at the NASA Ames electric-arc driven shock tube facility (from <b>cold</b> driver <b>shots).</b> Of particular interest is the interaction between the reflected shock wave and the boundary layer. Evidence of the shock bifurcation caused by this interaction is clearly seen in the present experimental data. The axisymmetric simulations reproduce this phenomenon and demonstrate how this interaction can provide a mechanism for driver gas to contaminate the stagnation region. The simulations incorporate finite-rate chemistry, a moving mesh and laminar viscosity...|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{grew up in}} {{the country}} close to his cousin and fellow blues man, Little Smokey Smothers. [...] "Shot" [...] moved to Detroit in 1954 and to Chicago in 1958. He joined Smothers there and began singing with Smokey's band in 1960 and a few years later joined Magic Sam's band as a vocalist. In 1962, Williams {{recorded}} his first singles for Chicago's Foxy label, [...] "Hello Baby" [...] and [...] "I'm Trying". He recorded a series of singles for other labels, including King/Federal, Palos, Gamma, Shama and Tchula. His 1964 recording [...] "Welcome to the Club" [...] was a hit in Chicago, and was later covered by Little Milton for Checker Records in 1965. Another regional hit, [...] "I Like Your Style", came out in 1969 and was covered by Junior Parker. Several more singles followed including the popular [...] "Drop Your Laundry Baby". His first album under his own name, Country Disco, was released on the Roots label in 1977. In the 1980s, Williams released a slew of singles on labels including Tchula, 4-Way, True & Dis-Muke. He released an album on cassette with many of these cuts called I Like Your Style. In 1994, the Japanese label Vivid Sound released an album called, A Shot of Rhythm and Blues, containing tracks Williams recorded in Memphis apparently for (but not released by) Quinton Claunch's SoulTrax imprint. The Black Magic label decided to give Lee a [...] "Shot" [...] behind his own band.

Shot peening is employed for imparting residual stresses by means of <b>cold</b> work. <b>Shot</b> peening is a complex random process with many input variables. The material responses include residual stresses, cold work, surface roughness, micro-cracks and micro-structure changes. To obtain the maximum fatigue strength, the designer needs to consider both favorable and detrimental aspects of these responses together.
