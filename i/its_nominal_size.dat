This is roughly equivalent to the pipe's internal diameter in inches or millimeters. However, it is the external diameter of the pipe that is kept constant between changes in wall thickness, {{in order to maintain}} compatibility in joints and fittings. Consequently, the internal diameter varies, sometimes significantly, from <b>its</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>size.</b> Nominal pipe sizes vary from 3 inches up to 64 inches, in increments of at least 1 inch, in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The {{framework}} hydrophobicity {{and flexibility}} of ZIF- 8 are investigated by a detailed adsorption and diffusion {{study of a}} series of probe molecules including ethanol, 1 -butanol, water, hexane isomers, xylene isomers, and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene. The prospects for using ZIF- 8 in biofuel recovery and hydrocarbon separations are discussed in terms of adsorption or kinetic selectivities. ZIF- 8 shows extremely low water vapor uptakes and is especially suitable for vapor phase butanol-based biofuel recovery. The extraordinary framework flexibility of ZIF- 8 is demonstrated by the adsorption of hydrocarbon molecules that are much larger than <b>its</b> <b>nominal</b> pore <b>size,</b> such as m-xylene, o-xylene and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene. The calculation of corrected diffusion coefficients reveals an interesting spectrum of promising kinetic hydrocarbon separations by ZIF- 8. These findings confirm that a molecular sieving effect tends to occur in the sorbate molecular size range of 4 - 6 Å rather than around the nominal ZIF- 8 pore size of 3. 4 Å, due to its surprising framework flexibility. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
30|$|These {{variations}} can {{again be}} explained with an increasing molecular and conformational {{changes in the}} smaller size fractions obtained during the HPSEC separation. In fact, not only lower molecular size in the smaller F 6 size fraction justifies an enhanced proton diffusivity, but also the larger amount of hydrophilic molecules in F 6 may limit further aggregation size and, thus, diffusivity. In fact, hydroxylated alkyl chains were also evident in DOSY spectra (Figure  5 G), in which the projection of several alkyl protons, resonating at 1.35, 1.6, 2.1, and 2.3  ppm, were placed relatively downward (greater diffusivity) than lipid signals. It may thus be inferred that the F 6 size fraction contained two populations of aggregates: the larger aggregates made of lipid components and the smaller ones constituted mainly by hydrophilic components. The presence of both kinds of small associated compounds in the same size fraction is consistent with <b>its</b> small <b>nominal</b> molecular <b>size.</b>|$|R
40|$|Mira {{variables}} change {{visual light}} {{by up to}} 8 magnitudes over their roughly yearly cycle. Here we present a simple explanation for the extremely large amplitudes of light curves of oxygen-rich Mira variables. Metallic oxides, such as TiO, form throughout the stellar atmosphere as the star cools when approaching minimum light. When this happens, the visual light can be almost completely absorbed at large radii, extending the visual photosphere to nearly twice <b>its</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>size.</b> At these large radii, temperatures can fall to ≈ 1400 K and essentially all of the star’s radiation emerges in the infrared. Since almost no optical light is emitted at these low temperatures, Mira variables can decrease their visual light {{by more than a}} thousand-fold and almost “disappear ” to the human eye.

40|$|Dramatically {{expanded}} routine {{adoption of}} the Bayesian approach has substantially increased the need to assess both the confirmatory and contradictory information in our prior distribution {{with regard to the}} information provided by our likelihood function. We propose a diagnostic 15 approach that starts with the familiar posterior matching method. For a given likelihood model, we identify the difference in information needed to form two likelihood functions that, when combined respectively with a given prior and a baseline prior, will lead to the same posterior uncertainty. In cases with independent, identically distributed samples, sample size is the nat-ural measure of information, and this difference can be viewed as the prior data size M(k), 20 with regard to a likelihood function based on k observations. When there is no detectable prior-likelihood conflict relative to the baseline, M(k) is roughly constant over k, a constant that captures the confirmatory information. Otherwise M(k) tends to decrease with k because the contradictory prior detracts information from the likelihood function. In the case of extreme con-tradiction, M(k) /k will approach its lower bound − 1, representing a complete cancelation of 25 prior and likelihood information due to conflict. We also report an intriguing super-informative phenomenon where the prior effectively gains an extra (1 + r) − 1 percent of prior data size rela-tive to <b>its</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>size</b> when the prior mean coincides with the truth, where r is the percentage of the nominal prior data size relative to the total data size underlying the posterior. We demonstrate our method via several examples, including an application exploring the effect of immunoglobu- 30 lin levels on lupus nephritis. We also provide a theoretical foundation of our method for virtually all likelihood-prior pairs that possess asymptotic conjugacy.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that early interventional {{treatment}} of patients with high risk acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has a favourable effect on mortality. It is also known that coronary plaque rupture and atherothrombosis creates a mileu of necrotic and thrombotic material, which is difficult to treat. Moreover, angiographic assessment of coronary artery disease is highly flawed; 2 -dimensional luminal silhouettes are not ideal templates to guide very important interventions. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is the gold standard imaging tool able to delineate vessel dimensions, plaque burden, length and now with virtual histology (VH) - plaque composition. Despite optimal medical care and urgent revascularisation, 12 - 20 % of ACS patients will suffer a further major adverse cardiac event (MACE) at 30 months. Our aim was to evaluate the angiographic treatment of high risk ACS patients by performing IVUS-VH pre and post-intervention, with the operators blinded to the images. Our hypotheses for this work were as follows: 1. Significant compositional and structural differences exist between culprit, non-culprit and stable plaques when analysed by Virtual Histology. 2. The histologically most unstable plaque does not occur at the site of maximum angiographic stenosis (in culprit lesions). 3. Angiographically guided stent length selection and positioning is flawed, leaving unstable plaque behind in the reference segments. Following recruitment, 135 lesions split into: 70 ACS culprit; 20 ACS non-culprit and 35 Stable lesions underwent analysis for inter-observer and intra-observer variability. We were able to show good standard markers of correlation but a large repeatability co-efficent, for some outputs from the analysis. This has raised questions with regard to the ability of the technique to detect differences between plaque types. In relation to our main hypothesis, {{we have been able to}} show structural and compositional volume differences between “active” ACS plaques (n= 70) and “stable” angina plaques (n= 35). We have used the most important of these to generate a plaque risk score based upon ROC statistics and logistic regression. The most important discriminators were: Remodelling index at the minimum lumen area; Plaque Burden; Presence of VH-TCFA; minimum lumen area (MLA) < 4 mm 2 and necrotic core to dense calcium ratio (NC/DC). The subsequent risk model was tested on an independent, blinded cohort of plaques from the Thoraxcentre, Rotterdam (n= 50). This confirmed good discriminatory power for the equation (AUC – 0. 71). Within this hypothesis we also explored the differences in individual areas of plaque. At two separate sites (MLA and MAX NC) in each lesion type (ACS and stable) n= 210, we showed that the MAX NC site lies proximal to the MLA in most cases and contains more positively remodelled plaque disease with less calcification. This is important as positively remodeled plaque disease is often not visible on a plain coronary angiogram when treating ACS lesions. Finally, as a follow on from thie previous chapter, we examined the treatment of ACS lesions by blinded IVUS examination. The operator completed their stent procedure with only angiographic guidance. We were able to show in 56 ACS lesions that systematic errors of judgement occur related to sizing of the vessel, the choice of stent sizes and the subsequent stent deployment. 36 %, 40 % and 65. 5 % of stents met three separate standard criteria for good stent deployment. Moreover, between 5 - 40 % of stents had some form of significant abnormality. With regard to the sizing of stents to the vessel, the mean reference vessel size was 10. 58 mm 2 (± 2. 51) yet the minimum stent area achieved was only 6. 79 mm 2 (± 2. 43). If the stent that was chosen had been symmetrically deployed to <b>its</b> <b>nominal</b> <b>size</b> (e. g 2. 5; 3. 0; 3. 5) then the stent area achievable should have been 8. 87 mm 2 (± 2. 68).

The aims {{of this study were}} to measure the orifice size and compare biologic equivalence in six bileaflet mechanical heart valve designs. MethodsThe inflow aspect of each of 29 valves was photographed then digitized, and the maximum internal diameter and orifice area were calculated. Biologic equivalence was assessed with a series of machined polypropylene blocks. ResultsThe orifice area ranged between 159 and 222 mm 2 for the six size 19 valves. The internal diameter ranged from 1. 6 to 4. 6 mm less than the manufacturer’s <b>nominal</b> <b>size.</b> Biologic equivalence assessed from an estimate of tissue annulus diameter with machined blocks ranged from 1. 0 and 3. 5 mm larger than <b>nominal</b> <b>size</b> for the intra-annular valves.
