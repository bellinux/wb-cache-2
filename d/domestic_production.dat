Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate <b>domestic</b> <b>production</b> and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
5|$|After Loetoeng Kasaroeng was released, {{numerous}} domestic {{films were}} made. The second <b>domestic</b> <b>production,</b> Eulis Atjih (1927), {{was directed by}} Krugers and received a wider release. With the release of Lily van Java (Lily of Java) in 1928, ethnic Chinese {{became involved in the}} industry; by 1940 native directors had become common. However, the first truly Indonesian film is considered to be Usmar Ismail's Darah dan Doa (The Long March) in 1950, released after the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence in 1949.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{deregulation}} of the Taiwanese film exhibition industry in the late 1990 s, local movie theatres have increasingly spurned <b>domestic</b> <b>productions</b> in favour of more dependable Hollywood blockbusters.

This article explores the historical development of this practice and examines how it has helped some filmmakers overcome the structural and economic constraints that affect <b>domestic</b> <b>productions</b> at the cinema.

5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected <b>domestic</b> <b>production.</b> Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing <b>domestic</b> <b>production</b> of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
5|$|The {{first showing}} of {{films in the}} Dutch East Indies was in 1900, {{and over the next}} twenty years foreign productions– {{generally}} from the United States– were imported and shown throughout the country. <b>Domestic</b> <b>production</b> of documentaries had begun in 1911 but were unable to compete with imported works. By 1923 a local feature film production spearheaded by the Middle East Film Co. was announced, but the work was not completed.|$|E

5|$|Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (Take My Song; 1952), was {{a musical}} about an old, impoverished {{musician}} who sells his saxophone {{to help his}} former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, {{when he returned to}} Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased with the work, stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed these lessons closely. This was followed by Harimau Tjampa (Tiger from Tjampa) in 1953, a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father's death. Set amidst Minang culture, the film featured some of the first nudity in a <b>domestic</b> <b>production</b> and was a considerable critical success.|$|E
5|$|Njai Dasima was {{directed}} by Bachtiar Effendi for Tan's Film, a production company owned by the Tan brothers. With this {{he became the first}} native Indonesian film director in the Indies. It starred Momo and Oesman. The story was adapted from G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima, which Tan's had already adapted in 1929 with the same name for their first release. The story was already well known in Batavia (now Jakarta), in part because it was a popular part of stage performers' repertoires. To ensure the quality of the story, Effendi worked with a scenario and, later, shooting script– two items which had, until then, never been used for a <b>domestic</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Si Tjonat was {{released}} in 1929. Although a work of fiction, it was advertised as {{based on a true}} story; this had been common in works of Malay literature {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, including Tjerita Si Tjonat. The film was one in a line of <b>domestic</b> <b>production</b> targeted primarily at ethnic Chinese audiences, following Lily van Java and Setangan Berloemoer Darah (both 1928); film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that this was evident from the predominantly Chinese production team and cast. Native audiences also enjoyed the film, particularly its action sequences. Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes that it was of distinctly commercial orientation, meant only to turn a profit.|$|E
50|$|Afero also {{actively}} {{promoted the}} development of the cinema of Indonesia; in 1973, for instance, he shaved his head in protest of movie theatres' lack of interest in showing <b>domestic</b> <b>productions</b> and attempted to meet Jakarta governor Ali Sadikin.

5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than <b>domestic</b> <b>production,</b> not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
5|$|However, when {{a country}} is {{suffering}} from high unemployment or wishes to pursue a policy of export-led growth, a lower exchange rate {{can be seen as}} advantageous. From the early 1980s the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed devaluation as a potential solution for developing nations that are consistently spending more on imports than they earn on exports. A lower value for the home currency will raise the price for imports while making exports cheaper. This tends to encourage more <b>domestic</b> <b>production,</b> which raises employment and gross domestic product (GDP) – though the effect may not be immediate due to the Marshall–Lerner condition. Devaluation can be seen as an attractive solution to unemployment when other options, like increased public spending, are ruled out due to high public debt, or when a country has a balance of payments deficit which a devaluation would help correct. A reason for preferring devaluation common among emerging economies is that maintaining a relatively low exchange rate helps them build up foreign exchange reserves, which can protect against future financial crises.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low capital formation, {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State <b>Domestic</b> <b>Production</b> (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistence progress in {{quality of life and}} income of people cutting across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has been not much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center.|$|E

5|$|The four Borodino-class battlecruisers (also {{referred}} to as Izmail class) of the Imperial Russian Navy were all laid down in December 1912 at Saint Petersburg for service with the Baltic Fleet. Construction of the ships was delayed as many domestic factories were already overloaded with orders and some components had to be ordered from abroad. The start of World War I slowed their construction still further as the foreign orders were often not delivered and <b>domestic</b> <b>production</b> was diverted into things more immediately useful for the war effort. The ships were launched in 1915–16, but {{the outbreak of the}} Russian Revolution in 1917 put a stop to their construction, which never resumed. The Soviet Navy gave consideration to completing the ships; initially, Izmail and Borodino were looked at, with a view to finishing one or both to their original design, but the lack of available 12in guns, combined with the complexity of the originally designed electrical system, led to the idea being dropped. Subsequently, plans were raised to complete Kinburn and Navarin to a modified design with 16in guns, which again failed due to the difficulty in either obtaining guns from overseas, or manufacturing them domestically. Subsequent ideas included converting some of the hulls for cargo or passenger use, which again failed. The Navy made a serious proposal in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but this plan was later cancelled as a result of political maneuvering {{on the part of the}} Red Army. Eventually, all four hulls were broken up for scrap; the second, third and fourth were sold to a German company in 1923, while Izmail was broken up in Leningrad in 1931.|$|E
