40|$|Abstract:- The {{need for}} reliable, redundant, and clean power {{generation}} in power systems is becoming more importance. This need requires geographically-distributed power systems to be integrated as a single entity where among the main features of this integration are large data base and computing intensive. Hence the current power systems {{are not able to}} handle this huge datasets required for that integration, Grid Computing is a gateway to virtual storage media and processing power. This paper analyzes, describes and simulates the integration of modern power systems into grid computing technology. Paper begins by introducing grid computing as a technology, defining selected middleware. Two power implementations are illustrated, power load forecasting within traditional and grid computing based systems, and real time power system controlling and monitoring with grid computing technology integration to enhance power system reliability. Developed reliable backup system strategy has been achieved by implementing grid computing technology as an innovative <b>integration</b> <b>benefit...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyzes}} the international transmission and welfare implications of productivity gains {{and changes in}} market size when macroeconomic adjustment occurs both along the intensive margin of trade (changes in the relative price of existing varieties of tradable goods) and the extensive margin (creation and destruction of varieties). We draw a distinction between productivity gains that enhance manufacturing efficiency and gains that {{lower the cost of}} firms' entry and of product differentiation. Countries with lower manufacturing costs have higher GDP but supply their products at lower international prices. Instead, countries with lower entry costs supply a larger array of goods at improved terms of trade. Output growth driven by demographic expansions, as well as government spending, is associated with an improvement in international relative prices and firms' entry. While trade liberalization may result in a smaller array of goods available to consumers, efficiency gains from deeper economic <b>integration</b> <b>benefit</b> consumers via lower goods prices. The international transmission mechanism and the welfare spillovers vary under different asset market structures, depending on trade costs, the elasticity of labor supply, and consumers' taste for varieties...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this report is tohighlight the great work of {{cities around the country}} that have {{recognized}} the importance of welcoming and supporting immigrants, and to create a space for municipalities to form collaborative partnerships in the development and replication of successful practices in immigrant integration. The importance of facilitating communication and collaboration among City officials working on a shared immigrant integration agenda is based on the following: 1. That cities are experiencing the greatest impacts of globalization and migration; 2. That in order to remain competitive, cities must attract and retain newcomers; 3. That in the face of federal inaction and state interference, cities are left to respond to immigration-related challenges; 4. That immigrants, regardless of legal status, are residents of cities, and that all city residents must have equal access to services and resources in order to promote general welfare; and 5. That immigrants and immigrant <b>integration</b> <b>benefit</b> the civic, economic and cultural life of cities. Recognizing these realities, the NYC Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs has provided technical assistance and guidance to numerous cities across the United States and around the world to help them better serve their immigrant residents and allow them to thrive. This collaborative effort has the potential to generate enormous benefits for immigrants and their neighbors around the country and reshape the way cities think about service delivery. For the City of New York, serving immigrants is about smart policy-making, innovative responses to community needs, and cross-agency programmatic opportunities that better support immigrant New Yorkers. It is important for cities to recognize the assets, challenges, resources and opportunities their immigrant communities provide. Cities that make similar commitments to being immigrant friendly and welcoming immigrants will reap the rewards of increased civic participation, engagement and economic mobility among their residents and foster cultural and economic vibrancy in their citie...|$|E

One {{of the main}} challenges in today’s organizations is how to efficiently and effectively integrate legacy assets with other internal and external applications and business processes. If an organization has previously implemented enterprise resource planning (ERP) and other legacy systems and intends to integrate a business intelligence (BI) system, then BI and ERP integration might be challenging because of several factors. However, the challenges can be conquered with proper planning, and organizations can obtain massive benefits from their investments in ERP as well as BI systems.
