5000|$|The {{park has}} more than 70 rivers and streams, mostly fed by glaciers. The few lakes are small in size and also fed by glaciers and snow runoff. [...] The 45 lakes cover an area of only 11 {{hectares}} in total, while the 5 alpine marshes cover a total area of 103 hectares. [...] The main ridge and side ridge is composed of granites, gneisses, and schists, with the younger sedimentary rocks gathered in large fan-shaped folds. There are mineral springs in the upper valleys, waterfalls, <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> <b>glades</b> on terraces. Named glaciers include the Masota, Tana, Karuaugom, Songuti, Bart, Fastagstete, and Tasmazov.|$|R

50|$|The wattled ibis is a gregarious species, often {{flocking}} {{in groups}} of 30 to 100, but it also can be seen feeding alone or in pairs. It forages in open grasslands, marshes, open alpine moorlands, croplands <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> <b>glades.</b> When feeding it walks about methodologically, probing the ground regularly. It feeds on worms, insect larvae, and small invertebrates; occasionally frogs, snakes and mice. Sometimes it is seen with herds of domestic animals, searching dung for beetles. It roosts singly or in pairs in trees, in groups on rock cliffs, often at sites of breeding colonies. The wattled ibis is predominantly sedentary, undertaking only local, altitudinal movements.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the network of <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> in the {{cadastre}} unit of Suchovršice and suggest to supplement the network of unpaved roads.

Then there is a division of <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads according to the relevant standards ČSN. Another section is devoted to maintenance events, repairs <b>and</b> reconstructions of <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads. There are outlined the possibility of financing the construction of new roads. Follow a description of the most important objects on the <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> paths. In the practical part is defined area of interest including the broader territorial relations. Then there are described the current <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads in the area of interest, which were plotted to the map of road networks. This map is the result of performed detailed field research. On the basis of digitized map stable cadastre is described the road network in 1840. Due to the fact could be compared to road networks in two different time stages. The existing system of <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads is evaluated. For ratings are calculated densities of both types of roads in the area of interest. The calculated density of the <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads are assessed with an average density of roads in the Czech Republic. The density of <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads in the selected area is higher than the national average. This {{can be explained by the}} type of relief which corresponds hilly land type. Overall, the number and length of roads is sufficient. However, density of forest haul routes is insufficinet. Problematic is also the technical condition of rural roads in the selected area. Based on the analysis of historical and current road network is designed to complement the rural roads within the land adjustment. Land adjustment just underway, and draft routes can be used to compile Plan of common facilities...|$|R
60|$|Martin Eden nodded. He {{had caught}} a glimpse of the {{apparently}} illimitable vistas of knowledge. What he saw took on tangibility. His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form. In the alchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics <b>and</b> the whole <b>field</b> of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much landscape. The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> <b>glades,</b> all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights. In the distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze, but behind this purple haze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the lure of romance. It was like wine to him. Here was adventure, something to do with head and hand, a world to conquer--and straightway from the back of his consciousness rushed the thought, conquering, to win to her, that lily- pale spirit sitting beside him.|$|R

The thesis describes two most of common <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads <b>and</b> focuses on their relationship.

The thesis also highlights the importance of the roads for an owner and the general Czech public. Marginally the work focuses on building new and maintaining existing roads and their impact on the environment. It shows the importance of roads for the owner as his property. It also shows <b>field</b> <b>and</b> <b>forest</b> roads in two cadastral areas and their records.
