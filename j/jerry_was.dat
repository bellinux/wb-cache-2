5|$|Hurricane Jerry caused {{minor damage}} in Texas and flash {{flooding}} in Kentucky and Virginia in October1989. The fourteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm of the season, Jerry developed from a tropical wave in the Bay of Campeche on October12. Initially a tropical depression, the system moved north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry {{early on the}} following day. Jerry continuously deepened until October14 and then maintained intensity while curving northeastward and briefly decelerating. Later that day, the storm re-curved north-northwestward. Jerry began to intensify on October15 and soon became a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Early on October16, Jerry made landfall on Galveston Island, Texas with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Less than six hours later, Jerry weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression shortly thereafter. Late on October16, <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> absorbed by a frontal system while situated over southwestern Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> an {{unpredictable}} storm as the strengthening before landfall and the continuation {{to the northwest}} was not anticipated. Equipment failure meant that data was not readily available. The National Hurricane Center forecast model was also disabled, throwing the accuracy of Jerry's track off. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches began early on October14, with a hurricane watch for Port Arthur, Texas {{to the mouth of}} the Mississippi River in Louisiana. At 2200UTC later that day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire coast of Louisiana. Another tropical storm watch was posted from Port O'Connor, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana at 1200UTC on October15.|$|E
5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> a {{short-lived}} tropical storm that {{formed in the}} latter half of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming as a tropical depression from a tropical wave on October 6 near Barbados, Jerry intensified into a tropical storm early the following day on October 7 while initially located under an environment of weak vertical wind shear. After reaching its peak of 50 mph (80km/h), Jerry passed just south of Barbados late on October 7 and through the Windward Islands on October 8. Shortly after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, moderate upper-level wind shear affected Jerry's upper-level outflow, and the cyclone weakened to a depression shortly afterwards. Deterioration in organization continued, and Jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of Puerto Rico. Jerry caused minimal effects in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

Ward Neale was a long-time friend and fellow GAC stalwart. <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> honoured and delighted {{to be associated with the}} development of a medal for the public awareness of geoscience that honoured his friend.|$|E
25|$|On May 19, 2009 {{the show}} {{recorded}} its last episode at WMAQ-TV's NBC Tower in Chicago, Illinois, {{where it had}} been videotaped since 1992, midway through the second season. Beginning with the 2009–10 season, production was moved to the Rich Forum in Stamford, Connecticut after NBCUniversal received tax credits from the state of Connecticut to move Springer, along with Maury and Steve Wilkos to the Nutmeg State, along with NBC Sports. <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> quoted as saying he was not happy with the move, but understood the financial reasons for which it was being done, and is working to secure jobs for those on his staff who wish to move with the show. Since moving to Stamford, the show has gone through a number of changes; the set has become more highly colored with new lighting, new chairs for guests, two new security guards, and a change to its iconic theme music.|$|E
25|$|Jerry and Charlie O'Connell {{left the}} series to pursue film careers, and because <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> denied an {{executive}} producer credit on the series. When he left, they informed Charlie {{that they would}} no longer require him either. The brothers leaving the show upset many fans and Tracy Tormé was asked {{what could be done}} to win them back. This resulted in an unsuccessful effort to bring back some popular previously recurring characters. The producers negotiated with John Novak (Ross J. Kelly, the ambulance-chasing lawyer), Alex Bruhanski (Pavel Kurlienko, the taxi driver) and Lester Barrie (Elston Diggs the waiter at the Chandler Hotel) for their return in season five. Zoe McLellan (Logan St. Clair) was scheduled to appear again and Jason Gaffney (Conrad Bennish, Jr) from season one was confirmed for four episodes including the season finale. However, none of these guest stars appeared. Why Bennish didn't appear in the fifth season {{is one of the biggest}} behind-the-scenes mysteries of the show.|$|E

25|$|Siegel {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, the {{youngest}} of six children of Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire, a part which later became Lithuania, Sarah (née Fine) and Mitchell Siegel (né Mikhel Segalovich). He was preceded by sisters Minerva and Roslyn, both in Lithuania, brothers Harry and Leo, and sister Isabel. His father was a sign painter who opened a haberdashery and encouraged his son's artistic inclinations. Mitchell {{died of a heart}} attack brought on by the robbery of his store, when <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> in junior high school. Siegel was a fan of movies, comic strips, and especially science fiction pulp magazines. He became active in a fandom, corresponding with other science fiction fans, including the young future author Jack Williamson. In 1929, Siegel published what might have been the first science-fiction fanzine, Cosmic Stories, which he produced with a manual typewriter and advertised in the classified section of Science Wonder Stories. He published several other booklets over the next few years.|$|E
500|$|Tropical Storm <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> a {{tropical}} storm that caused severe flooding throughout the southeast United States in August of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. Jerry, the tenth tropical storm of the season, formed from {{a tropical}} wave that moved off the African coast in early August, which organized into a tropical depression and tropical storm between the Bahamas and Florida later in the month, before striking Florida {{in the latter part}} of the month. Its remnant circulation persisted until five days after landfall. The rainfall it produced, amounting to over [...] in several locations across Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, was responsible for $40million (2005USD) in damage and 6 deaths. At the time, <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> the earliest tenth storm to form in a season on record, until Jose in the 2005 season overtook it. Tropical Storm <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> also the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Because {{much of the}} {{circulation}} was over land, <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> not predicted to intensify to a tropical storm. This caused tropical storm warnings not to be issued until just hours before landfall. [...] While crossing over the state, the storm retained its strength, causing officials to issue Tropical Storm Warnings over the Florida Panhandle. However, Jerry remained a tropical depression over the Gulf of Mexico, and the warnings were dropped after Jerry's second landfall.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} Jerry-centered episode arose {{when the}} writers decided one of the {{characters}} would get mugged. Muharrar said, [...] "Once we thought about it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it seemed like it was time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] that <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E

The following season with the Yankees at 34–31, Lemon was fired in June by Steinbrenner and replaced by Martin, but he remained with the organization as he had a contract through the 1982 season. Speaking of Martin, Lemon said, [...] "He's a very likeable guy, a free spirit. Where maybe I keep things inside, he lets them come out. There's nothing wrong with that." [...] The Yankees finished in fourth place in the AL East (89–71). Lemon worked as a scout for the Yankees and received [...] "several offers" [...] from other teams to serve as manager. One offer came in 1979 from the Indians, but Lemon refused it as well as the others.|$|E
500|$|Jerry Alan West {{was born}} into a poor {{household}} in Chelyan, West Virginia. He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician. [...] West was a shy, introverted boy, who became even more withdrawn when his closest brother David died in the Korean War at age 22 when <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> 12. He was so small and frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent him from getting seriously hurt. Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as [...] "obsessive".|$|E
500|$|... "Practice Date" [...] {{marked a}} turning point for the {{character}} Jerry. Prior to the episode, Jerry had appeared in every episode, but his personality had not yet been developed. Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked Jim O'Heir, so they cast him in the show and [...] "figured we'd work it out later". After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals <b>Jerry</b> <b>was</b> adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after [...] "Practice Date", [...] "We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who wants to put his head down and get his pension, but is asking for it all the time. In the next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. [...] "Practice Date" [...] marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that they made him a recurring character.|$|E
