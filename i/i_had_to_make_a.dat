500|$|Despite his {{mastery and}} world renown, Crane {{found it hard}} to make a living solely playing pool, and in 1957 began working as a Cadillac {{salesman}} at Valley Cadillac Inc. 333 East Avenue in Rochester, New York. He continued there for 17 years. According to Crane's daughter, at Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit featured a pool table at which Crane would run balls while answering questions. [...] "Working" [...] for a living was purely a choice of survival. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, Crane said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool... The only time I've ever been really happy is when I was at a pool table." ...|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E
500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have made a terrible mistake. I helped them do it. But damn it, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living." ...|$|E

Of course, that depends on their expertise. As an independent producer, I {{have to be a}} type of skilled laborer. There were many times that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film quickly. At those times, I kept entertainment-value in mind. Not once have I made a film for the sake of making the film itself. My taste is in looking through the camera. Filming happens to correspond with that taste. Art films are what Yu Hyun-mok makes. That's because director Yu wants to make art films. I just make films by following my heart, so the analysis I leave to all of you." [...] Kim Ki-youngAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Michael Carroll {{wrote an}} e-book novella about Rico in 2014, {{he dealt with}} this issue in the story. In an {{interview}} with Irish Comic News he explained: [...] "My argument {{has always been that}} Rico’s badge should show his surname… like every other Street Judge in Mega-City One. Why should he be the only one to have his first name on his badge? ... But Gordon’s story “Judgement” makes a plot-point of Rico temporarily wearing a “Dredd” badge in order to fool Judge Kenner into thinking that he is Joe … So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice. In my re-telling of the relevant scenes from “Judgement” I omitted the part about the badge-swap. So far, no one has complained!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In an autobiographical {{piece that}} Orwell {{sent to the}} editors of Twentieth Century Authors in 1940, he wrote: [...] "The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: Shakespeare, Swift, Fielding, Dickens, Charles Reade, Flaubert and, among modern writers, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. But I believe the modern writer who has {{influenced}} me most is W. Somerset Maugham, whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills." [...] Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of Jack London, especially his book The Road. Orwell's investigation of poverty in The Road to Wigan Pier strongly resembles that of Jack London's The People of the Abyss, in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate {{the lives of the}} poor in London. In his essay [...] "Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels" [...] (1946) Orwell wrote: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would certainly put Gulliver's Travels among them." ...|$|E

[...] "The Laughing Brook wasn't deep or big enough for me to live here safely. If it had been, I would have made my home in the bank and not bothered with a house or dam.

That would be acting like a gentleman, surely. And acting unselfishly too, because I can very well understand how distasteful it may be to you.

60|$|Well, I fetched him, half-shaved, and {{the rest}} of the {{business}} may be imagined. It is a very fine thing to be a hero with a big H. Henceforth (thanks to me) that was Charlie Scroope's lot in life. He has grandchildren now, and they all think him a hero. What is more, he does not contradict them. I went down to the lady's place in Essex, a fine property with a beautiful old house. On the night I arrived there was a dinner-party of twenty-four people. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> speech about Charlie Scroope and the leopard. I think it was a good speech.

[...] Then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bolt for it, and he arter me, and he run nigh fifty yards before he stopped; that is enough to show how mad he wor over it.

60|$|Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: If {{there is}} one thing I abominate more than another, it is turning out on a cold night like this to eat a huge dinner of twelve courses and know that I have to make a speech on top of it.

And by the time I had finished the rest of the food, I felt simply waterlogged, and I do still. More than that. The knowledge that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> speech congratulating this society of yours on its fiftieth anniversary haunted and racked me all through the meal. I am not, in plain truth, the ready and brilliant speaker you take me for. That is a pure myth. If you could see the desperate home scene that goes on in my family when I am working up a speech, your minds would be at rest on that point.|$|E
