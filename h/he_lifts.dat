5|$|Winter knows from Yates that Irwin's {{ultimate}} goal is to raise the American flag upside down, a classic signal of distress. Irwin's men create havoc but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards, armed with live ammunition. Irwin orders the prisoners to stand down and elects to personally hoist the flag. After Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> the flag.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the address}} is an {{extended}} policy statement about his eight years in office, with some pointed comments mixed in highlight certain points, in which he builds a case for the steps needed to perpetuate the union, a concept that began to germinate among and between the states during the Revolutionary War. In doing so <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> up a well-formed and functioning Constitution (the rule of law), along with the proper habits and dispositions (both intellectual and religious) of the people as essential. Washington also lays out the greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust the passions of political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's domestic affairs, and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
60|$|The {{order was}} obeyed, and the ex-pirate stood swaying to and fro, and smiling with almost childlike delight. Presently <b>he</b> became solemn, <b>lifted</b> one leg, {{and set it}} down again with marvellous rapidity. Then <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> the other leg with the same result. Then <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> the staff, but had to replace it smartly to prevent falling forward.|$|R

50|$|Nikolopoulos lifted 57.0 {{kilograms}} {{with one}} hand, {{which would have}} {{put him in a}} tie with Jensen had <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> the same weight with his other hand. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> only 40.0 kilograms with the other, but was awarded third place as Versis could only lift 40.0 with either hand.|$|R
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> the death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E

Log has also been known to dip his own breast in his scotch.|$|E

25|$|Boult is {{a useful}} {{right-handed}} tailender, having scored a half century against Bangladesh in a 2013 test. He tends to open his stance by stepping the left (front) foot {{off to the side}} for his back-foot cover drive, much akin to Shivnarine Chanderpaul.

25|$|Śrīrāghavāvatārapratijñānam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवावतारप्रतिज्ञानम्). Paraśurāma {{returns to}} the Mahendra {{mountain}} and contemplates on his past actions. He regrets his acts of rage and fury, and decides to perform penance to atone for the killings in his past. He starts meditating on the form of Rāma. With Sahasrārjuna killed and Paraśurāma putting down his weapons, Rāvaṇa's might is unchallenged and he terrorizes the whole earth – <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> the Kailāsa mountain, torments the eight Diggajas, wins the kingdom of Indra and terrorizes everybody who performs Dharma. Unable to bear the menace of Rāvaṇa, Pṛthvī {{takes the form of}} a cow and goes weeping to the Sumeru mountain. Brahmā has a discussion with Pṛthvī and Śiva. Brahmā then goes to Sāketaloka to see Sītā and Rāma. He eulogizes Rāma in 31 verses (10.56–10.86), beseeching him to take an Avatāra to slay Rāvaṇa. Rāma assures him that he will be soon born as Rāma with his three Viṣṇu Aṃśas – the Viṣṇu in Kṣīrasāgara as Bharata, the Viṣṇu in Vaikuṇṭha as Lakṣmaṇa and Viṣṇu in Śvetadvīpa as Śatrughna. When Brahmā returns assured, Rāma requests Sītā to also take an Avatāra after his Avatāra. He then decides to be born as the son of Kausalyā in Ayodhyā.|$|E

500|$|For his {{portrayal}} of Rhys, Barber was included on the long list for the 2012 Most Popular New Talent Logie Award. Writers for TV Week branded Rhys a [...] "handsome doc" [...] and a [...] "selfish surgeon-to-be." [...] A writer for the Daily Record said Rhys was [...] "deserving of a slap" [...] for taking advantage of Karl's mistake with a prescription. The writer also called Rhys a [...] "chancer." [...] When Rhys tries to impress Martin, television critic Dianne Butler quipped [...] "And I see John Wood's in the show. He's a golf-playing doctor [...] whose leg is being humped by Rhys Lawson tonight. Rhys puts on a barbecue to try to oil his way into a surgical-training program, only there's a rat under the plate when <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> the lid {{to put on the}} snapper. Vintage Neighbours." [...] Larissa Dubecki of The Sydney Morning Herald thought Rhys was [...] "dastardly", while the Herald Sun's Cameron Adams called him [...] "creepy" [...] for cyber stalking Erin. Adams later wrote [...] "dodgy doctor" [...] Rhys was threatening Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) status as the Erinsborough bad boy.|$|E
500|$|Chris says {{he hates}} classic rock {{stations}} because they {{always end up}} playing We Built This City from Starship. The radio station Chris tunes in to is [...] "Classic Rock 103.7 WHTT". WHTT was the callsign for the current Boston, MA radio station WODS, a classic hits station {{at the time that}} played the same music the fictional WHTT apparently airs before flipping to Top 40 in 2012 as 103.3 Amp Radio. The station had the callsign from 1983–86. This further references Boston influences on the TV show. Another station actually holds the callsigns now, 104.1 WHTT-FM in Buffalo, NY, with the same format. After Stewie is injected with steroids, <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> a barbell on one side and says [...] "I have the power!" [...] and the show then shifts scenes the same as in Masters of the Universe. It is mentioned that Connie is the key to One-Eyed Willy’s gold, a reference to The Goonies. Paul Sorvino and Chazz Palminteri are seen acting in a fictional movie called [...] "Distracting Trumpet". After Stewie's steroids injection wears off and he jumps out the bedroom window, the music playing is from the cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.|$|E

2500|$|When Basilio {{starts to}} gossip about Cherubino's obvious {{attraction}} to the Countess, the Count angrily leaps from his hiding place (terzetto: [...] – [...] "What do I hear!"). He disparages the [...] "absent" [...] page's incessant flirting and describes how he caught him with Barbarina under the kitchen table. As <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> the dress from the chair to illustrate how he lifted the tablecloth to expose Cherubino, he finds ... the self same Cherubino! The count is furious, but is reminded that the page overheard the Count's advances on Susanna, something that the Count wants to keep from the Countess. The young man is ultimately saved from punishment by {{the entrance of the}} peasants of the Count's estate, a preemptive attempt by Figaro to commit the Count to a formal gesture symbolizing his promise that Susanna would enter into the marriage unsullied. The Count evades Figaro's plan by postponing the gesture. The Count says that he forgives Cherubino, but he dispatches him to his own regiment in Seville for army duty, effective immediately. Figaro gives Cherubino mocking advice about his new, harsh, military life from which all luxury, and especially women, will be totally excluded (aria: Non più andrai – [...] "No more [...] ").|$|E
