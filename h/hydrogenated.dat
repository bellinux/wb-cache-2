5|$|Several {{negative}} effects {{may be attributed}} to the drinking of hot chocolate. The types and severity of health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate. Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk. Processed cocoa powder usually contains additional sugars.

5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the bread kosher (Angel Bakeries carries the hechsher of both the Edah HaChareidis and the Orthodox Union), Angel's son Ovadia, a trained chemist, collaborated with others at the Angel's-owned Adumim Chemicals plant {{to develop a new}} formula for the emulsifiers that bind water and oil in the bread-making process. In those early days, emulsifiers were made with animal-based fats which were not kosher. Ovadia Angel and his team produced emulsifiers from <b>hydrogenated</b> fats, a vegetable-based source, and later sold this new knowledge to other companies.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used <b>hydrogenated</b> {{vegetable}} oil for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean.

5|$|As a {{response}} to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of <b>hydrogenated</b> fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E

40|$|Five {{strictly}} anaerobic bacteria able to <b>hydrogenate</b> unsaturated {{fatty acids}} were isolated from sheep rumen. One was characterized as Ruminococcus albus, two as Eubacterium spp. and two as Fusocillus spp., {{one of which}} is named as a new species. The Fusocillus organisms were able to <b>hydrogenate</b> oleic acid and linoleic acid to stearic acid, and linolenic acid to cis-octadec- 15 -enoic acid. The R. albus and the two Eubacteria did not <b>hydrogenate</b> oleic acid but converted linoleic and linolenic acids to a mixture of octadecenoic acids; trans-octadec- I I-enoic acid predominated but several isomeric cis and truns octadecenoic acids were produced together with isomers of non-conjugated octadecadienoic acids. The intermediate and final products of hydrogenation by each organism were compatible with the results from mixed rumen bacteria...|$|R
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially <b>hydrogenated</b> fats and oils.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially <b>hydrogenated</b> vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|In other countries, {{there are}} legal limits to trans fat content. Trans fats levels {{can be reduced}} or {{eliminated}} using saturated fats such as lard, palm oil or fully <b>hydrogenated</b> fats, or by using interesterified fat. Other alternative formulations can also allow unsaturated fats {{to be used to}} replace saturated or partially <b>hydrogenated</b> fats. <b>Hydrogenated</b> oil is not a synonym for trans fat: complete hydrogenation removes all unsaturated fats.|$|E

25|$|Palm oil, {{a natural}} oil {{extracted}} from the fruit of oil palm trees that is semi-solid at room temperature (15–25 degrees Celsius), can potentially serve {{as a substitute for}} partially <b>hydrogenated</b> fats in baking and processed food applications, although there is disagreement about whether replacing partially <b>hydrogenated</b> fats with palm oil confers any health benefits. A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially <b>hydrogenated</b> fats (trans fats) in the food industry, because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.|$|E

40|$|A review. The asym. {{hydrogenation}} of olefins is {{a tremendously}} powerful tool used to synthesize chiral mols.
