5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

60|$|I {{ran down}} the hill in the thick Swiss {{darkness}} to the little bridge, and along the uneven cobbled street. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to think, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to know. <b>I</b> wanted to arrest my activity, to keep it confined to the moment, to the adventure.|$|R

60|$|Remembering {{the remarks}} {{which had been}} made about her by her friend Edith, I could not but admit {{that she was a}} very fine girl, {{combining}} a great many attractive qualities, but I rebelled against every conviction I had in regard to her. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to think about her admirable qualities. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to believe that in time they would impress me more forcibly than they <b>did</b> now. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> people to imagine that I would come to be so impressed. If I stayed there I might almost look upon her in the light of a duty.|$|R
500|$|Rapp {{immediately}} {{recommended to}} the Emperor that the Guard be deployed for action {{at which the}} Emperor {{is said to have}} retorted: [...] "I will most definitely not; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have it blown up. I am certain of winning the battle without its intervention." [...] Determined not to commit this valuable final reserve so far away from France, Napoleon rejected another such request, this time from Marshal Ney. Instead, he called the commander of the [...] "Young Guard", Marshal Mortier and instructed him to guard the field of battle without moving forward or backward, {{while at the same time}} unleashing a massive cannonade with his 400 guns.|$|E
500|$|By 1966, Cardinale {{was being}} {{cited as the}} most popular film star in Italy, even more than Mastroianni and Loren. Life stated that [...] "the Cardinale appeal {{is a blend of}} solid {{simplicity}} and radiant sensuality. It moves men {{all over the world to}} imagine her both as an exciting mistress and wife." [...] However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with Life, she confessed her fear of being over-glamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further U.S. films lined up, stated: [...] "If I have to give up the money, I give it up. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> become a cliché." ...|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can}} be faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life. But I do not show my life directly, in full view; nor even look at it while others watch." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{political}} climate of {{the country at the}} time, on April 1, 2003, Madonna pulled the video and released a statement explaining why: [...] "I have decided not to release my new video. It was filmed before the war started and I do not believe it is appropriate to air it at this time. Due to the volatile state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support and pray for, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video." [...] After pulling the original video, it was then released an edited version that premiered on April 16, 2003 on VH1, immediately after a special program called Madonna Speaks. This version features Madonna singing in front of a backdrop of ever-changing flags of different countries.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012 {{during an}} interview, Milian spoke of her Young Money debut: [...] "Wayne just gets his artists, which is great, I {{have a very}} {{one-on-one}} business relationship with everybody from Mack Maine to Wayne. They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] I really want to pick the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, so <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The Voice would be ended.|$|E
500|$|In May, Benfica {{had four}} matches to gain four points on Sporting. The first {{was at the}} Estádio da Madeira with Nacional. Knowing that Sporting had lost points to Académica, Benfica hoped to narrow the gsp between them to two points. After an uneventful first half, in the 56th minute Nenê scored the opening goal for Nacional. Eight minutes later, Rúben Micael {{extended}} the lead, with Reyes reducing it in the 67th minute. Benfica pressed unsuccessfully for the equaliser before Nacional scored again with Miguel Fidalgo. Sánchez Flores realised that winning the league title was now impossible. On 9 May, Benfica met Trofense at home. Valdomiro scored first for the visitors in the 31st minute before Benfica scored twice in two minutes, reaching half-time with a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Paulinho tied the score for Trofense. Sporting won that day, so Benfica trailed by seven points with two match days left and could not qualify for the Champions League. Sánchez Flores said, [...] "I know when to arrive and when to leave. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{be a problem for}} the club." [...] Playing out the schedule, Benfica first visited the Municipal de Braga. They won 3–1, ending a five-year winless streak there. The victory was against Jorge Jesus, widely reported as Sánchez Flores' successor. A week later, Benfica ended their campaign with a 3–1 win against Belenenses. Sánchez Flores analysed the club's season: [...] "They asked me to improve the team and I did. But we all know what happened last year; we should set realistic goals. Second place was possible, but we failed in the final third. I won a title and fought for another." [...] A short time later, he and the club terminated his contract.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> a room, but the remark about breakfast {{made me feel}} that I should like a cup of coffee, and perhaps I might get it here. It {{might have been a}} more natural thing {{to go back to the}} boat and ask Abner to make me the coffee, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go back to the boat. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to wake Walkirk. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have him with me on shore. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have him talk to me. My present intention was to go to the yacht as soon as it was reasonable to suppose that its passengers were awake, to see Mrs. Raynor, and say to her what I had to say. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel in the proper spirit for this; but, in the spirit in which I found myself, the less I was trammeled by advice, by suggestions of prudence, and all that sort of thing, the better it would be for me. So I was very glad that my under-study was asleep on the grocery boat, and hoped that he would remain in that condition until I had had my talk with Sylvia's mother.|$|R

2500|$|The {{emerging}} {{church is}} a growing, loosely connected movement of primarily young pastors who are {{glad to see the}} end of modernity and are seeking to function as missionaries who bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to emerging and postmodern cultures.
