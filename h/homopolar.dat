5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's <b>homopolar</b> motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Oliphant {{returned}} to Australia {{as the first}} Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the new Australian National University, where he initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 megajoule) <b>homopolar</b> generator. He retired in 1976, but was appointed Governor of South Australia {{on the advice of}} Premier, Don Dunstan. He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched. Late in life he watched his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. He died in Canberra in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's <b>homopolar</b> disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E
25|$|The magnet is held {{to prevent}} it from rotating, while the disc is spun on its axis. The result is that the {{galvanometer}} registers a direct current. The apparatus therefore acts as a generator, variously called the Faraday generator, the Faraday disc, or the <b>homopolar</b> (or unipolar) generator.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was {{demonstrated by the}} English scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current {{gave rise to a}} close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar <b>homopolar</b> motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.|$|E
25|$|A railgun is {{a device}} that uses {{electromagnetic}} force to launch high velocity projectiles, {{by means of a}} sliding armature that is accelerated along a pair of conductive rails. It is typically constructed as a weapon and the projectile normally does not contain explosives, relying on the projectile's high speed to inflict damage. The railgun uses a pair of parallel conductors, or rails, along which a sliding armature is accelerated by the electromagnetic effects of a current that flows down one rail, into the armature and then back along the other rail. It is based on principles {{similar to those of the}} <b>homopolar</b> motor.|$|E
25|$|The ANU College of Physical & Mathematical Sciences {{comprises}} the Research Schools of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Mathematical Sciences and Physics. Under {{the direction of}} Mark Oliphant, nuclear physics was one the university's most notable early research priorities, leading {{to the construction of}} a 500 megajoule <b>homopolar</b> generator and a 7.7 megaelectronvolts cyclotron in the 1950s. These devices were to be used as part of a 10.6 gigaelectronvolt synchrotron particle accelerator that was never completed, however they remained in use for other research purposes. ANU has been home to eight particle accelerators over the years and operates the 14UD and LINAS accelerators. Brian Schmidt (astrophysicist at Mount Stromlo Observatory) received the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe.|$|E
25|$|The SDC {{device is}} {{operational}} immediately after fabrication. Switching {{occurs in the}} Ge2Se3 active layer, where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge <b>homopolar</b> bonds, are found. The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and operating temperatures (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature (~350°C). These processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device types, including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed. It is a combination of these factors that allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, including long-term continuous operation at 150°C.|$|E

Completed in 1963, the HPG {{was intended to be}} the power source for a synchrotron, but this was not built.

[...] The school also benefited in an indirect way from the construction of the massive generator, the accumulated engineering experience and techniques where later used to build other research equipment around the school including the Plasma Physics H1NF Heliac.

2500|$|In {{the years}} of 1831–1832, Michael Faraday {{discovered}} the operating principle of electromagnetic generators. [...] The principle, later called Faraday's law, is that an electromotive force is generated in an electrical conductor that is subjected to a varying magnetic flux, as for example, [...] a wire moving through a magnetic field. [...] He also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk, a type of <b>homopolar</b> generator, using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. [...] It produced a small DC voltage.|$|E
2500|$|For much of {{the early}} years {{the focus of a}} large part of the school was designing, re-designing and {{building}} a cyclo-synchrotron that in its final intended form was to produce a beam of 10.6 GeV protons for nuclear physics research. Designed to be a world class research machine it was referred to within the school as [...] "The Big Machine". Due to shifting goalposts and huge costs the cyclo-synchrotron was never completed. The small 7.7 MeV cyclotron designed to function as the proton injector was completed in 1955, and the large <b>homopolar</b> generator intended to power the system was first operated in 1962, but by this time work on [...] "The Big Machine" [...] itself had been abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not strictly a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a <b>homopolar</b> generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E
2500|$|In 1821, {{soon after}} the Danish {{physicist}} and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism, Davy and British scientist William Hyde Wollaston tried, but failed, to design an electric motor. Faraday, having discussed {{the problem with the}} two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called [...] "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the <b>homopolar</b> motor, caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the Royal Society strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.|$|E
50|$|DC <b>homopolar</b> {{machines}} {{are among the}} oldest electric machines. Michael Faraday made one in 1831. Superconducting DC <b>homopolar</b> machines use superconductors in their stationary field windings and normal conductors in their rotating pickup winding. In 2005 the General Atomics company received a contract {{for the creation of}} a large low speed superconducting <b>homopolar</b> motor for ship propulsion. Superconducting <b>homopolar</b> generators have been considered as pulsed power sources for laser weapon systems. However, <b>homopolar</b> machines have not been practical for most applications.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Homopolar</b> motor - A <b>homopolar</b> motor has a {{magnetic}} field along the axis of rotation and an electric current {{that at some point}} is not parallel to the magnetic field. The name <b>homopolar</b> refers to the absence of polarity change. <b>Homopolar</b> motors necessarily have a single-turn coil, which limits them to very low voltages. This has restricted the practical application of this type of motor.|$|E
50|$|Like most {{electro-mechanical}} machines, a <b>homopolar</b> motor is reversible: if {{the conductor}} is turned mechanically, {{then it will}} operate as a <b>homopolar</b> generator, producing a direct current voltage between the two terminals of the conductor. The direct current produced is an effect of the <b>homopolar</b> nature of the design. <b>Homopolar</b> generators (HPGs) were extensively researched in the late 20th century as low voltage but very high current DC power supplies and have achieved some success powering experimental railguns.|$|E
5000|$|A pure <b>homopolar</b> motor (PHM) is an {{electric}} motor not requiring brushes or electronics or semiconductor parts to convert direct current into torque. In other words, this <b>homopolar</b> motor only requires a theoretical homogeneous or actual (constantly or cyclically) homogenized magnetic field and direct current, similarly to the Faraday <b>Homopolar</b> Motor (FHM).

50|$|A <b>homopolar</b> motor is {{a direct}} current {{electric}} motor with two magnetic poles, the conductors of which always cut unidirectional lines of magnetic flux by rotating a conductor around a fixed axis so that the conductor is {{at right angles to}} a static magnetic field.

The name <b>homopolar</b> indicates that the electrical polarity of the conductor and the magnetic field poles do not change (i.e., that it does not require commutation).|$|E

5000|$|Long {{after the}} {{original}} Faraday disc had been abandoned as a practical generator, a modified version combining the magnet and disc in a single rotating part (the rotor) was developed. Sometimes the name <b>homopolar</b> generator is reserved for this configuration. One of the earliest patents on the general type of <b>homopolar</b> generators was attained by A. F. Delafield, [...] Other early patents for <b>homopolar</b> generators were awarded to S. Z. De Ferranti and C. Batchelor separately. Nikola Tesla {{was interested in the}} Faraday disc and conducted work with <b>homopolar</b> generators, and eventually patented an improved version of the device in [...] Tesla's [...] "Dynamo Electric Machine" [...] patent describes an arrangement of two parallel discs with separate, parallel shafts, joined like pulleys by a metallic belt. Each disc had a field that was the opposite of the other, so that the flow of current was from the one shaft to the disc edge, across the belt to the other disc edge and to the second shaft. This would have greatly reduced the frictional losses caused by sliding contacts by allowing both electrical pickups to interface with the shafts of the two disks rather than at the shaft and a high-speed rim. Later, patents were awarded to C. P. Steinmetz and E. Thomson for their work with <b>homopolar</b> generators. The Forbes dynamo, developed by the Scottish electrical engineer George Forbes, was in widespread use during the beginning of the 20th century.
