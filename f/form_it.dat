5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI {{reference is}} defined as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute <b>form,</b> <b>it</b> equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold {{more often than}} in uncombined <b>form,</b> <b>it</b> is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E

5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what <b>form</b> <b>it</b> should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented the privileges of the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to the theology of Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E

It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. 3/4, of the civil pound: 350.78g. This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to <b>form.</b> <b>It</b> seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.|$|E
