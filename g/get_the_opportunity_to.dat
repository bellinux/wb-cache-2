25|$|The Tornado F3 {{made its}} combat {{debut in the}} 1991 Gulf War with 18 {{aircraft}} deployed to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The aircraft deployed to the region were later upgraded in a crash program with improved radar and engines, better defensive countermeasures and several adaptions to the weapons systems to improve combat performance in the Iraqi theatre; however, they still lacked modern IFF and secure communications equipment. They therefore flew patrols further back from Iraqi airspace where encounters with enemy aircraft were less likely, and did not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> engage any enemy aircraft. From August 1990 to March 1991, the RAF's F3 detachment flew more than 2000 combat air patrol sorties.|$|E

Frontman Dave Mustaine, speaking about the band's commercial breakthrough, said: [...] "I {{think a lot of}} our success now {{has to do with the}} fact that we're willing to study the marketplace and educate ourselves. Most musicians don't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> go into the market with educated strategy.

500|$|On July 30, 2011, Davis {{was traded}} with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for {{reliever}} Koji Uehara.

[...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, [...] "I'm glad to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> come here", citing his desire to play every day.|$|E

Australia would not <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> participate at the 1959 World Championship held in Moscow because at the time, the Australian Government would not allow the team to travel to the USSR.

[...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this {{lightbulb}} would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality.

[...] Pearl Jam faced a {{relentless}} touring schedule for Ten. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band for Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the album. Halfway through its own planned North American tour, Pearl Jam cancelled the remaining dates in order to take a slot opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the band's Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour in the fall of 1991 in North America. The spot was arranged by Jack Irons, who had called his former band asking for them to get an opportunity to his friend Vedder. The Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana were also supporting acts. Nirvana was initially brought in because the tour promoters [...] decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act, but the departure of The Smashing Pumpkins still kept the group in the concert bill. Epic executive Michael Goldstone observed that [...] "the band did such an amazing job opening the Chili Peppers tour that it opened doors at radio." ...|$|E

[...] Arundel added that Buckley was willing to work within the music he had already created, as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it. Buckley received Arundel's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme. Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23, 2015, and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from the soundtrack chosen by Arundel.
