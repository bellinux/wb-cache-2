5|$|On 17 June 1942, Marseille {{claimed his}} 100th aerial victory. He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot {{to achieve the}} century mark. Marseille then {{returned}} to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. On 6 August, he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper. On 13 August, he met Benito Mussolini in Rome and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery, the Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare. While in Italy Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report, submitted by the Gestapo head in Rome, Herbert Kappler. He was finally located. According to rumours he <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded {{to return to his}} unit. Unusually, nothing was ever said about the incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} the clock to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the time}} of Lewicka's disappearance, a {{licensed}} practical nurse named Suzette Trouten moved from Michigan to Kansas to travel the world with Robinson as his submissive sex slave. Trouten's mother received several typed letters signed by her daughter and purportedly mailed while the couple was abroad, although the envelopes all bore Kansas City postmarks. The letters were, her mother said, uncharacteristically mistake-free. Later, Robinson told Trouten's mother that she <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with an acquaintance after stealing money from him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1606, one of the nuns at the convent {{threatened}} to expose the relationship. As a consequence of this threat, Osio killed her {{in order to avoid}} the spreading of the story. This murder apparently took place with the complicity of both Sister Virginia and other nuns. Sister Virginia threatened all the nuns complicit in the murder that they would suffer the same fate if they revealed the crime. The murder remained secret because outsiders were told that the murdered lay sister <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off.</b> In the autumn of 1606, however, rumors about the activities at the convent became more frequent. The blacksmith who had counterfeited the keys was also killed by Osio.|$|E
25|$|Norma’s father Andrew {{abandoned}} {{her and her}} mother Grace when Norma was about 5 years old. Andrew <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with {{a woman in a}} relationship that ended soon. He travelled in Africa in financially successful ventures. Norma lived with her mother until Grace’s death {{two and a half years}} before. Andrew returned to England after his brother Simon died a year earlier, to work in the family firm, arriving with a new young wife. Norma can recognize nothing familiar in this man, but accepts him. Norma is the third girl in her flat in the fashion of young women advertising for a third girl to share the rent. The main tenant is secretary to her newfound father; the other girl, Frances, travels often for the art gallery that employs her.|$|E

25|$|The {{brothers}} {{continued their}} rivalry with their individual opponents before reuniting for a rematch {{on the last}} SmackDown! before Armageddon. This time, the match {{would go to a}} double disqualification as Kennedy threatened to run over Kane with a hearse parked ringside. The Undertaker, who <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> MVP, emerged in the passenger seat as his gong tolled and the lights went out, thus scaring Kennedy out of the vehicle. At Armageddon, Undertaker defeated Kennedy in a Last Ride match, which was why the hearse had been at ringside for the last two weeks, and Kane defeated MVP earlier in an inferno match. The next week on SmackDown!, the Brothers would reunite once again, defeating King Booker and Finlay, before parting ways as Kane began a rivalry with The Great Khali while Undertaker successfully pursued the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 23.|$|E
25|$|Gathering a {{group of}} acquaintances and hired help as the cast and crew, they decide to film a pornographic Star Wars parody, {{entitled}} Star Whores. Delaney, the film's producer and Zack's co-worker, rents film equipment and a building {{to use as a}} studio. When they return to the studio after the first night of filming, the building is being demolished, with all the equipment and costumes inside. They are told that the man that rented it to them <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with the money. Later at the coffee shop where Zack works, he realizes that his boss threatened to install a hidden camera, which Zack finds and decides to use to replace their lost film equipment. Zack retools his film to take place in the coffee shop, revamping the film to one with a coffee shop motif, Swallow My Cockuccino. The group shoots the film after hours.|$|E
500|$|When Howard Hughes {{purchased}} {{the hotel in}} the mid-1960s for $14.6 million, the architect Martin Stern, Jr. added a 500-room circular tower, which opened in 1967, and the hotel became a Las Vegas landmark. Hughes grew particularly annoyed every time the Rat Pack were in his hotel, due to a hatred of Frank Sinatra which stemmed {{from the fact that}} he had been in love with Ava Gardner in the 50s and she <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> to marry him. The ill feeling was reciprocated by Sinatra. Hughes plotted to oust Sinatra from the Sands for good, and asked Robert Maheu to draw up a plan shortly after the new hotel opened in 1967. The hotel imposed restrictions on what Sinatra could gamble in the casino, to just $3,000 a night. Under previous management, Sinatra had no limits on the amount of credit extended to him by the Sands casino. [...] His IOUs, chits or [...] "markers" [...] were torn up at the end of Sinatra's engagements because he was considered to be good for business-bringing the hotel more monetary value than the worth of his gambling losses. Hughes put a stop to this system, telling Jack Entratter to inform Sinatra of the new policy; Entratter did not do so because he was afraid.|$|E

The claims were vigorously denied by Young, he stated that Byrne was already 14 when she started and that drugs were not available on set, [...] "Any drug-taking Debra did, she certainly didn't do it on our show." [...] He said no-one on the show was aware of her affair with [...] "Michael", a boom operator ten years her senior.

2500|$|She {{had mixed}} {{fortunes}} in 1980 as she endured hamstring pain. She won the 60 metres at the AIAW indoor meet, {{but failed to}} defend her AIAW title, coming fifth, and {{dropped out of the}} relay due to her injury. Her third and final Olympic appearance came at the age of 27 at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where she ran in the heats of the 100m and came sixth in the relay with Pusey, Allwood, and Ottey (setting a Jamaican record of 43.19 seconds). While there Hodges commented on the lack of children in the city, and posited that the Soviet's did not want their children engaging with Westerners. Hodges was disappointed with the relay team's Olympic result, as a poor baton change between Allwood and Ottey led to a slower time. Hodges blamed Ottey, who <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> too early and performed poorly in practice, saying [...] "She never focused on the relays. She was just so obsessed with her own race." ...|$|E

[...] Sergeant Brown and one other man were deemed too severely injured to move and were tended by Campbell until the surgeon from Fort Thomas could be dispatched to retrieve them.

He gave Daniel some advice about marriage, telling him to have [...] "realistic expectations." [...] Phillipps thought that Daniel and Amber were rushing into marriage, but explained that the producers wanted the wedding to air {{as part of the}} show's 30th anniversary in March 2015. He thought they should have waited another year. Phillipps also admitted that he did not think Amber and Daniel were well suited, saying [...] "they are very easygoing people and I am not sure if that creates the best sparks." [...] On the day of his wedding, Daniel decided to be [...] "a hopeless romantic" [...] and try to get Amber an antique ring from a well that belonged to his ancestor. Phillipps explained that Amber had been obsessing about the love story connected to the ring and Daniel wanted to give it to her on their wedding day. Daniel and Imogen climbed into the well, but the ladder gave way, trapping them down there and forcing Daniel to miss his wedding.

[...] A short time later, all 75 Weatherwomen appeared at South Hills High School in Pittsburgh to participate in a [...] "jailbreak". The women spray painted anti-war slogans, [...] "Ho lives" [...] and [...] "Free Huey", on the school's main entrance doors, and handed out leaflets, urging high school students to [...] "bring the war home," [...] and asking students to leave the school campus. [...] Some Weatherwomen made speeches in the school's playground about racism, imperialism, and the SDS national action plans. Oughton was able to escape from the Pittsburgh police, but 26 others, including Cathy Wilkerson and Jane Spielman, were arrested at the school. The students at the high school had no idea who the Weatherwomen were, or even why the women chose their school.|$|E
2500|$|When Franklin was young, African {{slavery was}} common and {{virtually}} unchallenged throughout the British colonies. During his lifetime slaves were numerous in Philadelphia. In 1750, half the persons in Philadelphia who had established probate estates owned slaves. Dock {{workers in the}} city consisted of 15% slaves. Franklin owned {{as many as seven}} slaves, two males who worked in his household and his shop. Franklin posted paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. Franklin profited from both the international and domestic slave trade, even criticizing slaves who <b>had</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> to join the British Army during the colonial wars of the 1740s and 1750s. Franklin, however, later became a [...] "cautious abolitionist" [...] and became an outspoken critic of landed gentry slavery. In 1758, Franklin advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia. After returning from England in 1762, Franklin became more anti-slavery, in his view believing that the institution promoted black degradation rather than the idea blacks were inherently inferior. By 1770, Franklin had freed his slaves and attacked the system of slavery and the international slave trade. Franklin, however, refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Franklin tended to take {{both sides of the issue}} of slavery, never fully divesting himself from the institution.|$|E
