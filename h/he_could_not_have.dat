5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> prevented {{the launch of the}} American attack.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, after Bruckman {{takes the}} trash {{out for his}} neighbor, he discovers the body of Madame Zelma outside in his dumpster. When interviewed by Mulder and Scully, he reveals details about the crime that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> known from the media accounts, which causes Mulder to believe that Bruckman has psychic ability. Mulder insists that Bruckman join them in {{a visit to the}} crime scene at the doll collector's apartment. Thanks to {{seemingly}} psychically gained information from Bruckman, her body is soon found in a nearby lake.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E

Than is Mrs. Shelley's emendation (1839) for That, {{the word in}} the editio princeps (1819) printed in Italy, and in the (standard) edition of 1821. The sense is: 'The crime <b>he</b> witnessed <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> proved costlier to redeem than his murder has proved to me.' ...|$|R

5|$|During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth {{circled the}} world with his wife; the trip {{included}} a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{the time to make}} Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{takes an}} {{interest}} in the Reading Digest magazine after a copy is sent to the Simpson family's residence. In the magazine, he notices an ad for a children's contest in which an essay must be written about what makes America great. Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> written Lisa's essay for her.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged {{by his parents}} {{when he was a}} child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams. Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> become a 'pracharak' in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. Although Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career, he acknowledged his wife when he filed his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections. Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben and often visits her on his birthday to seek her blessings.|$|E
60|$|In {{this place}} I {{may as well}} jot down a chapter {{concerning}} those necessary nuisances, European guides. Many a man has wished in his heart <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do without his guide; but knowing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> <b>has</b> wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get some amusement out {{of him as a}} remuneration for the affliction of his society. We accomplished this latter matter, and if our experience can be made useful to others they are welcome to it.|$|R

5|$|There are a {{large number}} of battles {{attributed}} to Wellington. Although many leave the impression that he was present or in command at those actions, it was sometimes the case that he entrusted other officers to engage the enemy, such as at remote locations, and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> attended them all in person. Similarly, Wellington was not usually in command of rear guard actions, during advances or retreats, despite his army engaging in them often. Engagements where the lack of his presence is absolutely certain, or where his position is unconfirmed by records and accounts, are not included in his battle record.|$|E
5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge {{based on the principle}} that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain her hand on his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
50|$|Pisar's memoir, Of Blood and Hope, {{in which}} he {{tells the story of}} how he survived the Holocaust, {{received}} the Present Tense literary award in 1981. He wrote a narration based on his experiences and his anger at God, for Leonard Bernstein's Symphony No. 3 ("Kaddish"). He stated that the idea came from Bernstein, who felt Pisar could bring a more authentic voice to the symphony than <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> gone through the Holocaust himself.|$|R

5|$|Hipólito Vieytes {{was about}} to make a {{diplomatic}} mission to Britain, but Moreno requested that he should be given the appointment instead. Saavedra accepted immediately. He traveled to Britain with his brother Manuel Moreno and his secretary Tomás Guido, on the British schooner Fame. His health declined and there was no doctor on board, but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro (Brazil) or Cape Town (South Africa). The captain gave him an emetic in common use at that time, prepared with four grams of antimony potassium tartrate. Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence, and considered that in his state <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> resisted more than the quarter of a gram. He died shortly afterwards. His body was wrapped in a Union Jack and thrown into the sea, after a volley of musketry.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Solti {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to be {{music director of the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962. Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
6000|$|... "But the Duchess?" [...] exclaimed Lord Rufford in a stage whisper. One of the beaters was so {{near that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> but <b>have</b> heard;--but {{what does a}} beater signify? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{probably}} {{may be as}} exact as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make it {{with his}} means and instruments; {{but there are a}} great many sources of error which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> possibly <b>have</b> avoided." ...|$|R

5|$|Teresa Elena De Simone (24 June 19575 December 1979) {{was murdered}} in Southampton, England, in 1979. Her murder led {{to one of the}} longest proven cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in English legal history. The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and {{was the subject of a}} three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> committed and others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could not have come from him.|$|E
5|$|Rumours that Prince Albert Victor {{may have}} committed, or been {{responsible}} for, the Jack the Ripper murders were first mentioned in print in 1962. It was later alleged, among others by Stephen Knight in , that Albert Victor fathered {{a child with}} a woman in the Whitechapel district of London, and either he or several high-ranking men committed the murders in an effort to cover up his indiscretion. Though such claims have been repeated frequently, scholars have dismissed them as fantasies, and refer to indisputable proof of the Prince's innocence. For example, on 30 September 1888, when Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were murdered in London, Albert Victor was over 500miles (over 800km) away at Balmoral, the royal retreat in Scotland, in the presence of Queen Victoria, other family members, visiting German royalty and a large number of staff. According to the official Court Circular, family journals and letters, newspaper reports and other sources, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been near any of the murders. Other fanciful conspiracy theories are that he died of syphilis or poison, that he was pushed off a cliff on the instructions of Lord Randolph Churchill or that his death was faked to remove him from the line of succession.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, The Denver Post {{reported}} that two illegal immigrants {{were among the}} crew hired to remodel his basement. Tancredo said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> known their immigration status—they were subcontractors hired by the contractors he hired.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you swim?" [...] asked Charlie, {{a slight}} {{elevation}} of the eyebrows indicating surprise not unmingled with admiration--for our hero was a hero-worshipper. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> well <b>have</b> been a hero otherwise! ...|$|R
60|$|Soames {{had never}} called Irene an angel. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> so <b>have</b> {{violated}} his best instincts, letting other {{people into the}} secret of her value, and giving himself away. He made no reply.|$|R

25|$|Any {{error that}} was {{reasonably}} available {{to be raised}} while the petitioner was in custody is waived, {{and it is the}} petitioner's burden on the face of his petition to demonstrate that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reasonably raised his claims during the time he was in custody.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} that challenges the co-authorship {{idea is that}} the basic theory of co-authorship was originally hypothesised in the 18th and 19th centuries due to a distaste for the treatment of Joan. Critics were uncomfortable attributing such a harsh depiction to Shakespeare, so they embraced the co-authorship theory to 'clear his name', suggesting that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been responsible for the merciless characterization.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{excise taxes}} legalized, he did succeed in having {{legislation}} passed in 1919 to standardize property tax assessment {{across the state}} and grant the State Board of Tax Commissioners power to override local assessments, which effectively led to higher property values being attributed to city properties {{to ensure that the}} rural part of the state was no longer paying the majority of the state's revenues.|$|E
