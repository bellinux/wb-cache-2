Its structure has been proposed to consist of small polymers of single corner-sharing FeO 6 octahedra (rFe-Fe ~ 3. 6 Å) to which arsenate is attached as a monodentate binuclear 2 C complex (‘chain model’). Here, we analyzed the structure of AFAs and analogously prepared amorphous <b>ferric</b> <b>phosphates</b> (AFPs, FePO 4 •xH 2 O) by a combination of high-energy total X-ray scattering, Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of total X-ray scattering data revealed that the coherently scattering domain size of AFAs and AFPs is about 8 Å. The PDFs of AFA lacked Fe-Fe pair correlations at r ~ 3. 6 Å indicative of single-corner sharing FeO 6 octahedra, which strongly supports a local scorodite (FeAsO 4 • 2 H 2 O) structure. Likewise, PDF analyses as well as wavelet-transform and shell-fit analyses of Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure data of the AFPs suggest a local strengite (FePO 4 • 2 H 2 O) structure with isolated FeO 6 octahedra being corner-linked to PO 4 tetrahedra (rFe-P = 3. 25 (1) Å). Mössbauer spectroscopy analyses of AFAs and AFPs indicated a strong superparamagnetism. While the AFAs only showed a weak onset of magnetic hyperfine splitting at 5 K, magnetic ordering of the AFPs was completely absent at this temperature. Mössbauer spectroscopy may thus offer a convenient way to identify and quantify AFA and AFP in mineral mixtures containing poorly crystalline Fe(III) -oxyhydroxides.

40|$|The fate of iron (Fe) {{may affect}} that of {{phosphorus}} (P) and arsenic (As) in natural waters. This study addresses {{the removal of}} Fe, P, and As from streams in lowland catchments fed by reduced, Fe-rich groundwater (average: 20 mg/L Fe). The concentrations of dissolved Fe (< 0. 45 µm) in streams gradually decrease with increasing hydraulic residence time (travel time) {{of the water in}} the catchment. The removal of Fe from stream water is governed by chemical reactions and hydrological processes: the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and the subsequent formation of particulate Fe oxyhydroxides proceeds as the water flows through the catchment into increasingly larger streams. The Fe removal exhibits first-order kinetics with a mean half-life of 12 hours, a value in line with predictions by a kinetic model for Fe(II) oxidation. The Fe concentrations in streams vary seasonally: they are higher in winter than in summer, due to shorter hydraulic residence time and lower temperature in winter. The removal of P and As is much faster than that of Fe. The average concentrations of P and As in streams (42 µg/L P and 1. 4 µg/L As) are one order of magnitude below those in groundwater (393 µg/L P and 17 µg/L As). This removal is attributed to fast sequestration by oxidizing Fe when the water enters oxic environments, possibly by adsorption on Fe oxyhydroxides or by formation of <b>ferric</b> <b>phosphates.</b> The average P and As concentrations in groundwater largely exceed local environmental limits for freshwater (140 µg/L P and 3 µg/L As), but in streams, they are below these limits.

The human disease pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) {{has the same}} genetic defect and a neurodegenerative phenotype as well as iron accumulation in the brain. We have found that fumble females accumulate almost 2 fold more iron in the heads than wildtype. Dietary iron supplementation increases the iron accumulation in the heads further. The small isoform of malvolio (MVL), a homologue of mammalian NRAMP iron transporters, is expressed in the heads of flies. Its expression is upregulated in the fumble females, {{as well as in}} dietary iron supplemented wildtype flies. Unlike in the wildtype, dietary iron supplementation leads to a downregulation of MVL in the fumble flies. Although iron levels were elevated in fumble, ferritin expression was relatively unchanged and remained unchanged in the heads of fumble and wildtype with dietary iron supplementation. The Drosophila mutant malvolio was used to determine how iron metabolism is affected when the MVL gene is defective. Iron levels were unchanged in malvolio relative to its parental strain (w 1118) with or without dietary iron supplementation. Despite similar iron levels, a small decrease in ferritin expression was found in malvolio relative to w 1118, and dietary iron increased ferritin expression in malvolio. However ferritin expression decreased in the parental strain of malvolio after iron supplementation. Most of the iron in the Drosophila heads was in the form of goethite and ferrihydrite. The presence of iron oxides implies that this iron is in a mineralized storage form, likely ferritin. Dietary iron supplementation induced the appearance of <b>ferric</b> <b>phosphates</b> in fumble, malvolio, and wildtype. The subcellular location of this iron is unknown.

The presence in fumble of the kind of ferrihydrite characteristic of the mitochondrial protein frataxin may indicate that iron is accumulating in mitochondria. The upregulation of MVL in the fumble mutant is of significant interest because it is the first protein involved in iron metabolism found to be altered with mitochondrial PANK deficiency. A disruption in MVL could be relevant to the brain iron accumulation in fumble and could be a treatment target for human PKAN...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Iron is {{the most}} common and perhaps the most crucial {{transition}} metal. It is essential for virtually all of life yet it is also potentially extremely toxic; therefore, how organisms handle iron (iron metabolism) is of critical importance. Ferritins constitute a large family of iron storage proteins that are found throughout life, in bacteria, archaea, plants and animals. The newly discovered ferritin from the bloom-forming pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries is similar to other eukaryotic ferritins that contains a ferroxidase centre but also contains a third site (site C) only previously found in non-heme bacterial ferritins. The mechanism of iron uptake in P. multiseries ferritin and the effect of substitution of residues at site C has been studied using rapid reaction kinetic methods. These revealed that oxidation in PmFTN is very rapid suggesting a distinct mechanism of iron uptake. Bacterioferritin (BFR) is a unique heme-containing bacterial member of the ferritin family that stores up to 2700 iron ions as a <b>ferric</b> oxyhydroxide <b>phosphate</b> mineral within its central cavity. This core is surrounded by 24 identical protein subunits, each of which possesses a dinuclear iron centre that catalyses the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). The heme-binding sites are sandwiched between pairs of subunits and coordinated by two methionine residues (one from each subunit). The heme groups {{play an important role in}} iron release, though understanding of this has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining fully heme-loaded protein that is isolated from overexpressing bacterial cultures. Here, an in vitro heme-loading method is described and used to generate BFR containing variable amounts of heme. Studies of iron release indicate increased heme levels only marginally increases the rate of iron release and actually lowers the extent of iron release. These results suggest that the reconstituted heme-loaded protein behaves differently from naturally heme-loaded protein...|$|R

Iron-oxidizing activity was effectively detected in extracts obtained by oxalic acid treatment of biofilm fragments. Extracts obtained without oxalic acid treatment, heated extracts, or extracts supplemented with H(g) Cl 2 did not show any activity. This suggests that an iron-oxidizing factor (IOF), possibly an enzyme, coprecipitated with the mineral. Additional information gathered by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel-filtration chromatography, and UV spectrophotometry indicate that the IOF would be a small peptide or glycopeptide (1, 350 Da).

The flocculation and coagulation along with chemical sequestration are among important processes for removing contaminants from wastewaters. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the efficiency of coagulation and flocculation process along with chemical sequestration in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from automotive industry sewage. Study Method: This study is an applied-experimental study. The removal of organic and inorganic substances by coagulation, flocculation process combined with chemical sequestration was carried out in batch reactors. The parameters turbidity, heavy metals' concentration, color, phosphate, coagulants concentration, exposure time, TSS, pH and COD were studied. The concentration of color and residue of heavy metals were determined using spectrophotometer -UV and atomic absorption. Results: The research results showed that the removal percentage of Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn by ferric sulfate combined with lime at a pH equal to 10 and the exposure time of 100 minutes were 52. 65, 96. 3, 3. 27 and 100 respectively, and percentage of removing them by aluminum sulfate combined with lime was 52. 65, 97. 8, 3. 37 and 99. 81 respectively. the removal percentage of TSS, COD, color, turbidity, <b>phosphates</b> <b>ferric</b> sulfate was also 68. 9, 83, 94, 84 and 47. 2 respectively, and this amount of removal by aluminum sulfate was 62, 80, 94, 73. 5 and 48 respectively at neutral pH and concentration of coagulant was obtained equal to 150 mg / L. Conclusion: According to the results, the use of coagulation and flocculation process combined with chemical sequestration in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants in wastewaters of automotive industry achieved under optimal conditions is very effective and can be used in water treatment of automotive industry...|$|R
40|$|This laboratory-scale {{investigation}} {{is focused on}} decreasing mobility of uranium in subsurface contaminated sediments in the vadose zone by in situ geochemical manipulation at low water content. This geochemical manipulation of the sediment surface phases included reduction, pH change (acidic and alkaline), and additions of chemicals (<b>phosphate,</b> <b>ferric</b> iron) to form specific precipitates. Reactants were advected into 1 -D columns packed with Hanford 200 area U-contaminated sediment as a reactive gas (for CO 2, NH 3, H 2 S, SO 2), with a 0. 1 % water content mist (for NaOH, Fe(III), HCl, PO 4) and with a 1 % water content foam (for PO 4). Uranium {{is present in the}} sediment in multiple phases that include (in decreasing mobility) : aqueous U(VI) complexes, adsorbed U, reduced U(IV) precipitates, rind-carbonates, total carbonates, oxides, silicates, phosphates, and in vanadate minerals. Geochemical changes were evaluated in the ability to change the mixture of surface U phases to less mobile forms, as defined by a series of liquid extractions that dissolve progressively less soluble phases. Although liquid extractions provide some useful information as to the generalized uranium surface phases (and are considered operational definitions of extracted phases), positive identification (by x-ray diffraction, electron microprobe, other techniques) was also used to positively identify U phases and effects of treatment. Some of the changes in U mobility directly involve U phases, whereas other changes result in precipitate coatings on U surface phases. The long-term implication of the U surface phase changes to alter U mass mobility in the vadose zone was then investigated using simulations of 1 -D infiltration and downward migration of six U phases to the water table. In terms of the short-term decrease in U mobility (in decreasing order), NH 3, NaOH mist, CO 2, HCl mist, and Fe(III) mist showed 20 % to 35 % change in U surface phases. Phosphate addition (mist or foam advected) showed inconsistent change in aqueous and adsorbed U, but significant coating (likely phosphates) on U-carbonates. The two reductive gas treatments (H 2 S and SO 2) showed little change. For long-term decrease in U reduction, mineral phases created that had low solubility (phosphates, silicates) were desired, so NH 3, phosphates (mist and foam delivered), and NaOH mist showed the greatest formation of these minerals. In addition, simulations showed the greatest decrease in U mass transport time to reach groundwater (and concentration) for these silicate/phosphate minerals. Advection of reactive gasses was the easiest to implement at the laboratory scale (and presumably field scale). Both mist and foam advection show promise and need further development, but current implementation move reactants shorter distances relative to reactive gasses. Overall, the ammonia and carbon dioxide gas had the greatest overall geochemical performance and ability to implement at field scale. Corresponding mist-delivered technologies (NaOH mist for ammonia and HCl mist for carbon dioxide) performed as well or better geochemically, but are not as easily upscaled. Phosphate delivery by mist was rated slightly higher than by foam delivery simply due to the complexity of foam injection and unknown effect of U mobility by the presence of the surfactant...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} distribution of iron oxide biominerals in marine chiton teeth. Chiton teeth, like many biological structures, are sophisticated organic/inorganic composites, the structure and function {{of which have been}} refined over millions of years. The result is optimised tools possessing many of the desirable features we seek in biomaterials. Importantly, the extremely hard iron and calcium biomaterials deposited in these teeth are formed at physiological pH and ambient temperatures; conditions not conducive to their formation in vitro. Understanding the processes of mineral deposition in these teeth is fundamental to our wider understanding of the biomineralization process and highly relevant to Australia’s modern materials focus. Much of our current understanding of these biomineralized structures has derived from electron microscopy, X-ray and electron diffraction and elemental mapping via X-ray emission spectroscopy. We have initiated extensive studies of biomineralization using a suite of vibrational spectroscopies. Here we apply Raman spectroscopy and microscopy to studies, in situ, of the biomineralized structures that comprise chiton teeth. Laser Raman microscopy is a particularly powerful technique for the analysis of iron compounds. The majority of iron oxide and hydroxide vibrational bands occur below 600 cm- 1, which renders them inaccessible to routine infrared microscopy. The laser Raman technique also has the advantages of greater spatial resolution, down to ~ 1. 5 mm in contrast to ~ 20 mm for infrared, and minimal interference from any adsorbed or included water. Therefore, it is possible to focus on very small regions of individual chiton teeth and characterise spectroscopically the chemical species present. Such knowledge is essential if the details of the biomineralization processes in the chitons are to be elucidated and used in laboratory preparations of novel nanocomposite materials. Results we have recently obtained using the Raman microscopy technique challenge the assertion that all Chiton species can been separated into two general groups based upon the biominerals deposited in their teeth. Two biomineralization strategies are thought to be representative across all species, in one a magnetite surface cap overlays a discrete layer of lepidocrocite and a central tooth core composed of apatite (1 - 5), in the second strategy a magnetite cap is thought to overlay a <b>ferric</b> <b>phosphate</b> biomineral (6). We show {{for the first time that}} a new biomineral, the hydrated iron (III) oxide limonite can be found where <b>ferric</b> <b>phosphate</b> or lepidocrocite are expected (7). We show that deposition of lepidocrocite is limited to a very few species, those most easily collected and therefore the first studied and that in contrast the pseudomineral limonite is the most common FeOOH mineral deposited (7). Where species have been assumed to deposit only a hydrated <b>ferric</b> <b>phosphate</b> we find that despite EDS evidence for large quantities of phosphorus only limonite is observed by Raman spectroscopy(6, 7). In fact we have not found evidence for a discrete <b>ferric</b> <b>phosphate</b> biomineral in any chiton species. Our results suggest that chiton tooth biomineralization can not be divided into two discrete groups, rather, that there is a continuum of biomineralization strategies driven by diet and environmental factors...|$|E
