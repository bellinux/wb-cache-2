40|$|The {{glioblastoma}} genome displays remarkable chromosomal aberrations, which harbor critical glioblastoma-specific genes {{contributing to}} several oncogenetic pathways. To identify glioblastoma-targeted genes, we completed a multifaceted genome-wide analysis {{to characterize the}} most significant aberrations of DNA content occurring in glioblastomas. We performed copy number analysis of 111 glioblastomas by Digital Karyotyping and Illumina BeadChip assays and validated our findings {{using data from the}} TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) glioblastoma project. From this study, we identified recurrent focal copy number alterations in 1 p 36. 23 and 4 p 16. 3. Expression analyses of genes located in the two regions revealed genes which are dysregulated in glioblastomas. Specifically, we identify EGFR negative regulator, ERRFI 1, within the minimal region of deletion in 1 p 36. 23. In glioblastoma cells with a focal deletion of the ERRFI 1 locus, restoration of ERRFI 1 expression slowed cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TACC 3, an Aurora-A kinase substrate, on 4 p 16. 3, displays <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number,</b> is overexpressed in a glioma-grade-specific pattern, and correlates with Aurora kinase overexpression in glioblastomas. Our multifaceted genomic evaluation of glioblastoma establishes ERRFI 1 as a potential candidate tumor suppressor gene and TACC 3 as a potential oncogene, and provides insight on targets for oncogenic pathway-based therapy...|$|E

We analyzed paired blood and primary tumor samples from 22 children with high-risk neuroblastoma for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number change using the Affymetrix 10 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Findings. Multiple areas of LOH and copy number gain were seen. The most commonly observed area of LOH was on chromosome arm 11 q (15 / 22 samples; 68 %). Chromosome 11 q LOH was highly associated with occurrence of chromosome 3 p LOH: 9 of the 15 samples with 11 q LOH had concomitant 3 p LOH (P = 0. 016). Chromosome 1 p LOH was seen in one-third of cases. LOH events on chromosomes 11 q and 1 p were generally accompanied by copy number loss, indicating hemizygous deletion within these regions.

40|$|Glioma {{development}} and progression {{are driven by}} complex genetic alterations, including point mutations and gain or loss of genomic copy number, as well as epigenetic aberrations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the causes and effects of these alterations are poorly understood, and improved treatments are greatly needed. Here, we report a comprehensive evaluation of the recurrent genomic alterations in gliomas and further dissect the molecular effects {{of the most frequently}}-occurring genomic events. First, we performed a multifaceted genomic analysis to identify genes targeted by copy number alteration in glioblastoma, the most aggressive malignant glioma. We identify EGFR negative regulator, ERRFI 1, as a glioblastoma-targeted gene within the minimal region of deletion in 1 p 36. 23. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Aurora-A kinase substrate, TACC 3, displays <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> on 4 p 16. 3 and is overexpressed in a grade-specific pattern. Next, using a gene targeting approach, we knocked-in a single copy of the most frequently observed point mutation in gliomas, IDH 1 R 132 H/WT, into a human cancer cell line. We show that heterozygous expression of the IDH 1 R 132 H allele is sufficient to induce the genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation characteristic of these tumors. Together, these data provide insight on genetic and epigenetic alterations which drive human gliomas. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy (LVH) is {{an independent}} risk factor {{for the development of}} heart failure, coronary heart disease and stroke. It develops as a result of hemodynamic overload, for instance, hypertension. Blood pressure is an important determinant of LVH, and a significant proportion of patients with essential hypertension develops this complication. However, this condition varies {{in a wide range of}} phenotypes, and studies had shown that patients with LVH may have near-normal blood pressure, suggesting that development of LVH may be due to an independent genetic factor from hypertension. LVH can be reversed with anti-hypertensive (anti-HT) agents. Angiotensinogen receptor blocker like losartan has been shown to improve the reversal effect. However, it is unknown whether using this anti-HT agent alone would be useful in preventing LVH. Hence, identifying HT patients with the risk of LVH may allow this hypothesis to be tested, and if successful, would lead to the prevention, treatment and improvement of prognosis of LVH. We recently carried out a genome-wide scan of copy number variation (CNV) on a group of hyptertensive LVH patients and observed a <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> in AGTRII gene in a group of patients.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the prevalence of activated EGFR gene and the association between mutation, copy number, and protein overexpression. Patients and Methods:In a cohort of consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma, polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing (n = 89) were conducted through exons 18 to 21. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (n = 89) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 6. 0 (n = 77) were used to detect the gene copy number. The protein expression of EGFR was detected by standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n = 89). Results:Fifty-nine (66. 3 %) patients harbored somatic mutations of EGFR in tyrosine kinase domain, 55. 1 % were positive by IHC and 44. 9 % were positive by FISH, and 66. 2 % showed <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> according to SNP array 6. 0. EGFR somatic mutations are more common in women, never smokers, and tumors with better differentiation.

Conclusions:The EGFR somatic mutation rate is significantly higher in Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma than western countries. Nevertheless, we found comparable FISH and IHC-positive rates between different ethnics.

40|$|Copy number {{variations}} represent {{large scale}} genomic alterations varying from 1 kb to 3 Mb and are proposed as {{a driving force}} for genome evolution and variation. One such locus exhibiting copy number variation and genome evolution is salivary amylase, {{which is responsible for}} the digestion of starch in the human parotid glands. It was reported that since human salivary amylase gene (AMY 1) copy numbers are correlated positively with protein levels, and also due to the correlation of high gene copy numbers with a starch rich diet, AMY 1 had undergone adaptive evolution. Moreover there was recent evidence for <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> in the human lineage concordant with the dietary shift which occurred during Neolithic times. The main focus of this study was the development of multiplex Paralogue Ratio Test (PRT) systems for measuring human amylase copy number. Despite having considerable identity between salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase copies, PRT was designed due to the exclusive association of a retroviral element with the salivary amylase gene copies, such that only salivary amylase copies were quantified. As retroviral elements are scattered throughout the genome therefore eliciting amplification from just test and reference without any contribution from alternative loci was a technical challenge in this project. However, creation of enough mismatches within the primer binding sites ensured that only the test and reference sequences were amplified. Discrimination by means of increasing annealing temperature also aided in exclusive amplification of test and reference sequences. Consequently, two PRTs and 1 microsatellite assay were successfully designed to measure copy number of AMY 1 in Japanese and UK DNA samples. 14 copies was the highest copy number seen in the samples from both PRT systems. Reference samples specifying individual classes of copy number exhibited strong relationship with the copy numbers as determined by previous work. Repeat testing and clustering of copy number data points by both the individual systems of measurement ascertained the accuracy and reproducibility of the developed assays...|$|E
40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is the most}} common tumor of the renal parenchyma. The aim {{of this study was to}} further characterize known as well as new genetic abnormalities in a clinical material of RCC, as well as in established cell lines to gain more information about etiological and progression factors. In particular, chromosome 3 p, 10 q and 14 q have been studied, which according to chromosome imbalance maps has shown loss in 70 %, 6 % and 30 % of the tumors, respectively. Paired normal and tumor tissue samples, as well as established cell lines and cultured tumors, were analyzed by genotyping with microsatellite markers, DNA sequencing, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and spectral karyotyping (SKY). In order to approach the genes in 3 p relevant for RCC development NotI-linking clones were isolated from a commonly deleted region. Assignment and ordering of NotI-linking clones showed that the clones were localized fairly even on chromosome 3 (paper I, II). In order to locate the minimal deleted region on 3 p the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) strategy was selected (paper III). Thirty-seven RCC tumors were screened for deletions of different regions on 3 p to clarify their respective roles in the development of conventional RCC. Twelve cases were selected for more detailed analyses of 3 p by comparing LOH and CGH data. In three RCC cell lines and three primary tumors interstitial deletions were detected by both methods. Our results suggest that only a fraction of clear cell RCCs have terminal deletions and 3 p carries at least four frequently affected regions (paper III). In order to locate the minimal target region for 10 q deletions a panel of fifty-four cases of RCCs was screened for 10 q LOH. In addition, selected cases were screened for mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Two smallest deleted regions were observed. The five tumors with LOH covering 1 Oq 23 were selected for mutation analysis of the PTEN/MMAC 1 gene. From the direct sequencing of the nine exons, we found three different base pair changes in three tumors with LOH. Homozygous deletion of the PTEN gene was found in one RCC cell line (paper IV). In approaching the genetic background of RCC development we have performed a detailed mapping of 14 q deletions in RCC tumors. Five minimal regions of overlapping deletions were identified, three of which were defined from the primary RCCs. Losses in telomeric regions were each significantly associated with high tumor grade (i. e. Grade 3; p< 0. 05). Further-more, LOH within the region between D 14 S 617 and D 14 S 260 was also associated with a significantly shorter survival (p= 0. 02). In conclusion, the high frequency of distal 14 q LOH supports the relevance of this alteration for the development of RCC (paper V). Finally, primary RCC tumors were obtained at surgery and short term cultured for subsequent cytogenetic characterization by CGH and SKY. Overall numerical alterations were more frequent than structural changes. The two structural alterations identified constituted of a deletion of 3 p in conventional RCC, and a ring chromosome derived from chromosome 8 in a papillary RCC. <b>Gain</b> <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> were revealed on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 8 q, and 20, while the losses encompassed 3 p and 17 p. The SKY and CGH data suggest that the conventional RCCs are genetically more homogenous than the other types of kidney cancer (paper VI). In conclusion, comparisons between deletion mapping of 3 p, 1 Oq, and 14 q suggested that discontinous LOH represent a general mechanism of RCC development. A subset of RCC appears to constitute of heterogenous tumor cell populations. Furthermore, in sporadic cases, the variations in chromosome copy number changes seen between subgroups of tumor cells, is one dominant mechanism for tumor cell evolution in the kidney...|$|E

Incubated cells used for xenografting (Passage 0) were considered to represent the primary tumor. Four important differentially expressed miRNAs (miR- 31, miR- 31 *, miR- 145, miR- 106) were selected for further validation by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Integrated analysis of aCGH and miRNA data was performed on 14 xenograft passages by bioinformatic methods.

40|$|Stimulation or {{repression}} of gene expression by genome-wide regulatory mechanisms {{is an important}} epigenetic regulatory function which can act to efficiently regulate larger regions or specific groups of genes, for example by compensating for loss or <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> chromosome <b>copy</b> <b>numbers.</b> In Drosophila melanogaster there are two known chromosome-wide regulatory systems; the MSL complex, which mediates dosage compensation of the single male X-chromosome and POF, which stimulates expression from the heterochromatic 4 th chromosome. POF also interacts with the heterochromatin inducing protein HP 1 a, which represses expression from the 4 th chromosome but which also has been assigned stimulatory functions. In addition to these two, there is another more elusive and less well-characterized genome-wide mechanism called buffering, which can act to balance transcriptional output of aneuploidy regions of the genome (i. e. <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> variation). In my thesis, I describe {{the presence of a}} novel physical link between dosage compensation and heterochromatin; mediate by two female-specific POF binding sites, proximal to roX 1 and roX 2 on the X chromosome (the two non-coding RNAs in the MSL complex). These sites can also provide clues to the mechanisms behind targeting of chromosome-specific proteins. Furthermore, to clarify the conflicting reports about the function of HP 1 a, I have suggested a mechanism in which HP 1 a has adopted its function to different genomic locations and gene types. Different binding mechanisms to the promoter vs. the exon of genes allows HP 1 a to adopt opposite functions; at the promoter, HP 1 a binding opens up the chromatin structure and stimulates gene expression, whereas the binding to exons condense the chromatin and thus, represses expression. This also causes long genes to be more bound and repressed by HP 1 a. Moreover, I show that buffering of monosomic regions is a weak but significant response to loss <b>of</b> chromosomal <b>copy</b> <b>numbers,</b> and that this is mediated via a general mechanism which mainly acts on differentially expressed genes, where the effect becomes stronger for long genes. I also show that POF is the factor which compensates for <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> loss <b>of</b> chromosome 4...|$|R

Mechanistically, we have found that Sox 9 directly binds and activates the promoter of the polycomb Bmi 1, whose upregulation represses the tumor suppressor Ink 4 a/Arf locus. In agreement with this, human colorectal cancers showed a positive correlation between expression levels of SOX 9 and BMI 1 and a negative correlation between SOX 9 and ARF in clinical samples.

Recurrent CDC DNA losses occurred at 8 p (n= 9 / 29), 16 p (9 / 29), 1 p (n= 7 / 29) and 9 p (n= 7 / 29), and gains occurred in 13 q (n= 9 / 29). In contrast to CDC, the most frequently detected UUT-UC DNA aberration was a loss at 9 q (n= 13 / 26). DNA losses at 9 q, 13 q and 8 q as well as gains at 8 p showed significant variations in UUT-UC compared to CDC. There was no correlation between the patients' clinical course and the presence or absence of these recurrent genetic alterations. CDCs are characterized by a different genetic pattern compared to UUT-UC. Regarding the published data on renal cell carcinoma, we conclude that CDC appears to be a unique entity among kidney carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|SOX 9 [sex-determining region Y (SRY) -box 9 protein], a high {{mobility}} group box transcription factor, plays critical roles during embryogenesis and its {{activity is}} required for development, differentiation, and lineage commitment in various tissues including the intestinal epithelium. Here, we present functional and clinical data of a broadly important role for SOX 9 in tumorigenesis. SOX 9 was overexpressed {{in a wide range}} of human cancers, where its expression correlated with malignant character and progression. <b>Gain</b> <b>of</b> SOX 9 <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> is detected in some primary colorectal cancers. SOX 9 exhibited several pro-oncogenic properties, including the ability to promote proliferation, inhibit senescence, and collaborate with other oncogenes in neoplastic transformation. In primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and colorectal cancer cells, SOX 9 expression facilitated tumor growth and progression whereas its inactivation reduced tumorigenicity. Mechanistically, we have found that Sox 9 directly binds and activates the promoter of the polycomb Bmi 1, whose upregulation represses the tumor suppressor Ink 4 a/Arf locus. In agreement with this, human colorectal cancers showed a positive correlation between expression levels of SOX 9 and BMI 1 and a negative correlation between SOX 9 and ARF in clinical samples. Taken together, our findings provide direct mechanistic evidence of the involvement of SOX 9 in neoplastic pathobiology, particularly, in colorectal cancer. © 2012 AACR. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Case Details. We report rare {{familial}} {{unbalanced translocation}} of chromosomes 7 and 12, which was diagnosed prenatally at 20 + 3 weeks of gestation. Woman’s partner had {{been tested in}} the past and was found to be a carrier of a balanced translocation; his karyotype showed a balanced reciprocal translocation of 46, XY, t(7; 12) (q 34;q 24, 32). Partner’s brother had an unbalanced form of the translocation with severe learning disability. The diagnosis of the anomaly was based on two- and three-dimensional ultrasound and microarray analysis. Ultrasonography findings included fetal microcephaly and alobar holoprosencephaly, dysmorphic face (flat occiput, absent nasal bone, microphthalmia, hypotelorism, and single nostril), and hyperechogenic bowel. Genome-wide array analysis and cytogenetic results from the amniotic fluid showed unbalanced translocation in chromosomes 7 and 12 with deletion of an approximately 16. 5 [*]Mb and a duplication of 6. 1 [*]Mb, respectively, Arr 7 q 34 q 36. 3 (142, 668, 576 - 159, 161, 648) x 1, 12 q 24. 32 q 24. 33 (127, 708, 720 - 133, 777, 560) x 3, karyotype (der (7) t(7; 12) (q 34;q 24) pat). This unbalanced translocation was due to the segregation of the father’s balanced translocation. In this particular case, the recurrence of an unbalanced translocation in the subsequent pregnancies is estimated to be 20 %.

40|$|Proximal-type {{epithelioid}} sarcoma is {{a recently}} described soft-tissue tumor that is distinguished from conventional-type epithelioid sarcoma by {{a far more}} aggressive clinical course, frequent location in the proximal anatomic regions, and variable rhabdoid morphology. Because of their rarity and peculiar morphology, proximal-type epithelioid sarcomas frequently pose serious diagnostic dilemmas, being easily misdiagnosed as {{a variety of other}} malignant neoplasms. To date, the information available on the genetic alterations associated with this tumor entity has been confined to single conventional cytogenetic reports. In this article, we present the results of a conventional and molecular cytogenetic analysis of six proximal-type epithelioid sarcomas. Spectral karyotyping analysis of these cases deciphered the characteristics of several marker chromosomes and complex translocations, leading to the recognition of recurrent rearrangements. The most frequently involved chromosome arm was 22 q, and the identification of two cases with a similar translocation, t(10; 22), suggests a role for one or more genes on chromosome 22 in the pathogenesis of this tumor and provides an opportunity for finely mapping the translocation-associated breakpoints. Chromosome arm 8 q gain was also a frequent event and correlated with <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> MYC gene <b>copy</b> <b>number,</b> as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to distinguish the clinical and genetic features of the 46,XX male syndrome from other more frequent, testicular-origin azoospermic causes of male infertility. Methods: To study 46,XX male syndrome, we compared clinical and endocrinological parameters to other groups with testicular-origin azoospermia, and to an age-matched group of healthy males and females as normal control. Fluorescent in situ hybridization for detection and localization of the sex-determining region of the Y gene (SRY), array-based comparative genomic hybridization screening, and real-time qualitative polymerase chain reaction of FGF 9, WT 1, NR 5 A 1, and SPRY 2 genes were performed in this genetic investigation. Results: Our three patients with 46,XX male syndrome had a much higher follicular-stimulating hormone level, lower body height, lower testosterone level, and ambiguous external genitalia. One of the three patients with 46,XX male syndrome was SRY-negative. A further genetic study, including a comparative genomic hybridization array and real-time polymerase chain reaction, showed a <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> FGF 9 <b>copy</b> <b>numbers</b> only in the SRY-negative 46,XX male. The genetic <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the FGF 9 gene was duplicated in that case compared to the normal female control and was significantly lower than that of the normal male control. No such genomic gain was observed in the case of the two SRY-positive 46,XX males. Conclusion: Similar to clinical manifestations of 46,XX male syndrome, genetic evidence in this study suggests that FGF 9 may contribute to sex reversal, but additional confirmation with more cases is still needed...|$|R
30|$|The {{functional}} significance <b>of</b> ALK <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>gains</b> or polysomy 2 {{in breast}} carcinogenesis is not clear. Recent study by Kim et al. demonstrated that ALK CNG {{was observed in}} 17 / 36 (47.2  %) IBC cases and was associated with worse overall survival {{when compared to the}} patients without ALK CNG by univariate analysis (24.9 vs 38.1  months; p =  0.033). The recurrence free survival after mastectomy was also shorter in the patients with ALK CNG (12.7 vs 43.4  months; p =  0.016) (Kim et al. 2015). Studies of ALK in solid tumors other than breast have shown similar correlation with worse prognosis. Jia et al. (2014) reported that increased ALK <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> gains in hepatocellular carcinoma are associated with a decreased 3 -year overall survival (18.2 vs 63.6  %; p =  0.021) and 3 -year progression free survival (18.2 vs 46.9  %; p =  0.019) as compared to those without ALK <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> alterations. In lung cancer, <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> ALK is a more frequent phenomenon than ALK rearrangement, and is reported in up to 63  % of cases (Salido et al. 2011). This has persuaded investigators to study if tyrosine kinase inhibitors would be effective even in patients with ALK <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> gains without rearrangement; however, the results have been conflicting. A recent study tested crizotinib sensitivity in nine lung cancer cell lines and three patients with NSCLC exhibiting ALK CNG, and concluded that HCNG without ALK rearrangement has predictive value for chemo sensitivity to crizotinib (Kalai et al. 2012). On the contrary; CNG of ALK has been implicated as one of the mechanisms for developing resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Pietrantonio et al. (2014) have reported that <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> ALK gene <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> may predict lack of benefit from anti-EGFR treatment in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and RAS-RAF-PI 3 KCA wild-type status.

40|$|Loss of {{heterozygosity}} (LOH) {{analysis and}} comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) {{were used in}} an attempt to identify recurrent chromosomal alterations in different types of parathyroid tumors. These included familial and sporadic, benign and malignant, as well as primary, irradiation associated and secondary tumors. Hitherto unidentified tumor suppressor genes were implicated on chromosomes 1 p, 6 q, 9 p, 11 p, 11 q, 13 q, 15 q, 18 q and X, as well as a putative oncogene locus represented by a <b>gain</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> on chromosome 19 (Papers I and V). Since many genes responsible for familial cancer syndromes also are mutated in their sporadic counterparts, another approach was to search for deletions of chromosomal regions to which familial syndromes are mapped. The 11 q 13 region, which harbors the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) tumor suppressor gene, is deleted in the majority of parathyroid tumors from MEN 1 patients. Similarly, a third of tumors from patients with sporadic primary HPT showed LOH at 11 q 13 (Papers 1 and II) and in half of these cases a somatic MEN 1 mutation could be demonstrated (Paper II). The sporadic adenomas with MEN 1 involvement also displayed a significantly higher number of CGH aberrations as compared with the non-MEN 1 associated group (p< 0. 05) (Paper V). The genetic profile obtained for the radiation associated adenomas closely resembled that of the ordinary adenomas with involvement of the MEN 1 gene, i. e. multiple CGH alterations and frequent losses of 11 q. Indeed, inactivating mutations of the MEN 1 gene were identified in four of the eight irradiation associated tumors analyzed (Paper V). Changes in the calcium receptor (CaR) have been proposed to be responsible for the increase in set-point of parathyroid hormone secretion seen in primary HPT. The level of CaR mRNA in the adenomas was in the range of 41 - 98 % (median of 64 %) of the expression level in the normal parathyroid tissue (Paper VI). The mRNA level was not found to correlate with serum calcium, parathyroid hormone or adenoma weight. It seems likely that the reduced levels of receptor mRNAs and protein is a secondary phenomenon, rather than a primary event. Two families with HPT-JT syndrome were investigated and in both families renal hamartomas or cystic kidney disease were prominent associated features, possibly representing a new phenotypic variant of the HPT-JT syndrome. A sex dependent penetrance of HPT was seen, resulting in mainly male affected cases (Paper III). Three large previously unreported FIHPfamilies in whom the disease was linked to the chromosome 1 q 21 -q 32 region were analyzed and two of these families were considered to be true FIHP families, i. e. {{there was no evidence of}} jaw or renal lesions despite careful radiological investigations. In the third family, a parathyroid cancer and two cases of polycystic kidney disease were found and that family was therefore considered as being affected by the classical HPT-JT syndrome. The same sex-dependent penetrance of HPT was seen in the FIHP families as in the HPT-JT families reported in paper III. LOH analysis showed loss in the l q region of the wild type allele in the renal hamartomas and in some of the parathyroid tumors, including the parathyroid cancer, suggesting that this gene is a tumor suppressor gene. Parathyroid cancer is a rare cause of primary HPT. Nevertheless this group creates diagnostic and therapeu- tic problems, since in the absence of invasion of adjacent organs or structures and/or metastases, the diagnosis of parathyroid cancer can not be definitely established based on histopathology. The expression of Ki- 67, RB and Gelatinase A were investigated as possible tumor markers in parathyroid cancers. However, none of these markers was suitable for reliable differentiation between benign and malignant parathyroid tumors (Papers VII and VIII) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Copy</b> <b>number</b> {{aberration}} is {{a common}} form of genomic instability in cancer. Gene expression is closely tied to cytogenetic events by the central dogma of molecular biology, {{and serves as a}} mediator <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> changes in disease phenotypes. Accordingly, it is of interest to develop proper statistical methods for jointly analyzing <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> and gene expression data. This work describes a novel Bayesian inferential approach for a double-layered mixture model (DLMM) which directly models the stochastic nature <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> data and identifies abnormally expressed genes due to aberrant <b>copy</b> <b>number.</b> Simulation studies were conducted to illustrate the robustness of DLMM under various settings <b>of</b> <b>copy</b> <b>number</b> aberration frequency, confounding effects, and signal-to-noise ratio in gene expression data.
