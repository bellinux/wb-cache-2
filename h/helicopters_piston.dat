50|$|This {{airport is}} mainly {{operated}} by general aviation aircraft, Flight Training Organizations and flying clubs. Due to the runway length and surrounding buildings {{it is only}} possible to operate <b>helicopters,</b> <b>piston</b> engine aircraft, medium size turbo-props and small business jets. Also, {{due to the lack}} of IFR facilities, but an old NDB (CVT), it is only possible to operate VFR flights. Nevertheless, it is the headquarters airport of several FTOs, including some of the major Spanish ones as Gestair Flying Academy, Aerotec, Aerofan and others.|$|E
50|$|Lycoming Engines {{is a major}} American {{manufacturer}} of aircraft engines. With a factory in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Lycoming produces a line of horizontally opposed, air-cooled, four-, six- and eight-cylinder engines including the only FAA-certified aerobatic and <b>helicopter</b> <b>piston</b> engines on the market. The company has built more than 325,000 piston aircraft engines and powers {{more than half the}} world's general aviation fleet, both rotary and fixed wing. Lycoming is an operating division of Avco Corporation, itself a subsidiary of Textron.|$|R

5000|$|In many <b>piston</b> {{engine-powered}} <b>helicopters,</b> {{the pilot}} manipulates the throttle to maintain rotor speed. Turbine engine <b>helicopters,</b> and some <b>piston</b> <b>helicopters,</b> use governors or other electro-mechanical control systems to maintain rotor speed and relieve {{the pilot of}} routine responsibility for that task. (There is normally also a manual reversion available {{in the event of}} a governor failure.) ...|$|R
50|$|After 1945 it was {{occupied}} by the Soviet army. By then it {{was used as a}} spare airport. It was never utilized as a primary airport due to its lack of paved runways. <b>Helicopters</b> and <b>piston</b> driven aircraft were stationed here. Additionally, parachute landings were executed at the airport.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 September 1952, Bell pilot Elton J. Smith set a world {{distance}} {{record for}} <b>piston</b> <b>helicopters</b> of 1217 mi by flying nonstop from Hurst, Texas, to Buffalo, New York. As of 2017, this record still stands.|$|R
50|$|The weapons, {{including}} Mil Mi-24 <b>helicopter</b> gunships, <b>piston</b> engined light aircraft, military {{small arms}} and 600 crates of ammunition, were shipped in an Antonov An-124 Ruslan giant plane. This was intercepted by Australian fighter jets, and escorted to Australia until {{the government of}} PNG arranged for the material {{to be returned to}} Sandline. The helicopters remained in storage at RAAF Base Tindal as of 2015, with the Australian Defence Force seeking to dispose of them in 2016.|$|R
50|$|The CH-37 {{was one of}} {{the last}} heavy <b>helicopters</b> to use <b>piston</b> engines, which were larger, heavier and less {{powerful}} than the turboshaft engines subsequently employed in later military helicopters. This accounted for the type's fairly short service life, all being withdrawn from service by the late 1960s, replaced in Army service by the distantly related CH-54 Tarhe and in the Marine Corps by the CH-53 Sea Stallion.|$|R
2500|$|After {{three years}} and nearly 600 hours between the two aircraft, the XV-1 {{contract}} was canceled in 1957. Ultimately, {{it was determined that}} the XV-1's convertiplane configuration was too complex for the small advantages gained over conventional <b>helicopters.</b> The <b>piston</b> engine could not produce enough power to optimize the design advantages. Technological advances in conventional helicopter rotor design and engines in the following years would eventually negate the XV-1's performance margin. [...] The noise level was 116dB in the cockpit, but even higher for ground personnel who described the tip jet noise as [...] "extremely irritating" [...] and the noise level was still 90dB Â½ mile away. McDonnell would try to capitalize on the tip-jet rotor technology with a small crane helicopter design, designated Model 120 and first flown on 13 November 1957.|$|R
50|$|Reliable {{helicopters}} {{capable of}} stable hover flight were developed decades after fixed-wing aircraft. This is {{largely due to}} higher engine power density requirements than fixed-wing aircraft. Improvements in fuels and engines {{during the first half of}} the 20th century were a critical factor in helicopter development. The availability of lightweight turboshaft engines in the second half of the 20th century led to the development of larger, faster, and higher-performance helicopters. While smaller and less expensive <b>helicopters</b> still use <b>piston</b> engines, turboshaft engines are the preferred powerplant for helicopters today.|$|R
5000|$|By May 2011, {{the company}} had sold more than 1,000 EVS systems using 50+ {{aviation}} certifications on more than 200 different aircraft models including business jets, <b>helicopters</b> and various <b>piston</b> driven aircraft. [...] Among those companies that offer the Max-Viz EVS at the factory on selected aircraft models are AgustaWestland, Beechcraft, Bell Helicopter, Cessna, Cirrus Aircraft [...] and Eurocopter. [...] Max-Viz continues as a standalone business unit of Astronics Corporation and focuses its resources on core competencies involving packaging & design, image fusion and certification/installation of EVS systems.|$|R
50|$|Loakan Airport is {{the lone}} airport serving the general area of Baguio. The airport is {{classified}} as a trunkline airport, or a major commercial domestic airport, by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines but there are currently no regular commercial services in the airport. It is located {{south of the city}} center. Due to the limited length of the runway which is 1,802 meters or 5,912 feet, it is restricted to commuter size aircraft. The airport is used primarily by <b>helicopters,</b> turbo-prop and <b>piston</b> engine aircraft, although on rare occasion light business jets (LBJ) have flown into the airport.|$|R
50|$|Loakan Airport is {{the lone}} airport serving the general area. The airport is {{classified}} as a trunkline airport, or a major commercial domestic airport, by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, a body of the Department of Transportation and Communications {{that is responsible for}} the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports. It is about 10 minutes by car from the city center going south. Due to the limited length of the runway which is 1,802 meters or 5,912 feet, it is restricted to commuter size aircraft. This perhaps contributed to the city's declining competitiveness against other medium-sized cities around the country. The airport is used primarily by <b>helicopters,</b> turbo-prop and <b>piston</b> engine aircraft, although on rare occasion light business jets (LBJ) have flown into the airport.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the core}} of the Cabri's {{avionics}} is the Electronic Pilot Management (EPM) system, the digital instrumentation of the aircraft's glass cockpit. Intended to be intuitive, the EPM uses three monitors to display critical aircraft and engine information, such as current power settings, engine/rotor RPM, fuel level, flight time, and sensor data. In the event of an EPM system failure, backup systems are present. Guimbal claim the Cabri G2 to be [...] "the only <b>piston</b> <b>helicopter</b> designed from scratch with the safety of its occupants as top priority." [...] As such, numerous safety features are present upon the aircraft, including the design of the main rotor, a crash-worthy design, four-way trim system, energy-absorbent structure/seats, automatic carburetor ice-protection system, crash-resistant fuel tank, and exceptional autorotation capabilities. During development, the safety, security, longevity aspects of the design were emphasized over the cost.|$|R
40|$|The thesis deals the {{preliminary}} {{draft of the}} small two-seat <b>helicopter</b> with a <b>piston</b> engine. The aim of the thesis is not to propose a helicopter across {{the extent of the}} problems. Therefore we have chosen only selected issues which can be managed in the range of work. The introduction is focused on defining the general requirements imposed on proposed helicopter, formulating the basic conceptual and structural design according to the building regulation the relevant category. These ranges create a based assumption for right evaluation of the statistical analysis of the helicopters of the same or very near parameters category. Subsequently, there were defined the basic parameters of the proposed helicopter which make possible to solve the performance characteristics in the vertical and backward flight. The work is also focused on design of the rotor head of main rotor for the proposed helicopter, the definition of load acting on the rotor head, waving analysis and calculation of centrifugal forces acting on the main rotor blades. The design of the rotor head and also the helicopter as a whole will be graphically processed in the program Dassault Systemes Catia...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} standards and administrative {{procedures for the}} continuing airworthiness of aircraft and aircraft components, {{as well as the}} approval of organizations and personnel involved in these tasks, it is established in the European Regulation (EC) No 2042 / 2003 and amended by the (EU) No 1149 / 2011. Today, the community of Catalonia has more than twenty organizations that require technical maintenance specialist certifying aircraft and/or <b>helicopters</b> turbine and/or <b>piston,</b> as well as who can certify avionics maintenance performed on systems electric aircraft. In contrast, there is no maintenance training organization in the fields of helicopters and avionics. Therefore, the aim of this project is to create an organization for training in specialties not currently in Catalonia. In order {{to make the most of}} existing resources, it was necessary to visit and learn the means of which have different maintenance organizations as Heliswiss Iberica, Inaer, Aero Link, SHSC Helicopters, EFAV and Illa dels Banyols institute. The most obvious conclusion is that the helicopter maintenance companies and/or avionics have to hire skilled in aircraft and then train them in-house, instead of being able to hire technicians trained directly in the fields of helicopters and/or avionics. The procedures and training plans developed in this project provide trained technicians in schools and Banyols EFAV a curriculum to expand their skills to the needs of companies of helicopters and/or avionics, fully complying with requirements established by the European Aviation Safety Agency...|$|R
