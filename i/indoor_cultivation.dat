The larger the bulb, the more flowers it will produce. The largest bulbs measure 14 to 16 inches (36 to 41cm) in circumference and will produce three or more scapes (flower stems) with four or more blooms each. The commonest bulbs measure 10½ to 12½ inches (27 to 32cm) with two scapes with four to six flowers each depending on the cultivar. Some bulbs put up two flower scapes at the same time; others may wait several weeks between blooms and sometimes the second scape will have {{only two or three}} flowers rather than the usual four. A bulb needs to produce large, healthy leaves in the summer growing season before it can send up a scape the following year. Bulbs are often described by the country of origin of the bulb producers, since they may have different characteristics, e.g. 'Dutch Amaryllis', 'South African Amarylllis'. Dutch bulbs usually produce flowers first, then, after they have finished blooming (hysteranthous), the plant will begin growing leaves. [...] Bulbs from the South African growers usually put up a scape and leaves at the same time (synanthous).|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} for vegetables production in indoor or disadvantaged climatic zones by using greenhouses. The main problem of crop growing indoor or in environment with limited light availability is the correct choice of light source and the quality of lighting spectrum. In greenhouse and <b>indoor</b> <b>cultivations,</b> plant density is higher than in the open field and plants have to compete for light and nutrients. Nowadays, advanced systems for indoor horticulture use light emitting diodes (LED) for improving crop growth, enhancing the plant productivity and favouring the best nutritional quality formation. In closed environments, as indoor growing modules, the lighting system represents the only source of light and its features are fundamental for obtaining the best lighting performances for plant and the most efficient solution. LED lighting engines are more efficient compared to the lighting sources used traditionally in horticulture and allow light spectrum and intensity modulations to enhance the light use efficiency for plants. The lighting distribution and the digital controls are fundamental for tailoring the spectral distribution on each plant in specific moments of its growth and play an important role for optimizing growth and produce high-quality vegetables. LED lights can increase plant growth and yield, but also nutraceutical quality, since some light intensities increase pigments biosynthesis and enhance the antioxidants content of leaves or fruits: in this regards the selection of LED primary light sources in relation to the peaks of the absorbance curve of the plants is important...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Energy, Environment, and Society, 2013 According to the United States Department of Justice, Humboldt County, California {{leads the}} nation in the number of indoor-grown Cannabis plants {{eradicated}} by law enforcement officials. Electricity used to power indoor grow operations can be costly, especially when compared to the alternative of growing plants outside under sunlight. While benefits of <b>indoor</b> <b>cultivation</b> include security, more control over the growing environment, and the ability to continuously supply fresh product, one major drawback is greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation. Since the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996, which legalized medicinal Cannabis in California, per capita residential electricity consumption in Humboldt County has become greater than that of the average Californian, despite the lack of air conditioning load in the coastal zone. This increase is believed to be directly related to indoor Cannabis cultivation. Although as affirmed by the Humboldt County Sheriff???s Office Drug Enforcement Agency, it is difficult to quantify exact amounts of electricity consumption related to this clandestine industry. This thesis presents results of an investigation on the energy consumption and environmental impacts associated with Cannabis cultivation. Focus was directed at indoor marijuana production in Humboldt County, California. The economic feasibility of small-scale indoor Cannabis production in Arcata, California was analyzed and factors that contribute to production decisions were evaluated. A study of medical Cannabis dispensaries was conducted to estimate the amount of electricity consumed per quantity of medicinal-grade marijuana produced at different <b>indoor</b> <b>cultivation</b> facilities. Possible Cannabis cultivation energy efficiency gains are presented as efficiency measures for buildings, equipment, methods, and regulations. The relationship between medicinal product quality assurance and energy efficient practices is considered. Looking beyond the thesis, this information is summarized for Cannabis policy makers, cultivators, and consumers. A reduction in electricity consumption related to indoor Cannabis cultivation could be achieved with appropriate public policy and information dissemination. Federal prohibition of Cannabis is a significant hindrance to local and state regulation of this industry, keeping black market prices high and reducing growers??? incentive to comply with environmental standards. The objective of this thesis is to address inefficient energy use associated with illicit Cannabis production in a burgeoning legal market...|$|E

40|$|Microalgae {{are drawing}} {{increased}} attention {{from a variety}} of fields ranging from nutrition and health care to energy, and deservedly so. The potential of algae is almost unparalleled as a biomanufacturing platform. Microalgae can be used to produce complex human antibodies to target cancerous cells, or as crops for the production of high quality food, or even as sources of lipids for conversion into biofuels. They can grow to tremendous density in bioreactors, or be cultivated in open ponds where their yield per acre dominates that of higher plants. 	Research in microalgae needs {{to take it to the}} next step, to transform potential into reality and make production strains of microalgae into designer products that are custom tailored to suit the needs of the industry. The diversity of microalgae is enormous, and as a result, it is unlikely that the strains we have identified today will be the same we see as ideal production strains tomorrow. So in order to continue advancing the field, techniques for ideal cultivation, genetic modification, and metabolic engineering will need to be developed. This thesis work seeks to do just that by covering cultivation technology, metabolic engineering of lipids, and genetic modification of potential production strains. From a molecular perspective, a broad review of the current state of lipid metabolic engineering in both microalgae and higher plants is provided, covering both the biofuel relevant molecules as well as nutritionally relevant omega- 3 fatty acids. New techniques for rapid interrogation of protein, lipid, and dry weight content in microalgae under either <b>indoor</b> or outdoor <b>cultivation</b> techniques are also described herein. These will enable more efficient harvesting and culturing techniques as well as more efficient use of fertilizers and nutrients in cultivation of microalgae. Proof of concept for custom tailoring lipid profile is demonstrated in the manipulation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii lipid metabolism for the production of very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which also provides insights into how changes in lipid profile can have unexpected effects and yield new insights on lipid metabolism. Finally, attempts to characterize and transform a variety of potential production species are covered and reveal challenges to the transformation of new microalgae species. Taken together, this work represents significant advances in the field with regard to both cultivation and transformation and metabolic engineering of microalgal species...|$|R

Experimental results were fitted to Langmuir equation, Freundlich equation and Temkin equation, Langmuir equation was found to be the best to describe the adsorption of phosphor, and Temkin equation was the fittest for describing the adsorption of potassium.
