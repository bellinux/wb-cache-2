40|$|In {{the last}} decades the use of {{asynchronous}} machine in industrial and traction applications has been widespread also aided {{by the development of}} electrical drives and control techniques. It has been noted that distorted feeding voltages causes, in some cases, the breaking of squirrel cages. In order to investigate these phenomena, in the paper, authors have studied the mathematical model of the mechanical behaviour of the rotor cage of an asynchronous motor. A calculus procedure for obtaining an analytical solution of this mathematical model is suggested. The analytical solution expresses the natural torsional frequencies of the rotor cage {{as a function of the}} bar overhang and stiffness. The theoretical procedure presented can be used as a design guideline in order to prevent the breaking of the <b>end-bar</b> junctions when the motor is supplied by PWM inverters. The theoretical procedure is completed by a numerical analysis...|$|E
