500|$|Production on the band's sixth studio album {{began as}} a result of a series of events in which Shinoda decided to drop the {{electronic}} and experimental sound of the band's previous two studio albums. Shinoda had originally recorded and produced demos, which continued the sound of A Thousand Suns and Living Things, for the band's sixth studio album during the band's Living Things World Tour in 2013. He presented the demos to his bandmates, which received positive reception from the rest of the band, and to Rubin, who was also positive towards the demos, though describing them to Shinoda as more [...] "poppy" [...] than he expected. However, Shinoda, after listening to the demos again after the end of the tour, felt a strong negativity towards his material, especially after Rubin's statements. In a Warner Music interview, Shinoda stated that [...] "I don't even believe in this music. This is a mistake; I don't like what I'm making. I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> backwards into the process and scrapped all of it and started new stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|The band rescheduled European tour {{dates in}} the {{aftermath}} of the September 11 attacks. [...] "After the attacks the world <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> into freeze mode and we didn't know whether to carry on with things or not... so we decided we'd rather everyone was safe and play the shows a little later instead," [...] said Hoppus shortly thereafter. The European dates were canceled a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was", and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to feel betrayed. The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.|$|E
500|$|Steve Kandell of New York {{magazine}} {{said the}} episode felt like [...] "a {{bit of a}} place-holder" [...] compared to other episodes in the season, but that [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] included amusing scenes and introduced new ways to mock bureaucracy [...] "without every feeling like the sly satire it secretly is". Kandell also said he enjoyed the jokes at Leslie's and Jerry's expense. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said every character was at their best, and that he particularly enjoyed Ron's taunting of Leslie once it was made clear he was only joking. Gallagher said the [...] "only thing about this episode I didn't love" [...] {{was the way the}} subplot involving Tom's investment with the nightclub ended, because she felt it [...] "started off strong, but <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> nowhere." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was not a stand-out, but offered great character moments between Leslie and Ron. Fowler said Tom's desire to live like a hip hop mogul was funny [...] "but not always engaging", and that he enjoyed the [...] "little moments" [...] between Andy and April.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in {{the development}} of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew. She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. I remember her teaching us how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|E
2500|$|At {{around the}} same time, {{long-term}} manager Bruce Findlay was fired {{and over the next}} few years the band gradually altered to the point where it was a shifting set of musicians around the only remaining core members, Kerr and Burchill. MacNeil has commented [...] "After I left, everything <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went,</b> and Bruce fell into that bracket of upheaval. I don't think he deserved it and I have a lot of sympathy for him after the way he was treated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the band's {{eventual}} return, Ed Droste noted, [...] "Coming {{back together}} {{to try to}} write and record was like being in junior high again – after you go away for the summer, {{the first couple of}} weeks are slightly awkward when you get back to school. Then, you get back into the swing." [...] Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "The whole process with this record felt like starting over. We took enough time off that we... I don't know. My head <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> out of the game or something. Getting back into it was really confusing. It took a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dupré began singing professionally when Jerry Cooper, a {{musician}} {{she was living}} with, heard her singing the Aretha Franklin version of the song [...] "Respect" [...] in the shower. [...] "She had this huge voice for such a little girl," [...] Cooper told MTV, [...] "and so I just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> in and said, 'Hey, come upstairs when you're done with this, and let's work on some songs.'" [...] According to Dupré, she then toured and recorded with Cooper's band, networking {{with people in the}} music industry. In 2005, she formed a company named Pasche New York, an entertainment business intended to promote her music career.|$|E
2500|$|Tarantino {{has stated}} that he {{originally}} planned [...] "to do a Black Mask movie", referring to the magazine largely responsible for popularizing hardboiled detective fiction. [...] "t <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> somewhere else". Geoffrey O'Brien sees the result as connected [...] "rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition: the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers as Cornell Woolrich [...] Fredric Brown... Both dealt heavily {{in the realm of}} improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes, a realm that Pulp Fiction makes its own." [...] In particular, O'Brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of Brown's novels and the recursive, interweaving structure of Pulp Fiction. Philip French describes the film's narrative as a [...] "circular movement or Möbius strip of a kind Resnais and Robbe-Grillet would admire." [...] James Mottram regards crime novelist Elmore Leonard, whose influence Tarantino has acknowledged, as the film's primary literary antecedent. He suggests that Leonard's [...] "rich dialogue" [...] is reflected in Tarantino's [...] "popular-culture-strewn jive"; he also points to the acute, extremely dark sense of humor Leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E
5000|$|Hardcore Gaming 101 concludes {{about this}} version: [...] "... {{most of the}} [...] "soul" [...] of these tables is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>gone</b> (the Demon table now lacks the [...] "Escape from the Mega Mutant Meatball" [...] mode, for example).

2500|$|Taking {{their name}} from the David Bowie song with the same title, Pritchard {{revealed}} the first song they ever played as a group was a cover version of The Strokes' song [...] "Reptilia". The Kooks recorded an EP demo, sending it out in search of gigs; they instead received offers from managers and record companies. The band had only been together as a group for four months when they signed with Virgin Records, after being spotted by several label scouts at the Brighton Free Butt Festival in 2005. In an interview with musicOMH, Pritchard revealed [...] "It was really quick how it all happened, we did a demo with a mate of ours in London, which we sent off to one guy to get some gigs, and {{he turned out to}} be a manager. He rung us up and it <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> from there." [...] The members of the band have since revealed that they felt they weren’t ready at the time, [...] "We were way too early to sign a record deal ... We were really young, we'd been together like two or three months, so we really didn't want to sign. But then we thought it's a really good opportunity and Virgin seemed like really cool people - they just seemed to really understand where we were coming from.," [...] said Pritchard, who has also complimented the space the record label allowed for the band to grow, [...] "They were patient with us and let us develop our style, whatever it was." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> with it.|$|E
2500|$|Salli Frattini, the {{executive}} producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled {{a phone call from}} the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. [...] "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. [...] "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s. What just happened?'" [...] Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. [...] "I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay", he said. [...] "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." [...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> with the lyrics of the song". The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 1924, Lofting was editorializing about the {{negative}} effects of war on children. In an article written for The Nation, Lofting railed against what he called “tin-soldierism,” a state of mind common at the time that glorified war and “heroic deaths”. He attacked the so-called children’s classics about heroes galloping across battlefields. “That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> battlefield has <b>gone</b> for good,” he wrote, “it is still bloody, but you don’t gallop.

And whenever we tried {{to persuade him to}} feel cheerfuler, he only {{shook his head and said}} if we only knowed what it was to carry around a murderer's load in your heart we wouldn't talk that way. Tom and all of us kept telling him it WASN'T murder, but just accidental killing! but it never made any difference--it was murder, and he wouldn't have it any other way.
