40|$|In {{this study}} we {{introduce}} a rescoring method to improve the accuracy of docking programs against mPGES- 1. The rescoring method developed {{is a result of}} extensive computational study in which different scoring functions and molecular descriptors were combined to develop consensus and rescoring methods. 127 mPGES- 1 inhibitors were collected from literature and were segregated into training and external test sets. Docking of the 27 training <b>set</b> <b>compounds</b> was carried out using default settings in AutoDock Vina, AutoDock, DOCK 6 and GOLD programs. The programs showed low to moderate correlation with the experimental activities. In order to introduce the contributions of desolvation penalty and conformation energy of the inhibitors various molecular descriptors were calculated. Later, rescoring method was developed as empirical sum of normalised values of docking scores, LogP and Nrotb. The results clearly indicated that LogP and Nrotb recuperate the predictions of these docking programs. Further the efficiency of the rescoring method was validated using 100 test <b>set</b> <b>compounds.</b> The accurate prediction of binding affinities for analogues of the same compounds is a major challenge for many of the existing docking programs; in the present study the high correlation obtained for experimental and predicted pIC 50 values for the test <b>set</b> <b>compounds</b> validates the efficiency of the scoring method...|$|R
40|$|Hologram QSAR {{models were}} {{developed}} {{for a series}} of 36 inhibitors (29 training set and seven test <b>set</b> <b>compounds)</b> of acetyl/butyrylcholinesterase (AChE/BChE) enzymes, an attractive molecular target for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) treatment. The HQSAR models (N = 29) exhibited significant cross-validated (AChE, q 2 = 0. 787; BChE, q 2 = 0. 904) and non-cross-validated (AChE, r 2 = 0. 965; BChE, r 2 = 0. 952) correlation coefficients. The models were used to predict the inhibitory potencies of the test <b>set</b> <b>compounds,</b> and agreement between the experimental and predicted values was verified, exhibiting a powerful predictive capability. Contribution maps show that structural fragments containing aromatic moieties and long side chains increase potency. Both the HQSAR models and the contribution maps should be useful for the further design of novel, structurally related cholinesterase inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|Background: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 8 {{is one of}} its {{family members}} catalyzes the removal of acetyl groups from N-terminal lysine {{residues}} of histone proteins thereby restricts transcription factors from being expressed. Inhibition of HDAC 8 has become an emerging and effective anti-cancer therapy for various cancers. Application computational methodologies may result in identifying the key components {{that can be used in}} developing future potent HDAC 8 inhibitors. Results: Facilitating the discovery of novel and potential chemical scaffolds as starting points in the future HDAC 8 inhibitor design, quantitative structure-activity relationship models were generated with 30 training <b>set</b> <b>compounds</b> using genetic function approximation (GFA) and Bayesian algorithms. Six GFA models were selected based on the significant statistical parameters calculated during model development. A Bayesian model using fingerprints was developed with a receiver operating characteristic curve cross-validation value of 0. 902. An external test set of 54 diverse compounds was used in validating the models. Conclusion: Finally two out of six models based on their predictive ability over the test <b>set</b> <b>compounds</b> were selected as final GFA models. The Bayesian model has displayed a high classifying ability with the same test <b>set</b> <b>compounds</b> and the positively and negatively contributing molecular fingerprints were also unveiled by the model. The effectively contributing physicochemical properties and molecular fingerprints from a set of known HDAC 8 inhibitors were identified and can be used in designing future HDAC 8 inhibitors...|$|R
