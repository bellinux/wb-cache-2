However, pavement friction is highly important as {{it is one of}} the factors which determine pavement safety. The number of crashes derived from wet skidding is reduced when a vehicle tire and the pavement surface experience more <b>friction.</b> <b>Skid</b> resistance and texture are vital safety characteristics which need to be considered when pavement mixes are tested in laboratory. The objective of this study was to evaluate skidding based on macrotexture and microtexture used in the International Friction Index (IFI).

The characterization of the macrotexture and microtexture of asphalt pavements surfaces was obtained by the following tests: (i) British pendulum; (ii) Volumetric Method. IFI values were calculated through the pair of the parameters: Sp and F 60. The results showed that the gap-graded mixture had a more texture in comparison to mixtures with a dense grade gradation.

Spruce forests in Maçka, Trabzon, Eastern Blacksea, was selected as the study area. The slope of study area ranged between 45 % and 80 %. In this context, a total of 318 logs were researched. These logs were skidded in 6 harvested areas where skidding is done both in summer and winter.

Therefore, skid resistance measurement procedures are quite important components of a road management system. Currently, many equipments and procedures are used to measure skid resistance in pavement surfaces, like British Pendulum, GripTester, SCRIM, among others. Skid resistance data collected with such devices is afterwards processed and compared against minimum threshold values, predefined for the road management procedures. However, to ensure an acceptable reliability and quality level of such results, continuous monitoring of measurement procedures and also revision and calibration of devices must be performed. In this paper, a general methodology is proposed, to be used as a quality control system for <b>devices</b> and <b>skid</b> resistance measurements. Such methodology has been designed by using checklists, and applying statistical concepts of repeatability and reproducibility. The methodology was therefore applied to evaluate the quality level achieved by <b>skid</b> resistance <b>devices</b> and measurement procedures used in Chile, with good results.

Information from the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) Program database was analyzed for this purpose. One of the experiments developed under the LTPP Program, is Specific Pavement Study number 2 (SPS- 2) on the structural design factors of rigid pavements. SPS- 2 planned to build 12 pavement sections in 16 States. The sets of 12 pavement sections included three types of base course, two slab thicknesses and two widths. Slab length and dowel bars were held constant. Two concrete mixtures were designed by each State with local materials for target 14 day flexural strengths of 3800 and 6200 kPa. Most States included supplemental sections, with typical mixtures used by the State. In most cases the component materials remained constant while the proportions varied for the two concrete mixtures. In several States the geological class of the stone was different for the two mixtures. In each State the construction practices, including finishing, texturing and curing were the same for both levels of concrete strength. The climate and traffic were also {{the same for all}} 12 sections at each SPS- 2 site.

50|$|Early glider designs used skids for landing, but modern types {{generally}} land on wheels. Some of {{the earliest}} gliders used a dolly with wheels for taking off and the dolly was jettisoned as the glider left the ground, leaving just the skid for landing. A glider may be designed so {{the center of gravity}} (CG) is behind the main wheel so the glider sits nose high on the ground. Other designs may have the CG forward of the main wheel so the nose rests on a nose-wheel or skid when stopped. Skids are now mainly used only on training gliders such as the Schweizer SGS 2-33. Skids are around 100mm (3 inches) wide by 900mm (3 feet) long and run from the nose to the main wheel. Skids help with braking after landing by allowing the pilot to put forward pressure on the control stick, thus creating <b>friction</b> between the <b>skid</b> and the ground. The wing tips also have small skids or wheels to protect the wing tips from ground contact.|$|R

By operating the left and right wheel pairs at different speeds, the machine turns by skidding, or dragging its fixed-orientation wheels across the ground. The extremely rigid frame and strong wheel bearings prevent the torsional forces caused by this dragging motion from damaging the machine. As with tracked vehicles, the high ground <b>friction</b> produced by <b>skid</b> steers can rip up soft or fragile road surfaces.

Skid-steer loaders are sometimes equipped with tracks instead of the wheels, and such a vehicle is known as a multi-terrain loader.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of ROSANNE is the harmonisation and standardisation of {{the measurement of}} skid resistance, noise emission and rolling resistance of road pavements. For skid resistance, many European countries have established thresholds for pavement acceptance and routine monitoring. Past work has led to proposals for harmonisation of European <b>skid</b> resistance <b>devices</b> and, in spite of significant resources expended, {{it has not been}} possible to establish an algorithm that brings the measurement results from all the different devices into a common scale, with the required robustness and accuracy over the full range of operation. The lack of accuracy gives rise to a particular concern for the control and acceptance of newly constructed pavements against contractual specifications and warranty terms. The ROSANNE project proposed that a possible way to achieve an acceptable accuracy is to restrict the range and type of devices, including operating principle and condition. The quality assurance procedures with its several aspects will contribute to a stable common scale over time. While the several parts of the QA-system ensure a proper function of the measuring devices as well as a good comparability of different systems of the same type within one country or even across Europe, depending on the chosen QA-system and its components.

Tests included exposures of static and rotating (25, 000 rpm) specimens in oxygen pressurized to 5. 51 MPa, and with focused laser fluences of more than 3. 5 billion W/sq m. Specimen surface temperatures were monitored with a scanning infrared camera. Temperature measurement difficulties were experienced due to a problem with internal reflection inside the test chamber; however, posttest specimen examinations confirmed that surface melt (1371 C) was achieved in several tests. No sustained combustion was initiated in any rotating specimen. One static specimen was ignited. Results indicated that conditions necessary for autoignition of 440 C steel are more dependent on specimen geometry and available heat removal mechanisms. Sustained combustion occurred in the ignited static specimen with an estimated 130 C/sec cooling rate due to conduction. The rotating specimens could not sustain combustion due to a greater conductive/convective cooling rate of about 4000 C/sec and ejection of molten material.

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{wide range}} of routine <b>skid</b> {{resistance}} measurement <b>devices</b> on the market. All of them are measuring the friction force between a rubber wheel and the wetted road surface. Common to all of them is that they are relatively complex and costly because generally a truck carrying a large water tank is needed to wet the surface with a defined water layer. Because of the limited amount of water they can carry they are limited in range. Besides that the measurement is depending on factors like water film thickness, temperature, measurement speed, rubber aging, rubber wear and even road evenness and curviness. All of these factors will affect the skid resistance and are difficult to control. We present a concept of contactless skid resistance measurement which is based on optical texture measurement and consists of two components: measurement of the pavement texture by means of an optical measuring system and calculation of the skid resistance based on the measured texture by means of a rubber friction model. The basic assumptions underlying the theoretical approach and the model itself based on the theory of Persson are presented. The concept is applied to a laboratory device called Wehner/Schulze (W/S) machine to prove the theoretical approach. The results are very promising. A strong indication could be provided that skid resistance could be measured without contact in the future...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{undertaken}} to help predict infield long-term skid resistance performance. The Polished Stone Value (PSV) test is the oldest and the most common test used worldwide to rank the skid resistance performance of road surfaces. Due to certain limitations of the PSV test, other laboratory test methodologies have been developed as potential alternatives. One of the limitations of the PSV test is that it only provides end of test results, whereas it is desirable to observe the skid resistance deterioration trend during the polishing process, in particular for research applications. This paper discusses the application of a mathematical model, originally developed for asphaltic concrete surfaces, to predict the skid resistance deterioration trend under polishing for a range of New Zealand chip seal aggregates. A laboratory <b>skid</b> resistance testing <b>device,</b> known as the Wehner/Schulze device, was used for this study since the model was originally derived based on test results obtained using this type of device. It was found that the model was capable of replicating the skid resistance deterioration trend under laboratory polishing of the chip seal aggregates used in this research. It was also found that the model coefficients were dependent on aggregate geological types, and thus suggested that a set of coefficients obtained for a specific aggregate source may be able to provide information on infield skid resistance performance of that specific aggregate type, if the model is found to be capable of replicating skid resistance deterioration trends in the field as well. As part of future research, the model will be calibrated against infield skid resistance...|$|R

The <b>skid</b> {{resistance measurement}} <b>devices</b> at present commonly used by traffic engineers for pavement condition monitoring and maintenance intervention, such as SCRIM, ROAR, Griptester and the British Pendulum, are only rarely used for forensic purposes in New Zealand although in some other countries these may be applied as a routine procedure during crash-scene investigations.

Uncertainties exist and there is considerable scope for fundamental error. The latter is of significant concern, given the potential adverse consequences of an analyst presenting flawed expert testimony in Court. This paper examines the most common skid resistance measuring methods used for forensic purposes and discusses the interpretation and analysis of the results obtained, the uncertainties involved and the expression of expert opinion in Court.

In most cities, road managers have difficulties in estimating the quality level of their footway network. Maintenance planning and budgeting are mostly based on ad hoc repairs.

After a market survey for different types of measurement equipment, we have combined some ideas to develop an evaluation method for footways. Our approach is based on a network analysis by the manager, with the tool described in this article. Additional information (complaints/defects) is obtained from users, through an application on their smartphones or tablets. The basic idea is that a main inspection is done by the manager at least once a year. An operator travels on a footway with a wheelchair, which is the most “sensitive” type of footway user. This wheelchair is equipped with sensors (of a smartphone) and a <b>skid</b> resistance measuring <b>device.</b> Three parameters (comfort/longitudinal unevenness in the direction of travel, gradient in the direction of travel, and crossfall) can be measured in one run, and a skid resistance measurement is made in each section of the network. In total we will thus have four technical indicators and the feedback from the user. All this information will help the road manager to maintain his footway network. We are open to refine this kind of application in consultation with the wheelchair community, using their feedback on the quality of footways. A similar exercise could be done for cycle tracks.

40|$|Martin, Ronald E. Wet {{pavement}} <b>friction,</b> or <b>skid</b> resistance, {{is one of}} {{the most}} important engineering considerations in highway design from a safety standpoint. For bituminous pavements, skid-resistance performance is primarily a function of the durability, texture, and composition of coarse aggregate used to construct the wearing course, or the uppermost layer of the road surface. Cambrian age carbonate construction aggregates mined in Pennsylvania, although relatively simple mineralogically, exhibit a wide variety of textures that developed in response to complex paleoenvironmental and diagenetic processes. To reveal what factors influence the petrographic properties of such aggregates and relate these attributes to skid resistance, carbonate construction aggregates currently being mined from the Lower Cambrian Kinzers Formation in the West York 7. 5 -minute quadrangle, Pennsylvania have been sampled and subjected to laboratory testing. Thin section analysis has revealed six individual microfacies types at the mining operation in West York: Microfacies Types I and III include massive debris flow deposits consisting either of coarser crystalline dolomite or limestone; Microfacies Type II is believed to represent a proximal turbidite facies consisting of finer crystalline dolomite; Microfacies Types IV and V are laminated to shaly dolomites and limestones corresponding to middle and distal fan turbidite environments; and Microfacies Type VI consists of hemipelagic, meta-pelitic deposits. Four complete depositional sequences and portions of two others have been identified at the West York quarry using clast composition and the presence of sharp lithofacies contacts believed to represent sequence boundaries. High energy debris flows (LST) are interlayered with more distal turbidites (LST and TST) and altered, hemipelagic shales (HST). Aggregate skid resistance has been assessed through cyclic material polishing in the micro-Deval testing apparatus and incremental microtexture evolution monitoring via two methodologies: the application of wavelet analysis to grayscale images of aggregate particles and the use of laser confocal microscopy to measure aggregate sample surface roughness. Laser confocal microscopy, which results in a direct measurement of surface texture, provides a more precise method for monitoring changes in aggregate roughness as a function of polishing time than wavelet analysis. The latter technique is adequate for assessing bulk samples, but apparently is susceptible to misinterpreting aggregate variegation as surface roughness. Stockpile samples consisting of Microfacies Type I resist polishing much more effectively than those comprised mostly of Microfacies Types IV and V, reflecting the importance of coarser crystal sizes in carbonate aggregate skid-resistance performance. Microfacies Types I and III, both initially characterized by pronounced surface roughness associated with coarser, interlocking carbonate crystals, exhibit marked differences in polish resistance. Microfacies Type I ??? a mostly pure dolomite ??? maintains its initial rough microtexture more efficiently than Microfacies Type III ??? a high-calcium limestone. This observation confirms that it is essential to consider mineralogy when estimating the potential for relatively pure carbonate construction aggregates to resist polishing. Finally, Microfacies Types II and IV, which are both comprised of higher percentages of dolomite than calcite and mostly consist of fine to medium crystals, appear to sustain microtexture more effectively than the coarser textured, high-calcium limestones of Microfacies Type III, indicating that the dolomite component enhances skid resistance even more noticeably than the presence of coarser crystalline material, particularly for aggregates that are not exclusively fine textured in character. Findings are used to develop a process map that may serve as a valuable tool for mining companies targeting relatively pure or argillaceous carbonate deposits for use in bituminous wearing courses and state agencies charged with evaluating construction materials prior to approval for use and to confirm ongoing, consistent performance.

To achieve this, the project is following the recommendations of key predecessor projects like TYROSAFE, HERMES, SILVIA, SILENCE and MIRIAM as well as considering the ongoing work in CEN and ISO groups. Work package 1 deals with skid resistance and aims at the harmonization of skid resistance measurement following the TYROSAFE Roadmap, by deriving conversion factors for friction indices based on similar groups of devices, namely longitudinal and sideways <b>skid</b> resistance measurement <b>devices.</b> During the first project year a first round robin test {{was carried out in}} Nantes, ten different devices participated to the test. The results of this test are collected in report D 1. 2 “Analysis of data from the first round of tests and initial development of the common scale”. Work package 2 is dealing with the pavement influence on road traffic noise emission: the main objective of this work package is to combine the existing measurement methods of SPB (ISO 11819 - 1) and CPX (ISO/DIS 11819 - 2) into a stable and reliable harmonised pavement noise emission characterisation method. The project is validating procedure incorporating correction mechanisms for temperature influence and investigating its potential use for noise calculation methods like the one proposed by the CNOSSOS-EU project. Work package 3 is dealing with rolling resistance, where the ROSANNE project is mainly building on the results obtained in the MIRIAM project and is considering standardized trailer measurements of rolling resistance coefficients of road surfaces. After a first report D 3. 1 “State of the art on rolling resistance measurement devices including draft standard outline” the following main report was produced “Parameters influencing rolling resistance and possible correction procedures”. In the frame of work package 4 the project is also exploring the potential for developments in the measurement of surface texture in order to find out parameters that better reflect the physical process of tyre/road interaction and that may improve the understanding of how the texture influences noise emission, skid resistance and rolling resistance.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of ROSANNE is the harmonisation and standardisation of {{the measurement of}} skid resistance, noise emission and rolling resistance of road pavements. Controlling these road surface parameters enables road administrations to make a beneficial contribution to making road transport safer and greener. Currently, the measurement methods and policies vary greatly across Europe, leading to the situation that while their importance is recognized, the exchange of expertise and good practice among EU countries faces considerable barriers. Ultimately this leads to barriers facing companies that wish to trade {{in more than one}} country due to the difficulties in interpreting the technical requirements for the provision of goods and services (which in this case are the supply of road surfacing materials and the provision of road survey services), and the inefficiency of requiring different physical equipment for making measurements. For skid resistance, many European countries have established thresholds for pavement acceptance and routine monitoring that are linked to devices that originated from national development and also to many years of experience of the performance of pavement materials when newly constructed and in-service. Past work has led to proposals for harmonisation of European <b>skid</b> resistance <b>devices</b> and, in spite of significant resources expended, it has not been possible to establish an algorithm that brings the measurement results from all the different devices into a common scale, with the required robustness and accuracy over the full range of operation. The lack of accuracy gives rise to a particular concern for the control and acceptance of newly constructed pavements against contractual specifications and warranty terms. The ROSANNE project proposed that a possible way to achieve an acceptable accuracy is to restrict the range and type of devices, including operating principle and condition. In this way, different measurement classes can be introduced, associated with achieving different levels of accuracy, and where restrictions on the type of devices and the operating conditions are identified so that the accuracy of each class is complied with. Moreover, it was proposed to organize round robin tests between some European friction devices to develop this friction index. Two experimental campaigns were proposed: the first one to build the common scale and the second one to check its stability with other friction devices. This report analyses the data obtained from the second round of tests and compares it to the results from the first trial. The common scale for friction measurements in Europe is also developed further along with an assessment of its stability over time. The first campaign of skid-resistance measurement was executed in May 2014 in Nantes in France with the second trial being held at the same location in April 2015. The round robin tests were carried out on the IFSTTAR test tracks and on trafficked roads around the IFSTTAR facility. As with the first trial the tests were in two parts: one week for devices measuring longitudinal friction coefficient and another week for devices measuring side-force friction coefficient. To limit the differences due to seasonal variations, the tests were carried out on two consecutive weeks. Three groups of devices form the basis for the harmonisation exercise to be executed in the ROSANNE project, with a Common Scale to be established within each of the following groups: 1) Side-force measurement (devices with 20 degree wheel angle, 34 % slip); 2) Longitudinal force measurement with low slip ratios (devices with 15 - 25 % slip, close to peak friction); 3) Longitudinal force measurement with high slip ratios (devices with over 60 % slip). The 2015 test program incorporated all the devices that had taken part in the first trial, but also additional devices from both the side-force and longitudinal measurement groups. The additional devices were identified from an invitation through CEN, but for logistical reasons not all the devices that expressed an interest were able to be accommodated. Selection was therefore based on devices that were covered by a CEN Technical Specification and then on a first come first served basis. The complete test program allows for calibration of the Common Scale over a range of skid resistance levels and a test of its robustness on surface types and measurement conditions that are representative of the roads in Europe. Analysis of the data from the first round of tests had shown that measurements made by different devices can be converted to a common scale based on the SRI approach outlined in CEN TS 13036 - 2 (CEN, 2010). In addition the assumptions made in developing the TYROSAFE roadmap were proven correct in that the precision of the common scale is improved by developing a common scale for different groups of devices based on their operating principle...|$|R
40|$|High {{friction}} {{response in}} pavement improves road safety, while reduced noise production from the tire-pavement interface benefits {{public health and}} the economy of a country. According to Transport Canada, highway crashes cost Canadians approximately $ 67 billion annually. The economic impact of noise is difficult to quantify; however, billions of dollars have been invested in noise barriers as noise mitigation alternatives. Roadway safety is related to many factors including the <b>friction</b> characteristics or <b>skid</b> resistance of pavements. Lack of sufficient friction at the tire-pavement interface is a significant contributing factor to vehicle crashes. Skid resistance of pavement is affected by both: the microtexture of the pavement as related to the fine and coarse aggregate properties in the mortar phase of the concrete mixture; and by the macrotexture, which is defined as the measurable grooves formed in the plastic concrete during the finishing operation, or created in the hardened pavement with cutting heads consisting of uniformly spaced circular diamond saw blades. Traffic noise is also a growing concern for {{public health and the}} country’s economy. Tire-pavement noise predominates over the other sources of roadway noise in many circumstances. Under accelerating conditions, the tire-pavement noise is dominant at speeds greater than 35 to 45 km/h for cars, and 45 to 55 km/h for trucks. Although the tire-pavement noise is generated through a variety of mechanisms at the tire-pavement contact patch, it is recognized that a proper design of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement surface may assist in reducing noise levels and thus has prompted the evaluation of new macrotextures. However, an optimization process must be carried out to achieve adequate friction while reducing noise generation through macrotexture because large macrotexture can increase friction and generate excessive noise due to an inadequate tire-pavement interaction. Next Generation Concrete Surface (NGCS) is the first new concrete pavement texture introduced in the United States in the last 20 to 30 years. NGCS also has the quietest texture developed for conventional concrete pavements, mainly through macrotexture modification. The construction process uses conventional diamond grinding equipment, but the blades have a different configuration in the drum. Currently, after the evaluations of long term pavement performance and noise characteristics of the NGCS, concerns have been reported regarding durability and increased noise level over time. In this research, a laboratory investigation examined how friction, noise absorption, and surface durability can be improved by modifying the concrete microtexture. The innovative approach of this research involved investigating those properties of concrete pavement through microtexture modification using nanotechnology. Nanotechnology involves manipulating materials at scales below 100 nm. Two different products were investigated: nanosilica applied in the cement paste, and a nano lotus leaf solution applied as a coating to mimic the lotus leaf effect. Several concrete mixes were prepared and tested in the laboratory. Results reveal that microtexture modification through the addition of nanosilica can change the properties of fresh concrete, hardened concrete, and concrete durability. In fresh concrete, the main findings indicate that nanosilica reduces the concrete slump and also reduces the air content for a given water cement ratio; however, the slump and air content can be adjusted using High Range Water Reduced and Air Entraining Admixtures. In hardened concrete, results reveal that a small amount of nanosilica can accelerate the hydration process and enhance the compressive strength and the friction response. Results also reveal that nanosilica cannot significantly modify the sound absorption coefficient. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images in hardened concrete provide insight into the impact that the nanosilica has on the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ). Nanosilica can reduce ettringite crystal formation in voids and can also produce a denser and a more compact cement paste. Regarding durability, several abrasion tests using the rotating cutter method indicate that nanosilica can enhance the concrete’s abrasion response, resulting in better wear resistance and durability of PCC road surfaces. Freezing and thawing, and scaling resistance results show that nanoconcrete is able to reduce the external damage on the PCC surface. Regarding the coating mimicking the lotus leaf effect, several concrete mixes were prepared and tested in the laboratory. Visual inspections demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} create the lotus leaf effect on concrete surfaces. Laboratory results reveal that the coating is able to maintain the friction response of concrete surfaces; however, results also reveal that the sound absorption coefficient is not significantly affected by the coating. Further research must be done to determine the coating impact on the hydroplaning effect when a heavy rainfall is present...|$|R
