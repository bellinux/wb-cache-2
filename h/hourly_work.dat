"Where {{there are}} sixty pupils," [...] said I; for I knew the number, {{and with my}} usual base habit of cowardice, I shrank into my sloth like a snail into its shell, and alleged {{incapacity}} and impracticability as a pretext to escape action. If left to myself, I should infallibly have let this chance slip. Inadventurous, unstirred by impulses of practical ambition, I was capable of sitting twenty years teaching infants the hornbook, turning silk dresses and making children's frocks. Not that true contentment dignified this infatuated resignation: my work had neither charm for my taste, nor hold on my interest; {{but it seemed to}} me a great thing to be without heavy anxiety, and relieved from intimate trial: the negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives--the life of thought, and that of reality; and, provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of the strange necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread, <b>hourly</b> <b>work,</b> and a roof of shelter.|$|E

Ford continued on to reduce the <b>hourly</b> <b>work</b> week while continuously lowering the Model T price. These goals appear altruistic; however, {{it has been argued}} that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover: when the assembly line was introduced in 1913, it was discovered that “every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963” in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired.|$|E

In alfalfa harvesting and Sudanese grass harvesting, the specific fuel consume varied from 0. 23 l/t in Sudanese grass to 0. 25 l/t in alfalfa green fodder parcels.

According to the results, college town stayers both earn significantly lower <b>hourly</b> wages and <b>work</b> significantly fewer annual hours with coefficients of − 0.209 and − 0.058, respectively. Notice that these two coefficients add up to the coefficient in the second column by definition. While both are significantly negative, the magnitude is much greater for log hourly wages and suggests that lower hourly wages account for 78 percent of the lower annual wages of stayers. The results for advanced education are again somewhat interesting. Master’s degree holders have significantly higher hourly wages but significantly lower annual hours with coefficients of 0.084 and − 0.106. Professional degree holders earn similar <b>hourly</b> wages but <b>work</b> significantly fewer hours than persons with only a bachelor’s degree with a coefficient of − 0.176. For professional degrees the lower annual hours explains all of the lower annual wages in the second column. Given the age range considered, these results likely suggest that many master’s and professional degree holders were in school {{for part of the}} previous year and devoted less time to work because of school. Doctoral degree holders earned significantly higher hourly wages with a coefficient of 0.199, but the difference in hours worked is not statistically significant, probably {{due in part to the}} small number of doctorates in the sample. Age generally has a significantly positive effect on hourly wages and annual hours, except there is no difference in hourly wages between 23 and 24 [*]year olds. Females earn lower <b>hourly</b> wages and <b>work</b> fewer annual hours with coefficients of − 0.115 and − 0.092, respectively. Blacks earn similar hourly wages to Whites, but work significantly fewer hours with a coefficient of − 0.082. Asians earn higher hourly wages with a coefficient of 0.158 but do not work significantly different hours than Whites. Hispanics and Other Nonwhites earn similar wages to Whites but work significantly fewer hours with coefficients of − 0.064 and − 0.087, respectively. Married persons earn significantly higher <b>hourly</b> wages and <b>work</b> significantly more hours with coefficients of 0.053 and 0.027.

Heat stress reduces a workers work capacity, leading to lower hourly labour productivity and economic output.

During the hottest month in this region (March) afternoon WBGT levels are already high enough to cause major loss of <b>hourly</b> <b>work</b> capacity and by 2050 the situation will be extreme for many outdoor jobs...|$|E
40|$|We {{live in a}} time of {{unprecedented}} changes for American lawyers, probably the greatest changes since the Great Depression. That period saw the creation of the lawyer’s monopoly through a series of regulatory modifications. Will we see the same following the Great Recession? Formally, no. This Article predicts that formal lawyer regulation in 2023 will look remarkably similar to lawyer regulation in 2013. This is because lawyer regulators will not want to rock the boat in the profession or in law schools during a time of roil. Informally, yes! We are already seeing a combination of computerization, outsourcing, and nonlawyer practice radically reshape the market for law from one that centers on individualized, <b>hourly</b> <b>work</b> done for clients to a market of much cheaper, commoditized legal products. This trend will accelerate over time. The upshot? Formal lawyer regulation will continue on with little change, but will cover an ever-shrinking proportion of the market for legal services...|$|E

40|$|The first oral {{contraceptive}} {{was introduced in}} the United States during the 1960 s, and, subsequently, there was an increase in women’s labor force participation rates. Although the economic role of {{oral contraceptive}}s is still highly debated by scholars, previous studies have found that the pill had a statistically significant impact on women’s labor force participation rates. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, I will analyze how hours <b>worked,</b> <b>hourly</b> wages, weekly earnings and occupations for women were affected by oral contraceptives. By controlling for various governing statutes that affected the availability of the use and distribution of oral contraceptives in different states, I am able to provide evidence highlighting the extent of the pill’s significance.

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{provides}} {{the display of}} technology usage for managing and reporting of Cisco Unified Communications Manager. It serves as {{a central part of}} signalling and transcoding process with telephony services in our network. With its use and the use of IP telephony, we can drastically lower the costs and raise the productivity, improve the cost tracking and in the same time offer our customers and employees a wider and richer range of services. Cisco Systems offered its customers several options for server management. One of them is AXL or the so called Administrative XML, which was used to achieve the goal, set in this thesis. It helped me {{to solve the problem of}} data export and documentation creation with larger companies that are using Cisco Unified Communications Manager. The built-in documentation creation is very miserly and inconsistent, and that alone can raise the cost of expenses, if we own a company with few hundred employees. I have created a Perl script for the purpose of automating the export process. The data can be converted to HTML or some other format with the help of transformation files. The goal of this thesis is to change the usual <b>hourly</b> <b>work</b> to more accurate minute-long automated process that does not include the human factor, hence making it more error resistant. ...|$|E

In an additional real-effort laboratory experiment we show that explicit cost and surplus information that enables an exact calculation of an employer’s surplus from the work contract is a crucial prerequisite for a positive wage–effort relation. This demonstrates that an employee’s reciprocity requires a clear assessment of the surplus at stake. (JEL: C 91, C 92, J 41) 1...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} assess the quality of employment, a dummy {{indicating}} whether the respondent’s earnings are {{lower than those of}} his/her peers is used. This relative wage can be an important indicator of job quality. It compares the individual wage to an appropriate peer group which the person might take as a comparison as well. The median gross hourly wage is calculated by age category (16 – 19; 20 – 25; 26 – 30), gender and highest educational qualification. This is calculated in the LFS from 2009 to 2010, weighted appropriately. A dummy variable indicates that the respondent’s gross hourly wage, calculated from the UKHLS, lies below the nationally representative median hourly wage for people of similar age, gender and educational qualifications. The model is estimated through a binary logistic regression on all controls except cohabitating and being a parent. These two demographic variables are not thought to be important in determining the relative state of <b>hourly</b> wage. <b>Working</b> on a fixed-term contract and working part-time are also included as controls as someone’s position in the wage distribution may depend on their type of contract.|$|R
