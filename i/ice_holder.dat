50|$|At {{the hockey}} arena, one team member had score two goals {{while the other}} held a large, heavy block of ice. The hockey-playing team member could attempt to shoot goals when the <b>ice</b> <b>holder</b> held the block of ice off the floor. When two goals were scored, the team {{received}} its next clue.|$|E
40|$|Modifications to the <b>ice</b> <b>holder</b> {{component}} of the crushing friction apparatus, to increase its frequency response, were completed. This involved construction of new load cells and an air bearing for the <b>ice</b> <b>holder.</b> Calibration of the load cells was carried out. The final details {{of the construction of}} a sandblasting apparatus for preparing surfaces with controlled roughnesses for ice friction tests were completed.

40|$|A {{need for}} further {{extensive}} calibration of the load cells of the crushing friction apparatus <b>ice</b> <b>holder</b> was identified and carried out. This was associated with offset normal loads. A new data acquisition system was commissioned for the apparatus and a new program written to analyze the data. The cold room and hydraulic system were recommissioned when all {{the components of the}} apparatus were assembled. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

50|$|This ski {{came from}} the factory as a {{stripped}} down no-frills machine, {{it does not have}} a tachometer, speedometer, GPS, rear view mirrors, cup <b>holder,</b> <b>ice</b> box, luggage compartment or a reverse mechanism that are typical of larger multi-person skis. Yamaha also manufactured a WaveBlaster 2 and a WaveBlaster 3, the latter more commonly known as the WB800 in reference to its 800cc motor.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{functioning}} {{of a new}} impact device is described, where its eventual intended use {{is the study of}} damage associated with pressure distributions arising from ice impacts on ships. The large apparatus is a double-pendulum type device that is capable of achieving fairly high impact energies and velocities while remaining relatively 2 ̆ 018 compact 2 ̆ 019 with respect to the confines of the laboratory space that is available. For example, at a drop angle of 35 o from vertical for each pendulum the impact energy and relative velocity are 31 kJ and 5. 32 m/s respectively. Conical-shaped ice samples, one meter in diameter are held in a cylindrical <b>ice</b> <b>holder</b> that attaches to one arm of the double pendulum. For one type of test a unique instrumented panel (Impact Module), that records load and high spatial resolution pressure distribution during impacts, attaches to the opposite pendulum arm. For another test type the Impact Module is replaced by ship grillage (full-scale or reduced scale) so that ice impact tests can be performed that cause damage to the grillage. The pendulum arms are designed in a manner such that no rotation of the colliding masses occurs during tests. The effective masses of the colliding objects can be adjusted by adding or removing heavy metal plates. Similarly, the drop angles of the pendulum arms can be adjusted to achieve a range of impact velocities. These two adjustable features enable a variety of impact velocities and energies to be obtainable and allow for some degree of parameter-based study where either velocity or energy is fixed while the other is varied. To date a number of tests have been performed involving ice impacts on the Impact Module. Some representative sensor data that includes a few examples of the ice pressure distribution from one test are presented. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
