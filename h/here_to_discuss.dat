500|$|The Hall of Supreme Harmony (G) is the largest, {{and rises}} some [...] above {{the level of}} the {{surrounding}} square. It is the ceremonial centre of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is nine bays wide and five bays deep, the numbers 9 and 5 being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor. Set into the ceiling at the centre of the hall is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the [...] "Xuanyuan Mirror". In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held court <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, as Emperors held court far more frequently, a less ceremonious location was used instead, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as coronations, investitures, and imperial weddings.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2005 ASEAN {{summit in}} Thailand, the Foreign Minister Nyan Win {{complained about the}} US insistence of calling his country [...] "Burma" [...] instead of [...] "Myanmar" [...] as it was renamed {{more than a decade}} ago. In January 2011, during the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the country at the United Nations, the {{delegate}} of Myanmar interrupted the delegate of the United States, who had begun her comments on human rights in Myanmar by [...] "welcom the Burmese delegation to the UPR working group". Myanmar's delegate insisted that the American delegation should use the name [...] "Myanmar", and appealed to the session's president to enforce that rule. The latter commented that [...] "we're <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> human rights in Myanmar, we're not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the name of the country", and asked the American delegation to use Myanmar's official, UN-recognised name. The American delegate continued her comments on human rights violations in Myanmar, without using either name for the country. On 19 November 2012, US President Barack Obama, accompanied by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her second visit to the country, referred to the nation as both Myanmar and Burma.|$|E
2500|$|Fox {{and other}} protesters {{lined up in}} front of Malleable Iron Works, where Fox worked, and others at McCormick Reaper Works where things got violent. [...] Fox {{experienced}} the violence of the McCormick workers where he wandered for a time to see the protestors throwing stones and then the arrival of the police who began shooting people in the crowd; some were injured and even killed. [...] Fox described it as “a reign of terror,” where police “brutally attacked workers’ meetings with clubs and pistols.” [...] People later gathered at Haymarket square, among these people was Fox. [...] The rioters met <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> what had happened at the previous strike and the police brutality that had occurred. [...] During this gathering a pipe bomb was thrown into the audience, which caused chaos and added to the number of dead.|$|E

2500|$|Other players, such as Curt Schilling (due to his strident {{outspokenness}} against PEDs) and José Canseco (due to {{his role}} as a whistleblower), were requested to testify against the epidemic. [...] Congresspeople such as Jim Bunning (a former pitcher), Henry Waxman and Elijah Cummings interrogated the sportsmen. [...] McGwire was apologetic and admissive to a steroid problem within the sport, yet evasive about his own use when confronted, responding with [...] "I'm not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the past", and [...] "I'm here to be positive about this subject." [...] Sosa, Rodríguez, Palmeiro and Clemens answered with either similar levels of ambiguity or denials. [...] Selig and Fehr defended the policy that was in place, stating they felt it was sufficient. [...] The hearing lasted 11 hours having produced neither any definitive answers besides denials nor any proclamations to make concrete steps to clean up the sport. [...] As a result, Selig, Fehr, the players Congress subpoenaed and any other player suspected of using PEDs became objects of public scorn.|$|E
2500|$|In 219, Lü Meng {{came up with}} a plan to help Sun Quan seize {{control of}} Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for {{permission}} to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit Lü Meng and said, [...] "Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border and not worry about having to guard against him?" [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now." [...] Lu Xun then said, [...] "Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and he has never seen us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when he lowers his guard, we can capture him. I came <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> with you a plan to attack him." [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "Guan Yu is known for his bravery and ferocity in battle, and he's a formidable foe. Besides, he's in control of Jing Province. He governs with virtue and has made great accomplishments, while the morale of his army is at its peak. It won't be easy to defeat him." ...|$|E
