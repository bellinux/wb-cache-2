25|$|Will Smith {{conceived}} {{this story}} {{when he was}} watching the television show called I Shouldn't Be Alive with his brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett. It was originally not a science fiction story but about {{a father and son}} crashing their car in the mountains or some remote region, with the son having to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> rescue for his father. Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple log line for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> pregnant. When I first heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} taking over, Butler {{organized}} raids {{on more than}} 900 speakeasies, ordering them padlocked and, in many cases, destroyed. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling, and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the Ritz-Carlton and the Union League, {{as well as on}} drinking establishments that served the working class. Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, [...] "I don't believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman's guns [...] in this city, <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> some." [...] Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, the raids continued for several weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) is {{a charming}} 18-year-old who is partying and {{drinking}} {{his way through}} his {{senior year of high}} school. When his beautiful girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson) decides he's a lost cause and breaks up with him and starts seeing Marcus (Dayo Okeniyi), the School President and an athletic star, Sutter <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> drunk.|$|R
50|$|The song {{is about}} a man who has <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>gotten</b> drunk <b>and</b> been gone {{for a period of time}} (due to being locked up in the drunk tank) and is in fear of his wife because she thinks he was {{spending}} time with another woman. The song drolly describes, in first person, all the things he needs to have or do to protect himself from her wrath.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had spent}} a lot of money when I was young, and the estate, as you call it, was not large enough to bear the loss. So I had to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> work, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> back what I had squandered.' ...|$|R
500|$|The album sold well {{despite being}} {{initially}} {{pulled from the}} shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. [...] The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating, [...] "Our record {{has been in the}} marketplace {{for more than a year}} now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective... We have decided to put a sticker on the record". This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, [...] "It's almost taunting kids to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the record to see what we're saying on it". The album also had four successful singles which were [...] "Whatever", [...] "Keep Away", [...] "Voodoo" [...] and [...] "Bad Religion".|$|E
500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she can <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which he fills out to read that 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a debate}} in 2006 against Democratic {{opponent}} Jon Tester, Burns commented {{that he was on}} the telephone with his contractor when he saw an interview with an illegal immigrant on television. The immigrant featured in the interview said he was a roofer and was headed north. Burns said that he told the contractor, [...] "you better <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> your help or you won't get my house roofed." ...|$|E
50|$|Knightsabre is {{a central}} focus of the limited series 'Judgment Day (Awesome Comics)'. August 30, 1997 is his thirtieth {{birthday}} and depressed at his perceived lack of real friends, he <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> drunk. Depressed <b>and</b> stumbling drunk, he tries to simply spend a little platonic time with his female teammate Riptide. Instead he awakens covered with her blood. She is found dead in the next room. He is ultimately found innocent of her murder.|$|R
5000|$|Before the film's release, Jet {{magazine}} said it [...] "concerns a girl ... {{and a man}} ... who, {{broke and}} stranded, are {{on the run from}} the law...(at one point) the girl <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> money as a prostitute." [...] One author describes Michael Hordern's appearance in the movie as a [...] "sympathetic copper who knows that Trevor Howard is a jewel thief - thanks to Howard's double-crossing partner Edmond Purdom - but lacks the evidence to make an arrest." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He's small," [...] said Tagg. [...] "He's {{not that}} good-looking; he's not a robust horse by any means. He just <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> it done." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, {{as part of}} {{the buildup}} to The Play's 25th anniversary, the Bay Area News Group asked Verle Sorgen, the Pac-10 Conference's {{supervisor}} of instant replay, to review the two disputed laterals according to modern NCAA instant replay review rules. (Sorgen was not asked to rule on the larger issue of the Stanford band's outside interference.) After watching enhanced footage on a modern, large-screen monitor, Sorgen opined that there was insufficient video evidence to overturn the third lateral, from Garner to Rodgers. However, Sorgen believed that the fifth lateral from Ford to Moen [...] "was released at the 22 and touched at the 20-1/2 (sic). From that, it clearly appears forward." [...] Asked for his [...] "ultimate call", Sorgen replied, [...] "I would be tempted to reverse it...then <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the motor running in my car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, and then we would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it done".|$|E
2500|$|Schuldiner {{continued}} {{to work on his}} music, continuing his work with Control Denied. [...] About two years after his original diagnosis, in May 2001, the cancer returned and Schuldiner fell ill again. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the tumor pre-dated insurance being taken out. [...] Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner's medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium has also stated that the band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner {{while he was in the}} hospital in their days as a local band. Schuldiner received chemotherapy with vincristine. [...] Like most drugs used in the treatment of cancer, the side effects were harsh and weakened him greatly. [...] In late October/early November, Schuldiner's condition worsened as he became ill with pneumonia.|$|E
5000|$|Gus (Nick Sandow) is {{just getting}} out of a ninety-day rehab stint. He {{immediately}} <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> drunk with an old man he meets in a restaurant. He calls Nadia again and again, but she won't answer his calls. He meets a woman named Lisette (Bess Rous), who it develops {{has been in the}} same meditation class which he and Nadia attended. He succeeds in unnerving, and then seducing her, but instead of following through on that, he tells her to go home by herself.|$|R
60|$|Everybody {{knew that}} Paddy the Beaver was laying up {{a supply of}} food for the winter, and {{everybody}} thought it was queer food. That is, everybody but Prickly Porky the Porcupine thought so. Prickly Porky likes {{the same kind of}} food, but he never lays up a supply. He just <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> it when he wants it, winter or summer. What kind of food was it? Why, bark, to be sure. Yes, Sir, it was just bark--the bark of certain kinds of trees.|$|R
50|$|The {{night that}} Stella {{gives birth to}} their son, Stanley <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> drunk in celebration, and returns home; there, he finds a {{similarly}} drunk Blanche, lost in fantasies of better times. He makes a crude, drunken pass at her, which she rebuffs. Enraged, Stanley overpowers and rapes her. This final assault on what she had left of her dignity sends Blanche over the edge into a nervous breakdown. Weeks later, Stella has Blanche committed to a mental institution at Stanley's insistence. In the original play, Stella refuses to believe Blanche and stays with Stanley; in the 1951 film adaptation and many stagings of the play, however, she leaves him and takes their child.|$|R
2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll." ...|$|E
