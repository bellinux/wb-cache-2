5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a <b>hackneyed</b> scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
5|$|Undead Nightmare {{received}} generally favorable reviews at its release. It {{was praised}} {{as a model}} for downloadable content and named among the best of the year, with top awards from the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards and Shacknews in this category. Critics praised Rockstar's production and handling of the <b>hackneyed</b> zombie video game motif, and noted its lightheartedness compared to the main game. Some reviewers struggled with the game's character movement controls and found the combat unvaried. The expansion sold two million copies at retail and is recalled as among the best downloadable content packs on record. Through backward compatibility, the Xbox One supports Undead Nightmare.|$|E
25|$|Today {{her music}} is seldom performed. Her {{keyboard}} music, while often technically challenging, {{is said to}} have been somewhat <b>hackneyed</b> and not distinctive. Her work does seem to have matured throughout her career; her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic.|$|E
25|$|In Buchwald's later years, {{his detractors}} {{characterized}} the column as <b>hackneyed,</b> tiresome and not funny. When the Dallas Times Herald canceled it in 1989, the editors {{did not receive}} a single letter of protest. By contrast, when the paper cancelled the comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, so many readers complained that the editors were compelled to bring it back.|$|E
25|$|A {{certain number}} of seats used for {{domestic}} purposes are of great interest. A {{good example of the}} long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the Musée Cluny, Paris. In the Museum at Rouen is a long seat of a movable kind with a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there {{is a good example of}} the typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th-12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth. The shadows, curves and twists only being emphasized by a few well-disposed cuts with a V tool; and of course the whole effect greatly improved by colour. A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, offer patterns that might well be imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the <b>hackneyed</b> Elizabethan forms.|$|E
500|$|R.L. Shaffer of IGN called A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer [...] "fun". Zachary Scheer of Cinema Blend said, [...] "The short is as <b>hackneyed</b> as that title. It's {{about four}} minutes of Coulson being a badass, if the {{definition}} of 'badass' is performing needless slow-motion action stunts and then pausing to consider something normal people would consider – like which donuts to buy." ...|$|E
500|$|Joyce Boyarin Blundell is {{positive}} in her review of And Still I Rise in Library Journal. She recognizes {{many of the}} same themes in Angelou's autobiographies, but calls the poems in this volume uneven. Blundell finds the poems similar to speech patterns and songs the most effective, while she finds others [...] "mired in <b>hackneyed</b> metaphor and forced rhyme". [...] Despite the volume's weaknesses, she considers it successful as a statement of a Black woman's experiences and of her determination to survive and grow.|$|E
500|$|Much {{discussion}} has concerned the film's treatment {{of environmental protection}} and the parallels to, for example, the destruction of rainforests, mountaintop removal for mining and evictions from homes for development. [...] The title of the film and various visual and story elements provoked discussion of the film's use of the iconography of Hinduism, which Cameron confirmed had inspired him. [...] Christians, including the Vatican, worried that the film promotes pantheism over Christian beliefs, while others instead thought that it sympathetically explores biblical concepts. Other critics either praised the film's spiritual elements or found them <b>hackneyed.</b>|$|E
500|$|Feeling that Singer's {{efforts in}} Apocalypse to {{establish}} a larger world, similar to the MCU, {{did not meet the}} standards established by Marvel, VanDerWerff noted that unlike Feige's ability to serve as [...] "pseudo-showrunner", Singer is instead [...] "steeped in film and the way movie stories have always been told", so [...] "when it comes time to have Apocalypse dovetail with story threads from the earlier [...] (which was directed by someone else entirely), both Singer's direction and Simon Kinberg's script rely on <b>hackneyed</b> devices and clumsy storytelling", indicating a lack of [...] "the kind of big-picture thinking this sort of mega franchise requires".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} in the box office, Jailhouse Rock earned mixed reviews from critics. It was looked upon as scandalous once it was {{released}} because it portrayed Vince Everett as an anti-heroic character, presented a convict as a hero, used the word [...] "hell" [...] as a profanity, and included a scene showing Presley in bed with co-star Tyler. The Parent-Teacher Association described the movie as [...] "a <b>hackneyed,</b> blown-up tale with cheap human values." [...] The New York Times criticized Guy Trosper for writing a screenplay where the secondary characters whom Mickey Shaughnessey and Judy Tyler acted out were [...] "forced {{to hang on to}} the hero's flying mane and ego for the entire picture." [...] Cue magazine called the film [...] " [...] unpleasant, mediocre and tasteless drama." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{negatively}} received by several critics, {{with a number}} of them deeming it to be disappointing and lacking in originality; one critic praised the original idea but criticised its [...] "Bollywoodization". The direction was criticised in a number of reviews, though a few critics praised Sinha's pacing of the film and the execution of the action sequences. Some critics pointed to the presence of scenes which were not child-friendly, despite Ra.One being promoted as a children's film. Particular reviews criticised the lack of character development and the film's [...] "incoherently <b>hackneyed</b> morality". A few critics panned the film as a whole, describing it as a [...] "mess"; one review commented, [...] "It's convenient to say that if you have no expectations from the film, you wouldn't be disappointed." ...|$|E
500|$|Gemini {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu {{wrote that the}} [...] "Vikram style" [...] action film {{was more of a}} stylised fare as realism was a casualty in many sequences. She added that while the credibility level of the storyline was low, Saran had tried to strike a balance in making a formulaic film. Pearl of Rediff.com lauded Saran's [...] "racy" [...] screenplay but found the plot [...] "hackneyed" [...] and reminiscent of Saran's Amarkalam. The critic declared, [...] "Gemini is your typical masala potboiler. And it works." [...] In contrast, Sify was critical of the film and wrote, [...] "Neither exciting nor absorbing Gemini is as <b>hackneyed</b> as they get. [...] Saran should be blamed for this inept movie, which has no storyline and has scant regard for logic or sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Holden traces art pop's origins to the mid 1960s, when {{producers}} such as Phil Spector {{and musicians}} such as Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys began incorporating pseudo-symphonic textures to their pop recordings (both Americans), {{as well as}} the Beatles' first recordings with a string quartet. [...] In the words of author Matthew Bannister, Wilson and Spector were both known as [...] "eremitic studio obsessives... habitually absented themselves from their own work", and like Warhol, Spector existed [...] "not as presence, but as a controlling or organising principle behind and beneath the surfaces of media. Both vastly successful commercial artists, and both simultaneously absent and present in their own creations." [...] Writer Erik Davis called Wilson's art pop [...] "unique in music history", while collaborator Van Dyke Parks compared it to the contemporaneous work of Warhol and artist Roy Litchenstein, citing his ability to elevate common or <b>hackneyed</b> material to the level of [...] "high art".|$|E
500|$|Angelou's poems {{have been}} {{compared}} to music and musical forms. The poems in her fourth volume, Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983), have {{been compared to}} the music of French singer Édith Piaf. In her review of Shaker, Janet Blundell finds the best poems in the volume to be the ones that are structured like blues music. Critic Harold Bloom compares [...] "Times-Square-Shoeshine-Composition" [...] in Diiie to Langston Hughes' blues/protest poetry. He suggests {{that the best way to}} analyze the subjects, style, themes, and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou's poems is to use [...] "a blues-based model", since like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. Blundell, in her review of Angelou's third volume And Still I Rise (1978) in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poems which mimic speech patterns and songs the most effective. [...] However, she finds Angelou's other poems [...] "mired in <b>hackneyed</b> metaphor and forced rhyme".|$|E
500|$|The poet Thomas Hood, {{in his own}} journal, {{wrote that}} [...] "If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and {{charitable}} observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease." [...] The reviewer for Tait's Edinburgh Magazine—Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work—spoke well of A Christmas Carol, noting it was [...] "a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good". After Dickens' death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that {{in the days of}} its first publication it was regarded as [...] "a new gospel" [...] and noted that the book was unique in that it actually made people behave better. The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1884, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale's old and <b>hackneyed</b> subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.|$|E
500|$|In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid {{states that}} what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl {{apart from other}} female {{characters}} was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, [...] "she wears his symbol on her chest, {{but she is not}} his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden." [...] Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, [...] "Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male." [...] Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while [...] "Barbara Gordon initially conformed to <b>hackneyed</b> stereotypes as a dowdy librarian... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect {{as a symbol of the}} emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her 'civilian identity' and ran for Congress.)" ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmaking {{style of}} David Lynch {{has been written}} about {{extensively}} using descriptions like [...] "ultraweird", [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "oddball". Todd McGowan writes, [...] "One cannot watch a Lynch film the way one watches a standard Hollywood film noir nor in the way that one watches most radical films." [...] Through Lynch's juxtaposition of cliché and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, nonlinear story lines, camera work, sound and lighting, he presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing. Many of the characters in Mulholland Drive are archetypes that can only be perceived as cliché: the new Hollywood hopeful, the femme fatale, the maverick director and shady powerbrokers that Lynch never seems to explore fully. Lynch places these often <b>hackneyed</b> characters in dire situations, creating dream-like qualities. By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst writes of him, [...] "Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel uses {{characters}} with generic superhero traits. While they are public celebrities for being heroes, the novel deals {{more with the}} personal lives of superheroes, how they cope with their powers and interact with one another. The character Fatale, being asked to join the New Champions superhero group, {{is used as a}} [...] "useful outsider looking in" [...] behind the scenes. They exist in a [...] "cult of overachievement", constantly competing and trying to distinguish themselves from one another, which results in characters as [...] "colorful as playing cards but all from different decks, a jumble of incompatible suits and denominations dealt out for an 'Alice in Wonderland' game." [...] Despite their celebrity status and heroic facade, they exist in a [...] "mundane reality" [...] with a normal routine; as the villain devises new means of committing crimes and conquering the world, the heroes chat among themselves, reliving past adventures, and practice fighting one another. [...] From the perspective of the supervillain Dr. Impossible, superheroes live in [...] "a dumb, <b>hackneyed</b> world".|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, she portrayed an actress with a fatal heart {{condition}} in Walter Lang's Sentimental Journey. A commercially successful production, O'Hara {{described it as}} a [...] "rip-your-heart-out tearjerker that reduced my agents and the toughest brass at Fox to mush when they saw it". Critically it was poorly received, and was later declared by Harvard as the worst film of all time. One critic attacked O'Hara with saying [...] "just another one of those precious Hollywood juvenile products who in workday life would benefit from a good hiding", while Bosley Crowther dismissed the film was a [...] "compound of <b>hackneyed</b> situations, maudlin dialogue and preposterously bad acting". In Gregory Ratoff's musical Do You Love Me, O'Hara portrayed a prim, bespectacled music school dean who transforms herself into a desirable, sophisticated lady in the big city. She commented that it was [...] "one of the worst pictures I ever made". It frustrated her that she could not put her talents to good use, to not even sing in it.|$|E
500|$|From 1904 until 1967, when {{television}} finally {{killed them}} off, newsreels preceded films. In the early sound-film era, they lasted around eight minutes and featured highlights and clips of the world's biggest stories. Updated {{twice a week}} by the five major studios, they became a highly profitable enterprise: in 1933, newsreels had a total box office take of almost $19.5 million against an outlay of under $10 million. The sound-film era created the narrator; among the first was Graham McNamee, who provided voiceover during the clips, often delivering <b>hackneyed</b> jokes while delineating the on-screen action. Sound newsreel interviews and monologues featured famous subjects unaccustomed to the new medium. These clips changed public perception of important historical figures depending on their elocution, {{the sound of their}} previously unheard voices, and their composure in front of the camera. Around 12 [...] "newsreel theaters" [...] were soon created around the United States, the most successful being the Embassy Newsreel Theater on Broadway. The Embassy was a 578-seat facility that presented fourteen 45–50 minute programs a day, running from 10 in the morning until midnight. It was noted for its discerning, intellectual audience, many of whom did not attend motion-picture theaters.|$|E
500|$|Before Titanics release, various {{film critics}} {{predicted}} the film {{would be a}} significant disappointment at the box office, especially due to it being the most expensive film ever made at the time. When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, [...] "it was with massive forebodings" [...] since the [...] "people {{in charge of the}} screenings believed they {{were on the verge of}} losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making". Cameron also thought he was [...] "headed for disaster" [...] at one point during filming. [...] "We labored the last six months on Titanic in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty," [...] he stated. As the film neared release, [...] "particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance". A film critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project" [...] and that the film was [...] "a <b>hackneyed,</b> completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances".|$|E
500|$|Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{thought that}} [...] "Blank Page", along with [...] "Sing for Me", {{depicted}} [...] "flashes {{of the old}} Aguilera" [...] and that her [...] "voice veers volcanic" [...] on the songs as she raise the key as the songs progress. Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised 'Blank Page' and 'Sing for Me', writing that [...] "they are minimal piano ballads on which Aguilera discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self, respectively. The spare music lets her still-powerful voice dominate, and her impassioned delivery conveys how meaningful these songs are to her." [...] Sarah Godfrey of Washington Post commented that the song [...] "is about <b>hackneyed</b> metaphors and big notes — {{just the sort of}} combination that will appeal to fans of Aguilera's signature song 'Beautiful. Idolator critic Mike Wass complimented Aguilera's ability to [...] "tone it down" [...] on the song, but he was surprised at the level of simplicity considering Furler's [...] "alternative leanings". He did, however, describe it as the album's most straightforward ballad and as a song which could have been written in 1972, with its [...] "with its yearning lyrics and sparse production".|$|E
500|$|Modern critics {{address the}} film's impact and influence. Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice remarks, [...] " [...] adroitly {{atmospheric}} film is virtually an ideogram of narrative suspension and impact"; Chris Dashiell states that [...] "verything is so exaggerated, so lacking in subtlety, that we soon stop caring what happens, despite a few mildly scary effects", although {{he admits that}} the film [...] "had a great effect on the horror genre, and even Hitchcock cited it as an influence." [...] Tony Rayns has called the film [...] "the definitive 'haunted house' movie .... Leni wisely plays it mainly for laughs, but his prowling, Murnau-like camera work generates a frisson or two along the way. [...] It is, in fact, hugely entertaining ...." [...] John Calhoun [...] feels that what makes the film both [...] "important and influential" [...] was [...] "Leni's uncanny ability {{to bring out the}} period's slapstick elements in the story's <b>hackneyed</b> conventions: the sliding panels and disappearing acts are so fast paced and expertly timed that the picture looks like a first-rate door-slamming farce .... At the same time, Leni didn't short-circuit the horrific aspects ...." ...|$|E
500|$|Although it {{enjoyed a}} degree of {{commercial}} success, the album received mixed reviews. Melody Maker deemed it [...] "a milestone {{in the history of}} awfulness", and the NMEs Richard Cook wrote: [...] "Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters' writing has been blown to hell... Waters stopped with The Wall, and The Final Cut isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them." [...] Robert Christgau opined: [...] "it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it", and awarded the album a C+ grade. [...] More impressed, Rolling Stones Kurt Loder viewed it as [...] "essentially a Roger Waters solo album... a superlative achievement on several levels". [...] Dan Hedges of Record also approved, writing: [...] "On paper it sounds <b>hackneyed</b> and contrived – {{the sort of thing that}} was worked into the ground by everyone from P. F. Sloan to Paul Kantner. In Pink Floyd's case, it still works, partially through the understatement and ingenuity of the music and the special effects... but mostly through the care Waters has taken in plotting out the imagery of his bleak visions." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995 Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly rated Never Say Never Again as {{the ninth}} best Bond film to that point, after 17 films had been released. Sauter thought the film [...] "is {{successful}} {{only as a}} portrait of an over-the-hill superhero." [...] He did admit, however, that [...] "even past his prime, Connery proves that nobody does it better". James Berardinelli, in his review of [...] Never Say Never Again, thinks the re-writing of the Thunderball story {{has led to a}} film which has [...] "a hokey, jokey feel, [...] is possibly the worst-written Bond script of all". Berardinelli concludes that [...] "it's a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn't offer him something better than this drawn-out, <b>hackneyed</b> story." [...] Critic Danny Peary wrote that [...] "it was great to see Sean Connery return as James Bond after a dozen years". He also thought the supporting cast was good, saying that Klaus Maria Brandauer's Largo was [...] "neurotic, vulnerable... one of the most complex of Bond's foes" [...] and that Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger [...] "make lasting impressions." [...] Peary also wrote that the [...] "film is exotic, well acted, and stylishly directed... It {{would be one of the}} best Bond films if the finale weren't disappointing. When will filmmakers realize that underwater fight scenes don't work because viewers usually can't tell the hero and villain apart and they know doubles are being used?" ...|$|E
500|$|Will Salmon at SFX {{scored the}} episode 3.5 stars out of 5, feeling that [...] "The 'agent gone bad' is a <b>hackneyed</b> trope, but this works, {{largely because of}} Pascale Armand’s strong, {{understated}} performance" [...] and praising the opening sequence as being [...] "wonderfully eerie", comparing it positively to Doctor Who and The Avengers. Graeme Virtue at The Guardian praised the more focused, personal stakes of the episode, noting that [...] "it's easier to cheer for scrappy underdogs than a huge, militarised Big Brother organisation like SHIELD", as well as Grant Ward's storyline, but criticized the episode's use of Bear McCreary's score, calling it [...] "backgrounded". Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode for its much more realistic (compared to previous episodes) familial environment, complete with tension, {{as well as the}} character of Akela Amador and the fact that [...] "Agent Coulson {{was at the center of}} the action, where he belongs". Den of Geeks James Hunt surmised that [...] "Agents of SHIELD is definitely getting better and that's the main thing to take away from this episode. At this rate it should actually be quite good (rather than forgivably average) by Christmas. Let's hope the viewers last that long." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the episode [...] "had an overall cohesion not previously in evidence", but criticized it as unambitious, noting that [...] "stripping the Marvel concept to its visual minimum makes little sense".|$|E
500|$|Based on 73 reviews {{collected}} by Rotten Tomatoes, Halloween II has an overall 19% approval rating from critics, {{with an average}} score of 3.7 out of 10, with the general consensus reading [...] "Zombie shows flashes of vision in the follow-up to his Halloween reboot, but they're smothered by mountains of gore and <b>hackneyed,</b> brutal violence." [...] Rob Nelson, of Variety, felt the use of Deborah and the white horse {{was nothing more than}} [...] "silly", and he disagreed with Zombie's choice to film Halloween II in 16mm film, as opposed to wider format of 35mm that he used on his 2007 remake. Nelson also stated that the hospital scene {{was nothing more than a}} [...] "butcher"-version of Carpenter's 1981 sequel, with the rest of the film feeling like it was rushed and [...] "slapped together" [...] at the last minute. In contrast, Time Out believed the hospital scene at the start of the film [...] " [...] in just about every respect". Time Out stated that Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode showed an [...] "intense, nontrivializing dedication to the role" [...] that kept interest, while the storyline of Dr. Loomis's egocentricity hinders the overall storyline. Time Out also said that Zombie hurt the film by trying to show how [...] "violence lingers with, and perverts, all who are touched by it", but then undercutting himself with [...] "carnivalesque" [...] violence. Although the New York Posts Kyle Smith did not believe the character of Laurie Strode was a balance for Michael Myers or Dr. Loomis, he agreed the ghostly images of Deborah Myers were a [...] "relief from the blood-streaked brutality" [...] of Michael's murders.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'Orison' rises above {{its origins in}} the depressing, <b>hackneyed</b> genre of serial-killer dramas. The episode combines a fast pace with a richly gloomy mood, and even serves to blur the all-too-sharp distinction between standalone X-Files stories and the series' 'mythology arc.'" [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and called the episode [...] "creepy, dark and wonderful". Rosell argued that the episode [...] "adds fuel to the fiery argument that it is , and not Mulder, that the real heart of the series was built on." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] " [...] was a journey filled with horror, mystery, and self-analysis. It {{was also one of}} the most exhilarating journeys the seventh season has produced thus far." [...] Furthermore, Kessenich defended Scully's actions at the end of the episode writing that [...] "what we saw at the end of 'Orison' was a human being pushed beyond the breaking point by a man [...] it doesn't make what she did right, but it certainly wasn't a difficult thing to understand." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B" [...] and felt that the episode, despite its faults, had elements that were particularly interesting. He noted that the titular chaplain was a [...] "potentially fascinating figure" [...] who was never explored to his full extent, and that the ending was effective in that it [...] "helps transform the episode’s climax into something more than a simple regurgitation". Finally, he positively compared the mood and thematic elements of the episode to Carter's other series Millennium.|$|E
500|$|David Denby of The New Yorker {{asserted}} that the austere, but captivating installment presented a [...] "glancing, chilled view" [...] of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal. To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig, Fincher captures the [...] "menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape" [...] by carefully approaching its most gruesome features. Puig noted a surfeit of [...] "stylistic flourishes" [...] and [...] "intriguing" [...] changes in the narrative, compared to the original film. In his three-and-a-half star review, Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so-called [...] "paradoxical position" [...] that was both [...] "immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the [...] "fabulously sinister entertainment" [...] surpassed the original film [...] "in every way". The film took two-and-a-half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers, who concluded: [...] "Fincher's Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, admired the moments of [...] "brilliantly orchestrated" [...] anxiety and confusion, but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the [...] "lumbering proceduralism" [...] that he saw in its literary counterpart, as evident with the [...] "long stretches of drab, <b>hackneyed</b> exposition that flatten the atmosphere". The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth's cinematography, which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film's darkness; [...] "Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility, the movie was [...] "technically superb" [...] and [...] "superbly acted". In contrast, Kyle Smith of New York Post censured the film, calling it [...] "rubbish" [...] and further commenting that it [...] "demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting, badly written, psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story {{so long as you}} allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis." ...|$|E
500|$|A Billboard {{magazine}} review said Phantasmagoria [...] "lives up to {{the advanced}} billing" [...] and [...] "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex". USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and [...] "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot", but also said he had to adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's <b>hackneyed,</b> but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately {{it was all about}} Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said {{that it was a good}} film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of us might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a <b>hackneyed,</b> formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan.
