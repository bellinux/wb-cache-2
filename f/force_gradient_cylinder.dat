40|$|This article uses a fully {{quantitative}} approach {{to describe the}} behavior of the minute tip of the magnetic force microscope (MFM) over longitudinally directed magnetic bits. Three possible magnetic structures are taken into consideration together with a realistic tip model. The magnetic and van der Waals interactions beween the tip and the sample are derived analytically to simulate a <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> in MFM. The contours of the constant <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> are presented and related to the known experimental data. The important role of the van der Waals <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> in constant <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> measurements is shown. The <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> from a magnetic interaction is partly negative and partly positive and is balanced or increased by the (always positive) van der Waals <b>force</b> <b>gradient.</b> <b>Force</b> <b>gradient</b> asymmetry above the transition area is revealed when the MFM tip is tilted. By tilting the tip, the detection of two components of a stray field is accomplished. We found that the widths and heights of observed bumps of a <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> depend on the width of the transition area and the deviation of the magnetization vector from the recording direction. These factors are especially important in determining what tolerance can be put on a read/write head’s performance. A lateral resolution of 90 nm could be achieved with our tip model...|$|R
40|$|During {{the flying}} task, the control feel of an {{airplane}} with a reversible mechanical flight control system enables the pilot to perceive small changes in airspeed with pitch control force changes. Current certification specifications for light airplanes are subjective, requiring only that there be perceptible stick force changes with airpseed (or stick <b>force</b> <b>gradient)</b> and the final judgement is left to the test pilot. No minimum stick <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> for desirable control feel is specified. Previous flight testing of selected airframes {{in the course of}} this program of research, showed that stick <b>force</b> <b>gradients</b> vary between aircraft makes/models and phase of flight. Flying tasks performed by twenty general aviation pilots using a simulated light airplane with configurable stick <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> showed that as the stick <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> is reduced to zero, simulating an airplane with neutral static stability, pilot mental demand increased significantly (p< 0. 05). The results have implications for current airplane operations and future airplane design...|$|R
40|$|The large {{corrugation}} amplitudes in scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) {{images of}} metal surfaces have been commonly {{attributed to the}} action of forces between the tip and the sample. We have investigated the Cu(100) surface using a high-resolution non-contact atomic force microscope/scanning tunnelling microscope (nc-AFM/STM) in UHV. <b>Force</b> <b>gradient</b> and STM topography images were acquired simultaneously using constant tunnelling current feedback. <b>Force</b> <b>gradient</b> images showed atomic resolution whereas STM scans exhibited almost no contrast, corresponding to a flat tip trajectory during scans. The corrugation height in <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> images was found to increase as the set tunnelling current was increased. <b>Force</b> <b>gradient</b> and tunnel current were directly measured {{as a function of}} separation, to determine the operating conditions during imaging. The STM operation regime is found to lie between the minimum of the stiffness curve and the start of repulsive force...|$|R
40|$|Interatomic <b>force</b> <b>gradients</b> {{between a}} W tip and a 7 × 7 reconstructed Si(111) surface were {{measured}} using an off-resonance, ultra-low-amplitude {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) technique. The amplitudes used were less than 1 Å (peak-to-peak), which allowed direct measurement of the interaction <b>force</b> <b>gradients</b> {{as a function of}} separation. The <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> curves are shown to consist of an attractive van der Waals part and short-range attractive and repulsive interactions. The van der Waals background can be subtracted, leaving a short-range interaction with an energy parameter of 1. 9 - 3. 4 eV and an interaction length-scale of 0. 54 - 1. 26 Å, characteristic of a single atomic bond. This correlates well with our observation of single-atom resolved <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> images. In general, the interaction is reversible up to the zero intercept of the <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> (inflection point of the energy). Beyond this point hysteresis tends to be observed and the onset of inelastic deformation can be clearly discerned. An analysis of the atomic scale contact gives reasonable values for the interfacial energy, yield strength, and the energy per atom needed to initiate plastic deformation...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 90 - 96. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The dynamic thermoelastic response of functionally <b>gradient</b> <b>cylinders</b> and plates is studied. Thermomechanical coupling is significant in these materials when they are used in high temperature applications, and hence, the coupling is included in the formulation. The heat conduction and the thermoelastic equations are solved for a functionally <b>gradient</b> axisymmetric <b>cylinder</b> subjected to thermal loading. In addition, a thermoelastic boundary value problem using first-order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT) that accounts for the transverse shear strains and the rotations, coupled with a three dimensional heat conduction equation is formulated for a functionally gradient plate. Both problems are studied by varying the volume fraction of a ceramic and a metal using a power law distribution. Nonlinearities due to temperature and spatial dependence of material properties of the constituents are considered in the numerical studies. Parametric studies with respect to volume fraction of the ceramic and combinations of different constituents of the functionally gradient material are conducted using the finite element method. Issues related to optimization of the composition of functionally <b>gradient</b> <b>cylinder</b> are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A bearing must (1) {{support a}} loading force (for example, {{the weight of}} a rotor) and (2) provide a <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> (a {{restoring}} <b>force)</b> to hold the rotor in position. Permanent magnets can support weight (in a conventional way, without eddy currents), and without creating destabilizing <b>force</b> <b>gradients,</b> but the Earnshaw theorem precludes achieving stability by this means. Eddy currents can provide a stabilizing <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> without applying a force at the operating position (for example, when a shaft is centered). Creating this <b>force</b> [...] <b>gradient</b> does not require eddy currents (which are induced in proportion to shaft offset). In practice, eddy currents, and hence resistive losses, can be reduced to small values in normal operation. Dynamic bearings of this class, using permanent magnets and ordinary, resistive conductors, can support load and apply restoring force while dissipating little power (and in principle, none).|$|R

Quantitative lateral <b>force</b> <b>gradients</b> between a tungsten tip and Si(1 1 1) -(7 × 7) surface can be measured using this microscope. Simultaneous lateral <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> and scanning tunnelling microscope images of single and multi atomic steps are obtained. In our measurement, tunnel current is used as feedback. The lateral stiffness contrast has been observed to be 2. 5 N/m at single atomic step, in contrast to 13 N/m at multi atomic step on Si(1 1 1) surface. We also carried {{out a series of}} lateral stiffness-distance spectroscopy. We observed lateral stiffness-distance curves exhibit sharp increase in the stiffness as the sample is approached towards the surface.

50|$|A {{common form}} of {{electric}} force microscopy involves a noncontact AFM mode of operation. In this mode the cantilever is oscillated at a resonant frequency of the cantilever and the AFM tip is held such that it only senses with long range electrostatic forces without entering the repulsive contact regime. In this non-contact regime, the electric <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> causes {{a shift in the}} resonance frequency of the cantilever. EFM images can be created by measuring the cantilever oscillation, phase and/or frequency shift of the cantilever in response to the electrostatic <b>force</b> <b>gradient.</b>|$|R

Lateral control force-gradient characteristics were evaluated in combination with three different types of stabilization systems: An unstabilized (acceleration) system, a rate-stabilized system, and two attitude-stabilized systems.

50|$|The {{gradient}} can {{be formed}} through either a spontaneous or a <b>forced</b> <b>gradient.</b> Spontaneous gradient polymerization {{is due to}} a difference in reactivity of the monomers. The resulting change in composition throughout the polymerization creates an inconsistent gradient along the polymer. <b>Forced</b> <b>gradient</b> polymerization involves varying the comonomer composition of the feed being throughout the reaction time. Because the rate of addition of the second monomer influences the polymerization and therefore properties of the formed polymer, continuous information about the polymer composition is vital. The online compositional information is often gathered through automatic continuous online monitoring of polymerization reactions, a process which provides in situ information allowing for constant composition adjustment to achieve the desired gradient composition.|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} Casimir <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> between silicon {{surfaces}} with nanoscale, rectangular corrugations {{and a gold}} sphere attached to a micromechanical torsional oscillator. By comparing the <b>force</b> <b>gradients</b> on the corrugated surfaces to that on a smooth, flat surface of the same material, we demonstrate that the Casimir force deviates from the value expected from the pairwise additive approximation and the proximity force approximation. The observed deviation qualitatively agrees with calculations that {{take into account the}} interplay between finite conductivity and geometry effects. However, the agreement is not exact, possibly due to uncertainties in the optical properties of the silicon substrate...|$|R
40|$|We have {{implemented}} {{a variant of}} the <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> integrator proposed by Kennedy et. al. and are using it in our production 2 + 1 flavor DWF simulations with pion masses of 180 MeV in (4. 5 fm) 3 volumes. We find modest speed-ups (∼ 20 %) from using the <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> integrator, compared to our previously used Omelyan integrator. On other ensembles, primarily finite temperature 2 + 1 flavor DWF QCD, we have extensively tuned the Hasenbusch preconditioning masses and achieved speed-ups of 2 - 3 x. Here we have also switched to the <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> integrator, but this change has not had any impact on the speed. We also report on an improved solver for DWF, which uses Möbius fermions, with a smaller fifth dimension than the original DWF fermions, as an intermediate step in the generation of solutions of the Dirac equation. This approach cuts the number of effective Dirac applications by approximately a factor of 2 when the conjugate gradient iteration count is large.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dynamics}} of quartz tuning fork resonators used in atomic force microscopy taking into account mechanical energy dissipation through the attachment of the tuning fork base. We find that the tuning fork resonator quality factor changes even for {{the case of a}} purely elastic sensor-sample interaction. This is due to the effective mechanical imbalance of the tuning fork prongs induced by the sensor-sample <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> which in turn has an impact on the dissipation through the attachment of the resonator base. This effect may yield a measured dissipation signal that can be different to the one exclusively related to the dissipation between the sensor and the sample. We also find that there is a second order term in addition to the linear relationship between the sensor-sample <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> and the resonance frequency shift of the tuning fork that is significant even for <b>force</b> <b>gradients</b> usually present in atomic force microscopy which are in the range of tens of N/m.

30|$|Phase {{difference}} measurement {{experiments are}} not limited by the external environment and are easy to perform in both vacuum and atmosphere [8]. Consequently, a possible research direction is obtaining the specific electrostatic force according to the phase difference information. Some scholars have carried out relevant research, obtaining electrostatic <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> images through the phase difference [9, 10], but the absolute magnitude of the electrostatic force cannot be acquired. A mathematical model of the electrostatic <b>force</b> <b>gradient</b> has been established [9], but it conforms well to the experimental results only for a very small tip-sample distance. The degree of coincidence gets worse with increasing distance, {{and the range of}} application is narrow. The variation laws of the phase difference of vanadium-pentoxide nanowire samples with tip-sample distance and applied voltage have been investigated [11], but the results are not connected with the electrostatic <b>force</b> <b>gradient.</b> Finally, the absolute magnitude of the electrostatic force still was not obtained. Electrostatic force can be calculated based on phase difference measurement, combined with finite element simulation [12], but the sample is a metal wire with discontinuous material, and the voltage is only selectively applied on a local part of the sample, so there are some limitations in the material and structure of the sample and the way of applying voltage. Moreover, the effect of voltage on the electrostatic force has not been studied.|$|R
