25|$|The {{crystalline}} {{lenses of}} fishes' eyes are extremely convex, almost spherical, and their refractive indices {{are the highest}} of all the animals. These properties enable proper focusing of the light rays and in turn proper <b>image</b> <b>formation</b> on the retina. This convex lens gives the name to the fisheye lens in photography.|$|E
25|$|Solid-state {{physics is}} another field that {{is closely related}} to {{computer}} vision. Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible or infra-red light. The sensors are designed using quantum physics. The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics. Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems. Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the <b>image</b> <b>formation</b> process. Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example motion in fluids.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structure}} {{can also}} be investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as phase contrast. When using a field emission source and a specimen of uniform thickness, the images are formed {{due to differences in}} phase of electron waves, which is caused by specimen interaction. <b>Image</b> <b>formation</b> is given by the complex modulus of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex. However this effect can be used to an advantage, as it can be manipulated to provide more information about the sample, such as in complex phase retrieval techniques.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{a positive}} or converging lens in air focuses a collimated beam travelling along the lens axis {{to a spot}} (known as the focal point) at a distance f from the lens. Conversely, a point source of light placed at the focal point is converted into a collimated beam by the lens. These two cases are examples of <b>image</b> <b>formation</b> in lenses. In the former case, an object at an infinite distance (as represented by a collimated beam of waves) is focused to an image at {{the focal point of}} the lens. In the latter, an object at the focal length distance from the lens is imaged at infinity. The plane perpendicular to the lens axis situated at a distance f from the lens is called the focal plane.|$|E
25|$|According to the Ancient Greeks, {{vision was}} thought to a visual spirit emanating from the eyes that allowed an object to be perceived. The 11th century Iraqi {{scientist}} Ibn al-Haytham, also known as Al-hazen in Latin, developed a radically new concept of human vision. Ibn al-Haytham took a straightforward approach towards vision by explaining that the eye was an optical instrument. The description on the anatomy of the eye led him to {{form the basis for}} his theory of <b>image</b> <b>formation,</b> which is explained through the refraction of light rays passing between 2 media of different densities. Ibn al-Haytham developed this new theory on vision from experimental investigations. In the 12th century, his Book of Optics was translated into Latin and continued to be studied both in the Islamic world and in Europe until the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|... the {{advantage}} of phase contrast over conventional absorption contrast even grows with increasing energy. Furthermore, because the phase contrast <b>image</b> <b>formation</b> is not intrinsically linked to the absorption of X-rays in the sample, the absorbed dose can potentially be reduced by using higher X-ray energies.|$|E
30|$|In general, motion-managed PET/CT {{acquisitions}} either {{consist of}} {{a small percentage of}} total detected events in the gating window or a division of total detections across the respiratory states. Either case necessitates increased detection sensitivity to achieve similar signal-to-noise or contrast-to-noise ratios as in motion-free static images. PET acquisitions in 3 D mode (lead septa retracted) have been shown to have higher noise-equivalent count rates for clinical injected activities of 18 [*]F]FDG (5 – 10 [*]mCi) than in 2 D mode (lead septa inserted)[77]. 3 D PET acquisitions are therefore potentially advantageous for respiratory motion-managed <b>image</b> <b>formations.</b>|$|R

A combined model of MRI acquisition and blood flow is presented. The blood flow patterns are modeled using the Lattice Boltzmann Method, and the magnetic resonance experiments follow the Bloch equation. A new algorithm has been developed to compute the local magnetizations transport during the excitation, precession and relaxation steps. First results were compared to theoretical values of phase flow accumulation and amplitude attenuation. Next, the proposed algorithm is applied to simulate MR images in a simple stenosed vessel and in bifurcations. Characteristic flow artefacts are observed...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{blurring}} is {{not caused}} by random processes, such as light scattering, but can be well defined by the optical properties of the <b>image</b> <b>formation</b> in the microscope imaging system. If one considers a small fluorescent light source (essentially a bright spot), light coming from this spot spreads out further from our perspective as the spot becomes more out of focus. Under ideal conditions, this produces an [...] "hourglass" [...] shape of this point source in the third (axial) dimension. This shape is called the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope imaging system.

2500|$|Proponents for the {{authenticity}} of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for <b>image</b> <b>formation</b> on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of Resurrection. Some proponents have argued that the image on the shroud can be explained with scientific evidence that supports the Gospel narrative. John Jackson (a member of STURP) proposed that the image was formed by radiation methods beyond the understanding of current science, in particular via the [...] "collapsing cloth" [...] onto a body that was radiating energy at the moment of resurrection. However, STURP member Alan Adler has stated that Jackson's theory is not generally accepted as scientific, given that it runs counter to the laws of physics. In 1989 physicist Thomas Phillips speculated that the Shroud image was formed by neutron radiation due to a miraculous bodily resurrection.|$|E
