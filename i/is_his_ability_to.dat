5|$|Australian openside David Pocock, who {{was also}} shortlisted for the IRB award, admires the way he reads the game {{as well as his}} ability to read the referee. One of McCaw's {{strengths}} <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> re-invent himself. For example, he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws (e.g., the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations (ELVS) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations) and, over time, other areas of his game.|$|E
5|$|Pendragon's only form of defence in {{the game}} <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> utilise various magical spells, in which the correct spell is {{required}} in order to defeat certain enemies. If the player is hit by an attack of any enemy in the castle, Pendragon will lose energy, or in some cases, time will be deducted from the countdown timer. If the player completely runs out of energy or fails to destroy the Staff of Karnath before midnight, the game will end.|$|E
25|$|His playing {{style is}} that of the {{creative}} playmaker - picking out passes to his full forwards, as well as taking his own scores, usually at vital junctures of a game. The main key to his play that sets him apart from his contemporaries <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> control the pace, and direction of a match, through leading by example. Peter Canavan, whose influence since his retirement has been missed, has expressed he feels McGuigan's leadership is the key to any Tyrone success, and have struggled to take control of matches in his long absence.|$|E

50|$|As a full-back, much of <b>his</b> game <b>was</b> {{centred on}} <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> judge and {{understand}} {{the manner in which}} his full-forward opponent went for the ball; and much of his value <b>to</b> Essendon <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> consistently punch the ball {{out of the hands of}} a full-forward attempting to mark over his head.|$|R
5000|$|George Orwell in 1945 {{described}} him as a [...] "natural novelist", whose strength, particularly in A Candidate for Truth, <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> take seriously the problems of ordinary people.|$|R
25|$|Jeremiah is {{an aging}} {{member of the}} TNT. He is an Italian immigrant, and a running gag of the series {{is that he is}} an extreme hypochondriac who suffers from many {{diseases}} or medical syndromes (and sometimes, he even suffers from diseases he invented). He is bald and nearly toothless, and he usually sleeps around in the flower shop with The Boss. He is usually on guard duty and never on active missions due to his age, but sometimes proves crucial to missions. Another running gag <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> sleep through most extreme situations without waking up. He is a former street vendor and a hermit, which caused his bad health.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the reasons}} cited for Henry's {{impressive}} play up front <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> calmly score from one-on-ones. According to his father Antoine, Henry picked up his precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten. He was also influenced by Romário, Ronaldo and African star George Weah, {{a new breed of}} strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal. At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry's ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score. In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: [...] "I have to say I haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best." ...|$|E
500|$|About Ocean's writing, Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent {{stated that}} the [...] "strength of his songwriting <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make the {{unfamiliar}} feel intensely personal, as if you're a friend that has long known all the particulars of his relationships." [...] He continued, [...] "Thinking About You" [...] is also more primal, though. The yearning in his falsetto is almost palpable as he flips gender roles and admits that he's been [...] "thinking about forever," [...] while simultaneously questioning if the [...] "girl" [...] even had that kinda thing on her mind." [...] Erika Ramirez of Billboard wrote that the track [...] "gives prominence to his songwriting prowess and sonic versatility, as he intertwines the parallel styles of soul, R, jazz and even a bit of funk." [...] The song {{has been described as}} incredibly personal in nature, the [...] "sort of thing that's best sung by the person who wrote it." [...] The track telepathically serenades the person who took Ocean's virginity, and in the [...] "motel room of memories Frank talks eternal love, breaking into a sublime Maxwell-esque falsetto that makes a good case for restoring the style to contemporary mainstream R" ...|$|E
50|$|Addo {{was strong}} in {{one-on-one}} situations, physical, creative, and versatile {{enough to play}} on both wings, {{on the inside and}} also in the central position, although <b>his</b> main skill <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> dribble the ball.|$|R
50|$|Toweel was an instinctive boxer who, at his best, flaunted {{incredible}} stamina, {{perfect balance}} and a blazing work ethic. His greatest asset {{as a fighter}} <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> throw non-stop batteries of punches without tiring.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> land {{the ball on}} a {{strategically}} optimum line and length, the main weapons of the bowler <b>are</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> move the ball sideways as it approaches the batsman and <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> deliver the ball at a high velocity.|$|R
500|$|Typically, when {{creating}} a manga chapter, an artist draws a rough draft or [...] "name", then {{a more detailed}} storyboard, and lastly the finalized version. However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work. He did not plan {{the details of his}} stories in advance. When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters. The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half. Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him. Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks' time travel. The only thing he has confidence in <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making it seem to have been foreshadowing. The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, which is exactly what he did.|$|E
500|$|The Author's Farce {{is not a}} {{standard}} comedy; rather, it is a farce, and as such employs petty forms of humour like slapstick. Instead of relying on rhetorical wit, Fielding incorporates dramatic incongruities. For example, actors play puppets in a life-size version of a puppet play. Fielding's purpose in relying on the farce tradition was specifically to criticise society as a whole. Like others, Fielding believed {{that there was a}} decline in popular theatre related to the expansion of its audience, therefore he satirises it, its audiences, and its writers throughout The Author's Farce. Speaking of popular entertainment in London, Fielding's character Luckless claims, [...] "If you must write, write nonsense, write operas, write entertainments, write Hurlothrumbos, set up an Oratory and preach nonsense, and you may meet with encouragement enough." [...] Luckless's only ambition is to become successful. Many of the characters in the play believe that the substance of a play matters little as long as it can earn a profit. Harriot believes that the only important characteristic of a lover is his merit, which, to her, <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> become financially successful. Fielding later continues this line of attacks on audiences, morality, and genres when he criticises Samuel Richardson's epistolary novel Pamela, in which a nobleman makes advances upon a servant-maid with the intent of making her his mistress.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinctive}} deliberate mispronunciation of [...] "come on", used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelled [...] "c'mon", [...] "cha'mone", or [...] "shamone", is also {{a staple}} in impressions and caricatures of him. The turn of the 1990s saw {{the release of the}} introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, [...] "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" [...] and he had a [...] "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to [...] "smooth" [...] vocals. Of Invincible, Rolling Stone was of the opinion that, at age 43, Jackson still performed [...] "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies". Nelson George wrote: [...] "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness—that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist". Cultural critic Joseph Vogel notes that Jackson had a [...] "distinctive styles <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> convey emotion without the use of language: there are his trademark gulps, grunts, gasps, cries, exclamations; he also frequently scats or twists and contorts words until they are barely discernible." [...] Neil McCormick notes that Jackson's unorthodox singing style [...] "was original and utterly distinctive, from his almost ethereal falsetto to his soft, sweet mid-tones; his fluid, seamless control of often very fast moving series of notes; his percussive yet still melodic outbursts, ululations and interjections (from those spooky [...] "tee-hee-hees" [...] to grunts and wails). Unusually for someone coming from a black American soul tradition, he did not often sing straight, unadorned ballads, though when he did (from 'Ben' to 'She's Out of My Life') the effect was of a powerful simplicity and truth." ...|$|E
50|$|A running {{joke about}} the Professor <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> build {{anything}} from coconuts and bamboo, yet he was somehow unable to create a raft or other means to leave the island. This was parodied in the sitcom Roseanne.|$|R
50|$|James Monte Maloney, {{known as}} Jimmy Joy (20 April 1902 - 7 March 1962), was an American saxophonist, clarinetist, singer, and big band leader. His claim <b>to</b> fame <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> play two {{clarinets}} {{at the same}} time.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a medium}} pace bowler, <b>his</b> {{strength}} <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> worry batsmen {{with a combination}} of accuracy and unpredictability. Off a relatively short run, he combined good line and length with difficult to read [...] "change-up" [...] balls, swing and seam.|$|R
2500|$|Contemporary Waterford hurler John Mullane wrote: [...] "I can't speak highly {{enough of}} Shefflin either. Henry is simply irreplaceable and {{the measure of}} the man <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bounce back from serious {{injuries}} in recent years to get himself fully fit for the championship." ...|$|E
2500|$|The mu {{is known}} as [...] "magician, {{medicine}} man, mystic and poet" [...] (Eliade, 1974). What set him apart from other healers and priests <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> move at will into trance states. During a trance, the shaman's soul leaves his body and travelled to other realms, where helping spirits guide him in his work. The mu provides healing on many levels: physical, psychological and spiritual.|$|E
2500|$|Writing a {{few days}} after the race, Marcus Armytage said: [...] "Forget ratings, handicappers' {{assessments}} or any other method by which you measure one racehorse against another, it is unlikely that the world in either this or any previous generation has ever seen a better racehorse than Frankel... What makes him unique <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> go a top class sprinter's pace over distance... he is a lightning strike of genetics which may not be repeated for 100 years.".|$|E
2500|$|In extreme cases, Kramer {{was accused}} of being [...] "anti-American" [...] due to the themes of his films, many {{concerning}} social problems or pathologies.

50|$|During his lifetime, Widhopff earned acclaim for his diverse {{methods of}} expression. <b>His</b> {{uniqueness}} <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> work equally well with both pencil {{as well as}} the brush. <b>His</b> drawings <b>are</b> known for their lively expressions, colorful imagery and rich humor.|$|R

2500|$|Like Wolfe, Archie is a {{licensed}} private detective and handles all investigation {{that takes place}} outside the brownstone. He also takes care of routine tasks such as sorting the mail, taking dictation and answering the phone. At {{the time of the}} first novel, Fer-de-Lance, Archie had been working for Wolfe for seven years and had by then been trained by Wolfe in his preferred methods of investigation. [...] Like Wolfe, he has developed an extraordinary memory and can recite verbatim conversations that go on for hours. But perhaps his most useful attribute <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bring reluctant people to Wolfe for interrogation.|$|E
2500|$|The Symposium is {{considered}} a dialogue – a form used by Plato in more than thirty works – {{but in fact it}} is predominantly a series of essay-like speeches from differing points of view. So dialogue plays a smaller role in the Symposium than it does in Plato’s other dialogues. [...] With dialogue, Socrates is renowned for his dialectic, which <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> ask questions that encourage others to think deeply about what they care about, and articulate their ideas. In the Symposium the dialectic exists among the speeches: in seeing how the ideas conflict from speech-to-speech, and in the effort to resolve the contradictions and see the philosophy that underlies them all.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, a few reviewers {{praised the}} scope of Tolkien's creation. The New York Times Book Review {{acknowledged}} that [...] "what is finally most moving is … the eccentric heroism of Tolkien's attempt". TIME described The Silmarillion as [...] "majestic, a work held so long and so powerfully in the writer's imagination that it overwhelms the reader". The Horn Book Magazine even lauded the [...] "remarkable set of legends conceived with imaginative might and told in beautiful language". John Calvin Batchelor, reviewing the book for The Village Voice, lauded the book as a [...] "difficult but incontestable masterwork of fantasy" [...] and praised the character of Melkor, describing him as [...] "a stunning bad guy" [...] whose [...] "chief weapon against goodness <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> corrupt men by offering them trappings for their vanity".|$|E
50|$|One of {{the keys}} to Nordström's success as a {{scientist}} <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn to apply differential geometry to physics, a new approach that also would eventually lead Albert Einstein to the theory of general relativity. Few other scientists of the time in the World were able to make effective use of this new analytical tool, with the notable exception of Ernst Lindelöf.|$|R
5|$|Although much of {{his life}} remains obscure, Nerva was {{considered}} a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians.

25|$|Two {{significant}} {{features of}} Simpson's oeuvre <b>are</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> write long works entirely {{based on a}} single basic pulse, with faster or slower tempi being suggested by smaller or larger note-values, {{and the establishment of}} a dynamic tension between competing tonalities or intervals.|$|R
2500|$|Like most {{so-called}} [...] "Class 5 Mutants", En Sabah Nur is near-godlike in {{his abilities}} and their applications. Among his more aggressive powers is the apparent {{ability to create}} matter (including enormous buildings and structures but also clothing, weapons, armour, etc) from dust within seconds and also to turn matter in to dust, also within seconds. Another of his major powers <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> augment the powers of other mutants, a power he uses very selectively and chiefly {{as a means to}} recruit co-conspirators for his plans for world domination. The mutants whose powers he augments are sometimes taken with him as apprentices and eventual acolytes, and are treated as his children; however, even in such a role, a given mutant might suddenly be deemed unfit by Apocalypse and ejected from his confidence, at any time.|$|E
2500|$|David Wilson, {{editor and}} co-creator of the website Wilson & Alroys' Record Reviews, stated that [...] "By 2009, reggaeton had largely run its course, and Vico C wisely retrenched toward the minimalist Latin-ized hip hop of the Xplosión era (title track, with melodramatic but {{effective}} synth strings). There's nothing shockingly innovative like his first successes, {{but by now}} he's experienced enough {{to work with a}} limited palette while still giving each track an individual affect ('Prueba De Farmacia', which somehow manages not to be sappy; the salsified 'Aqui La Que Fallo Fue Usted'). Another of Vico C's strengths <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> vary vocal tone and timbre to suit a song: playfully prickly on 'Payasito'; tender on 'Moriré'; commanding on the upbraiding 'Polvora'. He still has an unfortunate tendency to moralize ('El Corazón Se Pone Bruto'; 'Angelina'), but his skills are equally undimmed by time, and though no one tune is a socks-rocker, it all adds up to a satisfying whole." [...] Wilson gave the album 3 stars out of 5.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Bonciu's writing {{style and}} {{mastery of the}} Romanian {{language}} have received both attention and praise. Lovinescu found these to be his validation as an artist. In Poetul absolut, he alternated critique with professional respect, concluding that Bonciu's talent deserved [...] "a better fate." [...] He was to elaborate on the topic in 1937, when he wrote: [...] "The essential merit of [...] novels is a stylistic violence that is still restrained by the remarkable dignity of language and accuracy in the artistic finish. As for the substance, so to say: a sexual release, an obsession [...] haunts therein; the writer's art will not hide his desolation." [...] For Călinescu, one of Bonciu's interests as a storyteller <b>is</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> merge a fantasy narrative and [...] "piercing" [...] realistic episodes; others are his [...] "fine bitterness" [...] and [...] "personal note of humor", even when alternating with [...] "sad clownings". Similar comments were made decades later by Nicolae Manolescu, who rediscovered Bonciu as [...] "a very talented writer", and by Buciu, who writes that Bonciu's [...] "imposing rhetorical competence" [...] outweighed his [...] "amateurism".|$|E
