30|$|The {{level of}} a {{disaster}} depends {{not only on the}} intensity of the natural event, but also on the vulnerability of the <b>exposed</b> <b>elements.</b> In the case of small-scale disasters, vulnerability is particularly important when the intensity of the hazard events is moderate or even low. In contrast, in the case of big disasters, vulnerability is quickly saturated due to the intensity of the hazards, and therefore, its relative importance is smaller (Cardona 2004 a; Marulanda et al. 2010; Velásquez et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|European {{dishwasher}}s {{almost universally}} use {{two or three}} spray arms which are fed from the bottom and {{back wall of the}} dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for <b>exposed</b> <b>elements</b> in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use more basic and old fashioned water distribution and <b>exposed</b> <b>elements</b> in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines use a large cone or similar structure in the bottom dish rack to prevent placement of dishes {{in the center of the}} rack. The dishwasher directs water from the bottom of the dishwasher up through this structure to the upper wash arm to spray water on the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from Whirlpool and Kitchenaid, use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher, which allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model Frigidaire dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).|$|R
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the MIAVITA project is to develop a conceptual frame for the risk assessment of inhabited areas exposed to various volcanic hazards. The present communication aims at presenting a scenario-building tool that would take into account the succession of volcanic, seismic, gravity and hydro-geological events and, consequently, analyse the impact of such events on people, physical elements (e. g. buildings, agriculture) and various functional systems composing the exposed community. As several scenario software tools are available in the field of seismic risk, such an approach proves less straightforward in the case of volcanic risk: the main difficulty resides in the crossover of several types of geological phenomena and <b>exposed</b> <b>elements,</b> each combination of them usually relying on specific damage mechanisms. Therefore, before building a risk assessment tool, the first step comprises the careful definition of all damaging phenomena, damage mechanisms and <b>exposed</b> <b>elements</b> that may be potentially involved in a volcanic eruption. For the analysis of complex systems of components, the object-oriented paradigm is a convenient approach and enables to clearly represent the hazard phenomena and the vulnerable elements as a set of well-structured classes that are assigned specific attributes (i. e. properties) and methods (i. e. functions) : such an approach has been previously used in the frame of a seismic risk analysis (Cavalieri et al., 2012) and has been adapted to the case of volcanic, by adding new hazard classes and damage mechanism corresponding to the specificities of volcanic risk. The definition of classes of objects is then used to draw UML (Unified Modified Language) diagrams that represent the successive steps of a risk scenario computation, from the definition of the hazard phenomena to the estimation of physical and functional damage of the <b>exposed</b> <b>elements.</b> A software tool developed by Cavalieri et al. (2012) in the frame of the SYNER-G FP 7 project has been used as the "core engine" for the MIAVITA scenario-builder tool: the changes that were implemented enable to compute the impact of several volcanic events {{on a wide range of}} <b>exposed</b> <b>elements</b> (e. g. buildings, lifelines, road network, cultivated areas, emergency centres [...] .). A non-negligible feature relies also in the ability to build a scenario composed from different successive volcanic events (e. g. tephra fall, pyroclastic density current, debris flow, lahar [...] .), thus adding a temporal dimension in the computation. A few probable scenarios have been elicited for the Mount Cameroun area and they were implemented in the risk assessment tool in order to get a robust and quantitative estimation of the impacts of different volcanic events. Using sets of fragility curves previously compiled by Jenkins & Spence (2009), the software tool yields probabilistic results for some indicators such as the number of casualties or collapsed buildings, the area of damaged cultivated fields or the connectivity loss in the road network...|$|R

For instance, when a uranium atom is bombarded with slow neutrons, fission takes place. This releases, on average, 3 neutrons and a large amount of energy. The released neutrons then cause fission of other uranium atoms, until all of the available uranium is exhausted. This is called a chain reaction.|$|R

In the case that the basic information required by this methodology does not exist or is not available, the holistic evaluation of the disaster risk can be performed by using expert opinions and applying an alternative methodology based on the fuzzy sets theory (Carreño et al. 2012, 2014 a).|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs {{part of the}} French climate plan, an inter-ministerial {{working group}} called “climate change impact, {{adaptation}} and associated costs in France” {{was put in place}} in order to initiate an evaluation of potential damages of climate change as well as the possible measures to mitigate their costs. Seven thematic committees were put in place, including the “natural risks, insurance and adaptation to climate change” committee, within which a working group was in charge of coastal risks, focusing on erosion and coastal submersion impacts. This paper presents and discusses the methodology, recommendations and results provided by this working group. This working group adapted a risk estimation methodology - where risk is considered as a combination of hazards and vulnerability of <b>exposed</b> <b>elements</b> - at a regional (i. e. sub-national) scale, focusing on the Languedoc Roussillon region in 2100 : sea level rise and hazard evolution scenarios were chosen and crossed with specific <b>exposed</b> <b>elements</b> for which damages costs can be estimated. The result served as proxy for a rough estimate of direct and indirect costs potentially induced by erosion and coastal submersion hazards in France during the XXIth century. Finally, climate change compliant recommendations in terms of short term risks management and spatial planning were produced. This paper will discuss the results obtained within this initiative from a risk assessment perspective. It will address the uncertainties for each step of the assessment, with a specific focus on data and information needs, but also identify processes that were not taken into account such as the ageing of buildings in coastal areas. Finally, the robustness of the proposed short term adaptation solutions will be discusse...|$|R
