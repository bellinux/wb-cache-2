25|$|The term {{mechatronics}} {{is typically}} {{used to refer}} to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers</b> to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication.|$|E
50|$|An inkjet {{printable}} DVD is a DVD {{made with}} an inkjet ink permeable coating on the upper, non-recording {{surface of the}} DVD which allow consumers to perform printings onto them directly by using a special CD/DVD <b>inkjet</b> <b>printer.</b> <b>Inkjet</b> printable DVD media offer a way to customize DVD-Rs. When inserted into a suitable <b>inkjet</b> <b>printer,</b> it will be capable of reproducing appropriate <b>inkjet</b> <b>printer</b> page output, including text and pictures.|$|R

50|$|Inkjet {{printing}} {{originated in}} the late 1950s, but was not marketed and sold until the 1980s. The four OEMs that account for the lionâ€™s share of <b>inkjet</b> <b>printer</b> sales are Canon, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Epson, and Lexmark. HP led the way, releasing the first HP Deskjet <b>inkjet</b> <b>printer,</b> priced at $1000 in 1988.|$|R
25|$|Stepper motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers),</b> and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|E
25|$|The script {{called for}} an entirely new {{location}} on the Enterprise, stellar cartography. According to Zimmerman, the script characterized the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a circular set with three stories {{to give the impression}} the actors are inside a star map. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design, dominated by video screens. Before the rise of large-format <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers</b> and computer graphics software in the few years before the film was made, the backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create. The set's size made it one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Garamond uses much less ink than Times New Roman {{at a similar}} point size, so {{changing}} to Garamond could be a cost-saver for large organizations that print large numbers of documents, especially if using <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers.</b> Garamond, along with Times New Roman and Century Gothic, has been identified by the GSA as a [...] "toner-efficient" [...] font.|$|E

500|$|Stanton wanted WALL-E to be {{a box and}} EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's {{eyes were}} {{inspired}} {{by a pair of}} binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He [...] "missed the entire inning" [...] because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers</b> his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others pointed it out to him.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{application}} of CE [...] in forensic is ink analysis where the discrimination of inkjet printing inks {{is becoming more}} necessary due to increasingly frequent counterfeiting of documents printed by <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers.</b> The chemical composition of inks provides very important information in cases of fraudulent documents and counterfeit banknotes. Micellar electrophoretic capillary chromatography [...] (MECC) has been developed and applied {{to the analysis of}} inks which extracted from paper, Due to its high resolving power relative to inks containing several chemically very similar substances, differences between inks from the same manufacturer can also be distinguished. This makes it suitable for evaluating the origin of documents based on the chemical composition of inks. It is worth noting that because of the possible compatibility of the same cartridge with different printer models, the differentiation of inks {{on the basis of their}} MECC electrophoretic profiles is a more reliable method for the determination of the ink cartridge of origin (its producer and cartridge number) rather than the printer model of origin.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to earlier}} consumer-oriented color printers, <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers</b> {{have a number}} of advantages. They are quieter in {{operation}} than impact dot matrix or daisywheel printers. They can print finer, smoother details through higher resolution.

5000|$|An inkjet {{spittoon}} is {{a component}} in electronic <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers.</b> <b>Inkjet</b> <b>printers</b> commonly experience {{a problem of}} drying out which blocks the flow of ink. To restore flow, {{it is necessary to}} clean the inkjet head by spraying (or [...] "spitting") excess ink through all the jets to reapply moisture and unblock the adjacent clogged jets. The excess ink used for cleaning needs to be collected somewhere to avoid creating a mess below the printer, so <b>inkjet</b> <b>printers</b> have a [...] "spittoon" [...] hidden inside to collect this ink.|$|E
