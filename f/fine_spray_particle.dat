40|$|Holographic {{data are}} {{acquired}} during hydrodynamic experiments at the Pegasus Pulsed Power Facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. These experiments produce a <b>fine</b> <b>spray</b> of fast-moving <b>particles.</b> Snapshots of the spray are captured using in-line Fraunhofer holographic techniques. Roughly one cubic centimeter is {{recorded by the}} hologram. Minimum detectable particle size in the data extends down to 2 microns. In a holography reconstruction system, a laser illuminates the hologram as it rests in a three axis actuator, recreating the snapshot of the experiment. A computer guides the actuators through an orderly sequence programmed by the user. At selected intervals, slices of this volume are captured and digitized with a CCD camera. Intermittent on-line processing of the image data and computer control of the camera functions optimizes statistics of the acquired image data for off-line processing. Tens of thousands of individual data frames (30 to 40 gigabytes of data) are required to recreate a digital representation of the snapshot. Throughput of the reduction system is 550 megabytes per hour (MB/hr). Objects and associated features from the data are subsequently extracted during off-line processing. Discrimination and correlation tests reject noise, eliminate multiple particles, and build an error model to estimate performance. Objects surviving these tests are classified as particles. The particle distributions are derived from the data base formed by these particles, their locations and features. Throughput of the off-line processing exceeds 500 MB/hr.

So, In Diesel engines, the combustion efficiency plays a major role for its performance. If the combustion efficiency is less, it leads to improper mixing of air and fuel that is lack of turbulence. Turbulence of a diesel engine depends on the design of the combustion chamber. At the end of the combustion stroke, the fuel is injected on to the piston crown and dispersed. By providing proper turbulent grooves on the piston, turbulence is created and thereby proper mixing of air and fuel. The objective of the research was to find the proper turbulent grooved piston crown to be used for better turbulence. Several turbulent grooves on the piston crown were made to increase further atomization and break down of fuel droplets into fine small molecules. Piston crown with three groves found to be the best in the performance of combustion and pollution aspects. With the provision of Turbulent grooves along with reservoir of heat, the combustion as well as thermal efficiencies would be improved.

A transition temperature, Tt, and a transition pressure, Pt, for those critical conditions were defined and introduced, respectively. Equivalence in the dependence both of transition temperature and transition pressure on the sprayed materials order indicated that the wetting of the substrate by the molten particle is a common domination in the flattening.

40|$|A novel mobile <b>fine</b> <b>spray</b> unit, utilising a Spill-Return Atomiser® (SRA) {{has been}} {{designed}} and developed {{for the purpose of}} decontamination within healthcare environments. The unit is able to spray uniformly onto any given surface, providing 'mist like' coverage. The high liquid pressure <b>fine</b> <b>spray</b> swirl atomiser that has been developed incorporates a spill-return orifice into the rear face of the swirl chamber with the aim of giving a significant reduction in flow rate whilst maintaining droplet size. Initial work modified a commercial atomiser to add spill-return. However drop sizes were considered to be too large and a new design was constructed based upon earlier work on efficient high pressure (up to 12 MPa) swirl atomisation. The atomiser was characterised for different geometries, supply pressures and spill return orifice sizes using a Laser Particle Sizer (Malvern Mastersizer-X) and Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). Spill-Return Swirl Atomiser (SRA) with a long swirl chamber was also designed and experimentally tested. This was found to have a direct reflection on the control of spray characteristics and the determination of the coating performance of the SRA on various surfaces in achieving the desired efficiency in the disinfection procedure. The subsequent coating and coverage produced by the SRA was analysed both quantatively and qualitatively via a range of test procedures. The investigation has found that the utilisation of <b>fine</b> <b>sprays</b> (15 um<D 32 < 25 um) at high liquid pressure (< 12 MPa) and low flow rates (< 0. 3 1 /min) is indeed suitable for surface disinfection in healthcare applications (i. e.
