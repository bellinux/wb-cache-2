[...] Jeremy D. Larson concurred with this idea, claiming that Stetson's music is [...] "alien but human, technically astounding but filled with passion– the saxophone acts as a medium of expression tied to his whole body", but admitted that [...] "to most ears, Stetson’s music is hard to classify."

On 7 November 1942 she described her [...] "contempt" [...] for {{her mother and her}} inability to [...] "confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm and her hard-heartedness," [...] before concluding, [...] "She's not a mother to me." [...] Later, as she revised her diary, Frank felt ashamed of her harsh attitude, writing: [...] "Anne, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> you who mentioned hate, oh Anne, how could you?" [...] She came to understand that their differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much her fault as her mother's, and saw that she had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, Frank began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.|$|E

40|$|What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> like?’ 1 To {{the common}} sense of today’s lay reader, this {{question}} {{seems to be the}} foundation of all historical work, the very core of our curiosity about the past. Ironically, however, in the long history of historical writing, the idea that the goal of history is to provide a window on to the ways of life of another time is a relative late-comer and, even then, it has seldom taken precedence over other, seemingly more serious reasons for examining the past. Recently, however, the layman’s question has found its way to the front, animating the most ambitious historians of the past four decades. What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> like (such historians have been asking) to be a sixteenth-century French peasant woman? what <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> like to live in a thirteenth-century community of Cathar heretics? to be a follower of a peasant cult that continued to practise pre-Christian fertility rituals? to work as a midwife in eighteenth-century New England?

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began to}} write again in 1847. His first work in this period was Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits which {{was made up of}} three parts. It {{included}} Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing, What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air, and The Gospel of Sufferings. These questions are asked, What {{does it mean to be}} a single individual who wants to do the good? What does it mean to be a human being? What does it mean to follow Christ? He now moves from [...] "upbuilding (Edifying) discourses" [...] to [...] " [...] discourses", however, he still maintains that these are not [...] "sermons". [...] A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote [...] discourses and Godly discourses.Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one's might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness.

[...] (Chapin, p. xi) Ted Chapin wrote, [...] "Taken as a whole, the collection of reviews Follies received was as rangy as possible." [...] (Chapin, p.300) In his New York Times review of the original Broadway production, Clive Barnes wrote: [...] "...it is stylish, innovative, it has some of the best lyrics I have ever encountered, and above all it is a serious attempt to deal with the musical form."

2500|$|Like {{the bulk}} of the songs on Till I Loved You, [...] "What Were We Thinking Of" [...] is a [...] "nontheatrical pop song". According to the {{official}} sheet music published by the Warner Music Group, the song is written in the key of B major with a moderately fast beat consisting of 138 beats per minute. Since Till I Loved You is a concept album based on the beginnings and ends of relationships, [...] "What Were We Thinking Of" [...] was placed {{towards the end of the}} album's track listing where the accompanying songs' lyrics discuss break-ups and how to move on in life from them. Streisand sings, [...] "Where did we go wrong? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> over? / Where does my heart belong if it's not with you?". To accompany the production, a number of instruments are present on the track, including a saxophone played by Dave Boruff, a guitar played by Michael Thompson, and drums played by Randy Waldman and Cutler.|$|E

[...] The following year, Thomas and five journalists and photographers who had also been under surveillance by the London Metropolitan Police Service's National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit (NDEDIU) began legal action against the force.

2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot {{have any idea of}} where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, but where <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> going?"
