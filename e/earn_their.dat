5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to <b>earn</b> <b>their</b> character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release.

Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work.
