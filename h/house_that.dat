40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the influence of access to potable water and sewer services about the attention for acute diarrheal disease (ADD) in centers of Ministry of Health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ecological study. The geographical unit of analysis was constituted by each of 25 regions of Peru. Information was obtained of the number of attentions reported of ADD in centers of Ministry of Health of each region for 2007. The information of population and the access to potable water and sewer services was obtained of 2007 population census. The attention rate by ADD was calculated in centers of Ministry of Health being registered in a multiple linear regression model with variables of access to potable water and sewer services. RESULTS: In the total population, the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> {{do not have access to}} potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not have sewer services (p= 0, 000) constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0. 408). In population under 5 years old, the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not have access to potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not have sewer services (p= 0, 000) also constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0, 251). CONCLUSIONS: The access to potable water and sewer services explain the 40, 8 % and 25, 1 % of attentions for ADD in centers of Ministry of Health for the total population and the population under 5 years old respectively...|$|R
40|$|Mortgage loan default studies {{typically}} {{evaluate the}} effects of the mortgage contract (fixed versus variable rates, term, down payment), the borrower characteristics (credit score, education, employment), the economic conditions, the legal situation or some combination of these. This paper takes an alternate approach by examining the contribution Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data can make to the understanding of mortgage default. We find: i) <b>Houses</b> <b>that</b> eventually foreclosed sold for about 3 % less than predicted by a hedonic model, ii) <b>Houses</b> <b>that</b> eventually foreclosed sold at less of a discount to list price than <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> did not, iii) <b>Houses</b> <b>that</b> eventually foreclosed took about 12 % longer to sell than other houses, and iv) A hedonic model based predicted house price is a very strong covariate of future foreclosure...|$|R

5|$|Forglen House is {{a mansion}} <b>house</b> <b>that</b> forms the centrepiece of the Forglen {{estate in the}} parish of Forglen, {{northwest}} of Turriff, Aberdeenshire, in the northeast of Scotland. The lands {{were given to the}} abbots of the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion before 1211 and the Monymusk Reliquary was held there. The original castle, built around 1346, was replaced by a vernacular harled <b>house</b> <b>that</b> was later extended. Significant development of the estate began when it was acquired by the family of Lord Banff and they started the work of landscaping and planting trees. It became their main family seat during the 18th century. After the death of William Ogilvy, the eighth and final Lord Banff, the estate passed by marriage to the Abercromby baronets who continued to enhance the property and maintained it as their main residence. Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect, John Smith to design the present house in 1839.|$|E
