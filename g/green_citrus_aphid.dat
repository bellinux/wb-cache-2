50|$|Toxoptera citricida (syn. Toxoptera citricidus) is {{a species}} of aphid known by the common names brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> black <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> and oriental <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid.</b> It is a pest of citrus and vector for the {{pathogenic}} plant virus citrus tristeza virus. The aphid spread the virus through citrus groves in Brazil and Venezuela in the 1970s, leading to the near destruction of the citrus industry there. This aphid was first discovered in Florida in 1995.|$|R

50|$|CTV is a {{virus that}} {{is limited to the}} phloem tissues of its host. It is {{transmitted}} semi-persistently by vectors that penetrate the phloem to extract sap, mostly the aphid species that colonize the crop. The brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> is considerably more efficient at transmitting the virus than are other <b>aphids</b> that infest <b>citrus.</b> In Florida, it {{has been shown to be}} from six to twenty five times as efficient as Aphis gossypii, the most efficient vector found in the state before the introduction of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> prior to 1995. This efficiency is enhanced by the narrow host range of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and its tendency to produce winged forms in order to colonize new growth. A. gossypii has a much wider host range, including hundreds of plant species in Florida, and the transmission of the virus is blocked when it feeds on a different host.|$|R
50|$|The Brown <b>Citrus</b> <b>Aphid,</b> (Toxoptera aurantii), is an aphid in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in {{the order}} Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants. It is known to hosts in well over 150+ plant species.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first is}} a study of {{expressed}} genes from alate Toxoptera citricida, more {{commonly known as the}} brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid.</b> The brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> is considered the primary vector of citrus tristeza virus, a severe pathogen which causes losses to citrus industries worldwide. The winged form of this aphid can fly long distances with the wind, enabling them to spread the citrus tristeza virus in citrus growing regions. To better understand the biology of the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and the emergence of genes expressed during wing development, researchers undertook a large-scale 5′ end sequencing project of cDNA clones from winged aphids. Similar large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing projects from other insects have provided a vehicle for answering biological questions relating to development and physiology. Although there is a growing database in GenBank of ESTs from insects, most are from Drosophila melanogaster, with relatively few specifically derived from aphids.The researchers were able to provide a large data set of ESTs from the alate (winged) brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and have begun to analyze this valuable resource. They were able to do this with the help of information on Drosophila melanogaster in FlyBase. Putative sequence identity was determined using BLAST searches. Sequence matches with E-value scores ≤ −10 were considered significant and were categorized according to the Gene Ontology (GO) classification system based on annotation of the 5 ‘best hit’ matches in BLASTX searches. All D. melanogaster matches were cataloged using FlyBase. Nearly all of these ‘best hit’ matches were characterized with respect to the functionally annotated genes in D. melanogaster using FlyBase. Genetic information is crucial to advancing the understanding of aphid biology, and will {{play a major role in}} the development of future non-chemical, gene-based control strategies against these insect pests.|$|R
40|$|Beginning in 1993, Florida’s citrus {{industry}} has been invaded by citrus leafminer (Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> (Toxoptera citricida Kirkaldy, Homoptera: Aphididae), and the Asian citrus psylla (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, Homoptera: Psyllidae). The source(s) of these pests remain unknown but {{other countries in the}} Caribbean, as well as Central and South America, also have suffered invasions by these pests. Brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> and Asian <b>citrus</b> psylla are vectors of serious citrus diseases (citrus tristeza virus and greening disease, respectively), while citrus leafminer damage provides openings for invasion of the citrus canker pathogen into the foliage. All three pests were considered suitable candidates for classical biological control. Dr. Ru Nguyen (Division of Plant Industry, Gainesville, Florida) and I have collaborated on importing, evaluating, rearing and releasing parasitoids for each pest into Florida’s 860, 000 acres of citrus between 1993 and the present.

5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the melon (cotton aphid) Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid</b> Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|R

We have been {{conducting}} {{a survey of}} the pests of E. joga in Guam, and have previously reported on a psylloid and two thrips (Muniappan et al. 2000 a, b). In this paper we report an additional ten pests that attack this tree in Guam, five of which are exotic. We also report on the nat-ural enemies of two of the caterpillar pests. The black <b>citrus</b> <b>aphid,</b> Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) (Homoptera: Aphididae) is found mostly on tender stems of E. joga. It can be found at any time of the year, but we have never found it to be epidemic or to cause appreciable damage. This aphid has been recorded on Annona muricata L., Citrus limon L., Citrus madurensis Lour., and Coffea arabica L. in Guam (Pike et al. 2000). It is widely distributed throughout the tropics. It occasionally transmits tristeza disease of citrus, a virus disease causing leaf mottle (citrus infectious mot-tling virus) on Citrus vulgaris Risso, and little leaf and lemon ribbing virus of lemon. It also transmits two viruses of coffee, blister spot of arabica coffee and ring spot of excelsa coffee (Heinze 1977).
