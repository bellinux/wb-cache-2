40|$|In a {{wireless}} multi-hop network, {{we need to}} allow the communication between any pair of nodes {{even if they are}} not in transmission range of each other. For it, a routing protocol is needed to provide routes between them. But, flat routing protocols (reactive or proactive) do not scale well. Indeed, such routing protocols become ineffective for large scale wireless multi-hop networks, because of bandwidth (flooding of control messages), latency and processing overhead (routing table computation). A well-known solution to overcome this major drawback is to introduce a hierarchy in the network by grouping geographically close nodes into clusters in a distributed and local way. We can thus apply different routing schemes in and between clusters. We thus previously introduced a clustering protocol in [6]. The resulting clusters have been analyzed by theoretical and simulations approaches and <b>have</b> <b>reveal</b> to present better features than other existing ones ([6, 7, 8]. It self-stabilizes in a low and constant time and specifically offers a better stability over node mobility. Because of place limitation, we will not detail our clustering scheme in this paper.

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to analyze, with geological-structural criteria, some aspects about the stones {{characterization}} and the exploitation of the deposits and find for the stone-waste new industrial utilize. The work started with the study of a particular and recently commercialized stone, the Giallo San Giacomo granite, for which did not exist geological and geotechnical data. This results have been then confronted with those of another stone already for long time interested from exploitation: the Rosa Beta granite. The geological survey has allowed to study the whole San Giacomo’s pluton creating a geological map with an unpublished detail. The geological-structural study has evidenced as outcrops characterized from "magmatic turbulences" (Cava M. te Seccu) or fractures (Cava Inginocchiaddu) are {{the main cause of}} abandonment of deposits on which the exploitation had been begun. These causes in fact do not concur the exploitation of a chromatically homogenous product and limits the production of suitable blocks. The study carried out on both the stones has allowed to characterize the anisotropy in these present ones (LPO, SPO, microfractures). Finally, the complete characterization carried out for the both stones has allowed to made a technical report with their principal physical and mechanical propriety.

40|$|The Couvade {{syndrome}} {{is a global}} phenomenon occurring in industrialised {{countries around the world}} and has a wide international variance. It affects biological fathers particularly during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy with cessation of symptoms after birth. It does not appear in the nosology of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-Version 4, (American Psychiatric Association 2000). Nevertheless, early accounts tended to medicalise it as a psychosomatic disorder. Its relationship with socio-demographic factors is inconsistent, with the exception of ethnicity. International studies reveal some contradictory findings in the type of symptoms. This may reflect methodological problems in the syndrome’s definition or criteria and type of measurement across studies. A plethora of theories has been put forward to account for the origins of the syndrome. Psychoanalytical theories contend that it is a consequence of the man’s envy of the woman’s procreative ability or foetal rivalry. Psychosocial theories propose that it occurs due to the marginalisation of fatherhood and as part of a transitional crisis to parenthood. Paternal theories suggest a connection between the man’s involvement in pregnancy, role preparation and the syndrome. However, some of these theories have not been thoroughly investigated. Those which <b>have</b> <b>reveal</b> inconsistent findings. It is recommended that future investigators use qualitative approaches to further illuminate the syndrome’s characteristics, definition and perceptions as seen by male partners. This should be followed by quantitative approaches of large heterogeneous samples to assess the relationship of socio-demographic factors and the syndrome...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the growing}} need for high {{specific}} energy density and good cycling performance has prompted the research to develop novel electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. In this context, carbon coated ZnFe 2 O 4 (C-ZFO) has attracted increasing interest as promising new anode material {{because it offers}} an exceptional specific capacity, higher than 1000 mAh g- 1, and it is environmentally friendly, non toxic and cheap. 1 This electrode material {{has been used in}} SIRBATT project in order to investigate the evolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) in this anode because the performances and durability of batteries are strongly influenced by the passivation layer formed on electrode surface. 2 The electrodes have been prepared by casting the slurry containing active material, conductive carbon and carboxymethyl cellulose as binder. The electrochemical performances and the study of electrode/electrolyte interface have been investigated by galvanostatic cycles at different C-rate values, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) at 25 °C and 50 °C and soft X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) using synchrotron radiation. The electrochemical results have shown that C-ZFO has good cycling performance, with high capacity values also at highest rates, and high stability upon cycling. Furthermore, EIS measurements <b>have</b> <b>reveal</b> that the electrode interfacial stability is more compromised at high temperatures. The XAS results have allowed to obtain important information on SEI formation and evolution upon C-ZFO electrodes.

40|$|The {{splitting}} of {{the frequencies}} of the global resonant acoustic modes of the Sun by large-scale flows and rotation permits study of the variation of angular velocityΩ with both radius and latitude within the turbulent convection zone and the deeper radiative interior. The nearly uninterrupted Doppler imaging observations, provided by the Solar Oscillations Investigation (SOI) using the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the SOHO spacecraft positioned at the L 1 Lagrangian point in continuous sunlight, yield oscillation power spectra with a very high signal-to-noise ratio that allow frequency splittings to be determined with exceptional accuracy. This paper reports on joint helioseismic analyses of solar rotation in the convection zone and in the outer part of the radiative core with eight different inversion procedures. The inversion results have been obtained for a medium-l mode set (involving modes of angular degree l extending to about 250) obtained from the first 144 -day interval of SOI [...] MDI observations in 1996. A set of controlled experiments utilizing artificial frequency-splitting data are also presented which test the reliability and sensitivity of these inversion methods. The inversions of SOI [...] MDI data have confirmed that the decrease ofΩ with latitude seen at the surface extends with little radial variation {{through much of the}} convection zone, at the base of which is an adjustment layer, called the tachocline, leading to nearly uniform rotation deeper in the radiative interior. A prominent rotational shearing layer involving an increase inΩ just below the surface is discernible at low to mid latitudes. Using the new data we have also been able to study solar rotation closer to the poles than in prior investigations. The data <b>have</b> <b>reveal</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The present work probes {{the ground}} and excited state energy {{structures}} {{of a variety of}} Ru(II) complexes to better understanding the factors which affect their photo - chemical and - physical properties. In the picosecond domain, ultrafast time resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate the rate of formation of the thermally equilibrated excited (THEXI) state in [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 +. These studies have shown that evolution of the THEXI state persists into the picosecond time range and is not complete on the femtosecond timescale, as previously suggested. These studies have also been extended to cover heteroleptic complexes and the effects of deuteriation and solvent. Ru(II) complexes containing a 1, 2, 4 - triazole moiety have been investigated using a variety of techniques, including time correlated single photon counting, resonance Raman and transient absorption. At room temperature studies have shown the ability to control the electrochemical and photophysical properties through substitution of the triazole and alternating the symmetrical N N ligands. Low temperature emission and single photon counting (on the microsecond timescale) measurements have shown the presence of two emissions for the 1, 2, 4 - triazole complexes containing a pyrazine moiety. These studies have highlighted the importance of electron délocalisation and excited state dipole, as well as the relative energies of the ligands, when controlling the excited state location. Throughout the work deuteriation have been employed to considered effect with its application of particular importance to the Raman and excited state lifetime studies. Computational studies have also been used to augment the experimental work.

40|$|The {{reform of}} work unit (Danwei) system since 1980 s has {{substantially}} influenced spatial structure {{as well as}} people's life style in urban China. How to understand the great transformation of work unit system {{is very important to}} disentangle the socio-economic restructuring processes of Chinese cities. In this paper, we explained the origin, function and transformation of work unit system through literature study and enterprise interview, then we analyze the implication of work unit system reform, as one aspect of institutional changes in China, to people's daily life and urban spatial structure. There has been increasing interests in work unit system and its transformation. The earliest work came from sociological perspective, which has focused on such topics as the origin of work unit and its political-economic background, its organizational structures and power balance, multiple functions of a typical work unit, as well as the dependence of individuals to the work unit. In other words, sociologists pay more attention on the mechanism of work unit system, especially the control and dependence among the state, work unit and individual. Geographers, however, first noticed the role of work unit system through their studies on the urban spatial restructuring. Work unit system and its reform are regarded as the main constraints as well as impetus of the transformation of urban land use and social space. However, up to the present, many studies still remained rather descriptive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework of work unit studies, while arguing that geographers should and are able to combine the two approaches. Work unit system is a series of institutions and systems of production organization and social control based on work units, which includes two main systems: personnel administration system and welfare system. The former includes authorized staff administration system, employment system, wage system, and employee evaluation and training system. The latter includes housing welfare system, collective consumption system, entertainment welfare system, subsidy system, and social security welfare system. Thus, work unit becomes the "cell" of urban society in China, which not only controls resource allocation and production organization, but is responsible to the social control and social welfare. A work unit is more of a "whole community" than merely a factory or a administrative organization. Work unit system has experienced great transformation since the adoption of the reform and open policy. One fundamental change was the breakdown of the "whole community" of Danwei. Market mechanism was introduced into social production sphere. The organization of work units has gradually been marketized to meet the requirement of market competition. Therefore, social welfare system was gradually separated from work units, i. e. it has been socialized and marketized too. Work units are no longer responsible to the provision of housing, health insurance or other items of social welfare. The reform aimed at work unit system has been one main impetus of the transformation of people's life style and daily life space. Within work unit system, people not only work in Danwei, live in the dwellings allocated as a type of welfare within the Danwei compound (Dayuan). Thus, not only the social relationship, but also the daily life is constrained within Danwei compound. Since the reform, however, individual's dependence to Danwei and work unit system has been weakened. With the breakdown of work unit system, urban residents now have more freedom in choosing jobs and residence. Consequently, job mobility and residential mobility both have been increasing. Home-work relationship has also been greatly shifted, due to the relocation of job opportunities and residences, from home-work proximity to increasingly long-distance commuting. Besides, people's activity space {{is becoming more and more}} extended from work unit compound (Dayuan). For example, our empirical studies on individual shopping space and leisure space <b>have</b> <b>reveal</b> the expansion and differentiation of residents'daily activity spaces of urban China. Urban morphology also experienced substantial restructuring process accompany with the breakdown of work unit system. Urban expansion is now more generated and influenced by urban redevelopment, the construction of industrial parks and residential communities, contrary to the significance of the Danwei construction before the reform. Consequently to the expansion and diversification of people's commuting space, housing search space, and activity space (such as shopping space and leisure space), major cities in China has been facing substantial restructuring. In addition, there has been a more and more apparent trend of urban socio-spatial stratification based on residential location. In the end, we argue that work unit system, although weaken, is still an important factor, to some extent, in urban China, which we call "the concealment of Danwei system". In some cities, residents still expect a "whole community" of Danwei, and Danwei is still the main source of welfare of them. Therefore, work unit system, as well as its transformation continues to be one main perspective of understanding urban China, which requires further studies...|$|E
