50|$|Battle Bird Armada - a {{group of}} avian villains first {{featured}} in the game Tails Adventure. In the comics they are a prejudicial army who believed that only birds can reside in the skies, putting them in conflict with Tails because {{of his ability to}} fly with his two tails; they also share a common origin with the Babylon Rogues, being descended from the ancient Babylonians who came to the planet Mobius on the Babylon Garden spacecraft. They were loosely aligned with the Eggman Empire, but received information so slowly that they mistook Bunnie Rabbot for a member of Eggman's cyborg army. They later attacked Sonic's home city of New Mobotropolis, which had been built atop the burial site of Babylon Garden. Prominent members included the super-strong Battle Lord, his son Speedy (who developed a rivalry with Tails), and the armada's <b>head</b> <b>technician,</b> Dr. Fukurokov. The Complete Sonic Comic Encyclopedia also listed Bin and Pin of the game Dynamite Düx (who served as the inspiration for Bean the Dynamite) as possible members. Their role in the continuity reboot is similar from before. After the current Battle Lord was called in to help Eggman and his Egg Bosses retake Eggmanland from the Naugus Twins' occupation, he led the armada to ambush the Sky Patrol through a widespread Eggman Empire attack.

40|$|International audienceSociety has {{a growing}} {{interest}} for urban nature. The decision-makers {{have to take}} this concern into account but they need to know the fallouts of nature for their municipalities, their citizens and the tourists. It was the purpose of our research programs, which were funded by the French region Centre-Val de Loire. How urban nature is perceived by users? What kind of nature is more appreciated? How explain the increasing interest for urban nature? What users research in green spaces? The study was conducted in six green spaces, which belong to different categories (forest and semi-natural, ornamental and allotment gardens) and are located in the six main cities of the region Centre-Val de Loire. 321 users were interviewed from a semi-supervised manner. To complete this study, 12 green spaces managers (elected representatives, <b>heads</b> and <b>technicians)</b> were questioned on the representation of nature by urban-dwellers. To put the results into perspective, we also analyzed tourists’ point of view in the Center Parcs site, which is located in the same region and can be assimilated to urban space, with its cottages, facilities and shops. Here, the study considered an innovative method, basing on 2. 118 comments posted by customers on a sharing website (TripAdvisor). The first conclusion is that nature is unanimously appreciated and sought-after, according to the accounts of green spaces users as well as Net surfers. But the green spaces managers moderate this idea. City-dwellers complain to them about nature: it has also disservices (pollen, weeds). If we analyze further {{the point of view of}} green spaces users, considering the perspective offered by Center Parcs customers, we can observe that French citizen appreciated only one kind of nature, the managed one. Moreover, this nature appears only like a setting. Indeed, users come first in nature spaces for peace and quiet, before coming for the closeness with nature...|$|R

50|$|Nikita was {{recruited}} by Division {{when she was}} a deeply troubled teenager, on death row. Division rescued her, faked her death, and told her she was getting a second chance {{to start a new life}} and serve her country. Throughout her grueling training, Nikita never lost her humanity. Once she graduated from recruit to field agent, she broke Division rules by falling in love with a civilian, whom she became engaged to and planned to run away with. When Division found out and assassinated Nikita's fiancé, Nikita went rogue. She makes it her mission to bring down Division, as a way to avenge her fiancé and atone for the sins she committed as a Division agent. Percy orders Michael, the Division operative who trained Nikita, to deal with her. On the outside, Nikita trains a young woman named Alex, who as a child was saved by Nikita during a mission that killed Alex's parents years ago. Nikita has Alex become a recruit inside Division, working as a mole to gain intelligence. Over the course of Season One, Nikita works to disrupt Division's operations, with the support of Alex's intelligence from the inside. Nikita also encounters Gogol, a Russian security department and established enemy of Division. Nikita slowly brings other allies to her side, including Michael when he realizes the true extent of Percy's corruption as well as his own feelings for Nikita. At the end of Season One, Nikita manages to foil Percy's plan to take over the CIA and gain its top secret funding. However, she is forced to go on the run with Michael. At the same time, Nikita loses Alex when Alex discovers that it was Nikita herself who killed her father on the Division mission years ago. When Alex is exposed as Nikita's mole and finds herself at the mercy of Division and Oversight, Amanda offers Alex a deal: help Division stop Nikita, and Division will help Alex bring down the man who ordered the hit on her father. In season two, Nikita and Michael focus and press their efforts against Oversight, seeking to destroy the group, which will also cripple Division at the same time. Division has changed, with Percy being locked up for his actions in season one, and Amanda taking control of the organization, with Oversight supervising her. Alex has set her sights on Sergei Semak, her father's right-hand man and also the one responsible for ordering his death, who has taken over Zektrov, her father's company and controller of Gogol. Nikita and Michael manage to expose and/or kill most of Oversight, with the help of Seymour Birkhoff, a former Division <b>head</b> <b>technician,</b> who left the organization after Percy was imprisoned. While trying to bring down Oversight, Nikita and Michael hunt down the remaining black-boxes, finally destroying all but one, which has fallen into the hands of Gogol's leader, Ari Tasarov, who is later revealed to be Amanda's lover, later exposes her as a traitor. With the help of the last of the Guardians, Percy escapes his prison and manages to overthrow Amanda's control of Division, sending her and Ari into hiding, along with the last black-box. Percy also manages to kill all members of Oversight and puts a plan into place to use plutonium to gain membership to an unknown group of powerful people. Having no other choice, Nikita and Michael decide to take the situation to the president, with the help of Ryan, who has been helping Nikita on her mission since season one. Alex reconciles with Nikita, after having finally brought down Semak and restore her father's company. While her allies attempt to stop Percy's most trusted man, Roan, from using the plutonium to blow up Washington D.C., Nikita and Michael infiltrate Division, managing to expose Percy of his corruption and evil deeds, ending his leadership over the organization. Percy is killed by Nikita after trying to escape and Roan is killed by Alex before he could set off the plutonium. The vice president assigns Ryan as the new director of Division and tasks Nikita in hunting down the last of Division's agents, who have gone rogue, including Amanda.|$|E
40|$|Information and {{communication}} technology in schools now reaches across every learning area, but {{who ought to}} provide the leadership? The answer is straightforward: an educator. To better understand the ICT leadership role, the author conducted research {{to find out how}} teachers and others in a variety of key leadership positions in schools see ICT leadership. The research surveyed and compared the views of educators in eight categories: heads of departments, deputy principals, classroom teachers, <b>head</b> librarians, computer <b>technicians,</b> principals, network administrators and curriculum co-ordinators across seven secondary schools. In addition, six people from that pool of survey participants were interviewed. The author 2 ̆ 7 s research found that the ICT leadership role as perceived by educators across all eight categories was similar. There is essentially a common understanding of the role and functions of an ICT leader in a secondary school. The research informed 11 recommendations for practice applicable in schools that are of a medium to large size - 600 to 1, 800 students - although these may be of limited practicality when applied to smaller schools or large schools that have multiple campuses. These recommendations for practice can, however, be used in schools to develop a uniform position description of the ICT leader. [Author abstract, ed...|$|R
40|$|Training is {{described}} as a structured intervention that is aimed at enhancing and improving key elements vital in individual performance. In other words, training and development consist of set of strategies, policies, lessons, tools and procedures designed to enhance the members or the employees at the organization. This study examined the effect of training strategies on the employees' performance in the Libyan construction companies. The population of this study consisted of the employees who worked in the construction companies in the eastern and central parts of Libya. A substantial literature review was done to obtain the information on training strategies and the development of human resources. A total of 400 designed structured questionnaires were distributed randomly to employees such as managers, <b>heads</b> of departments, <b>technicians</b> and workers in the selected companies.

Pedagogic discovery and experimentation are values expressed through the selected works, which combine traditional skills, processes, techniques and individual visual language. At {{the heart of our}} team of educators are practicing makers, designers and artists. We value creative discovery through making in areas that combine tradition and innovation. Craftsmanship is critical, shaping development and production of textiles for art, architecture, fashion and interiors. Many textile industries place demands for textiles to perform beyond the familiar range of functions and aesthetics; the new course develops design skills and creative ambition to challenge perception and push boundaries in materiality from an individual’s point of view. Origination and quality of making is paramount to this, as each individual develops a personal creative taxonomy. The new course facilitates a holistic experience with inter-connected stages. Year 1, basic skills and subject practice processes, year 2 explores creative practice exercising acquired knowledge and skills and year 3 develops an individual design identity and professional portfolio. The focus of responsibility shifts from staff team to student with each level promoting an increasingly individual and independent approach. Students are equipped strategies to navigate each stage as necessary, including tools for research, analysis, understanding of human values and international culture, creative thinking, workshop practice, material processes and technology, digital technologies, commercial practice, communication and presentation, teamwork, self-directed and continuous learning and critical reflection. With a clear understanding of making, materials and manufacture, students are able to influence and effect creative change.

40|$|So far EMAS {{research}} has shown that the success of environmental management system depends heavily on the participation and qualification of employees on all level in a company, not just on the management level, to reach the proposed goals towards continuous environment improvement. Today most of the companies who have passed the EMAS requirements are still uncertain in how to involve in all level and areas of a company multiplicator and actors: from the trainee, educated and uneducated collaborator, fellow to the master, <b>technician,</b> <b>head</b> of the department to the top management. Therefore it is mandatory to develop an understanding oftheir role and responsibilities within the greening process through training and education. In {{the first phase of the}} presented project the status quo of company's organisational structureand culture to implement environmental management will be analysed; a strength/weaknessprofile participation and qualification of employees in the company specific will be conduced; aframework for an extended training program for the employees will be developed and multiplicator and actor group defined qualification steps (modules) will be developed andimplemented. On the end of this phase the participating company should be able through anincreased level of participation and qualification of their employees to improve theirenvironmental management system successfully by their own. The second phase will measure the progress of the initial qualification and participation steps. As a consequence of the upcoming results the modules will be optimised to guarantee a long-term participation of all employees involved (as long as the continuous improvement of theenvironmental management system is ongoing). In the third phase the specific results from the company-level (micro-level) are evaluated,extracted and transformed onto the sector level and documented in guidelines (handbook). The project focuses on small and medium sized companies in sectors that are especially affectedby the ecological-economical structural changes and where the potential of unemploymentoccurs. The consumer good industry is such an example. As well as in the furniture- and as in the food sector the number of people employed is decreasing. Therefore the partners of thisproject are 5 - 7 small to medium sized businesses of the furniture and food branch, whichadditionally have passed the EMAS requirements. The project is composed as a European transfer project, which permits comparison, andanalysis of business oriented environmental protection measures within the premises of EMASand promotes information transfer between the international participants. The results of the project will support the participating businesses to implement environmentalmanagement system, contribute to the consolidation of jobs and as a result improve the situationof employees within the branches. ...|$|R
40|$|DoctorateWhile {{growing numbers}} of schools have an Information and Communications Technology leader, the role is defined {{in a variety of}} {{different}} ways. As position descriptions vary from school to school, there is surprisingly little consensus on who an Information and Communications Technology leader should be or what the position should entail. Although the role of the Information and Communications Technology leader in schools has not been formally investigated as much as that of Principals, some commentators have begun to suggest that Information and Communications Technology leaders have a crucial role to play. In Victoria, Australia, Information and Communications Technology leaders in secondary schools have been given a variety of position titles. In some schools the position is treated as a senior role, while in others it is not terribly important. Financial remuneration and time allowance for the Information and Communications Technology leader role varies. In addition, no system-wide description of the role or expectation of an Information and Communications Technology leader. exists. Moreover, there are differences in practice as to what kinds of experience and qualifications are necessary to undertake this role. In describing the Information and Communications Technology leadership role, the goal of this research was to obtain perspectives from a variety of personnel in key leadership positions in schools as well as teacher perspectives to evaluate: the similarity and differences of perspectives compared to the literature. For this purpose, comparisons were conducted across the seven schools. In all, a total of 51 questionnaires were completed by the participants: Heads of Departments, Deputy Principals, Classroom Teachers, <b>Head</b> Librarian, Computer <b>Technicians,</b> Principals, Network Administrators and Curriculum Coordinators. In addition, six people were interviewed from the pool of participants in the questionnaires. From the study it was identified that to be an effective Information and Communications Technology leader, one needs to have experience and skills in four specific areas. The four specific areas are: � Resources/Equity � Pedagogy � Professional Development � External Factors These specific areas are strongly connected to key aspects of the questionnaire and provide important points of amplification in terms of developing a position description. Additionally, the study identified that the Information and Communications Technology leader needs to as have the following components in the role: � Knowledge and Skills - both in terms of having a sound educational background and knowledge of hardware and software. � Team Leadership - with regards to technical team and Information and Communications Technology vision team and all staff in terms of professional development. � Leadership - with particular respect to vision and strategic leadership � Seniority - especially with respect to belonging on senior teams within a school and being able to have direct communication with the Principal. From this study, an Information and Communications Technology leader's role was derived and a position description produced which may be applied to schools.
