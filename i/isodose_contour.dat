40|$|Published data {{suggests}} that wedge resection for stage I {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is associated with}} improved overall survival compared to stereotactic body radiation therapy. We report CyberKnife outcomes for high-risk surgical patients with biopsy-proven stage I NSCLC. PET/CT imaging was completed for staging. Three-to-five gold fiducial markers were implanted in or near tumors to serve as targeting references. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were contoured using lung windows; the margins were expanded by 5 [*]mm to establish the planning treatment volume (PTV). Treatment plans were designed using a mean of 156 pencil beams. Doses delivered to the PTV ranged from 42 to 60 [*]Gy in three fractions. The 30 [*]Gy <b>isodose</b> <b>contour</b> extended at least 1 [*]cm from the GTV to eradicate microscopic disease. Treatments were delivered using the CyberKnife system with tumor tracking. Examination and PET/CT imaging occurred at 3 [*]month follow-up intervals. Forty patients (median age 76) with a median maximum tumor diameter of 2. 6 [*]cm (range, 1. 4 – 5. 0 [*]cm) and a mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 [*]s (FEV 1) of 57 % (range, 21 – 111 %) were treated. A median dose of 48 [*]Gy was delivered to the PTV over 3 – 13 [*]days (median, 7 [*]days). The 30 [*]Gy <b>isodose</b> <b>contour</b> extended a mean 1. 9 [*]cm from the GTV. At a median 44 [*]months (range, 12 – 72 [*]months) follow-up, the 3 [*]year Kaplan–Meier locoregional control and overall survival estimates compare favorably with contemporary wedge resection outcomes at 91 and 75 %, respectively. CyberKnife is an effective treatment approach for stage I NSCLC that is similar to wedge resection, eradicating tumors with 1 – 2 [*]cm margins in order to preserve lung function. Prospective randomized trials comparing CyberKnife with wedge resection are necessary to confirm equivalence...|$|E

40|$|COMPUTATIONAL PROGRAM OF ISODOSE AND TREATMENT PLANNING SYSTEM (TPS) FOR BRACHYTHERAPY USING 125 I-SEED-SOURCES. To {{reach the}} goals of a {{brachytherapy}} treatment, a guaranteed dose rate calculation {{as well as a}} treatment planning system (TPS) are absolutely needed. Therefore, a local computational program for isodose and TPS calculations has been developed. The program has been performed using Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows and its supporting tools based on dosimetry calculation models developed and updated by the Association of American Physicist in Medicine. The program was started from the dose rate calculation of the of 125 I-seed-source assumed as a line source with 0. 3 cm of active length. This program can display two dimensions-isodose contour of the single or poly- 125 I-seeds presented in the directions of lateral, anterior and caudal by changing the polar coordinate system (r, θ) into a Cartesian coordinate system (x,y). The dose rate at the distances of 1, 2, 3 and 4 cm from the center point as well as the effect of single-seed-source rotation can also be calculated. The entered data as well as the resulting calculation and the <b>isodose</b> <b>contour</b> presentation can be saved, quickly traced and redisplayed at any time necessarily. It was found that this computer program is in agree with the referenced data so it is hopefully able to assist physicians in the domestic implementation of 125 I seeds implants for brachytherapy...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 80 - 82). Recent {{advances in}} radiation therapy physics have enabled sophisticated treatment plans that conform accurately {{to the target}} volume while sparing normal tissue. The complex three- dimensional treatment planning requires dose verification (dosimetry) techniques that can validate with high spatial resolution in 3 D dose distribution with accuracy and precision. Routinely used dosimetry techniques include ionization chambers which can map very accurately but are restricted to a single plane or 2 D film based techniques. Gel dosimetry {{can be considered as}} 3 D integrating dosimeters that offer high spatial resolution, precision and accuracy for the verification of a large range of treatment plans. However, gel dosimetry has not been evaluated {{for a wide range of}} treatment plans, especially using more advanced radiation therapy units such as Stereotactic Radiosurgery. In addition gel dose readouts are performed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging sequences that are extremely long, precluding routine usage of this technique in a clinical setting. 	This thesis is focused on establishing gel dosimetry as a viable method for clinical use to validate a wide variety of treatment plans. A new fast MR pulse sequence (stepped TE multi-shot Echo Planar Imaging) is proposed for T 2 (spin-spin relaxation) relaxometry studies and evaluated against the conventional multiple spin echo sequence. Three different radiation dose treatment plans using Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and Stereotactic Radio Surgery (SRS) systems were evaluated with the gel dosimeter. Since the dose calibration curves did not yield accurate absolute values of dose, several methods for scaling are discussed. 	Gel dosimetry provided accurate <b>isodose</b> <b>contour</b> lines for the three treatment plans investigated in this thesis. Calibration using small vials did not yield accurate absolute values of dose, however the internal scaling schemes provided accurate absolute values.

40|$|Abstract Objective Curative {{surgery is}} not an option for many {{patients}} with clinical stage I non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), but radical radiosurgery may be effective. Methods Inoperable patients with small peripheral clinical stage I NSCLC were enrolled in this study. Three-to-five fiducial markers were implanted in or near tumors under CT guidance. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were contoured using lung windows. The GTV margin was expanded by 5 mm to establish the planning treatment volume (PTV). A dose of 42 – 60 Gy was delivered to the PTV in 3 equal fractions in less than 2 weeks using the CyberKnife radiosurgery system. The 30 -Gy <b>isodose</b> <b>contour</b> extended at least 1 cm from the GTV. Physical examination, CT imaging and pulmonary function testing were completed at 6 months intervals for three years following treatment. Results Twenty patients with an average maximum tumor diameter of 2. 2 cm (range, 1. 1 – 3. 5 cm) and a mean FEV 1 of 1. 08 liters (range, 0. 53 – 1. 71 L) were treated. Pneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy occurred following CT-guided fiducial placement in 25 % of the patients. All patients completed treatment with few acute side effects and no procedure-related mortality. Transient chest wall discomfort developed in 8 of the 12 patients with lesions within 5 mm of the pleura. The mean percentage of the total lung volume receiving a minimum of 15 Gy was 7. 3 % (range, 2. 4 % to 11. 3 %). One patient who received concurrent gefitinib developed short-lived, grade III radiation pneumonitis. The mean percent predicted DLCO decreased by 9 % and 11 % at 6 and 12 months, respectively. There were no local failures, regional lymph node recurrences or distant metastases. With a median follow-up of 25 months for the surviving patients, Kaplan-Meier overall survival estimate at 2 years was 87 %, with deaths due to COPD progression. Conclusion Radical CyberKnife radiosurgery is a well-tolerated treatment option for inoperable patients with small, peripheral stage I NSCLC. Effective doses and adequate margins are likely to have contributed to the optimal early local control seen in this study. </p...|$|E

Methods Patients with biopsy-proven inoperable stage IA NSCLC were enrolled into this IRB-approved study. Targeting was based on 3 - 5 gold fiducial markers implanted in or near tumors. Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were contoured using lung windows; margins were expanded by 5 mm to establish the planning treatment volumes (PTVs). Doses ranged from 42 - 60 Gy in 3 equal fractions. 18 F-FDG PET/CT was performed prior to and at 3 - 6 -month, 9 - 15 months and 18 - 24 months following treatment. The tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) was recorded for each time point. Results Twenty patients with an average maximum tumor diameter of 2. 2 cm were treated over a 3 -year period. A mean dose of 51 Gy was delivered to the PTV in 3 to 11 days (mean, 7 days). The 30 -Gy <b>isodose</b> <b>contour</b> extended an average of 2 cm from the GTV. At a median follow-up of 43 months, the 2 -year Kaplan-Meier overall survival estimate was 90 % and the local control estimate was 95 %. Mean tumor SUV max before treatment was 6. 2 (range, 2. 0 to 10. 7). During early follow-up the mean tumor SUV max remained at 2. 3 (range, 1. 0 to 5. 7), despite transient elevations in individual tumor SUV max levels attributed to peritumoral radiation-induced pneumonitis visible on CT imaging. At 18 - 24 months the mean tumor SUV max for controlled tumors was 2. 0, with a narrow range of values (range, 1. 5 to 2. 8). A single local failure was confirmed at 24 months in a patient with an elevated tumor SUV max of 8. 4. Conclusion Local control and survival following CyberKnife radiosurgery for stage IA NSCLC is exceptional. Early transient increases in tumor SUV max are likely related to radiation-induced pneumonitis. Tumor SUV max values return to background levels at 18 - 24 months, enhancing 18 F-FDG PET/CT detection of local failure. The value of 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging for surveillance following lung SBRT deserves further study. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study investigates to {{what extent}} the {{computed}} dose received by lung tissue in a commercially available treatment planning system (TPS) for 192 Ir high-dose-rate breast brachytherapy is accurate in view of tissue inhomogeneities and presence of ribs.

Results: The results were compared with the corresponding commercial TPS in the form of isodoses and cumulative dose–volume histogram in breast, lung and ribs. The comparison of Monte Carlo results and TPS calculation showed that the isodoses greater than 62 % in the breast that were located rather close to the implant or away from the breast curvature surface and lung boundary were in good agreement.

40|$|Background. The {{efficacy}} of focal continuous low dose-rate brachytherapy (CLDR-BT) {{for prostate cancer}} requires that appropriate margins are applied to ensure robust target coverage. In this study we propose a method to establish such margins by emulating a focal treatment in patients treated with CLDR-BT to the entire gland. Material and methods. In 15 patients with localized prostate cancer, prostate volumes and dominant intra-prostatic lesions were delineated on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Delineations and MRI were registered to trans-rectal ultrasound images in the operating theater. The patients received CLDR-BT treatment to the total prostate volume. The implantation consisted of two parts: an experimental focal plan covering the dominant intra-prostatic lesion (F-GTV), followed by a plan containing additional seeds to achieve entire prostate coverage. Isodose surfaces were reconstructed using follow-up computed tomography (CT). The focal dose was emulated by reconstructing seeds from the focal plan only. The distance to agreement between planned and delivered isodose surfaces and F-GTV coverage was determined to calculate the margin required for robust treatment. Results. If patients had been treated only focally, the target volume would have been reduced {{from an average of}} 40. 9 cm(3) for the entire prostate to 5. 8 cm(3) for the focal plan. The D- 90 for the F-GTV in the focal plan was 195 +/-. 60 Gy, the V- 100 was 94 % [range 71 - 100 %]. The maximum distance (cd(95)) between the planned and delivered <b>isodose</b> <b>contours</b> was 0. 48 cm. Conclusions. This study provides an estimate of 0. 5 cm for the margin required for robust coverage of a focal target volume prior to actually implementing a focal treatment protoco...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} radiation shielding {{requirements of}} the SSC have been evaluated using currently available computational tools that incorporate the well known processes of energy loss and degradation of high energy particles into Monte Carlo computer codes. These tools permit determination of <b>isodose</b> <b>contours</b> in the matter surrounding a source point and therefore the specification of minimum thicknesses or extents of shielding in order to assure annual dose equivalents less than some specified design amount. For the general public the annual dose equivalent specified in the design is 10 millirem, small compared to the dose from naturally occurring radiation. The types of radiation fall into two classes {{for the purposes of}} shielding determinations-hadrons and muons. The sources of radiation at the SSC of concern for the surrounding environment are the interaction regions, the specially designed beam dumps into which the beams are dumped from time to time, and beam clean-up regions where stops remove the beam halo in order to reduce experimental backgrounds. A final, unlikely source of radiation considered is the accidental loss of the full beam at some point around the ring. Conservative choices of a luminosity of 10 {sup 34 } cm{sup {minus} 2 }s{sup {minus} 1 } and a beam current three times design have been made in calculating the required shielding and boundaries of the facility. In addition to determination of minimum distances for the annual dose equivalents, the question of possible radioactivity produced in nearby wells or in municipal water supplies is addressed. The designed shielding distances and beam dumps are such that the induced radioactivity in ground water is safely smaller than the levels permitted by EPA and international agencies...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study investigates to {{what extent}} the dose {{received}} by lungs from a commercially available treatment planning system, Ir- 192 high-dose-rate (HDR), in breast brachytherapy, is accurate, with the emphasis on tissue heterogeneities, and taking into account the presence of ribs, in dose delivery to the lung. Materials and Methods: A computed tomography (CT) scan of a breast was acquired and transferred to the 3 -D treatment planning system and was also used to construct a patient-equivalent phantom. An implant involving 13 plastic catheters and 383 programmed source dwell positions were simulated, using the Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) code. The Monte Carlo calculations were compared with the corresponding commercial treatment planning system (TPS) in the form of percentage isodose and cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) in the breast, lungs, and ribs. Results: The comparison of the Monte Carlo results and the TPS calculations showed that a percentage of isodose greater than 75 % in the breast, which was located rather close to the implant or away from the breast curvature surface and lung boundary, were in good agreement. TPS calculations overestimated the dose to the lung for lower <b>isodose</b> <b>contours</b> that were lying near the breast surface and the boundary of breast and lung and were relatively away from the implant. Conclusions: Taking into account the ribs and entering the actual data for breasts, ribs, and lungs, revealed an average overestimation of the dose by a factor of 8 % in the lung for TPS calculations. Therefore, the accuracy of the TPS results may be limited to regions near the implants where the treatment is planned, and is a more conservative approach for regions at boundaries with curvatures or tissues with a different material than that in the breast...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} patient inhomogeneities {{surrounding}} the oesophagus on the dosimetry planning of an upper thoracic oesophageal 192 Ir HDR brachytherapy treatment is studied. The MCNPX Monte Carlo code {{is used for}} dosimetry in a patient-equivalent phantom geometry and results are compared in terms of <b>isodose</b> <b>contours</b> as well as dose volume histograms with corresponding calculations by a contemporary treatment planning system software featuring a full TG- 43 dose calculation algorithm (PLATO BPS version 14. 2. 4). It is found {{that the presence of}} patient inhomogeneities does not alter the delivery of the planned dose distribution to the planning treatment volume. Regarding the organs at risk, the common practice of current treatment planning systems (TPSs) to consider the patient geometry as a homogeneous water medium leads to a dose overestimation of up to 13 % to the spinal cord and an underestimation of up to 15 % to the sternum bone. These findings which correspond to the dose region of about 5 - 10 % of the prescribed dose could only be of significance when brachytherapy is used as a boost to external beam therapy. Additionally, an analytical dosimetry model, which is efficient in calculating dose in mathematical phantoms containing inhomogeneity shells of materials of radiobiological interest, is utilized for dosimetry in the patient-equivalent inhomogeneous phantom geometry. Analytical calculations in this work are in good agreement with corresponding Monte Carlo results within the bone inhomogeneities of spinal cord and sternum bone but, like treatment planning system calculations, the model fails to predict the dose distribution in the proximal lung surface as well as within the lungs just as the TPS does, due to its inherent limitation in treating lateral scatter and backscatter radiation. © 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the water and}} tissue equivalence of a new PRESAGE® 3 D dosimeter for proton therapy. Methods: The GEANT 4 software toolkit was used to calculate and compare total dose delivered by a proton beam with mean energy 62 MeV in a PRESAGE® dosimeter, water, and soft tissue. The dose delivered by primary protons and secondary particles was calculated. Depth-dose profiles and <b>isodose</b> <b>contours</b> of deposited energy were compared for the materials of interest. Results: The proton beam range {{was found to be}} ≈ 27 mm for PRESAGE®, 29. 9 mm for soft tissue, and 30. 5 mm for water. This {{can be attributed to the}} lower collisional stopping power of water compared to soft tissue and PRESAGE®. The difference between total dose delivered in PRESAGE® and total dose delivered in water or tissue is less than 2 % across the entire water/tissue equivalent range of the proton beam. The largest difference between total dose in PRESAGE® and total dose in water is 1. 4 %, while for soft tissue it is 1. 8 %. In both cases, this occurs at the distal end of the beam. Nevertheless, the authors find that PRESAGE® dosimeter is overall more tissue-equivalent than water-equivalent before the Bragg peak. After the Bragg peak, the differences in the depth doses are found to be due to differences in primary proton energy deposition; PRESAGE® and soft tissue stop protons more rapidly than water. The dose delivered by secondary electrons in the PRESAGE® differs by less than 1 % from that in soft tissue and water. The contribution of secondary particles to the total dose is less than 4 % for electrons and ≈ 1 % for protons in all the materials of interest. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the new PRESAGE® formula may be considered both a tissue- and water-equivalent 3 D dosimeter for a 62 MeV proton beam. The results further suggest that tissue-equivalent thickness may provide better dosimetric and geometric accuracy than water-equivalent thickness for 3 D dosimetry of this proton beam. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a method for}} quality control of stereotactic radiosurgery with Leksell Gamma Knife model C®. The Leksell Gamma Knife utilizes 201 intersecting 60 Co beams and four helmets with different size collimators to form four standard clinical beam sizes of 18, 14, 8 and 4 mm nominal diameter and a total geometrical accuracy in dose delivery {{of the order of}} 0. 5 mm (Leksell Gamma Unit User’s Manual Vol. 2). Quality assurance checks were made for every step of the entire planning and treatment procedure, including mechanical accuracy, precise dose delivery, Automatic Positioning System (APS) accuracy, as well as imaging and target localization accuracy, in order to guarantee a high quality standard. The polymer gel (Vipar and Pabig) - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dosimetry method is being used due to its inherent three-dimensional feature and linear dose response over the range of gamma knife applications. Percentage relative dose results are presented not only in the form of one dimensional profiles but also planar isocontours and isosurfaces in three dimensions. Experimental results are compared with corresponding Gammaplan treatment planning system calculations as well as radiochromic film measurements. A good agreement, within the experimental uncertainty, has been observed between measured and expected dose distributions. Accuracy of the experimental data depends on the scanning resolution in MRI. Pituitary adenoma treatment by using four 8 mm and one 14 mm collimator helmet shots delivers to the 50 % isodose line, a prescription dose of 15 Gy (30 Gy maximum dose) to the target. The comparison of experimental and theoretical data in terms of percentage <b>isodose</b> <b>contours</b> on axial, coronal and sagittal planes, as well as 3 D plan evaluation criteria such as dose-volume histograms for the target volume, target coverage and conformity indices, were in good argument. The multiple metastasis treatment plan includes planning system calculations in different dose matrices which are be combined in the final stage of the calculations. The accuracy of APS, maximum dose and increased intra-target distances has been verified. Measured dose distributions were found to agree with corresponding treatment planning calculations, besides statistical fluctuation of experimental results. On average, distance to agreement between experimental and calculated dose distributions was satisfied within the experimental uncertainty of the order of one pixel in the MRI gel readout session (< 1 mm). The measured and calculated DVH results were in good agreement. ...|$|R
40|$|Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a biochemically {{targeted}} form of binary {{radiation therapy}} {{that has the}} potential to deliver radiation to cancers with cellular dose selectivity. Accurate and efficient treatment planning calculations are essential to maximizing the efficacy of BNCT and ensuring patient safety. This thesis investigates computational aspects of BNCT treatment planning with the aim of improving both the accuracy and efficiency of the planning process as well as developing a better understanding of differences in computational dosimetry that exist between the different BNCT clinical sites around the world. A suite of computational dosimetry reference problems were developed as a basis for comprehensively testing, comparing, and analyzing current and future BNCT treatment planning systems (TPSs) under conditions relevant to both patient planning and planning system calibration. Using these reference problems, four of the TPSs that have been used in clinical BNCT (MacNCTPlan, NCTPlan, BNCTRtpe, and SERA) were compared to reference calculations performed with the well-benchmarked Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP 5. The comparison of multidimensional dose data in the form of dose profiles, <b>isodose</b> <b>contours,</b> dose difference distributions and dose-volume histograms yielded many clinically significant differences. Additional calculations were performed to further investigate and explain significant deviations from the reference calculations. (cont.) A combined 81 brain tumor patients have been treated in dose escalation trials of Neutron Capture Therapy (NCT) in the USA at Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Pooling the clinical data from these and other trials will allow the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of NCT with more statistical rigor. However, differences in physical and computational dosimetry between the institutions that make a direct comparison of the clinical dosimetry difficult must first be addressed before clinical data can be compared. This study involves normalizing the BNL clinical dosimetry to that of Harvard-MIT for combined NCT dose response analysis using analysis of MIT measurements and calculations with the BNL treatment planning system (TPS), BNCTRtpe, for two different phantoms. The BNL TPS was calibrated to dose measurements made by MIT at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) in the BNL calibration phantom, a Lucite cube, and then validated by MIT dose measurements at the BMRR in an ellipsoidal water phantom. Using the newly determined TPS calibration, treatment plans for all BNL patients were recomputed, yielding reductions in reported mean brain doses of 10 % on average in the initial 15 patients treated with the 8 cm collimator and 27 % in the latter 38 patients treated with a 12 cm collimator. These reductions in reported doses have clinically significant implications for those relying on reported BNL doses as a basis for initial dose selection in clinical studies and reaffirm the importance of collaborative dosimetric comparisons within the NCT community. (cont.) The dosimetric adjustments allowed the BNL clinical data to be legitimately combined with the Harvard-MIT clinical data for a combined dose response analysis of the incidence of radiation-induced somnolence syndrome. Probit analysis of the composite data set for the incidence of somnolence yielded ED 5 o values of 5. 76 Gyw and 14. 4 Gy, for mean and maximum brain dose. The applicability and optimization of variance reduction techniques for BNCT Monte Carlo treatment planning calculations were investigated using MCNP 5. The preexisting variance reduction scheme in the Monte Carlo model of the fission converter beam (FCB) at MIT was optimized, resulting in improved energy-dependent neutron and photon weight windows. Using these weight windows, a more precise surface source representation of the FCB was produced downstream at the patient position with improved statistical properties that increased the mean efficiency of in-phantom dose calculations by a factor of 9. The variance reduction techniques available in MCNP were also explored as a means of increasing the efficiency of dose calculations in the patient model. By disabling implicit neutron capture and using fast neutron source biasing and photon production biasing techniques, the mean efficiency of dose calculations was improved by a factor of 2. 2. Constructing an accurate description of a neutron beam is critical to achieving accurate calculations of dose in NCT treatment planning. (cont.) This study compares two methods of neutron beam source definition commonly used in BNCT treatment planning calculations, the phase space file (MCNP surface source file) and source variable probability distributions (MCNP SDef). To facilitate the comparison, a novel software tool was developed to analyze MCNP surface source files and construct MCNP SDef representations. This tool was applied to the MIT FCB, which has a well-validated Monte Carlo model. Each source type (surface source file and SDef) was used to simulate transport of the beam through voxel models of the modified Snyder head phantom, where doses were calculated. Compared to the surface source file, the initial dose calculations with the SDef produced significant errors of ~ 15 %. Using a patched version of MCNP that allowed the observed radial dependence of the relative azimuthal angle to be modeled in the SDef, errors in all dose components in the head phantom at Dmax were reduced to acceptably small levels with none being statistically significant except for the induced photon error of 0. 5 %. Errors in the calculated doses introduced by sampling the azimuthal component of particle direction uniformly in the SDef vary spatially, are phantom-dependent, and thus cannot be accurately corrected by a simple scaling of doses. by James Raymond Albritton.
