Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut {{for the rich and}} a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E
5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out {{of a desire to}} keep them out of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> had belonged to their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E

The 'Crowd' ad emphasizes that things designed to draw a crowd are good, but leaving the crowd behind is more rewarding. The 'Color Shift' ad shows it's more fun and exciting to blend out than blend in. The Two additional ads (This is Your Move, Intense) were created by Lexus' multicultural agency, Walton Isaacson, {{as part of the}} campaign. 'This is Your Move' was geared to the African-American audience, features Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp as he searches <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> matches his ambitious and driven personality. 'Intense' is targeted to the Hispanic audience and follows a young couple as they experience the thrills of driving the redesigned IS 250.|$|E

Stunt driver Johnathon Kralt found that the prop [...] "handles the roads extremely well <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> size and that height", and the four-wheel steering was an advantage for drifting.

500|$|Burshtein found {{creating}} a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron {{to be one}} of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film. One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors never touched while filming. She explained, [...] "That's how we see the enigma—the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining is the power. The passion cannot exist if you have it all the time—the passion is only <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> you don't have. You have to work to keep the passion. Judaism is all about that." [...] Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian Lawrence Norfolk {{commented that}} Sarah is a [...] "far from perfect heroine: a semi-neglectful mother and unfaithful wife", but noted that [...] "Cleave does not mock Sarah (and life in Kingston upon Thames) {{any more than}} he does Little Bee and her {{experiences}} in Nigeria." [...] Norfolk felt that: [...] "For all the characters' faults, none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we are intended to disbelieve. On the disparity in sympathy for Sarah and Little Bee, Cleave assessed: [...] "Sarah inevitably suffers by proximity to Little Bee, who is much easier to like. If Sarah is more twisted, I think it's because her path through life has necessarily been more convoluted. Little Bee's life is extremely harrowing but it is also very simple – she is swimming very hard against the current, struggling to survive and not to be swept away. Sarah doesn’t have the luxury of knowing in which direction she should swim." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Spins March Hogan wrote, [...] "'Some of us {{just like}} to read', she sings, and hey, that {{includes}} us. But it's easier to clap <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> moves or touches you, rather than serves as an advertisement for Gaga as incomprehensible high-end brand." [...] Consequence of Sound wrote in their review, [...] "Gaga's head appears on a black swan and she boogies down in a clam bikini. If this doesn't bump up her sales, I no longer believe in art." [...] Hilary Hughes of Esquire said that the video [...] "hits all the marks of Gaga-esque eccentricity: glitter, boob grabs, weird animals, space, severed limbs, devotional imagery, nudity, neon, etc. It just doesn't redefine those marks, as previous music videos of Gaga's— namely [...] "Bad Romance," [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and [...] "Judas"— have". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that Gaga was parodying herself with the video and suggested that her aim was [...] "to make a video both celebrating and poking fun at her career thus far."

500|$|While the {{character}} artwork for Mighty Jill Off {{was created by}} James Harvey, Anthropy first designed Jill in sprite form. Harvey was initially wary of doing work that was BDSM-themed; he {{felt that it was}} easy <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is both cartoony and sexual to make viewers feel uncomfortable and used the Japanese harem anime genre as an example. He added that in humorous, sexually-oriented cartoons, there is a [...] "fine line" [...] between [...] "cute and funny" [...] and [...] "repulsive". He wanted to design the relationship between the Queen and Jill in a way that people in the BDSM community could identify with it, while also avoiding putting people off who were not into BDSM. He used European comics as a model for his art work, which he admired for the [...] "permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons". He also cited as inspiration specific Japanese cartoonists who he felt had successfully portrayed sex in animation such as Monkey Punch, the creator of Lupin III.|$|E

500|$|The band {{feared that}} {{following}} the overt rock of the War album and tour, {{they were in}} danger of becoming another [...] "shrill", [...] "sloganeering arena-rock band". The group were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to the Who and Led Zeppelin, but according to Bono: [...] "something just didn't feel right. We felt we had more dimension than just the next big anything, we had something unique to offer." [...] Thus, they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, The Unforgettable Fire. Clayton said, [...] "We were looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was a bit more serious, more arty." [...] The Edge admired the ambient and [...] "weird works" [...] of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record.

Show creator David Crane considered the Thanksgiving-themed episode as the [...] "hallmark show" [...] in each season. Marta Kauffman added dialogue centering on six characters being together in a room made the holiday special work. When discussing story ideas, the writers decided to create [...] "a bunch of little pieces", until someone suggested [...] "what if it's the worst Thanksgivings?", later used as the hook. Working on a flashback meant the episode needed [...] "to have meaning" [...] as the story continues in the present. It was difficult to keep the characters, particularly Chandler, spontaneously mad <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> happened [...] "years ago".

500|$|The {{day after}} al-Sharif's arrest, another woman was {{detained}} for driving a car.

In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days. On 26 May, authorities said that al-Sharif would remain in detention until 5 June 2011, according to Waleed Abu Al-Khair. Al-Sharif was conditionally freed on 30 May. Her lawyer Adnan al-Saleh said that she had been charged with [...] "inciting women to drive" [...] and [...] "rallying public opinion". The conditions of Al-Sharif's release include bail, returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media. As possible reasons for al-Sharif's early release, The National cited al-Sharif having written a letter to King Abdullah, 4,500 Saudis signing an online petition to the King, and [...] "an outpouring of indignation and disbelief by both Saudis and critics abroad that Ms al-Sharif was jailed <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is not a moral or criminal offence." ...|$|E
