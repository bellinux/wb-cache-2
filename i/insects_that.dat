5|$|Insectivorous insects, or <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> feed {{on other}} insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> could cause damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs feed on aphids, {{and can be}} used as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E
5|$|Only <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true {{capacity for}} fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow an insect to return unerringly {{to a single}} hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E

5|$|Beetles are a {{group of}} <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> form the order Coleoptera, in the {{superorder}} Endopterygota. Their front pair of wings is hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all families, the Curculionidae (weevils) with some 70,000 member species, belongs to this order. They are found in almost every habitat except {{the sea and the}} polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> damage crops.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> {{hold their}} wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated {{on the sides of}} the head.|$|E
5|$|Immature <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> {{go through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis are called nymphs {{or in the}} case of dragonflies and damselflies, also naiads. Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings, which are not developed until adulthood. With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects.|$|E

Two different power-ups briefly illuminate the screen and clear all bugs onscreen. Later levels feature larger <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> contain bombs and small, fast bugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E
5|$|The Linyphiidae {{generally}} make horizontal but uneven sheets, with tangles {{of stopping}} threads above. <b>Insects</b> <b>that</b> hit the stopping threads fall onto the sheet or are shaken onto {{it by the}} spider, and are held by sticky threads on the sheet until the spider can attack from below.|$|E

5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects in the same area, for example flat horizontal webs trap <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in horizontal flight. Web-building spiders have poor vision, but are extremely sensitive to vibrations.|$|E
5|$|Transgenic crops {{have been}} made to express dsRNA, {{carefully}} chosen to silence crucial genes in target pests. These dsRNAs are designed to affect only <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> express specific gene sequences. As a proof of principle, in 2009 a study showed RNAs that could kill any one of four fruit fly species while not harming the other three.|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E

5|$|Mantises are {{an order}} (Mantodea) of <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> {{contains}} over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest {{family is the}} Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies {{may or may not}} have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bumblebees}} {{are social}} <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> form colonies {{with a single}} queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. Cuckoo bumblebees do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.|$|E
5|$|Since the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{believed that}} cockroaches were an ancient group of <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> had a Devonian origin, {{according to one}} hypothesis. Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in having long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises, as well as modern blattodeans. As the body, hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently, the relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroaches remains disputed. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appeared in the early Cretaceous. A recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroaches originated {{at least in the}} Jurassic.|$|E

5|$|Specialist ambush predators of {{visitors}} to flowers include crab spiders, which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects; predatory bugs, and praying mantises, {{some of which}} (the flower mantises of the tropics) wait motionless, aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers. Beewolves are large wasps that habitually attack bees; the ethologist Niko Tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf Philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybees in a day: all the prey he observed were honeybees. Other predatory <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the pygmy slow loris is seasonal. In north Vietnam, for example, {{the winter}} is {{characterized}} by low rainfalls and temperatures as low as , when there is little growth of vegetation in forests, few insects, and limited food resources. The pygmy slow loris will also consume <b>insects</b> <b>that</b> have been exposed by its bamboo-gouging activities. It will use its toothcomb to clean an area of lichens and fungi prior to gouging. The animals conserve energy in the colder winter months by reducing movement, often {{to the point of}} complete inactivity.|$|E
5|$|The egg {{parasite}} Trichogramma {{is frequently}} released inundatively to control harmful moths.
