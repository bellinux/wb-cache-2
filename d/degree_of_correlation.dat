2500|$|Formally, random {{variables}} are dependent {{if they do}} not satisfy a mathematical property of probabilistic independence. [...] In informal parlance, correlation is synonymous with dependence. However, when used in a technical sense, correlation refers to any of several specific types of relationship between mean values. [...] There are several correlation coefficients, often denoted ' or r, measuring the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>correlation.</b> [...] The most common of these is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may be present even when one variable is a nonlinear function of the other). [...] Other correlation coefficients have been developed to be more robust than the Pearson correlation– that is, more sensitive to nonlinear relationships. Mutual information can also be applied to measure dependence between two variables.|$|E
60|$|We may suppose--though this is doubtful--that {{there are}} laws of {{correlation}} of the mental and the physical, in virtue of which, {{given the state of}} all the matter in the world, and therefore of all the brains and living organisms, the state of all the minds in the world could be inferred, while conversely the state of all the matter in the world could be inferred if the state of all the minds were given. It is obvious that there is some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>correlation</b> between brain and mind, and it is impossible to say how complete it may be. This, however, is not the point which I wish to elicit. What I wish to urge is that, even if we admit the most extreme claims of determinism and of correlation of mind and brain, still the consequences inimical to what is worth preserving in free will do not follow. The belief that they follow results, I think, entirely from the assimilation of causes to volitions, and from the notion that causes compel their effects in some sense analogous to that in which a human authority can compel a man to do what he would rather not do. This assimilation, as soon as the true nature of scientific causal laws is realised, is seen to be a sheer mistake. But this brings us to the second of the two questions which we raised in regard to free will, namely, whether, assuming determinism, our actions can be in any proper sense regarded as compelled by outside forces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Modeling and {{understanding}} the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>correlations</b> between brain structures is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Correlated anatomic measures may arise from common genetic and trophic influences across brain regions, and may be overlooked if structures are modeled independently. Here, we propose a new method to analyze structural brain correlations based on a large set of cortical sulcal landmarks (72 per brain) delineated in 98 healthy subjects (age: 51. 8 +/- 6. 2 years). First, we evaluate the correlation between any pair of sulcal positions via the total covariance matrix, a 6 × 6 symmetric positive-definite matrix. Second, we perform canonical correlation analysis to measure the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>correlations</b> between any two positions, and derive from it a p-value map for significance testing. We present maps of both local and longrange <b>correlations,</b> including maps <b>of</b> covariation between corresponding structures in opposite hemispheres, which show different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> hemispheric specialization. ...|$|R

40|$|Resource {{diffusion}} is an ubiquitous phenomenon, {{but how it}} impacts epidemic spreading {{has received}} little study. We propose a model that couples epidemic spreading and resource diffusion in multiplex networks. The spread of disease in a physical contact layer and {{the recovery of the}} infected nodes are both strongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social layer. The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in turn strongly dependent upon the state of the nodes in the physical contact layer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly in this model. To quantify the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls the resource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that the preferential resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the fraction of infected nodes. When the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> interlayer <b>correlation</b> is below a critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes the phase transition from double continuous to single continuous. When the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> interlayer <b>correlation</b> is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from multiple continuous to first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find hysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also find that there is an optimal resource strategy at each fixed <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> interlayer <b>correlation</b> where the threshold reaches a maximum and under which the disease can be maximally suppressed. In addition, the optimal controlling parameter increases as the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> inter-layer <b>correlation</b> increases. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
