5|$|Jones {{made the}} Pro Bowl again in 1952, {{when he had}} 952 total yards and six touchdowns. Cleveland {{advanced}} to the NFL championship {{for the third time}} in a row that year, losing 17–7 to the Detroit Lions. In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns, and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for two more years, winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season, an injury that caused him to miss several games and bothered him all season.|$|E
5|$|Lawless {{signed for}} Forest Green's Conference Premier rivals York City on a one-year {{contract}} on 17 June 2009, despite there being two Football League clubs looking to sign him. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United on 8 August 2009. After suffering from a virus {{he was forced to}} miss a game against Cambridge United in September 2009, and he recovered ahead of York's game against Kidderminster. He scored his first goal for York with the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Gateshead on 24 November 2009. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> hamstring in a 1–0 defeat to Eastbourne on 27 February 2010 and made his return as a 64th-minute substitute in a 4–0 victory at Grays Athletic on 30 March. He played in both legs of York's play-off semi-final victory over Luton Town, which finished 2–0 on aggregate. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, which York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished the season with 45 appearances and one goal for York.|$|E
5|$|By mid-summer, the {{situation}} looked grim for the Coalition: Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east-northeast despite Charles' orders to unite with him. It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would outmaneuver Charles by driving {{a wedge between}} his force and that of Wartensleben. At Neresheim on 11 August, Moreau crushed Charles' force, forcing him to withdraw further east. At last, however, with this loss, Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction, moving his corps to join at Charles' northern flank. At Amberg on 24 August, Charles inflicted a defeat on the French, yet that same day, his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg. Regardless, the tide had turned in the Coalition's favor. Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines, moving far into the German states, and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security. The Coalition's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau, similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben. As the French withdrew toward the Rhine, Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward. On 3 September at Würzburg, Jourdan attempted to halt his retreat. Once Moreau received word of the French defeat, he had to withdraw from southern Germany. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> troops back through the Black Forest, with Ferino supervising the rear guard. The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4,000 men taken as prisoners, some standards and artillery, after which Latour followed at a more prudent distance.|$|E

5|$|The {{summer and}} fall {{included}} various conflicts throughout the southern territories of the German states as the armies of the Coalition and the armies of the Directory sought to flank each other. By mid-summer, the situation looked grim for the Coalition: Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east-northeast despite Charles' orders to unite with him. It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would succeed in flanking Charles or driving a wedge between his force and that of Wartensleben. At Neresheim on 11 August, Moreau crushed Charles' force, forcing him to withdraw further east. At last, however, Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction, moving his corps to join at Charles' northern flank. At Amberg on 24 August, Charles inflicted a defeat on the French; that same day, his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg. Regardless, the tide had turned in the Coalition's favor.

The Coalition's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau, similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben. As the French withdrew toward the Rhine, Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward. On 3 September at Würzburg, Jourdan attempted unsuccessfully to halt the retreat; subsequently at the Battle of Limburg, Charles pushed {{him back to the}} Rhine. Once Moreau received word of this defeat, he had to withdraw from southern Germany. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> troops back through the Black Forest, with Ferino supervising the rear guard. The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4,000 prisoners, some standards and artillery, and Latour followed at a more sensible distance. The two armies clashed again at Emmendingen, where Wartensleben was mortally wounded in the Coalition victory. After Emmendingen, the French withdrew to the south and west, and formed for battle by Schliengen.|$|E
25|$|Chard {{realised}} {{that the}} north wall, under near constant Zulu attack, could not be held. At 6:00 pm, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> men back into the yard, abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process. The hospital was becoming untenable; as the loopholes had become a liability: rifles poking out were grabbed at by the Zulus, yet if the holes were left empty, the Zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms. Among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were Corporal William Wilson Allen and Privates Cole, Dunbar, Hitch, Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams, Alfred Henry Hook, Robert Jones, and William Jones.|$|E
25|$|This {{success was}} {{tempered}} by a difficult {{period in the}} mid 80s after Grappelli suffered a heart attack. Although he made a full recovery, it was some time before he could tour again. Taylor {{found it difficult to}} replace the Grappelli gig with other work, and fell into a period of financial hardship, selling his guitars to survive. He became disenchanted with music, and virtually didn't touch guitar for almost a year. He finally agreed on a price for his one remaining guitar, a gift from mentor Isaacs, but, on the way to close the deal <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> car over to allow himself a final play of the instrument and suddenly found his passion for playing re-ignited. He called off the deal, and this was a catalyst in the next stage of his career.|$|E

25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told him that if <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith {{was able to take}} the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
500|$|For {{almost a}} month <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> sledge across the Antarctic, {{crossing}} the second glacier, despite an illness that increasingly weakened him. Mawson reached the comparative safety of Aladdin's Cave—a food depot [...] from the main base—on 1 February 1913, only to be trapped there for a week while a blizzard raged outside. As a result, he missed the ship back to Australia; the SY Aurora had sailed on 8 February, just hours before his return to Cape Denison, after waiting {{for more than three}} weeks. With a relief party, Mawson remained at Cape Denison until the Aurora returned the following summer in December 1913.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{following}} season started, Symes was loaned out to Macclesfield Town for six months, but in July he suffered an ankle injury keeping him out until September. He never played for Macclesfield meaning his action in 2005 {{was limited to}} just 35 minutes on New Year's Day. Instead he joined Stockport County in another loan deal in January 2006, where he made his one and only appearance in a 1–1 draw with Torquay United on 31 January 2006. He returned to Bradford and played another three games, scoring in a 1–1 draw with Brentford on 8 April 2006. However his season again ended early when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> hamstring during the draw with Brentford. Symes later admitted [...] "it never happened" [...] for him at City and that his confidence was shattered by manager Colin Todd.|$|E

The kids find it very funny and encourage him to tighten his tie even more, and Stephen does so, which makes him choke the more tighter <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> tie, until <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> tie so tight that it rips in half.

500|$|Expecting the Japanese {{to attack}} again that night, Edson {{directed}} his troops {{to improve their}} defenses on and around the ridge. After a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to Kokusho the night before, Edson repositioned his forces. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> front back about [...] to a line that stretched , starting at the Lunga River and crossing the ridge about [...] south of Hill 123. Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies. Any Japanese attackers surmounting Hill 80 would have to advance over [...] of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123. With {{only a few hours}} to prepare, the Marines were able to construct only rudimentary and shallow fortifications. They were low on ammunition, with one or two grenades for each Marine. Vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (2/5) to move into a position just to the rear of Edson's troops. [...] In addition, a battery of four 105mm howitzers from the 3rd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment under Lieutenant colonel James J. Keating moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge, and a forward artillery observer was placed with Edson's front line units.|$|E
500|$|Having {{been drawn}} to face Gillingham {{in the first round}} of the League Cup, the club's manager, Paul Sturrock, planned to make a couple of changes to the team that faced Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new season, with youngster Joe Mason {{included}} in the squad. Two first-half goals were enough to take the hosts into the second round. Simeon Jackson put Gillingham ahead after 42 minutes and Andy Barcham scored a second just before the half-time break. Argyle reduced the deficit four minutes into the second-half when Luke Summerfield from a direct free kick, but they couldn't find an equaliser. The visitors should have forced extra time but Jamie Mackie spurned a chance when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat. The defeat extended Sturrock's unfortunate run in the League Cup as a manager, having won just once in nine attempts. [...] "I must have the worst record of all managers in cup competitions, it's unbelievable," [...] he said. [...] "One or two of my defenders didn't defend properly tonight. It's not proper to name people but there were some glaring attempts to clear the ball and that's where we had problems." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on December 5, 1990, {{and it was}} filmed on December 11. Filming took place at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where all filming for the second season took place. As only one {{location}} was used, it took roughly half {{of the time it}} usually took for an episode to be filmed. Cast members have remarked that the filming was shorter than on any other episode. A few changes were made; in the first draft of the script, George, Jerry, and Elaine entered the restaurant talking about their least favorite holiday. In the version that aired, they talk about combining the jobs of policemen and garbagemen into a single job. In the original draft, the three friends also discussed how to spend the long waiting period in the future, with George suggesting they bring a deck of cards and that Jerry bring a jigsaw puzzle with nothing but penguins. One scene was cut before broadcast, featuring George explaining to Jerry that <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> hamstring while trying to untuck the covers of a hotel bed during his recent stay in Boston. George can be seen grabbing his hamstring as he walks to the phone. The scene was later included on the Seinfeld seasons one and two DVD boxset.|$|E

For his part, Marceau prepared to resist, but to his right, General Jean Castelbert de Castelverd, positioned between Diez and the Rhine, feared an Austrian breakthrough at Limburg would leave him trapped {{with his back to}} the Rhine; he panicked and withdrew his troops to Montabauer. This exposed Marceau's right wing, so <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>his</b> troops back to Molsberg. Marceau's retreat subsequently exposed the French center, which also was forced to withdraw; by the end of 17 September, the entire French line had unraveled.|$|E
