40|$|Hercules' clean {{propellant}} development {{research is}} exploring three major types of clean propellant: (1) chloride-free formulations (no chlorine containing ingredients), being developed on the Clean Propellant Development and Demonstration (CPDD) contract sponsored by Phillips Laboratory, Edwards Air Force Base, CA; (2) low HCl scavenged formulations (HCl-scavenger added to propellant oxidized with ammonium perchlorate (AP)); and (3) low HCl formulations oxidized {{with a combination}} of AN and AP (with or without an HCl scavenger) to provide a significant reduction (relative to current solid rocket boosters) in exhaust HCl. These propellants provide performance approaching that of current systems, with less than 2 percent HCl in the exhaust, a significant reduction (greater than or equal to 70 percent) in exhaust HCl levels. Excellent processing, safety, and mechanical properties were achieved using only readily available, low cost ingredients. Two formulations, a sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) scavenged HTPB and a chloride-free <b>hydroxy</b> <b>terminated</b> <b>polyether</b> (<b>HTPE)</b> propellant, were characterized for ballistic, mechanical, and rheological properties. In addition, the hazards properties were demonstrated to provide two families of class 1. 3, 'zero-card' propellants. Further characterization is planned which includes demonstration of ballistic tailorability in subscale (one to 70 pound) motors over the range of burn rates required for retrofit into current Hercules space booster designs (Titan 4 SRMU and Delta 2 GEM) ...|$|E

The synthesis of a random copolymer of ethylene oxide (EO) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was carried out through cationic bulk polymerisation. HTPE copolymers with different EO/THF group ratios and different molecular weights were synthesized and characterised by a range of techniques. HTPE binder network samples were prepared with and without plasticizer and cured using different NCO:OH equivalence ratios. Desmodur N- 3200 was used as a curing agent and n-BuNENA as an energetic plasticizer. The thermal decomposition of the HTPE binder network samples were studied by heating the materials at a rate of 6 oC per hour and periodically removing them from the oven for surface examination using interferometric surface measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microphotography. Their thermal decomposition behaviour was investigated by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) Spectroscopy.

HTPE propellants have similar mechanical properties to HTPB propellants but they give a less severe response in ‘slow cook-off’ tests for IM compliance. A literature review is presented on the development and properties of HTPE propellants {{in an attempt to}} place them in relation to recent trends in Insensitive Munitions. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the behaviour of HTPE propellants an HTPE pre-polymer and a range of binder network samples with different NCO/OH equivalence ratios, with and without plasticizer, have been synthesised and characterised by a range of techniques. The thermal decomposition of the HTPE binder network and propellant samples were also studied. Desmodur N- 3200 was used as a curing agent and n-BuNENA as an energetic plasticizer. Similar analyses were performed on analogous HTPB pre-polymer and binder network samples and the results were compared with those obtained for the corresponding HTPE samples. Two kinds of HTPE propellant were manufactured containing HTPE pre-polymer, n-BuNENA, 2 NDPA and either AP or AP+PSAN as oxidiser. Also HTPB propellant was prepared. Small cook-off test vehicles (SCTV) were filled with HTPE and HTPB propellants and slow cook-off tests were performed. In contrast to HTPB binders, which become harder during slow heating, it was found that the HTPE binders soften under the same conditions. This behaviour is possibly due to chain scission of the soft and hard segments of the HTPE polymer matrix. Thermooxidative processes and reactions of the energetic plasticizer decomposition products are believed to be the responsible for the scission of the polymeric matrix. From the binder characterisation and slow cook-off results it is concluded that there is a relation between the degree of polymeric matrix scission during slow heating and the violence of the response at the point of self ignition. This underlies the main difference between HTPB and HTPE propellants in slow cook-off. While HTPB compositions become harder and more brittle, HTPE propellants become softer and have a lower surface area at the self ignition point.

DSC and DMTA results revealed that these newlysynthesized PUs exhibit the glass transition temperatures of the soft and hard segments. DMTA, SEM and AFM results confirmed existence of microphase separated morphology. The results obtained in this work indicate that PU networks based on HBP and PDMS have improved surface and thermomechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the crystallization behaviour of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was undertaken. Determination of the equilibrium melting temperature showed a six degree difference between the equilibrium melting of a <b>hydroxy</b> <b>terminated</b> polymer (PDMS-OH, Tmo = 266 K, M w = 92. 9 kg mol- 1) over that of a trimethylsilyl terminated polymer (PDMS-CH 3, Tmo = 260 K, Mw = 100 kg mol- 1). The inherent flexibility of the Si-O linkage of these polymers caused crystallization to be first detected at Tmo - 35 K, and was recorded down to 177 K, i. e., Tg + 30 K. Both systems followed well behaved regime III surface nucleation kinetics. The average fold interfacial surface free energy, sigmae, was calculated to be 17. 6 erg cm - 2 and resulted in a very low value for the work of chain folding, q, calculated to be 14. 6 kJ mol- 1. This is in accord with the small rotational barrier of the siloxane backbone. In addition, PDMS-OH crystallized with slower kinetics than PDMS-CH 3, verified by chemical conversion from the hydroxy to trimethylsilyl end group. The first reported detection of two different PDMS solid state morphologies is presented. A small population of very low birefringent (Deltan) spherulites was observed to nucleate simultaneously with a majority of bright positive Deltan spherulites throughout the accessible crystallization temperature range. The sign of Deltan of these darker spherulites varied with growth, and this growth rate was depressed from that of the bright spherulites. Calorimetric annealing experiments indicate that the PDMS system attains very high percent crystallinities very early after nucleation. Coupled with the results of small angle laser light scattering (SALLS) during slow (1 deg/min) melting, secondary crystallization processes were observed to be non-negligible very soon after primary crystallization. SALLS of the crystallizing PDMS system was sensitive to the concurrent effects of (i) the presence of dark spherulites, (ii) secondary crystallization, and (iii) the distribution of spherulite sizes. These combined effects generated significant non-ideality within V v and Hv scattering envelopes. The effects of (i) and (ii) caused both the Vv pattern to remain circularly symmetric throughout the entire crystallization timeframe, and the 4 -leaf clover pattern of the Hv mode scattering to contain multiple intensity maxima not restricted to an azimuthal angle of 45 °. The effect of (iii) was to lower the calculated SALLS average radial growth rate relative to that observed optically...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{hydrogen}} bonding, phase segregation, and hard segment organization is studied {{in a series}} of segmented polyurethanes based on <b>hydroxy</b> <b>terminated</b> polybutadiene (HTPBD) soft segments and hard segments consisting of either 2, 4 - or 2, 6 -toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and 1, 4 -butanediol (BDL). The existence of two phase morphology is deduced from dynamic mechanical relaxation and thermal analysis. All polymers exhibit a soft segment glass transition very close to Tg of free HTPBD homopolymer and independent of hard segment structure and concentration. The high temperature transitions, corresponding to the glass transition in 2, 4 -TDI polymers and melting in the 2, 6 -TDI polymers are strongly dependent upon hard segment concentration and average hard segment length. Thermal history is found to have negligible effect on the position of the soft segment glass transition and, therefore, in the degree of phase segregation for all materials studied. The time-dependence in dynamic mechanical and thermal properties is related to physical changes within the hard segment domains, independent of the soft segment matrix. ^ An analysis of hydrogen bonding in a selection of HTPBD polyurethanes and model compounds based on 2, 4 - and 2, 6 -TDI and p,p 2 ̆ 7 -diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and BDL hard segments is made using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Changes in the frequency, half-width and intensity of the bonded N-H absorption band resulting from thermal treatment are correlated to structural changes as evidenced by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); variations in behavior are related to differences in packing and the ability and ease at which crystallization and reorganization of the hard segment repeat unit occurs. Resolution of the N-H band into its hydrogen bonded and non-bonded components indicates 80 to 90 percent of the N-H groups are hydrogen bonded at room temperature. Since hydrogen bonded interactions are limited to the hard segment components in PBD-containing polyurethanes, the results provide a quantitative measure of the extent of microphase segregation. Temperature-dependent studies indicate that the onset temperature for hydrogen bond dissociation occurs at 25 to 75 (DEGREES) C in the 2, 4 -TDI polymers and at about 130 (DEGREES) C in the 2, 6 -TDI polymers, close to the transition temperatures for the amorphous and crystalline domain structure, respectively. Heat of dissociation is about 4 kcal/mole for the former series and 7 - 8 kcal/mole for the latter. Overall, the results indicate that the thermal behavior of hydrogen bonding is sensitive to structure organization and correlate well with other properties studied via calorimetry and dynamic mechanical relaxation. ...|$|R

Organic-inorganic hybrids were prepared {{by using the}} sol-gel process {{in the presence of}} tetraethoxysilane and <b>hydroxy</b> or triethoxysilane <b>terminated</b> PCL-PFPE-PCL. Fully transparent hybrid materials with high content of organic matter were obtained only in the case of alkoxysilane functionalised copolymers. For such systems the PCL-PFPE-PCL copolymer was so intimately mixed with the inorganic network to prevent crystallisation of the PCL segments, The progress of the sol-gel reaction was limited by the early vetrification of the reactive system, while the interpenetration of the organic phase was enhanced by curing the samples at 100 degreesC.
