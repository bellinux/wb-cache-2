500|$|Death is an <b>irremediable</b> {{harm that}} is dealt with {{particularly}} seriously in English law. For example, {{the crime of}} [...] murder uniquely carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, regardless {{of the degree to}} which the defendant is morally culpable provided they are legally culpable. To use another example: causing injury by dangerous driving carries a maximum sentence of two years, whereas causing death by dangerous driving carries one of fourteen years.|$|E
500|$|The {{years from}} 1801 to 1804 are {{something}} of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located {{in the area where}} the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that [...] "having written so much {{on one side of the}} question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had [...] "had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love". A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that [...] "the worse and most <b>irremediable</b> of all evils, a connection for life" [...] with an unsuitable man.|$|E

Are the Germans {{fighting}} for a better future, or for the narthex of barbarity and {{for the death of}} Europe? This is yet another pathetic scrutiny! Christian peoples turn their backs on The Calvary, disavow the laws of their upbringing and mock the Nine Joys! The De-Christianized Germans and the Roman Catholic Poles are equally vainglorious and lacking in Christian spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Boyle's exhaustively {{researched}} and lucidly written study of post-World War II labor liberalism {{is a major}} contribution to labor and political history. Highlighting the social democratic perspective of UAW president Walter Reuther, it challenges the prevailing view among labor historians that the ouster of pro-Soviet unions from the CIO in 1949 and 1950 sent organized labor into an <b>irremediable</b> tailspin. ... he insists that into the 1960s the Reuther-led Auto Workers remained a vigorous and principled advocate of structural change in the political economy. Indeed, Boyle sees the mid-1960s rather than the immediate postwar years as the period of social democracy's greatest promise and accomplishment. The book also describes and analyzes {{the impact of the}} Vietnam War on the United Automobile Workers. [...] Boyle concludes that the union was not nearly as hawkish as most observers have concluded, and that fierce fights were waged within the AFL-CIO over support for the war.|$|E
