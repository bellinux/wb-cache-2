6000|$|My dear Rice--Being in {{the midst}} of your {{favourite}} Devon, I should not, by rights, pen one word but it should contain a vast portion of Wit, Wisdom and learning--for I have heard that Milton ere he wrote his answer to Salmasius came into these parts, and for one whole month, rolled himself for three whole hours (per day?), in a certain meadow hard by us--where the mark of his nose at <b>equidistances</b> is still shown. The exhibitor of the said meadow further saith, that, after these rollings, not a nettle sprang up in all the seven acres for seven years, and that from the said time, a new sort of plant was made from the whitethorn, of a thornless nature, very much used by the bucks of the present day to rap their boots withal. This account made me very naturally suppose that the nettles and thorns etherealised by the scholar's rotatory motion, and garnered in his head, thence flew after a process of fermentation against the luckless Salmasius and occasioned his well-known and unhappy end. What a happy thing it would be if we could settle our thoughts and make our minds up on any matter in five minutes, and remain content--that is, build a sort of mental cottage of feelings, quiet and pleasant--to have a sort of Philosophical back-garden, and cheerful holiday-keeping front one--but alas! this never can be: for as the material cottager knows there are such places as France and Italy, and the Andes and burning mountains, so the spiritual Cottager has knowledge of the terra semi-incognita of things unearthly, and cannot for his life keep in the check-rein--or I should stop here quiet and comfortable in my theory of nettles. You will see, however, I am obliged to run wild being attracted by the load-stone concatenation. No sooner had I settled the knotty point of Salmasius, than the Devil put this whim into my head in the likeness of one of Pythagoras's questionings--Did Milton do more good or harm in the world? He wrote, let me inform you (for I have it from a friend, who had it of ----,) he wrote Lycidas, Comus, Paradise Lost and other Poems, with much delectable prose--He was moreover an active friend to man all his life, and has been since his death.--Very good--but, my dear Fellow, I must let you know that, as there is ever the same quantity of matter constituting this habitable globe--as the ocean notwithstanding the enormous changes and revolutions taking place in some or other of its demesnes--notwithstanding Waterspouts whirlpools and mighty rivers emptying themselves into it--still is made up of the same bulk, nor ever varies the number of its atoms--and as a certain bulk of water was instituted at the creation--so very likely a certain portion of intellect was spun forth into the thin air, for the brains of man to prey upon it. You will see my drift without any unnecessary parenthesis. That which is contained in the Pacific could not lie in the hollow of the Caspian--that which was in Milton's head could not find room in Charles the Second's--He like a Moon attracted intellect to its flow--it has not ebbed yet, but has left the shore-pebbles all bare--I mean all Bucks, Authors of Hengist, and Castlereaghs of the present day; who without Milton's gormandising might have been all wise men--Now forasmuch as I was very predisposed to a country I had heard you speak so highly of, I took particular notice of everything during my journey, and have bought some folio asses' skins for memorandums. I have seen everything but the wind--and that, they say, becomes visible by taking a dose of acorns, or sleeping one night in a hog-trough, with your tail to the Sow Sow-West. Some of the little Bar-maids look'd at me as if I knew Jem Rice.... Well, I can't tell! I hope you are showing poor Reynolds the way to get well.

25|$|A marine {{border dispute}} with Russia in the Barents Sea since 1978 was settled when Stoltenberg and President of Russia Dimitry Medvedev signed an {{agreement}} on 27 April 2010 in Oslo. The agreement is a compromise, which divides a disputed area of around 175,000 km2 (68,000 sq mi) into two approximately equally sized parts. However, the agreement still needs ratification by the State Duma and the Parliament of Norway {{in order to be}} implemented. Whereas Norway had previously insisted on a border in accordance with the <b>equidistance</b> principle, which is recognized in international law, specifically the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea Article 15 and the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone Article 6, Russia invoked a Stalin-era decree of the Soviet Union from 1926, which was not recognised by any other country. The new agreement replaced a controversial temporary agreement negotiated by Jens Evensen and Arne Treholt, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy and who aided the Soviet Union in the negotiations. Most of the disputed area was within what would normally be considered Norwegian according to the relevant international treaties.|$|E

40|$|The fishery {{investigations}} in northern polar waters {{carried out by}} the Norwegian Fishery Administration have since 1933 been concentrated solely on the deep sea banks off the west coast of Spitsbergen in order to develop and support the commercial fishery which has come into existence here. The fishery investigations carried out annually since 1923 were during a series of years mainly centered upon the waters around Bear Island, with the intention of opening these waters for the commercial fishery, which also succeeded. But the Norwegian fishery interests stretch over the vast area of the Barents Sea - Jan Mayen - Southeast Greenland, and several cruises have been untertaken also in these waters {{in order to get a}} survey of the fishery conditions. On all these cruises fishing vessels or sealing vessels leased for the purpose have been employed, the majority of them being of about 50 gross tons, but also larger vessels have been used. On all the cruises the essential work has of course been to carry out practical fishing experiments, to collect biological and oceanographical material and to obtain information on depth and bottom conditions. Besides these primary tasks we have collected botanical and geological material in localities incidentally visited, and from which little or no material of this kind previously had been collected, as for instance Southeast Greenland, Jan Mayen and many places in the Svalbard area. My coworker on nearly all these cruises, mag. sci. EINAR KOEFOED, has through his wide knowledge and interest added to the value of the material collected. We have also had the opportunity to visit the lonely, arctic Hope Island which lies in the Barents Sea about 115 miles due east of the southern point of Spitsbergen. After my visit to the southern part of Hope Island in 1924 the results were published in the Skrifter om Svalbard og Ishavet, Vol. I, no. 10, Oslo 1926. During our later fishery {{investigations in}} these waters in 1929 and 1930 I had the opportunity to visit also the northern part of the island. During these latter landings I have taken a number of photographs and measured some heights on the island. According to these measurements it has been possible to draw the <b>equidistances</b> more correctly than on my sketch map of 1924. The localities which have been paid most attention in 1929 and 1930 are Hermansenskardet (Hermansen Gap) with Småhumpen (Small Hummock), ancl Bråstadskardet (Bråstad Gap) with Lyngefjellet (Lynge Hill). Some measurements of the sun's altitude were also taken. The distance between the south and north points, and the distances between the different mountains and gaps were determined by sailing to and from along the coast and using the patent log. On the basis of the observations taken in 1924 and in 1929 - 1930 I have made a new sketch map of Hope Island (fig. 36). On this new sketch map the south point has been shifted 4 miles to the south and 1 mile to the west. Hope Island is 18 miles long, i. e. 2 miles shorter than on the previous sketch map, and the angle formed by the longitudinal direction of the island with the meridian is somewhat larger. The measurements of the sun's altitude taken at one and the same spot on various occasions show differences on account of bad horizon, and I have therefore been compelled to use the mean values. On account of the varying tide currcnts I have also had to use the mean of the distances sailed along the coast from the south to the north points. These investigations on Hope Island have been carried out when the opportunity arose, and they must be considered only as a small contribution to the discription of the island. An accurate survey of Hope Island is still lacking. In accounts dealing with the whaling period in Spitsbergen waters walrus is mentioned at Hope Island. Walrus is not found at the island nowadays, although single specimens may be encountered here as well as in many other localities in the Svalbard area, and even at the Norwegian coast. The great quantities of skeletal fragments of walrus found at Koefoed Point might be remains from walrus slaughtered in the whaling period. However, by a closer study of these remains I am mostly inclined to believe that a catastrophe has occurred here once or repated times. The skeletal fragments are found partly scattered on the soil surface, but a great part of them are overgrown by vegetation. The size of the craniums shows that they belong to walrus of all age-groups, even new-borns. In many craniums the tusks are fixed in their proper place. As a whole I got the impression that these skeletal fragments were not remains of slaughtered animals. If, however, a natural catastrophe has occurred it might be explained thus: Near the south point of Hope Island the Koefoed point juts out eastwards as a low, grass-clad spit of land with a flat beach. Steep mountain sides mark the bounds on all other sides of this point. A large herd of walrus has been assembled on Koefoed Point during a strong and protracted gale blowing on the shore. This gale has pushed the drift-ice ashore, piling it up into such a high ice-wall that it has been impossible for the Walrus to escape into the sea. The herd has become enclosed for so long time that all the animals ultimately have died from hunger. Hope Island is assumed to be discovered by the Dutchman RIJP who called the island "Visch Eylandt" because he should have found much fish at the southern part of the island. Possibly RIJP by "Visch" meant whales. This mode of expression was at that time common among the whalers, and is even used today by the Norwegian whalers. RIJP was, however, on a voyage of discovery and he was perhaps no whaler, so it is possible that he by "Visch" really meant fish, i. e. cod or haddock or possibly capelan. When we have visited Hope Island we have never seen any indication of fish near the shore, but it is possible that under certain conditions shoals of capelan can be washed ashore, or that cod and haddock can be present in very shallow water near the island. In the 1870 -ies great shoals of cod were found near the beach in the fjords of Spitsbergen and Bear Island, and something similar may have occurred at that time at Hope Island. On August 26. 1923, while steering southwards from Frans Josef land with the M/C "Blåfjell", we encountered on the bank due east of Hope Island a great number of whales gorging in Euphausiidæ and capelan. With a small seine we succeeclecl in catching some hundred liters of capelan. Using the capelan as bait we caught a quantity of cod on long-lines in the same locality. This experiment was repeated a few days later on the edge of the bank southeast of Hope Island, and here very large catches of cod were made. However, these catches were made rather far from the island and in comparatively deep water, namely about 100 fathoms. Also on some occasions after 1923 our fishing experiments on the bank southeast of Hope Island have shown that fish could be found here, and in the last years this fishing region has also been visited by ordinary fishing vessels. When the fishermen get better aquainted with the conditions on Hope Island they may occasionally and under certain weather conditions possibly find it advantageous to seek anchorage to the lee of the island while fishing in this region. It is possible that in the future a meteorological station will be needed on Hope Island, and for this purpose the island seems well suited. In this case Hope Island will be utilised in the same way as the small and lonely Bear Island and Jan Mayen. If there cannot be found very valuable minerals on Hope Island it can hardly be exploited in any other way than for winter hunting or for purposes indicated above. The population of white and blue foxes will perhaps not stand reduction every year, perhaps only every second or third year. It is possible that an interchange occasionally takes place through migration of foxes across the ice from Edge Island or conversely. As for the polar bear the case is somewhat different, as it does not inhabit the island all the year round. The polar bear visits the island together with the drift-ice. It is only a few single individuals, perhaps some quite inexperienced young bears, which let the ice drift away from the island without jumping on to it in time. They stay on the island, often vegetating for long periods in summer, till the drift-ice again touches the shore...|$|R

60|$|Since, then, {{neither in}} nature, {{nor in the}} human mind, do there exist any objects exactly {{corresponding}} to the definitions of geometry, while yet that science can not be supposed to be conversant about nonentities; nothing remains but to consider geometry as conversant with such lines, angles, and figures, as really exist; and the definitions, as they are called, must be regarded as some of our first and most obvious generalizations concerning those natural objects. The correctness of those generalizations, as generalizations, is without a flaw: the equality of all the radii of a circle is true of all circles, {{so far as it}} is true of any one: but it is not exactly true of any circle; it is only nearly true; so nearly that no error of any importance in practice will be incurred by feigning it to be exactly true. When we have occasion to extend these inductions, or their consequences, to cases in which the error would be appreciable—to lines of perceptible breadth or thickness, parallels which deviate sensibly from <b>equidistance,</b> and the like—we correct our conclusions, by combining with them a fresh set of propositions relating to the aberration; just as we also take in propositions relating to the physical or chemical properties of the material, if those properties happen to introduce any modification into the result; which they easily may, even with respect to figure and magnitude, as in the case, for instance, of expansion by heat. So long, however, as there exists no practical necessity for attending to any of the properties of the object except its geometrical properties, or to any of the natural irregularities in those, it is convenient to neglect the consideration of the other properties and of the irregularities, and to reason as if these did not exist: accordingly, we formally announce in the definitions, that we intend to proceed on this plan. But it is an error to suppose, because we resolve to confine our attention to a certain number of the properties of an object, that we therefore conceive, or have an idea of, the object, denuded of its other properties. We are thinking, all the time, of precisely such objects as we have seen and touched, and with all the properties which naturally belong to them; but, for scientific convenience, we feign them to be divested of all properties, except those which are material to our purpose, and in regard to which we design to consider them.|$|E
60|$|Sir Alexander Ball would likewise, it is probable, urge, {{that the}} {{commercial}} advantages of Malta, which were most intelligible to the English public, and best fitted to render our retention {{of the island}} popular, must necessarily be of very slow growth, though finally they would become great, and of an extent not to be calculated. For this reason, therefore, it was highly desirable that the possession should be, and appear to be, at least inexpensive. After the British Government had made one advance for a stock of corn sufficient to place the island a year beforehand, the sum total drawn from Great Britain need not exceed 25,000 pounds, or at most 30,000 pounds annually: excluding of course the expenditure connected with our own military and navy, and the repair of the fortifications, which latter expense ought to be much less than at Gibraltar, from the multitude and low wages of the labourers in Malta, and from the softness and admirable quality of the stone. Indeed much more might safely be promised {{on the assumption that}} a wise and generous system of policy were adopted and persevered in. The monopoly of the Maltese corn- trade by the Government formed an exception to a general rule, and by a strange, yet valid anomaly in the operations of political economy, was not more necessary than advantageous to the inhabitants. The chief reason is, that the produce of the island itself barely suffices for one-fourth of its inhabitants, although fruits and vegetables form so large a part of their nourishment. Meantime the harbours of Malta, and its <b>equidistance</b> from Europe, Asia, and Africa, gave it a vast and unnatural importance in the present relations of the great European powers, and imposed on its government, whether native or dependent, the necessity of considering the whole island as a single garrison, the provisioning of which could not be trusted to the casualties of ordinary commerce. What is actually necessary is seldom injurious. Thus in Malta bread is better and cheaper on an average than in Italy or the coast of Barbary; while a similar interference with the corn-trade in Sicily impoverishes the inhabitants, and keeps the agriculture in a state of barbarism. But the point in question is the expense to Great Britain. Whether the monopoly be good or evil in itself, it remains true, that in this established usage, and in the gradual enclosure of the uncultivated district, such resources exist as without the least oppression might render the civil government in Valetta independent of the Treasury at home, finally taking upon itself even the repair of the fortifications, and thus realise one instance of an important possession that cost the country nothing.|$|E

The coast of Yukon is concave, whereas the coast of Alaska is convex; and thus an <b>equidistance</b> principle would result in a significant extension of the U.S. possession.
