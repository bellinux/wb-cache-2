5000|$|Stockholms Banco {{was thus}} founded in 1657 with Palmstruch {{appointed}} as general manager. The bank itself {{was nothing new}} as it was simply an imitation of the successful public <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> of Amsterdam and Hamburg, however Palmstruch himself added two important innovations. The first of these was to use money deposited into accounts at the bank to finance loans, however this soon became a problem as the deposits were usually short-term and the loans long-term, meaning that deposited money was unavailable to be withdrawn by account holders. Palmstruch's second innovation, and his solution to this problem, was the introduction in 1661 of Kreditivsedlar ("credit paper"), the first European banknotes, which would be exchangeable at any time for the gold and silver coins they were replacing. [...] These were very successful, but the bank began lending more than it could afford and printed too many banknotes without the necessary collateral, leading to the bank's collapse in 1668.|$|E
50|$|On lending side, {{traditional}} <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> directly {{deal with}} borrowers who seek business loans, mortgages, students loans, credit cards, overdrafts, etc. Each loan's credit risk are individually assessed and reviewed periodically. More crucially, the bank manager often maintains personal oversight over these borrowers. In contrast, SIV lending is conducted {{through the process}} known as securitization. Instead of assessing individual credit risk, loans (for example, mortgage or credit card) are bundled with thousands (or tens of thousands or more) of {{the same type of}} loans. According to the law of large numbers, bundling of loans creates statistical predictability. Credit agencies then allocate each bundle of loans into several risk categories and provide statistical risk assessment for each bundle in similar manner to how insurance companies assign risk. At this point, the bundle of small loans is transformed into a financial commodity and traded on the money market {{as if it were a}} share or bond. The bonds usually selected by a SIV are predominantly (70-80%) Aaa/AAA rated asset-backed securities (ABSs) and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs).|$|E
5000|$|Upon review, it {{is evident}} that the credit risk {{assessment}} conducted by these forms of lending was far more inadequate than with the traditional lending done by <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> (although many large traditional Banks turned out to be over-exposed to mortgage risk both via loans and through their investments in securitisations). Some mortgage loans even turned up to be liar's loans with some borrowers essentially being NINJA (No Income, No Job or Assets). In traditional banking, when a downturn occurred, branch managers could individually review clients' financial condition, separate good borrowers from bad ones and provide individually tailored adjustments. SIVs, on the other hand, are staffed by investment managers, who assess the content of pools of securitized loans, but not the individual loans. The banks were exposed to first loss risks while the SIVs were only exposed to last loss risk. The ratings on the most shaky types of sub prime securitisations were exposed when it turned out that complicated mathematical models, which is used to rate securitized loan, made fundamental assumptions {{that turned out to be}} wrong. The most significant among these assumptions were the trends in U.S. housing prices which declined far faster, deeper and broader than statistical model predicted.|$|E

5000|$|Some Amsterdam {{merchant}} bankers were leveraged {{far beyond}} their capacity. Financial activity in late-eighteenth century Amsterdam {{was controlled by}} a group of merchant banking firms. These “bankers” were proprietary firms that dealt in trade goods and that also provided financing to other merchants. These firms were not <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> in the English conventional tradition, as deposit taking was viewed as incredibly risky. Since deposits were scarce, financial intermediation was accomplished through a securitization scheme known as the acceptance loan. The building block of the acceptance loan was an instrument known as the bill of exchange — ultimately a contract to pay a fixed sum of money at a future date. Bills of exchange were originally designed as short-term contracts but gradually became heavily used for long-term borrowing. They were typically rolled over and became de facto short-term loans to finance longer-term projects, which resulted {{in the creation of a}} classic balance sheet maturity mismatch. At that time, bills of exchange could be re-sold, with each seller serving as a guarantor to the bill and, by implication, insuring the buyer of the bill against default. This practice prevented the circulation of low-credit-quality bills among market participants and created a kind of “credit wrapper”—a guarantee for the specific loan—by making all signatories jointly liable for a particular bill. In addition, low acceptance fees—the fees paid to market participants for taking on the obligation to pay the bill of exchange—implied a perceived negligible risk. However, the complexity of this system had underlying ramifications - the practice also resulted in binding market participants together through their balance sheets: one bank might have a receivable asset and a payable liability for the same bill of exchange, even when no goods were traded. By the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, high leverage and balance sheet interconnectedness left merchant bankers highly vulnerable to any slowdown in credit availability. Merchant bankers believed that their balance sheet growth and leverage were hedged and insured through offsetting claims and liabilities. And while some of the more conservative Dutch bankers were wary in growing their wartime business, others expanded quickly. One of the fastest growing merchant banks belonged to the De Neufville brothers, who speculated in depreciating currencies and endorsed a large number of bills of exchange. Leendert Pieter de Neufville was the leading perpetrator of the proliferation of the faulty bills of exchange. Noting his success, other merchant bankers followed suit. The crisis was triggered when De Neufville entered with 100.000 guilders into a deal by Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky to buy grain stored in Kolberg, etc., worth almost 1,2 million guilders, from the Russian army, c.q. Vasily Dolgorukov-Krymsky, as he left Poland. Frederick the Great ordered the grain traders to sell it on the Prussian market, but in May 1763 grain prices collapsed by more than 75 percent. The dealers that had not followed his advise, made heavy losses.|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} of Islamic banking is increasing day by day. On the other hand, some people also criticized this system in some aspect. One {{of the criticism}} is that profit sharing rates of Islamic banks are similar to interest rate of <b>deposit</b> <b>banks.</b> While considering this issue, this study aims to identify the causality relationship between profit sharing rate and interest rate in Turkey. Within this scope, monthly, quarterly, 6 -months and yearly data for the period between 2000 and 2016 was analyzed separately. In addition to this situation, Toda Yamamoto causality analysis {{was used in this}} study so as to achieve this objective. According to the results of the analysis, it was determined that there is a significant causality relationship between these rates. In other words, it was concluded that interest rate of the <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> is the main indicator of the profit share rate of Islamic banks in Turkey. The main reason behind this situation is that indicators in the market affect both <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> and Islamic banks. Therefore, it is inevitable that deposit rates and profit share rates will be similar when <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> and Islamic banks perform in the same market...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} seventy years, the {{proposal}} to narrow the scope of banks has occurred more and more frequently in financial debates and research.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the relationship between}} CAMELS ratios and credit ratings of <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> in Turkey. Annual data {{was used for the}} period between 2004 and 2014 in this study. Moreover, 20 <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> of Turkey were analyzed and 21 different ratios of CAMELS components were used. In addition to that, credit ratings of these banks were provided from Moody’s corporation or annual activity reports of the banks. After that, we created multi nominal logistic regression analysis in order to illustrate the relationship. The major finding in this study is that three components (Asset Quality, Management Quality, and Sensitivity to Market Risk) of CAMELS have effects on credit ratings whereas the ratios related to Capital Adequacy and Earnings are not effective. As a result, it was recommended that Turkish <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> should concentrate on the percentage of fixed assets and interest income to have a better rating. Moreover, having high market share with respect to total assets and lower interest expense are also other important points for this purpose. On the other hand, Turkish <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> should control the proportion of financial assets and increase the amount of FX liquid assets to prevent credit ratings to decrease. Additionally, market share of banks for loans should not reach at high level for this objective. </p...|$|E

Secondary data were acquired from the financial statement of 15 money <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> listed on floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) while regression and paired sample test analyses were used to determine the association between the adoption of IFRS and the market performance of listed money <b>deposit</b> <b>Banks</b> in Nigeria. The study found a positive and significant relationship between the adoption of IFRS and the market performance of listed money <b>deposit</b> <b>banks</b> in Nigeria proxy by Dividend pay-out (DPO) and Dividend Yield (DY). Furthermore, the paired sample test result indicates a significant difference exists between Dividend pay-out (DPO) and the adoption of IFRS while no significant difference exists between Dividend Yield (DY) and the adoption of IFRS. Thus, the study recommends that the global adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards particularly in developing economies like Nigeria should be properly implemented and studied, so as to keep abreast with the various changes the would likely affect the market performance of the Nigerian Banking industry...|$|E

With Lebanon''s high fiscal deficits financed largely by domestic commercial banks that rely on deposit funding, deposit growth is a key variable to assess government financing conditions. At the macro level, we find that domestic factors such as economic activity, prices, and the interest differential between the Lebanese pound and the U.

Impulse response functions and variance decomposition analyses underscore {{the relative importance of}} the external variables.
