40|$|Abstract—Wireless <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> {{combine the}} character-istics of both {{cellular}} and mobile ad hoc <b>networks.</b> In wireless <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks,</b> {{it is often}} assumed that each individual mobile node will faithfully follow the prescribed protocols without any deviation. However, these mobile devices, when owned by individual users, will likely do {{what is the most}} beneficial to their owners, i. e., act “selfishly”. Therefore, an algorithm or protocol intended for selfish wireless devices must be designed. In this paper, we specifically study how to design routing protocols in wireless <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> with selfish nodes. We first present a VCG-based routing protocol for <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks,</b> and show it is truthful but could be expensive. Then we modify the VCG-based routing protocol to make it more efficient for <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> in term of total payment. However, we prove that nodes could lie up their costs in the modified method. Moreover, we propose a novel routing protocol based on first-price path auctions [1], which can achieve a Nash equilibrium with low total payment.

40|$|Introduction Multi-hop {{cellular}} <b>networks</b> (also called <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks)</b> {{appear to}} be a promising combination of the dynamics of mobile ad hoc networks and the reliability of infrastructured wireless <b>networks.</b> These <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> o#er several advantages for users as well as operators. The network topology can be dynamically adapted to the respective needs reducing installation costs for the provider, the overall coverage area can be extended and nodes can reduce their energy consumption for transmitting packets due to shorter distances. However, several weaknesses known from mobile ad hoc networks persist. In the context of <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> new possibilities to deal with these weaknesses become available. Besides the security and routing issues the cooperation among nodes is of great importance. We propose a cooperation and accounting strategy for <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> called CASHnet, which stimulates cooperation among nodes by making it a rewarding alternative to selfishness.

40|$|Abstract Theoretical {{studies of}} the complex, doped BN/carbon pillar <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> have {{revealed}} their great potential for energy and power conversion, nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and electric propulsion devices. Demonstration of the technique to synthesize such networks and control the structure is critical for their applications. Here {{we report on the}} successful fabrication of complex, <b>hybrid</b> pillar <b>networks</b> consisting of carbon- and oxygen-doped BN nanoflakes and nitrogenated carbon nanorods. The complex, <b>hybrid,</b> structure-controlled pillar <b>networks</b> were grown directly on the carbon nanorods in N 2 -H 2 plasma using B 4 C as the boron and carbon sources. The characterization by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, micro-Raman, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies has confirmed that the carbon- and oxygen-doped BN crystalline nanoflakes indeed grow on the amorphous nitrogenated carbon nanorods and form the pillar <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks.</b> The photoluminescence measurements have revealed that the pillar <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> generate ultraviolet, blue, green, and red photoluminescence bands. In particular, the photoluminescence properties of the pillar <b>hybrid</b> <b>networks</b> can be effectively tuned by changing the network structure. These outcomes can contribute to the synthesis of novel nanostructures and the development of next generation optoelectronic nanodevices and power devices...|$|R
