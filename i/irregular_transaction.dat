5000|$|Within a {{few years}} of the {{settlement}} of South Australia, the colonial government decided to establish a [...] "Government Farm" [...] for the purpose of agisting horses and bullocks, and providing hay and fodder. The area chosen was {{the upper reaches of the}} Sturt River; In addition to its suitability as farmland, governor George Gawler thought the area would be ideal for the establishment of a summer residence. In July 1840, in a highly <b>irregular</b> <b>transaction,</b> thirteen surveyed sections of 80 acres, plus 1000 acres of rough country to the east were purchased. The sale was dubious in that it was paid by private promissory note, rather than through official government channels. Additionally, the sale document did not mention three of the 80 acre sections, nor the large section of rough country. When Gawler was replaced by George Grey in May 1841, the colony's finances were in considerable debt. As a fundraising measure, the newly established farm was offered for public sale. However, realising that their title to the land was dubious, the government cancelled the sale. Ironically, the government's questionable title to the land ensured it remained in public ownership.|$|E
40|$|We {{contribute}} to the debate on how to assess {{the size of the}} underground (or shadow) economy by proposing a reinterpretation of the traditional Currency Demand Approach (CDA) à la Tanzi. In particular, we introduce three main innovations. First, we take a direct measure of the value of cash transactions-the flow of cash withdrawn from bank accounts relative to total non-cash payments-as the dependent variable in the money demand equation. This allows us to avoid unrealistic assumptions on the velocity of money and the absence of any <b>irregular</b> <b>transaction</b> in a given year, overcoming two severe critiques to the traditional CDA. Second, in place of the tax burden level, usually intended as the main motivation for non-compliance, we include among the covariates two direct indicators of detected tax evasion. Finally, we control also for the role of illegal production considering crimes like drug dealing and prostitution, which-jointly with the shadow economy-contributes to the larger aggregate of the non-observed economy and represents a significant component of total cash payments. We propose then an application of this "modified CDA" to a panel of 91 Italian provinces for the years 2005 - 08...|$|E

50|$|The {{analytic}} tests usually {{start with}} high-level data overview tests to spot highly significant irregularities. In a recent purchasing card application these tests identified a purchasing card transaction for 3,000,000 Costa Rica Colons.

These high-level tests include tests related to Benford's Law and possibly also those statistics known as descriptive statistics. These high-tests are always followed by more focused tests to look for small samples of highly <b>irregular</b> <b>transactions.</b> The familiar methods of correlation and time-series analysis {{can also be used to}} detect fraud and other irregularities. Forensic analytics also includes the use of a fraud risk-scoring model to identify high risk forensic units (customers, employees, locations, insurance claims and so on).

50|$|JITEC {{was growing}} rapidly; its stock had jumped from CDN$3.80 in late July 2000 to CDN$11.65 {{in only a}} few weeks. This sudden success caught the {{attention}} of many, including multi-millionaire Herbert Black, who then became a friend and advisor to Laliberté. However, unbeknownst to Laliberté, Black had a well established history of profiting from the short selling of companies’ stocks. Soon after becoming involved with Laliberté, Black allegedly began this process with JITEC. He reported Laliberté to the Quebec Security Commission (QSC) and accused him of insider trading and <b>irregular</b> <b>transactions.</b> He put immense pressure on the QSC to have a cease trade order issued against JITEC, which triggered an investigation. Meanwhile, JITEC stock was falling rapidly based on leaked information to the media. On Nov 10th, 2000, Paul Trudeau, principal investigator for the QSC in the case signed an affidavit required for the QSC to issue a personal cease trade order on Laliberté and an investigation was initiated. This resulted in his forced resignation as CEO the following day, the same day that Black had initiated a class action suit against JITEC, CIBC, Canaccord, and Laliberté himself for losses incurred with the drop in share price. However, at the same time Black was shorting the stock at $10 thereby benefitting from the stock's drop. In 2011, after conducting an extensive investigation, the CIBC filed as part of its defence, that Black himself alone was responsible for the drop in share price.|$|R

40|$|This study {{intends to}} scrutinize how {{adjustments}} {{made in the}} housing market has affected the profession of estate agents. Our premise is based on that social facts can be interpreted by social facts and the aim is to understand the factors affecting the profession in today's society that are developed in interaction with societal factors. In order to fathom this phenomenon, we have chosen to study the profession of estate agents and how it has been affected by the housing market. The empirical material is based on real estate agents’ experience and is therefore collected through a qualitative method based on interviews. The study is interpreted by a professional theoretical perspective, where we have assumed the thesis that all professions can be professionalised. The theoretical conceptual apparatus consists of autonomy, social closure, legitimacy, authority and will be used to understand the professionalisation process, that is when and why professions arise. Despite the fact of the profession’s changes, it has not been enough for the profession to be professionalised in the classical term. It can be said that the housing market has affected the professionalisation process of profession of real estate brokerage, which means that social factors can influence the professionalisation process. What prevents the profession from change and development of their professional position is the lack of autonomy. Due to the runaway housing market, a regulator was established to combat <b>irregular</b> <b>transactions,</b> which lead to decreased autonomy. A stronger professional status would derive from an increased authonomy and the conclusion is therefore {{that as long as the}} profession is under external control, it will not be professionalised...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Despite all {{attempts}} to prevent fraud, {{it continues to be}} a major threat to industry and government. In this paper, we present a fraud detection method which detects <b>irregular</b> frequency of <b>transaction</b> usage in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. We discuss the design, development and empirical evaluation of outlier detection and distance measuring techniques to detect frequency-based anomalies within an individual user’s profile, relative to other similar users. Primarily, we propose three automated techniques: a univariate method, called Boxplot which is based on the sample’s median; and two multivariate methods which use Euclidean distance, for detecting transaction frequency anomalies within each transaction profile. The two multivariate approaches detect potentially fraudulent activities by identifying: (1) users where the Euclidean distance between their transaction-type set is above a certain threshold and (2) users/data points that lie far apart from other users/clusters or represent a small cluster size, using k-means clustering. The proposed methodology allows an auditor to investigate the transaction frequency anomalies and adjust the different parameters, such as the outlier threshold and the Euclidean distance threshold values to tune the number of alerts. The novelty of the proposed technique lies in its ability to automatically trigger alerts from transaction profiles, based on transaction usage performed over a period of time. Experiments were conducted using a real dataset obtained from the production client of a large organization using SAP R/ 3 (presently the most predominant ERP system), to run its business. The results of this empirical research demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Keywords—anomaly detection; enterprise resource planning systems; fraud detection I...|$|R
40|$|Twele, André; Sandro, Martinis; Wenxi, Cao; Simon, Plank German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany Since the {{establishment}} of the ZKI (Center for Satellite-Based Crisis Information) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the development of EO-based methodologies for the rapid mapping of flood situations has been of major concern. This can be especially contributed to the fact that inundations constitute the majority of all ZKI-activations as well as activations of the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disasters’. These requirements have {{led to the development of}} dedicated SAR-based flood mapping tools which have been utilized during numerous rapid mapping activities of flood situations. The core of these tools is an automatic tile-based thresholding approach (Martinis et al. 2009, 2011, Martinis and Twele 2010) which allows separating inundated regions from land-areas without any user interaction. Recently, the SAR-based flood detection algorithm has been substantially extended and refined in robustness and transferability to guarantee high classification accuracy under different environmental conditions and sensor configurations with the ultimate goal to allow its implementation in an automatic processing chain (Martinis et al. 2014). The processing chain including SAR data pre-processing, computation and adaption of global auxiliary data, unsupervised initialization of the classification as well as post-classification refinement by using a fuzzy logic-based approach is automatically triggered after new SAR data is available on a delivery server. The dissemination of flood maps resulting from the service is performed through a dedicated web client. With respect to accuracy and computational effort, experiments performed on a data set of > 200 different TerraSAR-X scenes acquired during flooding all over the world with different sensor configurations confirmed the robustness and effectiveness of the flood mapping service. The processing chain has recently been adapted to the new European Space Agency’s C-band SAR mission Sentinel- 1. The thematic processor has further been enhanced through the integration of the “Height above nearest drainage index” (Rennó et al. 2008) which helps to reduce water look-alikes depending on the hydrologic-topographic setting. In contrast to the current TerraSAR-X based thematic service, Sentinel- 1 enables a systematic disaster monitoring with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This is a major advantage since the time-consuming step of tasking new satellite data can be omitted. By minimizing the time delay between data delivery and product dissemination it is expected that the proposed service enhances the value of remote sensing during flood management activities and supports applications in hydrology, where information about the flood extent is systematically assimilated into hydrologic and hydraulic models. The presentation will introduce to the technical concept of the SAR-based fully-automated processing chains, with a focus on the current status of the Sentinel- 1 flood service.
