5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing.|$|E
25|$|Uyesugi {{pleaded not}} guilty by reason of {{insanity}} and claimed that he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done was wrong.|$|E
500|$|Jasmyn Burke and Morgan Waters, {{who first}} met {{each other in}} a bar, started Weaves in 2012 when the two made demo songs based on files of song ideas Burke {{recorded}} on her iPhone. In 2013, bassist Zach Bines and drummer Spencer Cole joined the project and started recording their self-titled debut EP immediately after. [...] "Motorcycle", [...] "Take A Dip", [...] "Do You See Past" [...] and [...] "Hulahoop" [...] were produced by Waters in his bedroom using Garageband, while [...] "Buttercup" [...] and [...] "Closer" [...] was produced by David Newfeld in his church studio of Dobbstown North. Waters described Newfeld's production contributions as [...] "music lessons and artist lessons in a way," [...] given that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was making. He also said, [...] "That open mindedness and visibility to capture what happens in the moment and allow mistakes and encourage them brings you out of your comfort zone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{good to see}} you up there," [...] said Slone. [...] "An' that splendid horse! ... <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is. It'll break Bostil's {{heart to}} see that horse beat." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Disease of the mind" [...] is not {{a medical}} term; it instead means that the {{defendant}} must show {{he was suffering from}} a disease which affected the functioning of the mind, which does not necessarily have to be a disease of the brain. This was confirmed in the case of R v Kemp [...] 1 QB 399, where the defendant's arteriosclerosis led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious. It must then be shown that this disease of the mind led to a [...] "defect of reason"; that the defendant's ability to reason was impaired by the disease. Alternately, the defendant can try to show {{that he did not know}} [...] "the nature or quality of his act or that it was wrong". The first requires proof that the defendant did not know what he was doing; that he had no awareness of what he was happening, that he was unaware of the consequences of his act or that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, but was deluded as to the circumstances; for the latter, Jonathan Herring gives the example of a man who [...] "thought he was killing a monstrous person when he was in fact killing a person". When arguing that the defendant was [...] "not knowing the act was wrong", [...] "wrong" [...] is taken to mean [...] "illegal", as set out in R v Windle [...] 2 QB 826.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in CounterPunch, author Tariq Ali said, [...] "The Bavarian is a razor-sharp reactionary cleric. I think <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying and why. In a neo-liberal world suffering from environmental degradation, poverty, hunger, repression, a 'planet of slums' (in the graphic phrase of Mike Davis), the Pope chooses to insult the founder of a rival faith. The reaction in the Muslim world was predictable, but depressingly insufficient." ...|$|E
2500|$|At MIT, Netanyahu {{studied a}} double-load, {{completing}} an SM (that would normally take four years) {{in only two}} and a half years, despite taking a break to fight in the Yom Kippur War, and while simultaneously completing a thesis in a graduate course at Harvard. Professor Groisser at MIT recalled: [...] "He did superbly. He was very bright. Organized. Strong. Powerful. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to do and how to get it done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mister Wilson," [...] {{answered}} the captain, with the gruff {{air of a}} man who assumes and asserts that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is about, and does not want advice.|$|R
6000|$|But no, {{his head}} was level, <b>he</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was about. He swooped down to within thirty or forty feet of the lake, and stopped right over the center, and sung out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I wish I knew it all," [...] {{answered}} another. [...] "I guess <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing." [...] And in this he was right; Theodore Roosevelt <b>knew</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{was trying}} to accomplish.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{transportation}} hub, Singapore {{has always been}} a potential transit point for Golden Triangle heroin. In a letter to David Hawker, the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, Abdullah Tarmugi, the Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore, wrote: [...] "He was caught in possession of almost 400 grams of pure heroin, enough for more than 26,000 doses of heroin for drug addicts.... <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing and the consequences of his actions. As representatives of the people, {{we have an obligation to}} protect the lives of those who could be ruined by the drugs he was carrying." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 2009, {{in one of}} {{his last}} games in the NHL, after scoring the game-winning goal in the 2009 playoffs against the New York Rangers in a 2–1 Game 7 contest, then-Capitals Head Coach Bruce Boudreau stated in a press conference, [...] "Let's face it, {{sometimes}} experience pays off. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to do, when to do it, and that's what makes him one of the greatest players, ever." [...] Teammate Alexander Ovechkin added, [...] "He's our leader... He's our best guy in the locker room. He showed it. He's our best guy. He has more experience than anybody in this locker room. He knows how to play like that. He just shows his leadership." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winwood recalled, [...] "There were no chord sheets, no nothing. [...] He [...] {{just started}} playing. [...] It was a one-take job, with him singing and {{playing at the}} same time. [...] He just had such mastery of the {{instrument}} and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was and knew his abilities". [...] Engineer Eddie Kramer saw it differently: [...] "The idea that these jam sessions were informal is something that I completely disagree with. [...] They may have seemed casual to the outside observer, but Jimi plotted and planned out nearly all of them. [...] He'd reason {{that if he had}} his songs together, if he really wanted to pull out what he heard in his head, he needed the right people... and that's what he did". [...] During the recording session, Hendrix is heard advising Winwood on his organ part.|$|E
6000|$|... "The lad did {{not speak}} boastfully, {{when he said he}} was a fair swordsman," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "He does not fight in our fashion, but at least <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> about. I was {{so fond of}} {{my pillow}} this morning that I thought I'd let the hunting slide for once. A man should not make a toil of his pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, here's a perposal to squander, all right," [...] said McNutt. [...] "But the {{question}} is, Does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> runnin' up agin', and what it'll cost {{to do all}} the idiotic things as he says?" ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, {{do you have any idea}} how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Series {{producer}} Craig-Brown {{revealed the}} [...] "biggest challenge" [...] was {{to distinguish the}} storyline from other sexuality plots featured in other dramas. She concluded that it was about Dan's struggle with [...] "trying {{to deal with what}} he wants, which is a very conventional life." [...] She also confirmed it would be a long-running story arc for the character. Astill also shared her sentiment stating it was a [...] "new direction" [...] for the programme. He said it would be easy for Dan to [...] "come out" [...] if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. Hobley later revealed Dan is [...] "moving things too fast", which has a negative effect on her training. He is annoyed with Chrissie when Malick offers her theatre slots. She added [...] "Dan doesn't respect what she is trying to do [...] Dan's reaction makes her see red". Hobley revealed that Dan's affair begins to come between them – [...] "so when she finds out what Dan has been up to under her nose all hell is going to break loose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Gravano {{and several}} {{other members of the}} Gambino family became disenchanted with Gotti's lust for the media and {{high-profile}} antics, feeling they brought too much heat. Several members of the family informed Gravano that Gotti's high profile and large gatherings of mob members at the Ravenite Social Club were constant targets for the FBI and that the media attention put a large spotlight on the Gambinos. Many members of the family, according to Gravano, complained to him about Gotti's use of Gravano in murders despite Gravano's position as underboss of the family. Members were also concerned about Gotti's frequent appearances in court. He was first tried for assaulting a refrigerator repairman over a parking space. Through witness intimidation, he was acquitted. Gravano had paid a juror in Gotti's second trial to vote in favor of an acquittal allowing Gotti to beat the RICO charges lodged against him. Gotti's third trial on state assault charges ended the same way. Gotti's ego began to bother Gravano as well as several other members of the family. Gotti was first known as the [...] "Dapper Don" [...] in the press for his Brioni suits and hand-painted ties as well as his well-combed hair and quick wit with reporters. Gotti required Gravano and Gambino consigliere Frank LoCascio to be at the Ravenite social club five days a week and all of his captains to make an appearance once a week. When Gravano warned Gotti about the negative attention from reporters as well as the constant surveillance from the FBI, Gotti instructed Gravano not to worry about it, as Gotti said that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog, {{who is very}} wise. [...] "Jerry Muskrat knows. If Jerry {{says that}} we are going to have a long cold winter you may be sure that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is talking about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Persuasion {{is not at}} command; but pardon me, if I cannot even {{endeavour}} {{to persuade}} him. I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is about, and must be his own master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{is talking}} about," [...] said Mrs. Travers {{in such a}} bitter tone as to disconcert d'Alcacer for a moment. [...] "I don't see a single soul about the decks," [...] Mrs. Travers continued, almost directly.|$|R

6000|$|... "It ain't that," [...] Shorty was saying. [...] "We don't {{want your}} money. Wouldn't touch it nohow. But my pardner {{is the real}} meat with boats, and when he says yourn ain't safe I reckon <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> talkin' about." ...|$|R
5000|$|McGrew {{was named}} {{as one of}} four [...] "favorite TV anchors" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle pop-culture critic Peter Hartlaub, who {{described}} McGrew as an [...] "excellent communicator, he’s prepared, he works hard and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> talking about without being a know-it-all".|$|R
6000|$|... "There was Norman {{grave and}} steadfast, as if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was about, and was manfully and calmly ready--he {{might have been}} a young knight, {{watching}} his armour." ...|$|E

60|$|With {{these words}} he fell fainting from his chair, {{and as the}} youth, before <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, had {{squeezed}} the bird to death, the old man died also.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, Bull. I thought mysel' {{that it was}} an awkward fix, and {{certainly}} he managed those Portuguese fellows well, and turned the lot round his little finger. Ay, ay; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing perfectly well, young as he is." ...|$|R
