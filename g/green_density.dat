40|$|NoPhysical and {{mechanical}} properties for prealloyed 6061 Al powder processed {{with and without}} additions of solid and/or liquid lubricants and sintering aids (Pb, Sn, Ag) are presented. For comparison, both vacuum and nitrogen sintering were carried out on as received (gas atomised) and degassed powder compacts pressed at 340 and 510 MPa. Vacuum degassing of the prealloyed powder provided better compressibility and thus higher <b>green</b> <b>densities</b> than those for the as received powder. Highest sintered densities of ~ 98 - 99 % of theoretical were obtained for the prealloyed (and degassed) Al compacts by sintering under pure nitrogen with an addition of 0 · 6 wt-% paraffin wax as solid lubricant or 1 · 33 vol. -% liquid paraffin, or with a 0 · 12 wt-%Pb addition as sintering aid and no lubricant. It was found that additions of solid lubricants such as lithium stearate and acrawax to both the premixed (elemental) and prealloyed powders provided reasonable <b>green</b> <b>densities</b> of ~ 94 · 5 - 95 · 5 % TD, but had deleterious effect on sintered densities and microstructures, particularly under vacuum sintering. Other lubricants such as zinc stearate, stearic acid and liquid paraffin provided similar <b>green</b> <b>densities,</b> but higher sintered densities and less porous microstructures, particularly by sintering under pure nitrogen. The prealloyed compacts sintered under pure nitrogen consistently provided much higher sintered densities than elementally premixed compacts sintered under pure nitrogen or vacuum. It is therefore concluded that both lubricant type and sintering atmosphere will have a major effect on the sintered properties of the 6061 Al powder. Sintering under pure nitrogen resulted in higher sintered densities as compared with vacuum sintering for this grade of Al alloy.

These additives unlike the powder or the solvent are added in a very minor quantity, most of which is eliminated in the subsequent processing steps. In this project, different combinations of plasticiser (Polyethylene glycol) and binder (Polyvinyl alcohol) {{have been used for}} forming Alumina ceramics. PVA and PEG {{have been one of the}} most conventional pairs of binder and plasticiser used on Alumina system. This project aims to study the variation of these properties with the plasticiser amount. It was observed that with the increase in the plasticiser amount, the <b>green</b> <b>density</b> increased till it reached a maximum and then became independent of further additions, in some cases, even decreasing. This high <b>green</b> <b>density</b> led to high sintered density too. But the compositions having more than 0. 5 % PEG in spite of high <b>green</b> <b>density,</b> showed poor sintered density indicating that, as PEG vaporised out, it left pores, and even some residues which hindered densification while sintering. Therefore, the final density of the product depended on two mutually opposite factors: the high <b>green</b> <b>density</b> and the high amount of impurity left after PEG vaporised. Fired strength (like fired density) was the best for unplasticised sample. Still, highest green strength corresponded to 0. 25 % and 0. 5 % plasticiser (PEG) necessitating its use in green products. <b>Green</b> <b>density</b> showed an increasing trend, which reversed after firing, limiting the use of PEG to 0. 5 % in the batch...|$|E
40|$|Variation in <b>green</b> <b>density</b> and {{moisture}} content are relevant for log transport planning, weight-scaling systems, lumber drying and dynamic assessment of stiffness. The lack of published Australian {{reports on the}} subject prompted the present study (most studies with radiata pine {{have been carried out}} in New Zealand). Patterns of variation in <b>green</b> <b>density</b> {{and moisture}} content of radiata pine as influenced by age, site, thinning regime, height in the stem and season were investigated using paired stands of mature trees (34. 5 - 36. 5 y old) on contrasting sites and with various thinning regimes, and a stand of young trees (9 y old), in the Hume region of New South Wales. Destructive samples were taken from mature trees at successive heights in the stem, and from young trees at 1. 3 m. The effect of extended drought was included by using data from separate studies. The effect of <b>green</b> <b>density</b> variation on weight scaling was determined by calculating weight-to-volume conversions for a number of stands under two climatic scenarios. Under normal climate, sapwood <b>green</b> <b>density</b> averaged about 1100 kg m- 3 and showed little variation across ages, seasons, sites, thinning regimes and height in the stem. Sapwood saturation showed small but consistent differences with age, season and height in the stem, but practically no differences with site and thinning regime. For mature trees, sapwood saturation ranged from 90 % {{at the base of the}} tree to 92 - 94 % higher up in the stem, whereas for young trees it averaged 96 % at 1. 3 m height. Heartwood <b>green</b> <b>density</b> varied greatly with height in the stem, but showed no consistent differences with site and thinning regime; it ranged from about 550 to 630 kg m- 3 at 1. 3 m height across mature stands. Heartwood saturation averaged about 7 % at 1. 3 m, decreased from the base of the tree to 10. 5 m followed by an increase up the stem, was higher in the high-altitude site and decreased slightly from winter to summer. Whole-section <b>green</b> <b>density</b> was driven by the ratio of sapwood to heartwood that in turn was affected primarily by age and height in the stem, followed by site and to a lesser extent by thinning regime. Season exerted practically no effect on whole-section <b>green</b> <b>density.</b> Whole-section <b>green</b> <b>density</b> varied considerably between mature stands, ranging from 943 to 1023 kg m- 3 at 1. 3 m height, 928 to 996 kg m- 3 at 10. 5 m, and 960 to 1016 kg m- 3 at 16 m. Whole-section <b>green</b> <b>density</b> and thus weight-to-volume conversions were significantly affected by site, age and severe drought, but not by thinning regime nor season. Using a common conversion factor between contrasting sites would lead to errors of 3 - 5 %. The errors in applying such a factor to unthinned stands under severe drought would be 10 % (large trees), 12 % (average trees) and 25 % (suppressed trees). The errors for the 9 - 10. 5 -y-old trees under normal climate would be 8 - 10 % and up to 5 % under severe drought. If a separate conversion factor was set for young trees, conversions under severe drought would have an error of 9 - 13 %. It is then advisable to determine variations in <b>green</b> <b>density</b> at site and age levels in large plantation areas with a range of growing conditions and age classes, as well as to monitor changes during extended droughts...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{protocol}} for non-destructive assessment of <b>green</b> <b>density</b> and moisture content via increment cores was validated for young (8 – 10 years) and mature trees (36 years) of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.

Initial procedures involved comparing 5 - and 12 -mm cores with fresh disks taken from young trees at breast height and felled during the winter, {{as well as}} methods for rehydrating the wood cores. Subsequently, the best method (12 -mm cores) was validated with material collected in summer from both young and mature trees. The protocols developed require separate processing of sapwood and heartwood, and soaking the sapwood for 24 h to replace the moisture lost while coring. For young trees, bark-to-pith 12 -mm cores accounted for between 64 % and 66 % of variation in <b>green</b> <b>density</b> of sapwood and between 51 % and 72 % of saturation percentage, as measured by destructively sampled disks.
