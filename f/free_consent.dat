25|$|Laymen {{are not to}} {{take any}} part in the {{administration}} of church affairs without the <b>free</b> <b>consent</b> of the bishop. If they usurp any such authority and divert church goods to their own use or in any way frustrate the will of the donors; or if they, even under cover of the civil law, endeavour to wrest from the bishop's hands what has been confided to his care, then such laymen by that very fact fall under the censures constituted by the Council of Trent against usurpers of ecclesiastical goods.|$|E
500|$|After {{setting out}} {{a list of}} {{individual}} grievances and statutes that had been broken, the Petition of Right declares that Englishmen have various [...] "rights and liberties", and provides that no person {{should be forced to}} provide a gift, loan or tax without an Act of Parliament, that no free individual should be imprisoned or detained unless a cause has been shown, and that soldiers or members of the Royal Navy should not be billeted in private houses without the <b>free</b> <b>consent</b> of the owner. In relation to martial law, the Petition first repeated the due process chapter of Magna Carta, and then provided that: [...] This clause was directly addressed to the various commissions issued by Charles and his military commanders, restricting the use of martial law except in war or direct rebellion and prohibiting the formation of commissions. A state of war automatically activated martial law; as such, the only purpose for commissions, in their view, was to unjustly permit martial law in circumstances that did not require it.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} James F. Cooper, Jr., Congregationalism helped imbue {{the political}} culture of Massachusetts with several important concepts: [...] "adherence to fundamental or 'higher' laws, strict limitations upon all human authority, <b>free</b> <b>consent,</b> local self-government, and, especially, extensive lay participation." [...] However, congregational polity also meant {{the absence of any}} centralized church authority. The result was that at times the first generation of Congregationalists struggled to agree on common beliefs and practices. For example, specific rules on church membership and baptism requirements were still being debated into the late 1630s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marriage}} contract is concluded between the wali, or guardian, {{of the bride}} and bridegroom, not between bridegroom and bride [...] The wali of the bride can only be a free Muslim. The wali of the bride is normally a male relative of the bride, preferably her father. If the bride is a virgin, the wali mujbir, that is her father or paternal grandfather, can not force the bride into the marriage against her proclaimed will; according to most scholars. According to Khomeini and Ali al-Sistani, both Shia scholars (both having the degrees mujtahid and marja'), and also almost all contemporary scholars, the marriage is invalid without bride's <b>free</b> <b>consent</b> and no obligation can make marriage official and legal.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand was {{the second}} {{jurisdiction}} {{in the world to}} recognize aboriginal title, but a slew of extinguishing legislation (beginning with the New Zealand land confiscations) has left the Māori with little to claim except for river beds, lake beds, and the foreshore and seabed. In 1847, in a decision that was not appealed to the Privy Council, the Supreme Court of the colony of New Zealand recognized aboriginal title in R v Symonds. The decision was based on common law and the Treaty of Waitangi (1840). Chapman J went farther than any judgebefore or sincein declaring that aboriginal title [...] "cannot be extinguished (at least in times of peace) otherwise than by the <b>free</b> <b>consent</b> of the Native occupiers".|$|E

2500|$|The United States, while {{intending}} {{never to}} acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, {{and with their}} <b>free</b> <b>consent,</b> are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim {{from the state of}} nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If this be a spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain. [...] They will not suppose that that Government will avow, as the basis of their policy towards the United States a system of arresting their natural growth within their own territories, for the sake of preserving a perpetual desert for savages.|$|E

40|$|<b>Free</b> prior {{informed}} <b>consent</b> is {{a critical}} concept in enacting the rights of Indige- nous People according to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indig- enous Peoples. This paper outlines a case {{for the inclusion of}} <b>free</b> prior informed <b>consent</b> in World Heritage nomination processes and examines issues that are problematic when enacting <b>free</b> prior informed <b>consent.</b> Case research was used to analyse current issues in the potential nomination of certain areas of Cape York Peninsula, Australia. The authors’ reflexive engagement within this case offers insights into the praxis of developing a World Heritage nomina- tion consent process. The outcomes of this research were: preconditions need to be addressed to avoid self-exclusion by indigenous representative organisations; the nature of consent needs to account for issues of representation and Indige- nous ways of decision making; the power of veto needs to have formal recogni- tion in the nomination process; and prioritising self-determination within <b>free</b> prior informed <b>consent</b> ensures the intent of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The paper contributes to the human rights agenda of Indigenous People and conservation management processes by help- ing address the issues that will be raised during a World Heritage nomination process...|$|R
