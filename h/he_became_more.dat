5|$|Sjumandjaja {{was known}} as a heavy drinker, which contributed to his health issues. Starting with beer while in high school, he later {{switched}} to hard liquor despite suffering from liver issues while still in his teens. Towards the end of his life, when <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> religious, he drank less.|$|E

5|$|The {{birth of}} an heir {{produced}} changes in PedroII's character. Previously isolated and shy, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> outgoing and confident as monarch. His strained {{relationship with his}} wife, {{the product of a}} disappointing arranged marriage, also improved, and with children came shared domestic interests that developed into an affectionate friendship.|$|E
5|$|While Hillcourt studied {{pharmacy}} in Copenhagen, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{involved in}} Scouting. As a Scout leader, {{he became a}} Scoutmaster, national instructor, writer and then the editor for the Danish Scouting journal. He wrote his first book, The Island, recounting his early Scouting experiences.|$|E
5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E

50|$|For {{most of the}} book, Logan is an antihero; however, his {{character}} develops a sympathy towards Runners, and <b>he</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>more</b> of a traditional hero figure.|$|R
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} period he served {{on a number of}} {{government}} bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{improved}} {{significantly in}} his third season with the Colts, scoring his first century and taking 21 wickets, having managed only seven scalps in the two previous summers. In 1940–41, aged 19, he moved back to Prahran to play in their first grade team after the Colts were disbanded, and <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> productive {{over the next few}} years, taking 46 wickets in one season.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji's early {{preoccupation with}} the occult subsided, and <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{interested}} in other religions, {{although it is not}} known whether he practised any. He was enthusiastic about Parsi culture, but became disillusioned with Parsis after visiting India in 1932. He embraced only a few of aspects of Zoroastrianism, and in later years he was interested in Roman Catholicism, although he did not take it up. For much of his life he practised yoga, but it is not known what branch of it.|$|E
5|$|While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After {{two weeks}} in the hospital, Zimmermann became his {{full-time}} caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they went. After the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E
5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E

5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. <b>He</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E
5|$|However, after 1912 <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> {{radical and}} began to {{predicted}} the liberation of the Africans {{and the end of}} colonial rule, {{and began to}} foster closer links with a number of other independent African churches. From 1914, he preached more militant sermons, often referring to Old Testament themes, concentrating on such aspects as the Israelites' escape from slavery in Egypt , Chilembwe himself {{was not part of the}} apocalyptic Watch Tower movement, which was popular in central Africa at the time and later became known as Kitawala in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but some of his followers may have been influenced by it. The leader of Watch Tower, Charles Taze Russell had predicted that Armageddon would begin in October 1914, which some of Chilembwe’s followers equated to an end to colonial rule.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> involved in the writing of the songs later, particularly in conjunction with Adam Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E
5|$|Klein had {{the power}} to make or break {{academic}} careers, so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize. Because Klein refused to supervise him, Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor. Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners. Starting from his paper, Born developed the equations for the stability conditions. As <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> interested in the topic, he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally. On 13 June 1906, the rector announced that Born had won the prize. A month later, he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude.|$|E
5|$|Moving to Northern California, McNallen began {{a career}} as a school teacher; during the summer {{vacations}} he travelled the world as a military journalist, writing articles for Soldier of Fortune magazine. Concerned by what he saw as the growth of liberal, universalist ideas in Heathenry, he returned to active involvement in the Heathen movement in the mid-1990s, establishing the Asatrú Folk Assembly, which was headquartered in Grass Valley, California. In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite. He brought greater attention to his group after they became involved in the debate surrounding the Kennewick Man, arguing that it constituted evidence for a European presence in prehistoric America. In the 21st century <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>more</b> politically active, becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and a group promoting the rights of European Americans.|$|E
