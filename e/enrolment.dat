5|$|At universities, {{appointments}} to top posts were {{the subject of}} power struggles between the education ministry, the university boards and the National Socialist German Students' League. In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries, most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period. This was especially true of universities located in predominately Catholic regions. <b>Enrolment</b> at German universities declined from 104,000 students in 1931 to 41,000 in 1939, but <b>enrolment</b> in medical schools rose sharply as Jewish doctors {{had been forced to}} leave the profession, so medical graduates had good job prospects. From 1934, university students were required to attend frequent and time-consuming military training sessions run by the SA. First-year students also had to serve six months in a labour camp for the Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service); an additional ten weeks service were required of second-year students.|$|E

Unpublished higher education statistics from the Department of Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) is extracted at the specific and broad field of study level {{for the purposes of}} the analysis. Three main trends are noted. First, banking and finance courses are among the fastest growing business-related fields in Australia. On average, <b>enrolments</b> in banking and finance courses increased annually by some 17. 94 percent over the period, with postgraduate <b>enrolments</b> growing at an annual rate of 32. 34 percent, and undergraduate <b>enrolments</b> at 15. 25 percent. Second, while the composition of banking and finance <b>enrolments</b> has changed markedly during the last decade, female participation rates are lower than other business-related fields. Female <b>enrolments</b> currently make up less than one third of all research students in banking and finance. Finally, the share of <b>enrolments</b> by overseas and domestic fee-paying students has also increased. In 1998 only some 37. 30 percent of banking and finance course completions were by non-fee-paying students, whereas in all business-related programs this figure is slightly more than 60 percent. ...|$|R

5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in <b>enrolment</b> at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E

In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not <b>enrolment)</b> was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%.

By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its <b>enrolment</b> and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} baby boom and generous support from the public sector.

There have been at least 30 major reports on the issue of engineering <b>enrolments</b> in universities and a great many more on an allied issue, <b>enrolments</b> and achievement in science and maths areas at a secondary school level. Typically such reports are funded through government or private agencies at local, regional and national level, and their authors obtain access to significant numbers of respondents, and secondary data sources; however, because of their size and scope the reports are rarely synthesised.
