We {{provide evidence that}} an increase in government spending increases the job finding rate and reduces the separation rate, lowering unemployment in the U. S. by using a structural VAR model. We then develop a DSGE model with search frictions where job separation is endogenously determined. Our model can capture the empirical pattern of responses of the job finding, separation, and unemployment rates to a government spending shock. We also demonstrate that model’s predictions are in contrast with earlier studies that assume exogenous separation...|$|R

40|$|This paper re-visits {{effects of}} fiscal {{expansion}} on employment and unemployment {{by focusing on}} both hiring and <b>firing</b> <b>margins.</b> We develop a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with labor search frictions in which job separation is endogenously determined. We study effects of fiscal stimuli {{in the form of}} government spending and hiring subsidies. The prediction of our model is in contrast with earlier studies that assume exogenous job separation. First, our model generates a larger size of the impact of a government spending shock on labor market variables than the model without endogenous separation. Second, while an increase in hiring subsidies increases employment and reduces unemployment in the model without endogenous separation, it reduces employment and increases unemployment in our model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} the observed positive relationship between youth unemployment and the cost of firing workers. When the cost of firing workers is high, firms only fire when the present discounted value of future losses is high, in which case they gain little by postponing the firing decision in the hope that productivity will recover. The young workers are then the first to go due to their longer remaining tenure. In contrast, when the cost of firing workers is low, the present discounted value of future losses is small at the <b>firing</b> <b>margin</b> and firms may choose to wait in the hope of a recovery. In this case they may choose to fire the older workers first since the younger ones {{are more likely to be}} around when productivity recovers. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the huge {{cross-country}} differences in job losses during the recent crisis, we study how labor market duality - meaning the coexistence of "temporary" contracts with low firing costs and "permanent" contracts with high firing costs - affects labor market volatility. In a model of job creation and destruction based on Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), we show that a labor market with these two contract types is more volatile than an otherwise-identical economy with a single contract type. Calibrating our model to Spain, we find that unemployment fluctuates 21 % more under duality than it would in a unified economy with the same average firing cost, and 33 % more than it would in a unified economy with the same average unemployment rate. In our setup, employment grows gradually in booms, due to matching frictions, whereas the onset of a recession causes a burst of firing of "fragile" low-productivity jobs. Unlike permanent jobs, some newly-created temporary jobs are already near the <b>firing</b> <b>margin,</b> which makes temporary jobs {{more likely to be}} fragile and means they play a disproportionate role in employment fluctuations. Unifying the labor market makes all jobs behave more like the permanent component of the dual economy, and therefore decreases volatility. Unfortunately, it also raises unemployment; to avoid this, unification must be accompanied by a decrease in the average level of firing costs. Finally, we confirm that factors like unemployment benefits and wage rigidity also have a large, interacting effect on labor market volatility; in particular, higher unemployment benefits increase the impact of duality on volatility. firing costs, temporary jobs, unemployment volatility, matching model, endogenous separation...|$|R
40|$|Studies about ionic liquids {{are mostly}} focused on synthesis, characterization, and applications, however very limited {{research}} {{is dedicated to}} safety and even less on relating physico-chemical hazards. It is actually true that ionic liquids generally present good thermal stability and resistance to ignition. Even if they present superior <b>fire</b> safety <b>margins</b> compared to conventional solvents, combustibility of these materials do however exist, especially at high operating temperatures. In view of ionic liquids structures, fire induced toxicity and thermal threat can {{be an issue in}} case of an accidental fire scenario. This communication presents the results of combustion tests performed on some 15 ionic liquids in terms of ignitability, combustibility, actual heat release profiles and fire induced toxicity by use of the fire propagation apparatus also called Tewarson calorimetry. These systematic studies provide useful input data that can be incorporated into contextual risk assessment of ionic liquids...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Controlled {{rectifiers}} {{are widely}} used {{as a source of}} DC motors power supply. It is important to study motor characteristics when fed from such converters. Early work has studied single motor characteristics when fed from a converter. This paper is concerned with the study of an AC-DC full-controlled converter supplying separ-ately excited DC motor parallel with series DC motor loads. Continu-ous and discontinuous converter currents are considered. The critical firing angle is deduced. The <b>margin</b> <b>firing</b> angle that separates motor operation from generator operation of the separately excited machine is investigated. The performance characteristics have been derived and studied for each of: constant firing angle, constant torque of the separately excited motor and constant horsepower of the series motor.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{model for}} droplet combustion {{predicts that the}} square of the droplet diameter decreases linearly with time. It also predicts that a droplet of any size will burn to completion over a period of time. However, it has been known for some time that under certain conditions flames surrounding a droplet, in a quiescent environment, could extinguish because of insufficient residence time for the chemistry to proceed to completion. This type of extinction that occurs for smaller droplets has been studied extensively in the past. Large droplets, on the other hand, exhibit a different type of extinction where excessive radiative heat loss from the flame zone leads to extinction. This mode of "radiative extinction" was theoretically predicted for droplet burning by Chao et al. and was observed in recent space experiments in a quiescent environment. Thus far, the fundamental flammability limit prescribed by radiative extinction of liquid droplets has been measured only under quiescent environmental conditions. In many space platforms, however, ventilation systems produce small convective flows and understanding of the influences of this convection on the extinction process will help better define the radiative extinction flammability boundaries. Boundaries defined by experiments and captured using theoretical models could provide enhanced <b>fire</b> safety <b>margin</b> in space explor 1999063 d investigation of convective effects will help in interpretations of burning-rate data obtained during free-floated droplet combustion experiments with small residual velocities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Forest {{fires are}} a {{permanent}} threat in urban-forest interface areas and cause considerable environmental damage, especially in protected areas. An {{efficient way to}} assist decision-making to prevent an increase in forest fires is risk assessment using geographical information systems (GIS). The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the risk of forest fires in the municipality of Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, using remote sensing data and spatial analysis techniques implemented in a GIS. The procedures of the methodology are based on spatial analysis techniques to prepare maps of the likelihood of fire based on calculations of the Euclidean distance, the Kernel statistical method and fuzzy transformation and to combine these maps via the increasing diffuse overlay method. The results showed a high risk of forest <b>fires</b> on the <b>margins</b> of the urban area, rural settlements and main roads that cross the municipality, as well as the surrounding areas. It is concluded that the municipality of Bodoquena has a high risk of forest fires in areas with high biodiversity, especially the areas surrounding the Serra da Bodoquena National Park and Mato Grosso do Sul Pantanal...|$|R
40|$|The {{destructive}} {{nature of}} the [*]∼[*]  590   000  ha Horse river wildfire in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), northern Alberta, in May of 2016 motivated {{the investigation of the}} hydrometeorological conditions that preceded the fire. Historical climate and field hydrometeorological data from a moderate-rich fen watershed were used to (a)  identify whether the spring 2016 conditions were outside the range of natural variability for WBP climate cycles, (b)  explain the observed patterns in burn severity across the watershed, and (c)  identify whether fall and winter moisture signals observed in peatlands and lowland forests in the region are indicative of wildfire. Field hydrometeorological data from the fen watershed confirmed the presence of cumulative moisture deficits prior to the fire. Hydrogeological investigations highlighted the susceptibility of fen and upland areas to water table and soil moisture decline over rain-free periods (including winter), due to the watershed's reliance on supply from localized flow systems originating in topographic highs. Subtle changes in topographic position led to large changes in groundwater connectivity, leading to greater organic soil consumption by <b>fire</b> in wetland <b>margins</b> and at high elevations. The 2016 spring moisture conditions measured prior to the ignition of the fen watershed were not illustrated well by the Drought Code (DC) when standard overwintering procedures were applied. However, close agreement was found when default assumptions were replaced with measured duff soil moisture recharge and incorporated into the overwintering DC procedure. We conclude that accumulated moisture deficits dating back to the summer of 2015 led to the dry conditions that preceded the fire. The infrequent coinciding of several hydrometeorological conditions, including low autumn soil moisture, a modest snowpack, lack of spring precipitation, and high spring air temperatures and winds, ultimately led to the Horse river wildfire spreading widely and causing the observed burn patterns. Monitoring soil moisture at different land classes and watersheds would aid management strategies in the production of more accurate overwintered DC calculations, providing fire management agencies early warning signals ahead of severe spring wildfire seasons...|$|R
40|$|The Western Boreal Plains of Alberta (WBP) {{contains}} {{a mixture of}} peatlands and forests, with the latter dominated by trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Given the sub-humid climate of the WBP, where evapotranspiration (ET) often exceeds precipitation (P), uplands are usually dependent on peatlands for water supply. The process of hydraulic redistribution (HR), the transfer of water from one area to another through roots, is a mechanism by which aspen obtain moisture from peatlands. However, the effects of disturbances such as fire on this process remain unknown, and it is uncertain if connectivity between land units through HR continues post-fire. During May 2011, a wildfire affected 90 000 ha of north central Alberta including the Utikuma Region Study Area (URSA). Portions of a glacio-fluval outwash lake catchment was burned which included forests and a ~ 0. 5 ha peatland. Within {{one year after the}} fire, aspen were detected in peatlands and at peatland margins. The {{purpose of this study was}} to monitor aspen recovery across a burned hillslope, and determine if nutrients, soil moisture conditions, or both were sufficient to permit regeneration in peatlands. The role of aspen in peatlands in forest recovery was also investigated. Across recovering land units in 2013 and 2014, plot transpiration (Eplot) measurements were taken to evaluate stress levels where on average midslope (0. 42 mm hr- 1) > hilltops (0. 29 mm hr- 1) > riparian (0. 23 mm hr- 1) > peatlands (0. 095 mm hr- 1); similar trends were observed with leaf area and stem heights. To determine if aspen required excess nutrients for regeneration, plant available nitrate (NO 3 -), ammonium (NH 4 +), and water extractable phosphorus (Ext-P) were measured in both growing seasons. While Ext-P remained elevated with the highest levels in burned peatlands, aspen stem height and leaf area were not greatly dependent on P. Similarly, negative relationships with growth were observed with increasing soil moisture content (VWC). Although VWC was below field capacity (< 25 %) in forests, P. tremuloides were sustained through roots present, likely before <b>fire,</b> in peatland <b>margins</b> through hydraulic redistribution. Evidence for this was observed in oxygen (δ 18 O) and hydrogen (δ 2 H) isotopes (‰) where upland xylem and peat core signatures were - 10. 0 ‰, - 117. 8 ‰ and - 9. 2 ‰, - 114. 0 ‰, respectively, highlighting their importance in hydrologically connecting forests to water sources. This study showed that while peatlands were resource rich post-fire, aspen was able to regenerate in nutrient and moisture-poor forests and that peatlands are unsuitable areas for further re-establishment. This research also highlighted the significance of hydraulic redistribution to forest recovery. The continuation of HR and water table fluctuations however, may result in soil moisture changes and the encroachment of aspen. Therefore, peat margins post-disturbance may be at risk during succession resulting in margin loss...|$|R
