The opening theoretical part briefly mentions the legislation and manners in which both financial and physical assistance was provided to physically handicapped persons before the Social Services Act came into effect. The second part of the thesis describes matters relating to the provision of care allowances, namely the filing of requests, the course of proceedings for the granting of care allowances, the right to the payment of care allowances, degrees of dependency, and the purposes for which care allowances are intended. The third part introduces the <b>individual</b> <b>registered</b> providers in Milevsko, namely what services they have registered, to whom these services are meant to be provided, and what scope of services the registered providers provide. The practical part traces the particular manners in which care allowances are utilized by their recipients in social services.

40|$|Public {{concern about}} the {{earnings-related}} Canada Pension Plan has forced the Canadian government to move toward fuller funding, a new investment policy, and changes to benefits and administration. Together, the three initiatives, and particularly the first two, amount to a modest degree of marketization. The assumption behind the reform is that the Canada Pension Plan will remain public and mandatory but the change will create a board and an investment policy which are more sensitive to market pressures and less amendable to government interference. The Canada Pension Plan {{is one of three}} tiers of support for the elderly in retirement. It is a contributory social insurance scheme which protects against loss of income. The other two are a social allowance (Old Age Security) as well as an income tested benefit (Guaranteed Income Supplement) which provide basic income support and employment based retirement pension plans as well as group and <b>individual</b> <b>registered</b> retirement savings plans which supplement the other two tiers on a voluntary basis. This article examines the reform of the Canada Pension Plan. After a brief examination of Canada's retirement benefits in an international context, the article summarizes recent debates in Canada, government policies to develop fuller funding and new investment strategies, and reflections on possible developments in the future.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To examine {{socioeconomic}} {{differences in}} case fatality and prognosis of myocardial infarction (MI) events, and {{to estimate the}} contributions of incidence and case fatality to socioeconomic differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality.  DESIGN—A population-based MI register study.  METHODS—The FINMONICA MI Register recorded all MI events among persons aged 35 - 64 years in three areas of Finland during 1983 - 1992. A record linkage of the MI Register data with the files of Statistics Finland was performed to obtain information on socioeconomic indicators for each <b>individual</b> <b>registered.</b> First MI events (n= 8427) {{were included in the}} analyses.  MAIN RESULTS—The adjusted risk ratio of prehospital coronary death was 2. 11  (95 % CI 1. 82,  2. 46) among men and 1. 68  (1. 14,  2. 48) among women with low income compared with those with high income. Even among persons hospitalised alive the risk of death during the next 12  months was markedly higher in the low income group than in the high income group. Case fatality explained 51 % of the CHD mortality difference between the low and the high income groups among men and 38 % among women. Incidence contributed 49 % and 62 %, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—Considerable socioeconomic differences were observed in the case fatality of first coronary events both before hospitalisation and among patients hospitalised alive. Case fatality explained a half of the CHD mortality difference between the low and the high income groups among men and more than a third among women.    Keywords: socioeconomic status; myocardial infarction; case fatalit...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study that}} {{will focus on the}} {{possibility}} to learn information about a town and its inhabitants of the 18 th century by analyzing individual titles in the church records. The records that are used in this study are marriage registration administrated by the local church of the town of Uddevalla. The records are very detailed and each <b>individual</b> <b>registered</b> have a title, such as “tradesman” or “maiden”. Since the source are a registration of all the weddings that took place during the period of 1700 to 1749, the source gives very broad and valid information about the inhabitants of the town. By inspecting the titles of the individuals listed in the source, we learn that the town of Uddevalla had a lot of craftsmen, dragoons and public servants for the era. During the early years in the source the largest groups were farmers and farm-helpers as well as a large group of “young men”, lacking a title connected to a profession.   The variety of craftsmen increases steadily throughout the time period being studied, meaning {{that there were a lot}} more specialization among the craftsmen, as well as an increase in the total number of craftsmen in the wedding registry. The women’s titles are also studied in detail and absolute majority of the women had the title maid. Those women that were not maids possessed the titles of “jungfru”, meaning something similar to maiden. “Jungfru” were commonly married to men with a higher status kind of title, thus implying that these titles were of a high status themselves...|$|E
40|$|Politicians, and the public, are {{beginning}} to worry about how {{we will be able}} to finance health care and social security in an aging population, especially when the baby boom retires. Politicians are also worried about how much money is lost from tax revenues because of the tax advantages offered Employer-sponsored Retirement Pension Plans (RPPs) and <b>Individual</b> <b>Registered</b> Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs). Under these schemes, contributions (both employer and employee) within specified limits are tax deductible and investment income accrues tax free until the pension funds are taken as income. Thus, there is significant taxpayer participation in these schemes. While it is true that these Registered Pension Plans are costing the government tax revenues today, it is also true that the same schemes will create increased tax revenues for the government when the baby boom retires and turns their pension assets into taxable retirement income. This paper models the extent of the tax dollars being lost by the government today, but then goes on to project the extra revenue that will accrue to the government from these same pension plans when the baby boom retires. It then points out that these extra pension income dollars of tax revenue will come at exactly the time when the baby boom will need extra government support to pay for their increased health care delivery. In short, these two cash flows can be combined to create the perfect macroeconomic immunized portfolio. 1 The paper concludes by presenting a demographic solution to the problems associated with paying for taxed-financed social security (i. e. Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)). ...|$|E

40|$|Master of EducationThe nursing {{literature}} advocates {{lifelong learning}} through continuing {{education as a}} means to respond to the rapid changes in health care delivery and to ensure continued competence of registered nurses. With the rapid changes in scientific, technological and social environments, basic pre-registration nursing education is said to become obsolete within three to five years. Continuing education is a lifelong process that encompasses systematic, planned learning experiences beyond pre-registration education. In-service education is one component of continuing education that occurs in the workplace and focuses on providing the skills and knowledge the nurse requires to fulfil their current role. The purpose of this research was to identify the factors that encourage and discourage participation in in-service by the registered nurse. Health care agencies have an important role in providing in-service education is an important means to update and up skill registered nurses of constant changes in the nursing profession and the health care industry. The <b>individual</b> <b>registered</b> nurse has a professional obligation to the profession, community and themselves to participate in in-service education sessions for the in-service sessions to be effective and for quality patient care to be delivered. Currently there is very little literature on in-service education, thus it is imperative that further research is conducted on the topic, so in-service providers can plan effective, quality in-service programs that attract high participation from nurses. An explanatory multi-method approach was utilised to identify the factors that encourage and discourage nurses' participation at in-service education. The study found that nurses are usually influenced by a number of factors and not just one single factor in making their decision to participate in in-service education. The primary factors influencing participation are professional issues, topic relevance to practice and better meeting the needs of the patient, whilst discouraging factors include staff shortages, skill mix, inconvenient scheduling and busy shifts. The results of this study have important implications for in-service providers in planning and implementing an in-service education program that draws high levels of participation.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundNursing {{turnover}} is a {{major issue}} for health care managers, notably during the global nursing workforce shortage. Despite the often hierarchical structure of the data used in nursing studies, few studies have investigated {{the impact of the}} work environment on intention to leave using multilevel techniques. Also, differences between intentions to leave the current workplace or to leave the profession entirely have rarely been studied. ObjectiveThe aim of the current study was to investigate how aspects of the nurse practice environment and satisfaction with work schedule flexibility measured at different organisational levels influenced the intention to leave the profession or the workplace due to dissatisfaction. DesignMultilevel models were fitted using survey data from the RN 4 CAST project, which has a multi-country, multilevel, cross-sectional design. The data analysed here are based on a sample of 23, 076 registered nurses from 2020 units in 384 hospitals in 10 European countries (overall response rate: 59. 4 %). Four levels were available for analyses: country, hospital, unit, and <b>individual</b> <b>registered</b> nurse. Practice environment and satisfaction with schedule flexibility were aggregated and studied at the unit level. Gender, experience as registered nurse, full vs. part-time work, as well as individual deviance from unit mean in practice environment and satisfaction with work schedule flexibility, were included at the individual level. Both intention to leave the profession and the hospital due to dissatisfaction were studied. ResultsRegarding intention to leave current workplace, there is variability at both country (6. 9 %) and unit (6. 9 %) level. However, for intention to leave the profession we found less variability at the country (4. 6 %) and unit level (3. 9 %). Intention to leave the workplace was strongly related to unit level variables. Additionally, individual characteristics and deviance from unit mean regarding practice environment and satisfaction with schedule flexibility were related to both outcomes. Major limitations of the study are its cross-sectional design and the fact that only turnover intention due to dissatisfaction was studied. ConclusionsWe conclude that measures aiming to improve the practice environment and schedule flexibility would be a promising approach towards increased retention of registered nurses in both their current workplaces and the nursing profession as a whole and thus a way to counteract the nursing shortage across European countries...|$|E
