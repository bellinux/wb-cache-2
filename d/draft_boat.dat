500|$|The group {{remained}} {{on board the}} ship through the next day, a Sunday, for prayer and worship. The immigrants finally set foot on land at what became Provincetown on November 13. The first task was to rebuild a shallop, a shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boat</b> that had been built in England and disassembled for transport aboard the Mayflower. It would remain with the Pilgrims while the Mayflower returned to England. On November 15, Captain Myles Standish led a party of sixteen men on an exploratory mission, during which they disturbed a Native American grave and located a buried cache of Indian corn. The following week, Susanna White gave birth to son Peregrine White on the Mayflower. He was the first English child born to the Pilgrims in the New World. The shallop was finished on November 27, and a second expedition was undertaken using it, {{under the direction of}} Mayflower master Christopher Jones. Thirty-four men went, but the expedition was beset by bad weather; the only positive result was that they found a Native burial ground and corn that had been intended for the dead, taking the corn for future planting. A third expedition along Cape Cod left on December 6; it resulted in a skirmish with local Native Americans known as the [...] "First Encounter" [...] near modern-day Eastham, Massachusetts. The colonists decided to look elsewhere, having failed to secure a proper site for their settlement, and fearing that they had angered the local Native Americans by robbing their corn stores and firing upon them. The Mayflower left Provincetown Harbor and set sail for Plymouth Harbor.|$|E

50|$|These {{boats are}} known to be long and sleek to cut through the water fast and have {{extremely}} shallow <b>drafts.</b> <b>Boats</b> rang from 10 ft to upwards of 21 ft on the great lakes and rivers. They usually accompany two hunters at a time using the wind to catch a sail like blind {{in the front of the}} boat while also sculling to achieve greater speed.|$|R
50|$|At Great Falls, the Potomac {{presented}} physical {{obstacles to}} travel as well. Narrow and winding in places, it drops over 600 feet in 200 miles from Cumberland to sea level. Spring rains swell {{the river to}} dangerous heights; summer droughts can render it impassable. To make the river navigable by even shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boats,</b> the Patowmack Company had to dredge portions of the riverbed and skirt five areas of falls.|$|R
50|$|The {{cut through}} South Padre Island has shoaled {{considerably}} {{and as of}} early 2008, only shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boats</b> could safely enter at the Mansfield cut. The channel was dredged in the winter months of 2009-2010 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers using Federal relief money following Hurricanes Rita and Dolly. The channel is now 16-20 feet deep with all the dredge tailings making a beach {{on the north side}} of the jetty.|$|R
50|$|Flour Bluff is {{bordered on}} the East by the Laguna Madre, {{renowned for its}} fine Red Drum, (or Redfish) and Trout fishing.

If you have a deeper <b>draft</b> <b>boat,</b> come in from the bay. If shallower, use the channel that parallels Flour Bluff {{to the north of the}} JFK - it's on any map. There are several shallow humps, so a map is much better than coordinates.|$|E
5000|$|Point England is {{well known}} for its {{extensive}} 25 hectare bird sanctuary, Tahuna Torea (gathering place of the oyster catcher), located on the large triangular sandspit which protrudes 1.5 kilometre into the Tamaki Estuary. Following a council suggestion this area be turned into a residential marina in the 1980s, a group of activists led by Ronald Lockley, persuaded the council to create a wildlife reserve with extensive walk ways. Many species of birds including oyster catchers, pied stilts, gulls, plovers, herons, mallard and grey ducks are found in the area. In the higher bush areas are tui, moreporks, fantails, grey warblers and silver eyes. At low tide it is possible to walk east towards the Bucklands Beach Junior Yacht Club which is located 300 m on {{the eastern side of the}} Tamaki River. About 20% of the spit is consolidated with native plants that are largely above high tide. The remainder is sand that is uncovered at low tide. The whole spit can be walked in [...] hours or the board walk in 40 minutes. A good view is to be seen from the Godwit lookout. Nearby on the north side is a protected Maori Camp or whakaruruhau. The area can be accessed from Vista Crescent, Riddell Rd Walkway or West Tamaki Road or from the Tamaki estuary using a shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boat.</b> Care should be taken at the east end of the spit as the water is 22 m deep and very swift at low tide.|$|E

50|$|When {{the first}} state {{assembly}} adjourned at St. Stephens on February 14, 1818, many Alabama residents thought the capital should be moved to a more central location. Tuscaloosa was under consideration when Governor William Wyatt Bibb made the announcement in 1819 that the capital would be moved to Cahaba. This spelled certain doom for St. Stephens. In addition, the development of shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boats</b> permitted travelers to pass over the shoals and venture further upriver past the town. Lastly, yellow fever outbreaks decimated the citizenry.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pontoon bridge}} is a {{collection}} of specialized, shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boats</b> or floats, connected together to cross a river or canal, with a track or deck attached on top. The water buoyancy supports the boats, limiting the maximum load to the total and point buoyancy of the pontoons or boats. [...] The supporting boats or floats can be open or closed, temporary or permanent in installation, and made of rubber, metal, wood, or concrete. The decking may be temporary or permanent, and constructed out of wood, modular metal, or asphalt or concrete over a metal frame.|$|R
50|$|Alligators were scow-shaped, shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boats,</b> {{fitted with}} side mounted paddle wheels, {{powered by a}} 20-horsepower steam engine and {{provided}} with a cable winch and large anchor. By using the winch Alligators could pull themselves over land, around portages and {{up as much as}} a 20 degree incline at the rate of 1 to 2½ miles per day. They could haul a boom of some 60,000 logs across water against all but the strongest winds. They were heavily but simply built, making rebuilding and repair easy. Alligators began with paddle wheel propulsion. Later versions used screw propellers and diesel engines in place of steam.|$|R
50|$|After {{about four}} weeks, word {{came for the}} Confederate prisoners to prepare to embark for Fort Monroe, Virginia, on July 31. They were then to proceed up the James River on shallow <b>draft</b> <b>boats</b> and finally go to Aiken's Landing for exchange. They could walk the last {{thirteen}} miles to Richmond. The ill would be transported to the City Point and taken by rail to the capital. All went as planned. The prisoners were on the James River by August 3 and knew they would soon be heading home. Whelan arrived at City Point with the sick and on August 8 was unconditionally released. He then went to Aiken's Landing to join those of his company who were being exchanged on August 12.|$|R

50|$|As {{an island}} with no dock, Sandy Point can be {{somewhat}} difficult to access. The island is most easily reached by kayak or by a boat with a shallow <b>draft.</b> Larger <b>boats</b> {{can also be}} taken to the island, but boaters must drop anchor offshore and then row or swim to the beach.|$|R
25|$|The Union fleet {{conducted}} explorations {{among the}} Atlantic inlets and coastal marshes by shallow <b>draft</b> ships, <b>boats</b> and monitors. But {{when they came}} up against earthworks such as Fort McAllister just south of Savannah, their efforts using bombardment alone were fruitless. The Federals would not advance on Savannah until General William T. Sherman’s March from the interior in 1864.|$|R
