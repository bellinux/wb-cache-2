5|$|Today, Oldham has large {{communities}} with heritage from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan {{and parts of}} the Caribbean. At the time of the 2001 census, over one in four of its residents identified themselves as from a South Asian or British Asian ethnic group. Cultural divisions along <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are strong within the town, with poor cross-community integration and cohesion along Asian and white backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic {{heritage}} cooking, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, {{has made}} a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society. Apart from home cooking, many ethnic foods are now available in street markets, supermarkets and restaurants, or are served at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and people increasingly eat foods from <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> other than their own. Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups is becoming standard as a multi-ethnic food culture develops.|$|E
5|$|Polyethnicity {{refers to}} the {{proximity}} of people from different <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> within a country or other specific geographic region. It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of immigration, intermarriage, trade, conquest and post-war land-divisions. This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions.|$|E
5|$|Presently, most {{armed forces}} are {{composed}} of people from different <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> They {{are considered to be}} polyethnic due to the differences in race, ethnicity, language or background. While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, the former USSR and China. Polyethnic {{armed forces are}} not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic forces have been in existence since the ancient Roman Empire, Middle Eastern Empires and even the Mongol Khans. The U.S. Military {{was one of the first}} modern militaries to begin ethnic integration, by order of President Truman in 1945.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} to not feature {{either of the two}} previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, who had run against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city.|$|E

5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in the age}} of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD), {{the ancient}} Romans, {{including}} authors such as Pliny the Elder, mentioned contacts with the Seres, who they identified as the producers of silk from distant East Asia and could have been the Chinese or even any number of middlemen of various <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds</b> along the Silk Road of Central Asia and Northwest China. The Eastern-Han era Chinese general Ban Chao, Protector General of the Western Regions, explored Central Asia and in 97 AD dispatched his envoys Gan Ying to Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). Gan was dissuaded by Parthian authorities to venture further than the Persian Gulf, although he wrote a detailed report about the Roman Empire, its cities, postal network, and consular system of government, and presented this to the Han court. Subsequently, there were a series of Roman embassies in China lasting from the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, as recorded in Chinese sources. In 166 AD the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD), claiming they represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Andun 安敦) (r. 161–180 AD). Historian Rafe de Crespigny speculates that they were Roman merchants instead of official diplomats.|$|E
25|$|Organized social nudity usually attracts {{more people}} of European <b>ethnic</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> This {{may be due}} to it {{becoming}} a social movement in Europe, before spreading {{to other parts of the}} world.
