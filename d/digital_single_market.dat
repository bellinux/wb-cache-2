Such practices would be against the <b>Digital</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Market</b> initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group buys a number of keys in regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to profit on the difference, outside of European oversight and tax laws.|$|E

40|$|Authenticating onto systems, {{connecting}} to mobile networks and providing identity data to access services is common ground for most EU citizens, however what is disruptive is that digital technologies fundamentally alter and upset the ways identity is managed, by people, companies and governments. Technological progress in cryptography, identity systems design, smart card design and mobile phone authentication {{have been developed}} as a convenient and reliable answer {{to the need for}} authentication. Yet, these advances ar enot sufficient to satisfy the needs across people's many spheres of activity: work, leisure, health, social activities nor have they been used to enable cross-border service implementation in the <b>Single</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Market,</b> or to ensure trust in cross border eCommerce. The study findings assert that the potentially great added value of eID technologies in enabling the Digital Economy has not yet been fulfilled, and fresh efforts are needed to build identification and authentication systems that people can live with, trust and use. The study finds that usability, minimum disclosure and portability, essential features of future systems, are at the margin of the market and cross-country, cross-sector eID systems for business and public service are only in their infancy. This report joins up the dots, and provides significant exploratory evidence of the potential of eID for the <b>Single</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Market.</b> A clear understanding of this market is crucial for policy action on identification and authentication, eSignature and interoperability.

40|$|Europe's {{failure to}} specialise in new ICT sectors and firms {{is likely to}} hold back Europe’s post-crisis recovery. Europe lacks in {{particular}} leading platform providers, who are capturing most of the value in the new ICT ecosystem. • In-depth analysis of some specific new emerging ICT sectors shows that the problem in Europe appears {{not to be so}} much in the generation of new ideas, but rather in brin-ging ideas successfully to market. Among the barriers are the lack of a <b>single</b> <b>digital</b> <b>market,</b> fragmented intellectual property regimes, lack of an entrepreneurial culture, limited access to risk capital and an absence of ICT clusters. • The EU policy framework, particularly the Innovation Union and Digital Agenda EU 2020 Flagships, could better leverage the growth power for Europe of new ICT markets. The emphasis should move beyond providing support for infrastructure and research, to funding programmes for pre-commercial projects. But perhaps most important is dealing with the fragmentation in European digital markets. Reinhilde Veugeler...|$|R
