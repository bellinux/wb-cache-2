The latest update was on 19 March 2013.|$|E
5|$|On the {{geological}} timescale, the Marcellus {{occurs in the}} Middle Devonian epoch, of the Devonian period, in the Paleozoic era, of the Phanerozoic eon.

5|$|The Fortingall Yew is {{an ancient}} tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire.

This still makes it the oldest tree in Europe, although there is an older Norway Spruce root system in Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. <b>Its</b> <b>age</b> has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of <b>its</b> <b>age.</b> Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine <b>its</b> <b>age</b> and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E

5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{discovered}} in the Candeleros Formation, which was deposited during the Early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 98 to 97 million years ago, although Holtz provided an earlier lower bound for <b>its</b> <b>age</b> of 99.6 million years. This formation is the lowest unit in the Neuquén Group, wherein {{it is part of}} the Río Limay Subgroup. The formation is composed of coarse and medium-grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment (associated with rivers and streams), and in aeolian conditions (effected by wind). Paleosols (buried soil), siltstones, and claystones are present, some of which represent swamp conditions.|$|E
5|$|In May 1840, {{while serving}} as Prince Sturdza's private secretary, he became co-director (with Alecsandri and Negruzzi) of the National Theater Iași. This {{followed}} the monarch's decision to unite the two existing theaters in the city, one of which hosted plays in French, into a single institution. In later years, this venue, which staged popular comedies based on the French repertory of <b>its</b> <b>age</b> and had become {{the most popular of}} its kind in the country, also hosted Alecsandri's debut as a playwright. Progressively, it also became subject to Sturdza's censorship.|$|E
5|$|Later, between 2009 and 2011, {{another team}} of astronomers {{observed}} WASP-13b and WASP-21b {{to find what}} caused some Hot Jupiters to have anomalously high radii. The RISE photometric camera on the Liverpool Telescope was used to detect further transits. Two partial transits and two full transits were observed during this period, although the quality of both full transits was slightly compromised because of passing cloud cover. The collected observations, along with the JGT observations {{that were used to}} confirm the planet, were scaled to filter out errors such as background noise. The data was then used to re-define WASP-13b's parameters, including <b>its</b> <b>age,</b> mass, radius, and density. The study also noted that a limb darkening effect was present, a characteristic that may affect future atmospheric studies of the planet.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as <b>its</b> <b>age.</b> Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with <b>its</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{also had}} the ability to {{converse}} with spectators using a letter board. The director, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, was able to do this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung (or On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica).
