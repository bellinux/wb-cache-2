5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bond disguises {{himself as}} one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy Miami Beach. Bond is {{discovered}} by Largo, but rescued by Leiter, who orders the United States Coast Guard to parachute to the area via US Air Force transport aircraft. After an underwater battle, the henchmen surrender. Largo escapes to his ship, which h{{as one of}} the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on underwater. The ship is pursued by Royal Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels, but Largo jettisons the rear of the ship, revealing the front as a hydrofoil as it escapes. Bond fights Largo on board, and he is about to shoot Bond when Domino, freed by Largo's nuclear physicist Ladislav Kutze, shoots Largo with a <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun.</b> Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard, and the boat runs aground and explodes. A sky hook-equipped CIA B-17 aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.|$|E

5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} {{can use a}} variety of weapons, {{including}} dual pistols, dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> for underwater use. The dual pistols have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and must be found in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to use stealth, before recovering her pistols later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a memory card and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.|$|E
25|$|Between the wars, several Norwegian gunsmiths {{attempted}} to create harpoon guns, intended for hunting seals and shooting rescue lines to boats in distress. Seeing a ready market, and {{having access to}} the several thousand Jarmanns in storage, Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk designed a <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> {{referred to as the}} M28.|$|E

50|$|The ship {{provided}} by Svend Foyn was the Antarctic, a three masts barque {{equipped with a}} steam engine. It was also equipped with eleven <b>harpoon</b> <b>guns,</b> an arsenal of explosives, eight whaleboats and a thirty-one man crew. The ship was captained by Leonard Kristensen (1857-1911). The crew included Carsten Borchgrevink, who later lead the Southern Cross Expedition to Antarctica.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the standard version, a Limited Edition of the game could be purchased. This edition features additional in-game missions and an Impaler <b>Harpoon</b> <b>Gun.</b> The Limited Edition was a free upgrade for players who pre-ordered the game. A Kyrat Edition was also announced and it contains a collector's box, a poster, a journal, a map of Kyrat, a figurine of Pagan Min, and the missions from the Limited Edition. Players can also purchase a season pass for the game, which grants them access to additional content, including a new competitive multiplayer mode, a mission called [...] "the Syringe", the missions from the Limited Edition, and the two other pieces of downloadable content.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} that Borchgrevink joined was organised by Henryk Bull, a Norwegian {{businessman and}} entrepreneur who, like Borchgrevink, {{had settled in}} Australia in the late 1880s. Bull planned to make a sealing and whaling voyage into Antarctic waters; after failing to interest Melbourne's learned societies in a cost-sharing venture of a commercial–scientific nature, he returned to Norway to organise his expedition there. He met Svend Foyn, the 84-year-old [...] "father of modern whaling" [...] and inventor of the <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun.</b> With Foyn's help he acquired the whaler Kap Nor ("North Cape"), which he renamed Antarctic. Bull hired an experienced whaling captain, Leonard Kristensen, and with a crew and a small scientific team left Norway in September 1893. [...] When Borchgrevink learned that Antarctic was due to visit Melbourne in September 1894, he hurried there {{hoping to find a}} vacancy. He was fortunate; William Speirs Bruce, later an Antarctic expedition leader in his own right, had intended to join Bull's expedition as a natural scientist but could not reach the ship before it left Norway. This created an opening for Borchgrevink, who met Bull in Melbourne and persuaded him to take him on as a deck-hand and part-time scientist.|$|E

2500|$|The {{work was}} immensely tiring and complicated, {{embracing}} everything from seamanship to whale-hunting (with metal <b>harpoon</b> <b>guns)</b> to complex logistics. In {{the winter of}} 1896, the crews of several ships faced starvation as the frozen seas prevented the ships from reprovisioning. [...] "These two vessels were in such desperate straits for food {{in the fall of}} 1897", wrote First Lieut. D. H. Jarvis of the Overland Relief Expedition of 1898, [...] "that it took heroic work to keep them supplied, and Captains Leavitt and McKenna are deserving of great credit for the ways they brought their crews through." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the war the {{buildings}} were bought by B.C.Packers and whaling operations began. Whales were harpooned by a fleet of up to 5 small [...] "chasers" [...] with <b>harpoon</b> <b>guns.</b> Whales were brought up by steam windlass on the main slipway formerly used by planes and then flensed on the main concourse and processed in the main buildings. Japanese whalers operated jointly with Canadian partners. The Taiyo group operated the Coal Harbour fisheries from 1962 to 1967 using a land station at Coal Harbor. They caught mostly sei (2153), sperm (1108), and fin (837) whales. Some blue and humpback whales were also taken. The plant was powered by two World War II US destroyer steam engines.|$|R
50|$|At first slow whales {{were caught}} by men hurling {{harpoons}} from small open boats. Early <b>harpoon</b> <b>guns</b> were unsuccessful until Norwegian Svend Foyn invented a new, improved version in 1863 that used a harpoon with a flexible joint between {{the head and}} shaft. Norway invented many new techniques and disseminated them worldwide. Cannon-fired harpoons, strong cables, and steam winches were mounted on maneuverable, steam-powered catcher boats. They made possible the targeting of large and fast-swimming whale species that were taken to shore-based stations for processing. Breech-loading cannons were introduced in 1925; pistons were introduced in 1947 to reduce recoil. These highly efficient devices were too successful, for they reduced whale populations {{to the point where}} large-scale commercial whaling became unsustainable.|$|R

50|$|He {{tried again}} in 1866 and 1867, {{but he could}} not catch a single whale in the former season and only caught one whale the latter, while two others were killed but lost. Experimenting with a <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> that fired a grenade and harpoon at the same time, Foyn was able to catch thirty whales in 1868. He {{patented}} his grenade-tipped <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> two years later.|$|E
50|$|W.W. Greener {{also used}} the Martini action to produce the Greener-Martini Light <b>Harpoon</b> <b>Gun</b> used for whaling, and also for {{commercial}} harvest of tuna and other large fish. The gun fired a blank cartridge to propel the harpoon. A special barrel and stock were fitted to accommodate the harpoon and to lower weight. A Greener <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> is used by Quint in the 1975 movie Jaws.|$|E
2500|$|The Jarmann M1884 is a Norwegian bolt-action repeating rifle {{designed}} in 1878 adopted in 1884. The Jarmann {{is the first}} centerfire, repeating bolt-action rifle, adopted as standard issue based on an entirely new design. Earlier rifles like the Swiss Vetterli used rimfire cartridges, the Winchester Hotchkiss and early models of the Remington Lee saw only limited military use, the German Mauser Model 71/84 and early Kropatschek rifles were based on earlier designs. The Jarmann's adoption, and subsequent modifications, turned the Norwegian Army from a fighting force armed with single-shot black-powder weapons into a force armed with modern repeating weapons firing smokeless ammunition. Several thousand were manufactured to equip both Norwegian and Swedish forces in the 1880s. The design is unique, and {{was the brainchild of}} Norwegian engineer Jacob Smith Jarmann. After the design had been phased out of the Norwegian Army, a number of the weapons were rebuilt as <b>harpoon</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1968, {{larger numbers}} of minke whales were caught off Natal, South Africa, mainly to {{supplement}} the dwindling supply of larger species, particularly the sei whale. A total of 1,113 whales (nearly all Antarctic minke, but a few dwarf minke as well) were caught off the province between 1968 and 1975, with a peak of 199 in 1971. They were taken by whale catchers of 539 to 593 gross tons with 90 mm <b>harpoon</b> <b>guns</b> mounted on their bows, which {{brought them to the}} whaling station at Durban (...) for processing. Gunners refused to take minkes early in the day, because sharks devoured any minke carcasses that were flagged, forcing the catchers to tow them during the chasing of other whales and thus slowing them down. They also could not use asdic, as it frightened them and lead to protracted chases. The season lasted from February to September, with a peak in the last month of the season.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{commercial}} whaling era, from 1950-51 to 1986-87, 97,866 minke whales (the vast majority probably Antarctic minkes) {{were caught in}} the Southern Ocean - mainly by the Japanese and Soviets - with a peak of 7,900 being reached in 1976-77. <b>Harpoon</b> <b>guns</b> of lesser caliber and [...] "cold harpoons" [...] (harpoons without explosive shells) had to be used due to their small size, while no air was pumped into the carcasses when they were tied alongside for towing to ensure the greatest quality of meat. While an expedition or two was fitted out each year specifically for minke whales - the Jinyo Maru in 1971-72, the Chiyo Maru from 1972-73 to 1974-75, and the Kyokusei Maru in 1973-74 - most expeditions, which targeted other species, ignored minkes during the peak of the whaling season (November-December and late February to early March) and only caught them on whaling grounds relatively close to those of larger ones - the minke whaling grounds were much further south (south of 60°S) than those for fin and sei whales.|$|R
50|$|Between the wars, several Norwegian gunsmiths {{attempted}} to create harpoon guns, intended for hunting seals and shooting rescue lines to boats in distress. Seeing a ready market, and {{having access to}} the several thousand Jarmanns in storage, Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk designed a <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> {{referred to as the}} M28. As part of the rebuild, the magazine and the repeating mechanism were removed, and the handguard and barrel were shortened. In addition, a heavy rubber shoulderpad was added to reduce the considerable recoil. The rifle could still fire the ordinary 10.15 x 61R cartridge after the conversion. A box could be mounted under the handguard containing up to 300 m of thin rope. Kongsberg manufactured the M28 <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> until 1952, when they started using the Mauser 98 mechanism in a new <b>harpoon</b> <b>gun</b> called the M52. The sources indicate that around 1,911 Jarmann rifles were modified to M28s, about half of them after World War II.|$|E

5000|$|The Western Australian Government {{granted a}} license to a Norwegian company in 1912 to operate whaling {{stations}} at Frenchman Bay near Albany and Point Cloates (then known as Norwegian Bay) off North West Cape. The company traded profitably {{for a number of}} years by making use of the recently invented exploding <b>harpoon</b> and <b>gun</b> on steam powered chaser boats, rather than the old toggling harpoons. [...] Approximately 4,000 whales were caught in that period.|$|R
50|$|In 1870, a Norwegian {{man named}} Svend Foyn {{successfully}} patented and pioneered the modern exploding whaling <b>harpoon</b> and <b>gun.</b> His basic design {{is still in}} use today. He perceived the failings of other methods and solved these problems in his own system. He included, {{with the help of}} H.M.T. Esmark, a grenade tip that exploded inside the whale. This harpoon design also utilized a shaft that was connected to the head with a moveable joint. His original cannons were muzzle-loaded with special padding and also used a unique form of gunpowder. The cannons were later replaced with safer breech-loading types.|$|R
5000|$|He later {{designed}} a whale harpoon which he carved into a wooden model. He subsequently travelled to Tønsberg {{to meet with}} whaling and shipping magnate Svend Foyn to present him with the model of a proposed grenade harpoon.

In 1870, Svend Foyn successfully patented and pioneered the modern exploding whaling <b>harpoon</b> and <b>gun.</b> He industrialized production and use of the deck cannons and heavy-caliber harpoons. Erik Eriksen gained neither profits nor the honor for his contribution as Foyn had financed production and development of the harpoon and it was designed while Eriksen was employed by him. However, Svend Foyn did provide financial assistance to Eriksen's family in Hammerfest.|$|R
