5|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> is {{a fictional}} {{political}} conspiracy thriller {{about what happened}} during the Maralinga tests.|$|E
5|$|Operation Crossroads {{began with}} the first blast (Test Able), an air burst on 1 July 1946; Nagato was not close to <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> and was only lightly damaged. For Test Baker, an {{underwater}} explosion, the ship was positioned closer to <b>ground</b> <b>zero.</b> Nagato rode out the tsunami {{of water from the}} explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July. Opened to divers in 1996, The Times has named Nagato {{as one of the top}} 10 wreck diving sites in the world.|$|E

5|$|Dodd's career {{returned}} to politically contentious Indigenous issues {{when he played}} a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film Deadly. This film is a police drama based around {{the death of an}} Indigenous man in police custody. As in <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero,</b> the subject was very topical: the movie was released {{at the same time as}} the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which had for four years been examining why so many Indigenous Australians died in police detention.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} gather {{research}} for the series, Hoshino once visited New York as she believes the city left a deep influence in her works. She also visited graveyards since she never had resources for the series. The <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks also left a big impression in her based on the guides' comments. Hoshino commented she would rather go again as {{she did not have}} much time to stay in New York.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, {{who was at}} a {{restaurant}} with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed. The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|The Hiroshima {{authorities}} took {{advice about}} the city's reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, suggested they build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near <b>ground</b> <b>zero,</b> that point directly below {{the explosion of}} the atomic bomb. In 1949 the authorities enacted the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Reconstruction Act, which gave the city access to special grant aid, and in August 1949, an international competition was announced for the design of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|Before the Rove sediments {{were laid}} down, during the Archean Eon, the Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this {{boundary}} is the Great Lakes tectonic zone. Several million years later {{a thin layer}} of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited on top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale.|$|E
5000|$|Solid Snake is featured/mentioned in Metal Gear Solid V: <b>Ground</b> <b>Zeroes</b> and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The unlockable bonus mission [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] on the PlayStation {{platform}} and later Xbox platform of <b>Ground</b> <b>Zeroes</b> in which Big Boss must re-enact situations {{from the original}} Metal Gear Solid game and answer a series of trivia questions after fulfilling them. If all the questions are answered correctly on the Normal difficulty setting, the mission can be replayed with Big Boss's standard character model replaced with Snake's Metal Gear Solid low-polygon model. The Phantom Pain shows that Snake's Metal Gear Solid low-polygon model can be an alternate outfit for Venom Snake after transferring the save data from <b>Ground</b> <b>Zeroes.</b> David is also alluded in association with Eli during conversation between Big Boss and Ocelot.|$|R

5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at <b>ground</b> <b>zero.</b> The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E
5|$|In September 1953, about 650 people {{attended}} the first Trinity Site open house. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house {{are allowed to}} see the <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> and McDonald Ranch House areas. More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is {{about half of the}} total radiation exposure which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.|$|E
5|$|The America's Response Monument, a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue {{commemorating the}} actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces {{in the first few}} weeks of the War in Afghanistan, was {{unveiled}} to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was displayed on a float, which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street. It was dedicated that same day, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero.</b>|$|E

Instead, Hollywood actor and producer Kiefer Sutherland portrayed the character through voice acting and facial capture.|$|R
5|$|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith was not {{the only}} film in which Dodd {{appeared}} that addressed topical Indigenous issues of the day. A decade after Jimmie Blacksmith, Dodd performed in <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero,</b> again with Jack Thompson in one of the lead roles. This film is a thriller based on claims that Indigenous Australians were used as human guinea pigs in the British nuclear tests at Maralinga. The film uses as its context the McClelland Royal Commission, which was investigating radioactive contamination at the site. In the film, Dodd plays a minor character named Freddy Tjapaljarri.|$|E
5|$|When {{the search}} for {{survivors}} ended, authorities closed Salta Street. Engineers began checking the buildings at <b>ground</b> <b>zero,</b> trying to restore the original layout {{of the street and}} demolishing unstable structures. Secretary of Public Works Omar Saab said that the two remaining buildings were beyond repair and had to be demolished. As a sign of respect, the demolition would not be carried out with explosives. Secretary of Housing Gustavo Leone estimated that the work would take nearly six months. People were allowed to enter their destroyed houses in small groups at a time, starting on August 9. Nearby streets began to be reopened on August 13.|$|E
5|$|Rescue {{workers at}} the World Trade Center site began to {{discover}} body fragments from Flight11 victims {{within days of the}} attack. Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats and discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands bound, suggesting the hijackers might have used plastic handcuffs. Within a year, medical examiners had identified the remains of 33victims who had been on board Flight11. They identified two other Flight11 victims, including purser Karen Martin, in 2006, while other unrelated body fragments were discovered near <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> around the same time. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E

5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero,</b> a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Elements of D.Gray-man first {{appeared}} in Hoshino's one-shot title, Zone, in which the Akuma, the exorcists, and the Millennium Earl plan to end the world. Although Allen Walker is male, his character is based on Zone female protagonist. Lavi {{is based on the}} protagonist of Hoshino's planned series, Book-man, that she originally wanted to write. Other characters, such as the Millennium Earl, Lenalee Lee, and Komui Lee, are based on real people whom Hoshino has not specifically identified; some are well-known scientists, and Komui is based on Hoshino's boss. The character of Yu Kanda, based on a samurai, was created to vary D.Gray-mans Western setting. Hoshino found the design of some characters difficult early in the series. In 2011, the author visited New York for research, and believed that the city had greatly influenced her work. Hoshino visited cemeteries, and was deeply impressed by her guides' comments at <b>Ground</b> <b>zero</b> of the World Trade Center (left after the September 11 attacks). She said that she would like to spend more time in New York to gather data for the series.|$|E
5|$|The Injustice: Gods Among Us {{comic book}} series was {{announced}} by Ed Boon on October 5, 2012, during the EB Games Expo. The series {{serves as a}} prequel detailing the {{events leading up to}} the game, as well as those that happen in the interregnum between Superman's murder of the Joker and the discovery of the primary universe. The series was first written by Tom Taylor and illustrated by a number of artists, including Jheremy Raapack, Mike S. Miller, Bruno Redondo, Tom Derenick, and others. The comic was released digitally beginning on January 15, 2013. The series was later issued in regular comic book form, and eventually a collected edition. In December 2014, Tom Taylor announced that he would be leaving the series and left after writing Injustice: Year Three #14, with Brian Buccellato replacing him by continuing the story into Year Four and Five. The final chapter of the series was released in September 2016, leaving the story incomplete; another comic book series, titled Injustice: <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero,</b> followed afterwards, which picked up the story and concluded the retelling of the game's events from Harley Quinn's perspective.|$|E
