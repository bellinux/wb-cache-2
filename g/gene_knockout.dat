25|$|Gene {{insertion}} {{is cheaper}} {{to carry out}} than <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b> But as the silencing is sometimes non-specific and has off-target effects on other genes, it provides less reliable results. Animal host vectors also play an important role.|$|E
25|$|Different {{laboratories}} {{have shown}} that the Ndc80 complex is essential for stabilization of the kinetochore-microtubule anchoring, required to support the centromeric tension implicated in the establishment of the correct chromosome congression in high eukaryotes. Cells with impaired function of Ndc80 (using RNAi, <b>gene</b> <b>knockout,</b> or antibody microinjection) have abnormally long spindles, lack of tension between sister kinetochores, chromosomes unable to congregate at the metaphase plate and few or any associated kMTs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> are {{a common}} tool used to study gene {{function}} in various organisms. However, designing <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> is complicated in viruses, which frequently contain sequences that code for multiple overlapping genes. Designing mutants that can be traced by {{the creation of new}} or elimination of existing restriction sites further compounds the difficulty in experimental design of <b>knockouts</b> of overlapping <b>genes.</b> While software is available to rapidly identify restriction sites in a given nucleotide sequence, no existing software addresses experimental design of mutations involving multiple overlapping amino acid sequences in generating <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts.</b> Results Pyviko performed well on a test set of over 240, 000 gene pairs collected from viral genomes deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Nucleotide database, identifying a point mutation which added a premature stop codon within the first 20 codons of the target gene in 93. 2 % of all tested gene-overprinted gene pairs. This shows that Pyviko can be used successfully {{in a wide variety of}} contexts to facilitate the molecular cloning and study of viral overprinted genes. Conclusions Pyviko is an extensible and intuitive Python tool for designing <b>knockouts</b> of overlapping <b>genes.</b> Freely available as both a Python package and a web-based interface ([URL]), Pyviko simplifies the experimental design of <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> in complex viruses with overlapping genes...|$|R
25|$|Deletion of the Trsp gene in osteochondroprogenitor cells {{results in}} {{abnormal}} bone growth, delayed ossification, chondronecrosis and dwarfism. General Trsp gene deletion is lethal to the embryo. The {{results of this}} research was used as a model for Kashin-Beck disease. Kashin-Beck is a result of combinatorial environmentally induced by factors such as: toxic mould, contaminated grains by mycotoxins, and mostly by selenium deficiency, which is necessary for selenoprotein function. The disease has symptoms similar to those resulting from Trsp <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b>|$|E
25|$|ROOM {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} prediction of the metabolic state of an organism after a <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b> It follows the same premise as MOMA that an organism would try to restore a flux distribution {{as close as possible}} to the wild-type after a knockout. However it further hypothesizes that this steady state would be reached through a series of transient metabolic changes by the regulatory network and that the organism would try to minimize the number of regulatory changes required to reach the wild-type state. Instead of using a distance metric minimization however it uses a Mixed Integer Linear Programming method.|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} {{plants can}} also be developed using gene knockdown or <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> to alter the genetic makeup of a plant without incorporating genes from other plants. In 2014, Chinese researcher Gao Caixia filed patents {{on the creation of}} a strain of wheat that is resistant to powdery mildew. The strain lacks genes that encode proteins that repress defenses against the mildew. The researchers deleted all three copies of the genes from wheat's hexaploid genome. Gao used the TALENs and CRISPR gene editing tools without adding or changing any other genes. No field trials were immediately planned. The CRISPR technique has also been used to modify white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus).|$|E

50|$|Conversely, {{measured}} mutational robustnesses {{of organisms}} vary widely. For example, >95% of point mutations in C. elegans have no detectable effect and even 90% of single <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> in E. coli are non-lethal. Viruses, however, only tolerate 20-40% of mutations and hence {{are much more}} sensitive to mutation.|$|R
25|$|In situ {{hybridization}} and conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> {{studies have}} helped to demonstrate the role JAG1 plays in development {{and its effects on}} different organ systems. In humans, JAG1 has broad expression in many tissue types including the pancreas, heart, placenta, prostate, lung, kidney, thymus, testis, and leucocytes in the adult. In a developing embryo JAG1 expression is concentrated around the pulmonary artery, mesocardium, distal cardic outflow tract, major arteries, metanephros, branchial arches, pancreas, the portal vein, and otocyst. Generally, JAG1 expression patterns correlate with organ systems affected in ALGS, although {{it is important to note}} that not all tissues where JAG1 is expressed are affected in ALGS. More recently JAG1 expression has been found to be altered in breast cancer and adrenocortical carcinoma patients.|$|E
25|$|Because {{many of its}} {{genes are}} {{homologous}} to human genes, yet its lifecycle is simple, D. discoideum is commonly used as a model organism. It can be observed at organismic, cellular, and molecular levels primarily because of their restricted number of cell types and behaviors, and their rapid growth. It is used to study cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and programmed cell death, which are all normal cellular processes. It {{is also used to}} study other aspects of development, including cell sorting, pattern formation, phagocytosis, motility, and signal transduction. These processes and aspects of development are either absent or too difficult to view in other model organisms. D. discoideum is closely related to higher metazoans. It carries similar genes and pathways, making it a good candidate for <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b>|$|E
25|$|Genetic studies {{agree with}} the biosynthetic routes {{established}} in the precursor-feeding experiments. AFLP-based studies using crosses between strains of the endophyte, Epichloë festucae, that differ in the capacity to produce lolines, show that loline production and protection of the grass, Lolium giganteum, from feeding by the aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, segregate in a Mendelian fashion. The presence of a single locus for loline production was later confirmed by the finding that loline-producing epichloae endophytes contain a gene cluster (LOL cluster) of at least eleven genes. The LOL genes are greatly and coordinately upregulated during loline alkaloid production, and experimental genetic tests involving manipulation of selected LOL genes by RNA interference and <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> have directly confirmed the involvement {{of two of the}} LOL genes in loline biosynthesis. These tests and similarities in the peptide sequences of the proteins encoded by these genes to known enzymes indicate that one gene, termed lolC, is likely required for the first step in loline biosynthesis (condensation of L-proline and L-homoserine for NACPP formation), and another gene, lolP —likely encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase—, for oxygenation of one methyl group on the C-1 amine of N-methylloline, which gives the most abundant loline in many grass–endophyte symbiota, N-formylloline.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{establishment}} of topographic maps of neuronal connections {{is believed to}} involve graded repulsion mediated by EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands. <b>Gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> show that ephrin-A ligands do indeed have {{a crucial role in}} mapping, and that mechanisms in addition to graded repulsion must also be at work...|$|R
25|$|Therefore, it is {{possible}} to evaluate the effect of single or multiple gene deletions by evaluation of the GPR as a Boolean expression.

50|$|Around 30% of all {{targeted}} <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> in mice {{result in}} embryonic or perinatal death.

While homozygous deletions of Jag1 {{have been shown to be}} embryonic lethal in mice, and heterozygous deletions may show only a limited phenotype (involving the eye), mice haploinsufficient for both Jag1 and Notch2 present with the ALGS phenotype. Conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> mouse models with Jag1 mutations targeted to the portal vein mesenchyme, endothelium, and cranial neural crest all exhibit features classic to those in individuals with ALGS, highlighting the role of this tissue type in disease origins ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that sex hormones may influence appetite and eating in women, and the onset of bulimia nervosa. [...] Studies have shown that women with hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome have a dysregulation of appetite, along with carbohydrates and fats. [...] This dysregulation of appetite is also seen in women with bulimia nervosa. [...] In addition, <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> studies in mice have shown that mice that have the gene encoding estrogen receptors have decreased fertility due to ovarian dysfunction and dysregulation of androgen receptors. [...] In humans, there {{is evidence}} that there is an association between polymorphisms in the ERβ (estrogen receptor β) and bulimia, suggesting there is a correlation between sex hormones and bulimia nervosa.|$|E

2500|$|Based on {{findings}} {{of changes in}} OCD symptoms in menstruating women and differences {{in the development of}} the disease between men and women, Hill and colleagues set out to research the effect of estrogen deprivation on the development of compulsive behavior in mice. [...] Male mice with an aromatase <b>Gene</b> <b>knockout</b> who were unable to produce estrogen showed excessive grooming and wheel running behaviors, but female mice did not. [...] When treated with 17β-estradiol, which replaced estrogen in these mice, the behaviors disappeared. [...] This study also found that COMT protein levels decreased in mice that did not produce estrogen and increased in the hypothalamus after estrogen-replacement treatment. [...] Briefly, the COMT protein is involved in degrading some neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. [...] This data suggests that there may be a hormonal component and a hormone-gene interaction effect that may contribute to obsessive behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second step}} in this reaction, the {{conversion}} of 12(S)-HpETE to HxA3 and HxB3, may be catalyzed by ALOX12 as an intrinsic property of the enzyme. [...] Based on <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> studies, however, the epidermal lipoxygenase, ALOXE3, or more correctly, its mouse ortholog Aloxe3, appears responsible for converting 12(S)-HpETE to HxB3 in mouse skin and spinal tissue. It is suggested that ALOXE3 contributes in part or whole {{to the production of}} HxB3 and perhaps other hepoxilins by tissues where it is expressed such as the skin. [...] Furthermore, hydroperoxide-containing unsaturated fatty acids can rearrange non-enzymatically to form a variety of epoxyalcohol isomers. The 12(S)-HpETE formed in tissues, it is suggested, may similar rearrange non-enzymatically to form HxA3 and HXB3. Unlike the products made by ALOX12 and ALOXE3, which are stereospecific in forming only HxA3 and HxB3, however, this non-enzymatic production of hepoxilins may form a variety of hepoxilin isomers and occur as an artifact of tissue processing. Finally, cellular peroxidases readily and rapidly reduce 12(S)-HpETE to its hydroxyl analog, 12S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE; see 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; this reaction competes with the hepoxilin-forming reaction and in cells expressing very high peroxidase activity may be responsible for blocking the formation of the hepoxilins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{availability}} of the S.cerevisiae genome sequence {{and a set of}} deletion mutants covering 90% of the yeast genome has further enhanced the power of S.cerevisiae as a model for understanding the regulation of eukaryotic cells. A project underway to analyze the genetic interactions of all double-deletion mutants through synthetic genetic array analysis will take this research one step further. The goal is to form a functional map of the cell's processes. As of 2010 a model of genetic interactions is most comprehensive yet to be constructed, containing [...] "the interaction profiles for ~75% of all genes in the Budding yeast". This model was made from 5.4 million two-gene comparisons in which a double <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> for each combination of the genes studied was performed. The effect of the double knockout on the fitness of the cell was compared to the expected fitness. Expected fitness is determined from the sum of the results on fitness of single-gene knockouts for each compared gene. When there is a change in fitness from what is expected, the genes are presumed to interact with each other. This was tested by comparing the results to what was previously known. For example, the genes Par32, Ecm30, and Ubp15 had similar interaction profiles to genes involved in the Gap1-sorting module cellular process. Consistent with the results, these genes, when knocked out, disrupted that process, confirming that they are part of it. From this, 170,000 gene interactions were found and genes with similar interaction patterns were grouped together. Genes with similar genetic interaction profiles tend {{to be part of the}} same pathway or biological process. This information was used to construct a global network of gene interactions organized by function. This network can be used to predict the function of uncharacterized genes based on the functions of genes they are grouped with.|$|E

40|$|Examining {{complete}} <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> {{within a}} viable organism can inform on gene function. We sequenced the exomes of 3222 British adults of Pakistani heritage with high parental relatedness, discovering 1111 rare-variant homozygous genotypes with predicted {{loss of function}} (<b>knockouts)</b> in 781 <b>genes.</b> We observed 13. 7 % fewer homozygous knockout genotypes than we expected, implying an average load of 1. 6 recessive-lethal-equivalent loss-of-function (LOF) variants per adult. When genetic data were linked to the individuals' lifelong health records, we observed no significant relationship between <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> and clinical consultation or prescription rate. In this data set, we identified a healthy PRDM 9 -knockout mother and performed phased genome sequencing on her, her child, and control individuals.

Thus, natural LOF variants inform on essential genetic loci and demonstrate PRDM 9 redundancy in humans...|$|R

50|$|Conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> is a {{technique}} used to eliminate a specific gene in a certain tissue, such as the liver. This technique is useful to study the role of individual genes in living organisms. It differs from traditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> because it targets specific genes at specific times rather than being deleted from beginning of life. Using the conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> technique eliminates many of the side effects from traditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b> In traditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout,</b> embryonic death from a gene mutation can occur, and this prevents scientists from studying the gene in adults. Some tissues cannot be studied properly in isolation, so the gene must be inactive in a certain tissue while remaining active in others. With this technology, scientists are able to knockout genes at a specific stage in development and study how the knockout of a gene in one tissue affects the same gene in other tissues.|$|E
