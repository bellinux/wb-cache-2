Pear tree (Pyrus communis) is a self-incompatible species and requires inter-variety cross-pollination to develop fruits. Hives are often settled in the orchards to facilitate pollination and allow a better fruit size production. However honeybees seem not really attracted by pear flowers and no accurate study of pear tree pollination by insects has been conducted.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for future genetically modified (GM) crops {{is to prevent}} undesired gene flow of transgenes to plant material intended for another use. Recombinase-mediated auto excision of transgenes directed by a tightly controlled microspore-specific promoter allows efficient removal of either the selectable marker gene or of all introduced transgenes during microsporogenesis. This way, transgene removal becomes {{an integral part of}} the biology of pollen maturation, not requiring any external stimulus such as chemical <b>induction</b> by <b>spraying.</b> We here show the feasibility of engineering transgenic plants to produce pollen devoid of any transgene. Highly efficient excision of transgenes from tobacco pollen was achieved with a potential failure rate of at most two out of 16 800 seeds (0. 024 %). No evidence for either premature activation or absence of activation of the recombinase system was observed under stress conditions in the laboratory. This approach can prevent adventitious presence of transgenes in non-GM crops or related wild species by gene flow. Such biological containment may help the deployment and management of coexistence practices to support consumer choice and will promote clean molecular farming for the production of high-value compounds in plants...|$|R

Parthenocarpic fruit development was compared to fertilized fruits resulting from hand compatible cross-pollination. Spontaneous intrinsic parthenocarpy occurred in Conference, but pollen deposit (even incompatible) increased the number of fruits initiated. Gibberellins (GA 3) increased the fruit set compared to the other hormonal treatments and trees treated with gibberellins and/or cytokinins produced larger fruits.

The droplet size spectra were measured for these 15 spray mixtures using a Malvern Particle Sizer and characterised by the Volume Median Diameter (VMD) {{and the percentage of}} liquid contained in droplets less than 100 m (% < 100 m). Horizontal ground drift was measured in a wind tunnel, on glass fibre collectors using a fluorescent tracer dye technique. The relative drift of each spray mixture was characterised by the Drifted Part (DP) which is the part of the sprayed volume drifted between 2 and 6 metres. Although the nozzle type was the predominating parameter regarding to the droplet size spectra and the DP, differences were observed due to the liquids characteristics. The EC formulation produced a smaller droplet size and a greater DP than the SC formulation whatever the tank mix adjuvant used. For the different spray mixtures, the DP was poorly correlated to the VMD or the % < 100 m. However, correlations between the VMD, the % < 100 m and the DP of the flat-fan nozzle and of the hollow cone nozzle were significant.

As a self-incompatible species, pear tree requires cross-pollination to develop fertilized fruits. Hives could be settled in the orchards to facilitate pollination and allow a better fruit size production. However, blooming occurs early in the spring in Belgium and unfavorable weather conditions (frost, low temperatures, rain, etc.) could prevent the pollination by insects.

Our work aims to better highlight the pear tree reproduction and focuses on the pollination and parthenocarpy processes in ‘Conference’. Field trials were realized during 3 years to compare fruits resulting from 1) spontaneous intrinsic parthenocarpy with emasculated flowers, 2) induced intrinsic parthenocarpy with flowers pollinated with intra-cultivar incompatible pollen, 3) induced extrinsic parthenocarpy with phytohormones (gibberellins, cytokinins or auxins), 4) hand compatible inter-cultivar pollination, 5) open pollination by insects. We observed that spontaneous intrinsic parthenocarpy due to endogenous phytohormones occurred in ‘Conference’. However, pollen deposit (even if incompatible) {{increased the number of}} fruits initiated by 10 to 40 % depending on the climatic conditions. Gibberellin treatments could also increase the parthenocarpic fruit set under adverse weather conditions. However, phytohormone treatments did not particularly increase fruit weight and fruit size in relation to extrinsic parthenocarpy. According to the year, parthenocarpic fruits remained, nevertheless, up to 12 % smaller than fertilized ones. Our results also suggest that endogenous gibberellins do not act alone to induce parthenocarpy since gibberellin inhibitor (paclobutrazol) treatment did not completely prevent parthenocarpic fruit initiation...|$|R

The properties of these spray droplets {{can influence the}} effectiveness and risks {{associated with the use}} of pesticides. Initial spray characteristics (initial droplet size and velocity, fan angle and spray liquid density) were therefore measured for a range of hydraulic nozzles and spray mixtures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the spray sheet velocity. There was a significant difference between a standard hydraulic nozzle, Turbo TeeJet® and air induction nozzle for all measured spray characteristics. The standard hydraulic nozzle generated the smallest droplet sizes, the highest velocity and the highest spray liquid density. The air induction nozzle generated the largest droplet size, the slowest velocity and the lowest spray liquid density. The type of air <b>induction</b> nozzle and <b>spray</b> formulation was also found to influence spray characteristics.

40|$|International audienceThis {{experimental}} study {{deals with the}} impingement of sprays on a heated wall in close to semi-industrial conditions. Therefore, an experimental setup was specifically designed: high liquid mass flux (up to 8 kg/m 2 /s), large droplets (up to 300 lm) and high surface temperature widely above the Leidenfrost point (up to 800 °C). The surface to be cooled is a 175 mm diameter nickel disk with 5 mm thickness heated by electromagnetic <b>induction.</b> The <b>spraying</b> devices consist in full cone sprays. Several studies, performed under these particular conditions, has allowed characterizing the heat flux removed by the spray by using techniques based on thermocouples or infrared thermography (IRT). However, to investigate more finely the heat transfer mechanism, {{it is necessary to}} measure the droplet temperature but, to date, no measurement for sprays are available in the literature. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to demonstrate the ability of the three-color Laser Induced Fluorescence (3 cLIF) to meet this challenge. The combination of the 3 cLIF with a Phase Doppler system allows also determining the droplet temperature per size class before and after impact. By adding the IRT measurements combined to an inverse heat conduction model, an energy balance is done in order to estimate the evaporated liquid mass. The influence of the normal Weber number on the liquid vaporization is investigated by using three sprays (Normal Weber numbers up to about 1500). Thereby, main results show that the droplets temperature after impact increases with the incident Weber number before to reach a plateau, attributed to the apparition of the splashing regime. The analysis of the energy balance shows that the mass of evaporated liquid decreases with the incident Weber number and the droplet heating. These first results are in well agreement with previous works conducted with single calibrated droplets, validating as the same time the use of combined 3 cLIF-PDA measurements in the case of sprays...|$|R
40|$|In this work, metal-based {{thermal barrier}} {{coatings}} (MBTBCs) have been produced, using high frequency <b>induction</b> plasma <b>spraying</b> (IPS) of iron-based nanostructured alloy powders. Important advances {{have been made}} over recent years {{to the development of}} ceramic-based thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) for internal combustion engines application, but they are not yet applied in mass production situations. Besides the important economic considerations, the reliability of ceramic: TBCs is also an issue, being associated with the difficulty of predicting their"in-service" lifetime. Through engineering of the nano/amorphous structure of MBTBCs, their thermal conductivity can be made as low as those of ceramic-based TBCs, with reduced mean free paths of the electrons/phonons scattering. In this work, nano/amorphous structured coatings were deposited by IPS using the following spray parameters: spraying distance (210 [tilde] 270 mm), plasma gas composition (Ar/N[subscript 2]), IPS torch power (24 kW), and powder feed-rate (16 g/min.). The structure and properties of the deposited layers were characterized through SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) observations. The thermal diffusivity ([alpha]) properties of the MBTBCs were measured using a laser flash method. Density ([rho]) and specific heat (C [subscript p]) of the MBTBCs were also measured, and their thermal conductivity (k) calculated (k =[alpha]pC[subscript p]). The thermal conductivity of MBTBCs was found to be as low as 1. 99 W/m/K. The heat treatment study showed that crystal structure changes, and grain size growth from a few nanometers to tenth of nanometers occurred at 550 [degree Celcius] under static exposure conditions. Thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of MBTBCs was 13 E- 6 /K, which is close to the TEC of cast iron and thus, closer to the TEC values of aluminium alloys than are conventional TBCs.

In this context, the study aimed to evaluate the effects of spray nozzles and spray volumes on spraying deposits, armyworm control and crop corn performance in narrow row sowing system. The experiment was carried out at experimental area of Sao Paulo State University, Campus of Botucatu/SP, Brazil, during the 2009 / 2010 agricultural season, in randomized blocks with factorial scheme (2 x 2 + 1) and four replications. It was tested two flat fan spray nozzles (with and without air induction) combined with two spray volumes (100 and 200 L ha- 1) plus a control treatment. There was no influence of spray nozzles (without air <b>induction)</b> in the <b>spray</b> deposits levels on plants. However, the flat fan nozzle with air induction was more effective on fall armyworm, with 100 % of control against 47. 84 % from other at 15 days after spraying. The increase in the spray volume promoted high spray deposits (415. 4 and 388. 6 μL g- 1 dry mass for flat fan nozzle with and without air induction, respectively at V 10 growth stage) and consequently, the highest spray volume (200 L- 1) was more efficient in the fall armyworm suppression, with 100 % of control. All the technologies tested showed lower plant injury from fall armyworm. The insecticide sprayed with different technologies did not affect the parameters of plant height and leaf area index.

40|$|Dust {{control is}} a very {{significant}} issue in underground coal mining. The benefits of reducing dust levels will be a lesser risk of lung disease to coal miners, improved working conditions and a reduced risk of dust explosions. Coal dust is commonly suppressed by water sprays but suppression efficiency is not high because dust tends to travel in the air flow round the water droplets rather than being captured by them. If water sprays are electrostatically charged, then a significant improvement in dust suppression efficiency may be achieved. Of the three principal droplet charging mechanisms, i. e. corona charging, induction charging and contact charging, corona charging is {{the most widely used}} in many industrial fields including dust suppression, However, it requires a high applied voltage, ranging from thousands to more than a hundred thousand volts, depending on the geometry of the charging equipment. Induction charging has been used in agricultural spraying since Law (1978) developed an embedded-electrode <b>induction</b> charging <b>spraying</b> nozzle. This nozzle provides a compact, inexpensively fabricated droplet charger and, reduces design requirements on size and output voltage (of the order of 1000 volts). It also reduces the potential for mechanical damage, misalignment and personnel hazard. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} dust suppression, either the charge on individual droplets or the charge-to-mass ratio of water sprays needs to be known. However, the parameters which control the charge applied to water and the charging rate have been unsolved theoretically for any charging mechanism. The existing theories for the induction-charged and air-atomising a liquid jet have been found to be inadequate. And there is no theory available for corona charging of the droplets produced with a pneumatic nozzle in order to predict the spray charge level or the spray charge-to-mass ratio. In view of this situation, mathematical models have been developed in this thesis for both the corona and induction charging mechanisms. During the development of the theories, it has been assumed that for corona charging, that the jet is disintegrated into droplets and the droplets are then charged; for induction charging, that the jet is first charged and the charged jet is then disintegrated into charged droplets. The Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, plays an important role in linking the individual droplet charge to the spray charge-to-mass ratio for both charging mechanisms. The developed theories are general models suitable for any liquid with both corona and induction charging. Theoretical calculations for the spray charge-to-mass ratio, individual droplet charge and the ratio of droplet charge to the Rayleigh charge limit have been presented for almost all of the influencing electrical and mechanical parameters such as applied voltage, air flowrate, liquid flowrate, liquid conductivity, liquid dielectric constant, nozzle dimensions, cylindrical electrode dimensions, and fluid parameters, for example, density, viscosity and surface tension. In the calculation for corona charging of droplets, the effect of the droplets on corona current and corona-onset voltage has been assessed for first time. The introduction of the Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D 32, makes the assessment possible. Theoretical calculations for induction charging of liquid jets have shown that provided liquids have a conductivity value higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m, then they can be charged satisfactorily by the induction charging method. Among all of the influencing parameters, the electrical and mechanical parameters determine the charging rate and the water spray charge level. The suitability of employing these two charging mechanisms to dust suppression in coal mine has been evaluated based on the spray charge level, safety issues and the simplicity or otherwise of the equipment. The induction charging method was considered to have advantages over its corona charging counterpart, and has been chosen for charging the water sprays in the experiment program. Water has a conductivity of s = - 10 2 S/m, higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m. Based upon theoretical considerations, it is concluded that water is an appropriate liquid for corona charging, based on its dielectric constant, and for induction charging, based on its conductivity. In order to facilitate the testing of electrostatically charged water spray cloud parameters, a spray charger/collector was designed and constructed by others and a computerised data acquisition system has been employed. According to the theory developed for induction charging, the optimum length of the charging electrode has been analysed based upon the assumption that water jet is first charged and then the charged jet is disintegrated into charged droplets by the high pressure air. An experimental program examined the dependence of spray current upon four parameters: air flowrate, water flowrate, applied voltage and jet diameter. The experiments have shown that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle used in the experiment is able to impart a significant charge into the water sprays. The spray charge-to-mass ratio calculated based upon the measured spray current demonstrates the same characteristics as predicted by theory: increasing with air flowrate, decreasing with water flowrate, increasing with applied voltage to a peak value then decreasing with further increase in the voltage, and increasing with jet diameter. A successful interpretation of an important phenomenon in the inductioncharged air-atomising a water jet, that spray charge-to-mass ratio and spray current increase with air pressure (or air flowrate) and decrease with increasing water flowrate, has been achieved based on the theories developed in this thesis. This phenomenon occurs because increasing air flowrate and/or decreasing water flowrate leads to a higher velocity of jet flowing through the induction electrode. However, when water flowrate becomes very small, a decrease in spray current with increasing air pressure (or flowrate) may be caused both by jet breakup inside the electrode and by contraction of the jet. In order to verify the theory, a preliminary comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions employing a constant kic in the air-jet interaction coefficient a which was assumed to be 0. 7 has shown a general agreement. However, the value of kic appears to be related to jet diameter, air/water mass ratio and applied voltage. An empirical equation for kic has then been formulated based on the experimental data for the spray charge-to-mass ratio. Finally a comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions using the formulated kic shows an improved agreement. It is concluded that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle has a potential application in dust suppression in coal mines, as the voltage required to charge water sprays is only 1000 ~ 1200 volts, and that the theory developed for induction charging of water sprays can be used to guide laboratory investigations and design processes for dust suppression and other industrial applications which might employ the electrostatic charging of liquid sprays...|$|R
