2500|$|Joni Mitchell, {{who flew}} in to sing for one show, nearly left, {{but when she}} told Wyeth goodbye, he was hurt, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized,</b> more than anybody Wyeth's {{reaction}} was so heartfelt, his expression of it was so open. Like it's just his soul is so beautiful. And I stayed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1850–1851, while {{he was working on}} Opera and Drama, Wagner {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a comic opera based on a {{well-known}} folk-tale, Vor einem, der auszug, das Fürchten zu lernen (The Boy Who Set Out to Learn Fear), which he had come across in Grimms' Fairy Tales. [...] "Imagine my surprise," [...] he later wrote to his friend the violinist Theodor Uhlig, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that this youth was none other than young Siegfried!" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that his neck was oddly {{leathery}} and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
30|$|This {{is exactly}} the point where <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realize</b> that {{it is sort of}} not quite fitting how I was using those symbols previously. I was {{thinking}} ahead to where the proof was going and suddenly it becomes clear to me {{that there is a problem}} ahead but it’s not clear to anyone else yet.|$|R
5000|$|Members of the Syndicate use online advertising, email marketing, {{affiliate}} {{marketing and}} multi-level marketing to sell [...] "info products", such as self-published books and videos that purport to teach customers {{how to get}} rich through online business. They also do lead generation for pressure-sales telemarketing companies called [...] "boiler rooms". The Syndicate's members use {{the group as a}} way of coordinating product launches and release dates, and of enhancing perceived credibility through social proof. According to Syndicate member Frank Kern, [...] "Have you ever noticed that {{all the people in the}} Internet Marketing world are promoting each other? I mean, we're not psychic. It's not like, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realize</b> he's having a launch today, I have to nail it'. We all work together, all the top people work together." ...|$|R
40|$|This is an aptly titled {{book that}} deals in a {{fascinating}} manner with {{the biological and}} cultural intersections that have occurred between humans and the crow-like birds (Corvus spp.) throughout history. Today, even city dwellers {{are likely to have}} had some contacts with crows, as these crafty birds have increasingly been able to adapt to the complex world of city life in recent decades. As a youngster I knew crows only as highly elusive countryside birds, and I was constantly frustrated in my attempts to stalk them with my. 22 rifle and collect a 25 -cent bounty. Later, while doing field studies in Grand Teton National Park, I was similarly outwitted by hungry ravens when I tried to put out meat baits unobserved to attract and photograph wild pine martens. Only on reading this book did <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realize</b> that the word ravenous was derived from the substantial appetites of ravens...|$|R
2500|$|Producer Ken Nelson took a {{hands-off}} {{approach to}} producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: [...] "The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was {{an exception to}} the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized,</b> 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1962 and 1964, Garcia {{sang and}} {{performed}} mainly bluegrass, old-time, and folk music. One {{of the bands}} Garcia performed with was the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers, a bluegrass act. The group consisted of Jerry Garcia on guitar, banjo, vocals, and harmonica, Marshall Leicester on banjo, guitar, and vocals, and Dick Arnold on fiddle and vocals. Soon after this, Garcia, Weir, Ron [...] "Pigpen" [...] McKernan, and several of their friends formed a jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Around this time, the psychedelic LSD was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: [...] "Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't going to work out. Luckily I wasn't far enough into it {{for it to be}} shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{lost all}} of her {{endorsements}} too, Suzuki was faced {{with the problem of}} production companies refusing to sign her and tried to make a comeback {{in the next two years}} with little to no success. Her relationship with her producer, Tetsuya Komuro, also ceased. Sony also took {{all of her}} singles and albums released up to that point off CD shelves. Many people were convinced that her chances for making a comeback were nil. In 2003, Suzuki finally negotiated an out-of-court agreement with Sony. Her contract with the label was scheduled to end in December 2004. Eiji Yamada was subsequently fined for his role in the tax evasion. Government officials linked to the scandal included former Education Minister Takashi Kosugi and two other legislators, who allegedly received 34 million yen in unofficial payments for referring AG Communication and other clients seeking tax evasion. About this period, Suzuki herself has said [...] "I really didn't know what was going on, lots of lies were being thrown about in the media. For people to hear little things on the TV and believe that to be the truth was a surprise, and <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> the kind of world I was in. What kept me going was the thought of one day being able to tell the truth myself" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful," [...] he murmured, warningly--and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{that all}} my future, the only future for which I was fit, would perhaps go irretrievably to pieces in any mishap to my first command.|$|R
60|$|His {{words were}} spoken quietly, but <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>suddenly</b> that the mysterious force which had drawn {{me to him}} now, against my will, was an {{intellectual}} rather than apparently sentimental one, an intellectual force seeming to comprise within it all other human attractions. And yet I felt a sudden contrition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she desolately asserted, [...] "that is so! Something {{has been}} hanging over me {{ever since we}} came, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> {{that it was the}} absence of the brides. But--but--down at the hotels--Didn't you see {{anything}} bridal there? When the omnibuses arrived, was there no burst of minstrelsy? Was there--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am that same," [...] he answered, and I looked with {{interest}} upon one whose {{name had been}} ringing through Italy these last few years. And then, <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> why his face was familiar to me. This {{was the man who}} in a monkish robe had stared so insistently at me that day at Mondolfo five years ago.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, after {{finishing}} my LIFE OF ULYSSES S. GRANT, I began to plan {{to go into the}} Klondike over the Telegraph Trail. One day in showing the maps of my route to William Dean Howells, I said, [...] "I shall go in here and come out there," [...] a trail of nearly twelve hundred miles through an almost unknown country. As I uttered this <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that I was starting on a path holding many perils and that I might not come back.|$|E

6000|$|... "All {{would now}} {{have been well}} for them {{had it not been}} for my {{knowledge}} of what they had done. I have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance. I was confined to my room, terrorized by the most horrible threats, cruelly ill-used to break my spirit--see this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my arms--and a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when I tried to call from the window. For five days this cruel imprisonment continued, with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together. This afternoon a good lunch was brought me, but the moment after I took it I knew that I had been drugged. In a sort of dream I remember being half-led, half-carried to the carriage; in the same state I was conveyed to the train. Only then, when the wheels were almost moving, did <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realize</b> that my liberty lay in my own hands. I sprang out, they tried to drag me back, and {{had it not been for}} the help of this good man, who led me to the cab, I should never had broken away. Now, thank God, I am beyond their power forever." ...|$|R
60|$|Dusk was {{abroad in}} the colder garden, {{and the last}} bee home, when, with plans {{resolved}} on, I stretched my stiffened limbs and made my way into the house. Excellent augury--so easy had been my daily habits {{that no one had}} noticed my absence. Supper was awaiting me. I was ravenous. Up and down I stumped, gnawing my biscuit and sipping my sweet country milk. <b>I</b> had <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> what the world meant to Fanny--an oyster for her sword. Somewhere I have read that every man of genius hides a woman in his breast. Well, perhaps in mine a man was now stirring--the man that had occupied my Aunt Kitilda's skirts. It was high time.|$|R
5000|$|... "Reincarnation of a Lovebird" [...] is a {{composition}} dedicated to Bird. [...] "I wouldn't say I {{set out to}} write a piece on Bird. ... <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> it was Bird. ... In one way, the work isn't like him. It's built on long lines {{and most of his}} pieces were short lines. But it's my feeling about Bird. I felt like crying when I wrote it." ...|$|R
5000|$|I always envisioned motheras {{the perfect}} wife and mother. The {{idea that she}} had a period in her life when she was miserable was astounding to me. <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that if my mother could be desperate in the life she had chosen for herself, any woman can.

5000|$|... "idea {{was stolen}} from The Long Christmas Dinner of Thornton Wilder!" [...] Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. [...] "I did the breakfast scene {{thinking}} I'd invented it. It wasn't in the script originally. And when I was almost finished with it, <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that I'd unconsciously stolen it from Thornton and I called him up and admitted to it." [...] When Bogdanovich asked how Wilder reacted, Welles replied, [...] "He was pleased." [...] Welles and Wilder were good friends.|$|E
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that Alfred Inglethorp was {{not with}} us--that he alone had given no sign of his presence. John {{opened the door of}} his room. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was {{following}} with the candle, and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, {{and that there was no}} sign of the room having been occupied.|$|R
5000|$|... "He (meaning the jangama devara) {{asked me}} to keep {{watching}} in between the eyebrows, so I just went on watching. I saw all the things happening: then all the happenings stopped. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that my attention was on 'That' which was making it happen. Then the attention settled on 'That' which was watching. Boundless Supreme Peace was there. Amazing happiness was there. It was so 'tasty' that one wouldn't ever want {{to be away from}} that." ...|$|R
40|$|During the two past decades, {{scholars}} in religious studies and social anthropology have frequently reconsidered Turner's theoretical model of pilgrimage. A pilgrimage is the outer manifestation of an inner journey, {{often referred to}} as an allegory of the soul's journey to God. Thus it is cosmologically meaningful. The height of the journey is the arrival at the pilgrimage centre and the encounter with the divine. There the pilgrim perceives the gap between what he should be (according to the religious tradition) a what he really is, <b>i.</b> e. he <b>suddenly</b> <b>realizes</b> the discrepancy between the precept and the practice. This experience is the very essence of a pilgrimage, because what has been experienced cannot become unexperienced, what has been seen cannot become unseen, what has been realized cannot become unrealized. ...|$|R

5000|$|On April 15, 2015, Anno {{spoke about}} his {{feelings}} regarding Asuka and Rei. He claimed:"The truth is, I have no emotional attachment to Rei at all. In {{the midst of}} making Eva, <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that I had forgotten her. Her very existence. For example, in episode seven, I remembered and added one shot with Rei. I had no attachment to her at all. I think that was okay, because in episode eight, she didn't appear. Not even in a single shot." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, {{the young}} Henri Cartier-Bresson, {{at the time}} an undirected {{photographer}} who catalogued his travels and his friends, saw the Munkácsi photograph Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika, taken {{on a beach in}} Liberia. Cartier-Bresson later said, [...] "For me this photograph was the spark that ignited my enthusiasm. <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that, by capturing the moment, photography was able to achieve eternity. It is the only photograph to have influenced me. This picture has such intensity, such joie de vivre, such a sense of wonder that it continues to fascinate me to this day." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} from Africa, Moreau settled in [...] "the tiny and unregarded Oxfordshire village of Berrick Salome". He wrote, [...] "in 1965 <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>suddenly</b> that, because Berrick {{was so small}} and because we were fortunate in still having several people whose clear recollections reached back to between 1890 and 1910, {{it might be possible}} to build up for a period about the turn of the century a picture of more than purely local interest." [...] His study was published Oxford University Press in 1968 as The Departed Village: Berrick Salome at the Turn of the Century.|$|R
6000|$|This {{taste of}} [...] "life" [...] had so elated me that after fevered and silent debate I at last laughed out, and {{explained}} to Pollie that I {{wished to be}} [...] "put down." [...] Her breathless arguments against this foolhardy experiment only increased my obstinacy. She was compelled to obey. Bidding her keep some little distance behind me, I settled my veil, clasped tight my Miss Austen {{in my arms and}} set my face in the direction from which we had come. One after another the wide paving-stones stretched out in front of me. It was an extraordinary experience. I was openly alone now, not with the skulking, deceitful shades and appearances of night, or the quiet flowers and trees in the enormous vacancy of nature; but {{in the midst of a}} town of men in their height--and walking along there: by myself. It was as if <b>I</b> had <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> what astonishingly active and domineering and multitudinous creatures we humans are. I can't explain. The High Street, to use a good old phrase, [...] "got up into my head." [...] My mind was in such a whirl of excitement that full consciousness of what followed eludes me.|$|R
5000|$|According to Doris Warner, {{who was in}} attendance, {{about halfway}} through the film {{she began to feel}} that {{something}} exceptional was taking place. Jolsons [...] "Wait a minute" [...] line had prompted a loud, positive response from the audience. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, [...] "the audience became hysterical." [...] After the show, the audience turned into a [...] "milling, battling, mob", in one journalists description, chanting [...] "Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!" [...] Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was Life magazines Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as [...] "fraught with tremendous significance.... <b>I</b> for one <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> {{that the end of the}} silent drama is in sight".|$|R
5000|$|John Curry, Olympic {{gold medal}} winning ice skater {{said that he}} found “a central core of strength” from doing the est Training. He said, [...] "Quite honestly, I can say that from the day I signed up for est and {{from the first time}} I did it, my skating just changed. <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that it was me who is doing the skating. I was the one in control. I was doing it, and it wasn't other things that could make me fall over, or make things go wrong." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{could not}} find my Weston {{exposure}} meter! The situation was desperate: the low sun was trailing the edge of clouds in the west, and shadow would soon dim the white crosses ... <b>I</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>realized</b> that I knew the luminance of the Moon — 250 cd/ft2. Using the Exposure Formula, I placed this value on Zone VII ... Realizing as I released the shutter that I had an unusual photograph which deserved a duplicate negative, I quickly reversed the film holder, but as I pulled the darkslide, the sunlight passed from the white crosses; I was a few seconds too late! The lone negative suddenly became precious.|$|E

5000|$|Berch usually {{began his}} {{program with a}} whistle and a song. In {{an article in the}} January 1949 issue of Radio and Television Mirror, he gave the reason for that: [...] "I was reading the morning paper. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that the whole front page was full of {{disaster}} -- fires, murders, political troubles, jealousy and strife between persons and between nations. ... 'Now,' I said to myself, 'something ought to be done about this. And, in my own small way, I'm the guy to do it.' Then and there, in theory at least, the Heart to Heart Hookup and the Good Neighbor Club came into being." ...|$|R
5000|$|Then comes {{a moment}} when <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> can't handle the {{language}} anymore, like I can't read one more translation of The Divine Comedy, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> it's in my eyes all the time, that I have a vision of Hell, I have even more necessary kind {{of a way of}} getting out of Hell, kind of a springboard in my thinking, closing my eyes and thinking what I'm seeing ... and also purgation, that I can go through the stages of purging the self, of trying to become pure, free of these ghastly visions, and then there is something that's as close to Heaven as I would hope to aspire to, which I call [...] "existence is song." [...] And that all of that was in my eyes all the time, backfiring all these years ... It's lovely that I can have the language, but I also have a visual corollary of it, but that is a story.|$|R
2500|$|According to Doris Warner, {{who was in}} attendance, {{about halfway}} through the film {{she began to feel}} that {{something}} exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson's face appeared in big close-up, and said [...] "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothing yet!" [...] Jolson's [...] "Wait a minute" [...] line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, [...] "the audience became hysterical."
