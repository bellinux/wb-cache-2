An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported <b>from</b> <b>old,</b> unsafe buildings to safer areas. The people were transported to shelters provisioned with supplies. In addition, the power grid in southern Cuba was turned off to avoid accidents.|$|E

5|$|In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (<b>from</b> <b>Old</b> Norse Askr ok Embla)—male {{and female}} respectively—were {{the first two}} humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, three gods, {{one of whom is}} Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the {{dominant}} {{language of the}} country. It was derived largely <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> English, {{with the addition of}} elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century. It was adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline.|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch, an {{earthwork}} {{stretching from}} Stretford to Ashton-under-Lyne, {{is evidence of}} Anglo-Saxon activity in Tameside.

Further evidence of Anglo-Saxon era activity in Tameside comes from the derivation of settlement names <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> English such as -tun, meaning farmstead, and leah meaning clearing.|$|E

5|$|On August 1, 1844, Wickliffe {{and two of}} {{his daughters}} boarded the {{steamship}} Georgia traveling <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> Point Comfort in Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. While en route, he was stabbed in the chest by a man wielding a claspknife. The knife bounced off Wickliffe's breastbone without damaging any major internal organs, and a U.S. Navy officer prevented a second blow from hitting Wickliffe. Wickliffe's attacker, J. McLean Gardner, was disarmed and arrested. Later that night, he wrote Wickliffe a letter of apology. Wickliffe was not seriously injured, and returned home three days after the attack. Gardner was tried and found to be insane; he was later sent to an asylum.|$|E
5|$|Pedra da Gávea is a {{mountain}} in Tijuca Forest, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Differential weathering {{on one side}} of the rock has created what is described as a stylized human face.

Some individuals, such as Bernardo de Azevedo da Silva Ramos, have advanced the position that the inscription is of Phoenician origin and possibly proof of pre-Columbian contact <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> World cultures. Alternative theories proposed include that the rock was the site of a Viking colony or that it is connected with suspected UFO activity.|$|E
