40|$|The {{very slow}} {{injection}} {{of a large}} quantity of contrast material into the triple branching of the celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery produces an intense opacification of the hepatic sinusoids resulting from an arterial and portal summation of the parenchymatgraphic phases. Summation <b>hepatography</b> would appear of particular interest, on the one hand, {{in a search for}} hypovascular neoplastic changes localized at the periphery of the organ, and on the other hand, {{in the study of the}} spleno portal venous axis.

40|$|The {{umbilical}} vein {{in adults}} is patent but collapsed. There is a membranous valve at its {{entrance into the}} left portal vein. Cannulation of the portal vein via the umbilical vein permits {{direct access to the}} portal system for portography and <b>hepatography.</b> This procedure was performed under local or general anesthesia in 30 patients and was successful in 22. It is useful in the investigation of patients with portal hypertension, and suspected intrahepatic tumours or abscesses. It gives excellent contrast visualization of the liver and definition of lesions as small as 1. 0 cm. This technique is superior to both hepatic scanning and splenoportography...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{features}} {{of obstruction of}} the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava were observed in five out of the 11 patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome seen during the last four years. These patients apparently formed a distinct group from the remaining six and resembled in clinical course, biochemical features, haemodynamic findings, and radiological investigations the patients described as cases of membranous obliteration of the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava. The present study reports five such patients diagnosed {{with the help of}} venous catheterization, percutaneous <b>hepatography,</b> and haemodynamic studies. The value of distinguishing these patients from those with obstruction due to hepatic vein occlusion is highlighted because of the difference in the prognosis and treatment...|$|E
40|$|Lymph {{dynamics}} in idiopathic portal hypertension {{has been studied}} in two phases. In the first phase thoracic duct lymph transport was studied in 11 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension by cannulating the duct. This revealed altered lymph transport {{in the form of}} a distended thoracic duct, raised pressure in the duct, and haemorrhagic lymph with an increased flow rate. The lymph flow rate was analysed in relation to various hepatic haemodynamic and biochemical parameters. In the second phase of the study hepatic lymphatics were studied by percutaneous <b>hepatography</b> in 16 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension. By this technique hepatic lymphatics were opacified in patients with idiopathic portal hypertension and cirrhosis with equal frequency. The significance of this finding in relation to the altered hepatic haemodynamics and thoracic duct lymph transport is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Symptomatic {{occlusion}} of the hepatic veins {{is a rare}} condition {{caused by}} tumour or thrombus arising either locally or by extension from the inferior vena cava. It is usually called the Budd-Chiari syndrome. The etiology remains unknown in over two-thirds of the patients. Its rarity and interest {{has led to a}} large number of individual case reports. 322 instances of symptomatic hepatic vein occlusion have been reported, of which 184 are single case publications. There are only six series of more than five cases (Nishikawa, 1910; Corinini and Oberson. 1937; Palnar, 1954; Parker, 1959; Gibson, 1960; Safouh and Shehata, 1965) and these have been largely drawn from autopsy records, although Palmer (1954) described seven patients seen during life. The clinical and pathological features of hepatic vein occlusion have been described in a number of papers (Hess, 1905; Thompson and Turnbull, 1912; Armstrong and Carnes, 1944; Kelsey and Comfort, 1945; Thompson, 1947; Parker, 1959; Gibson, 1960) during the one hundred and twenty years since the publication of Budd's treatise. However, accurate diagnosis has generally relied on autopsy, and detailed investigations have seldom been performed. Consequently, little is known of the roentgenographic and haemodynamic features. The diagnosis of liver disease has been revolutionized by such special techniques as percutaneous liver biopsy, portal pressure measurements, isotope scanning and selective arteriography and venography. This study describes six patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome in whom these methods have been applied to establish the diagnosis, to ascertain the underlying cause and to assess the possibility of surgical intervention. Special attention has been given to hepatic venography and <b>hepatography.</b> The vascular pattern in the Budd-Chiari syndrome has been compared with that in normals and in patients with other diseases of the liver. Diagnostic features have been determined and an attempt made to evaluate compensatory changes in the lymphatic drainage and venous blood supply following hepatic vein obstruction. Alterations in portal dynamics have also been recorded. The clinical course has been followed and the effect of treatment assessed in each patient. Finally, the literature has been reviewed with particular reference to the diagnosis and treatment of hepatic vein thrombosis. The studies reported in this thesis were carried out during the tenure of a Research Fellowship in the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, and they were {{supported by a grant from}} the William Shepherd Bequest to the Royal Free Hospital. The special radiological procedures, haemodynamic studies, isotope investigations and laboratory work were personally performed with the exception of the scintillation scans, coeliac axis arteriograms and the other individual tests acknowledged overleaf...|$|E
