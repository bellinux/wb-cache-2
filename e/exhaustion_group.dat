40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} uterine fundal pressure during {{the second stage of}} labor (Kristeller maneuver) on pelvic floor dysfunction (urinary and anal incontinence, genital prolapse, pelvic floor strength). METHODS: 522 primiparous women, enrolled 3 months after vaginal delivery, were divided in two groups: group A (297 women) identifies the women who received Kristeller maneuvers with different indications (e. g. fetal distress, failure to progress, mother <b>exhaustion),</b> <b>group</b> B (225 women) the women without maneuver. Participants were questioned about urogynecological symptoms and examined by Q-tip test, digital test, vaginal perineometry and uroflowmetric stop test score. RESULTS: Mediolateral episiotomies, dyspareunia and perineal pain were significantly higher in Kristeller group, whereas urinary and anal incontinence, genital prolapse and pelvic floor strength were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Kristeller maneuver does not modify puerperal pelvic floor function but increases the rate of episiotomies...|$|E

MethodsA one-time exhausted treadmill exercise session was used. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: a control group—animals receiving no TS and no exercise (NTSNE), animals receiving TS and no exercise group (TSNE), animals receiving no TS and exercised to <b>exhaustion</b> <b>group</b> (NTSE), and animals receiving TS and exercised to <b>exhaustion</b> <b>group</b> (TSE). The TSNE and TSE groups were fed TS at a dosage of 20 [*]mg/kg body weight once per day for 2 weeks. The NTSE group was given a placebo, and the NTSNE group was not given any treatment. The NTSE and TSE groups were exercised at speed of 30 [*]m/min on treadmill until exhausted. The exercise time and exercise distance were recorded when the rats became exhausted and the rats were then decapitated and anatomized immediately.

Beetroot juice (BR), a rich, safe source of dietary nitrates, {{has been shown to}} be effective for improving performance and increasing time to exhaustion in events that require endurance or require repeated interval sprints. The demands of combat are most like repeated sprints, and it is important to identify if BR would aid this population and what would the recommended dose and duration of supplementation be. Twenty-five ROTC Cadets from a midsize, midwestern university were randomized into 3 groups that did not differ between age, gender, body composition, or aerobic fitness; the groups were only different in the beverage they were given and the corresponding amount of dietary nitrates, either 16. 9 oz. apple juice (CON, 0 mg NO 3 -), roughly 8 oz. apple juice + 8. 4 oz. beetroot juice (BR 1, 300 mg NO 3 -), or 16. 8 oz. beetroot juice (BR 2, 600 mg NO 3 -). The major outcome measure is performance on the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test 1 (Yo-Yo IR 1), which measures distance covered in progressively faster interval sprints until <b>exhaustion.</b> Each <b>group</b> increased over the 3 sprints, and a dose-related effect was observed, even though the increase was insignificant (p > 0. 05).

In this paper, {{the focus of}} which is on geometrically infinite Kleinian groups, the authors study <b>exhaustions</b> of such <b>groups</b> by specific subsets which have properties reminiscent of geometrically finite groups. Each of these subsets (the authors call them ρ-restrictions) defines a ρ-restricted limit set which is a closed subset of the limit set of the original group and which carries a (ρ-restricted) Patterson-Sullivan measure. This ρ-restricted Patterson-Sullivan measure shows similarities with the classical Patterson-Sullivan measure for geometrically finite Kleinian groups. The exponent of convergence of the ρ-restriction agrees with the Hausdorff dimension of the ρ-restricted limit set, and the Poincaré series of the ρ-restriction diverges at the critical exponent. Furthermore, as ρ → ∞, the exponent of convergence of the ρ-restriction converges to the exponent of convergence of the original group. Reviewed by Petra Bonfert-Taylo...|$|R
40|$|However, uptake for Cu(II) and Cd(II) {{decreased}} at 37 C due to enhanced sulfide oxidation in ETB. Overall, 0. 1 M HCl was {{the most}} effective eluent to regenerate spent ETB. Sulfuric acid was not suitable to desorb ETB possibly due to <b>exhaustion</b> of amine <b>groups.</b> Decrease in Pb(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) uptake {{may be due to}} acid decomposition and oxidation of S functional groups. Addition of thiourea in HCl eluent alleviated the decrease of Pb(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) uptake. However, the enhanced S decomposition with increasing number of HCl desorption process progressively enhanced the uptake of Cu(II). The elucidation of mechanism of chitosan thiolation has potentially eliminated the unnecessary use of crosslinking agents to specifically improve bead stability. The enhance stability of ETB in acidic condition as well as increased sorption uptake for soft Lewis acids shows that ETB has great potentials for use in selective recovery of precious metals (Au(III), Ag(I), Pd(II), Pt(IV), etc) from mining and electroplating wastewater.

40|$|Purpose: Given the {{widespread}} use of water immersion during recovery from exercise, we aimed to investigate the effect of contrast water immersion on recovery of sprint cycling performance, HR and, blood lactate. Methods: Two groups completed high-intensity sprint exercise before and after a 30 -min randomized recovery. The Wingate group (n = 8) performed 3 x 30 -s Wingate tests (4 -min rest periods). The repeated intermittent sprint group (n = 8) cycled for alternating 30 -s periods at 40 % of predetermined maximum power and 120 % maximum power, until <b>exhaustion.</b> Both <b>groups</b> completed three trials using a different recovery treatment for each trial (balanced randomized application). Recovery treatments were passive rest, 1 : 1 contrast water immersion (2. 5 min of cold (8 -C) to 2. 5 min of hot (40 -C)), and 1 : 4 contrast water immersion (1 min of cold to 4 min of hot). Blood lactate and HR were recorded throughout, and peak power and total work for pre- and postrecovery Wingate performance and exercise time and total work for repeated sprinting were recorded. Results: Recovery of Wingate peak power was 8 % greater after 1 : 4 contrast water immersion than after passive rest, whereas both contrast water immersion ratios provided a greater recovery of exercise time (È 10 %) and total work (È 14 %) for repeated sprinting than for passive rest. Blood lactate was similar between trials. Compared with passive rest, HR initially declined more slowly during contrast water immersion but increased with each transition to a cold immersion phase. Conclusions: These data support contrast water immersion being effective in maintaining performance during a short-term recovery from sprint exercise. This effect needs further investigation but is likely explained by cardiovascular mechanisms, shown here by an elevation in HR upon each cold immersion. <br /...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to test whether endurance training can strengthen glutathione-dependent antioxidant defense mechanism and decrease lipid peroxidation in heart of the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Redox status of glutathione in blood of diabetic rats in response to training and acute exercise was also examined. Eight weeks of treadmill training increased the endurance in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. It did not affect glutathione level in heart tissue at rest and also after exercise. On the other hand, endurance training decreased glutathione peroxidase activity in heart, while glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities were not affected either by acute exhaustive exercise or endurance training. Reduced and oxidized glutathione levels in blood were not affected by either training or acute exercise. Conjugated dienes levels in heart tissue were increased by acute exhaustive exercise and also 8 weeks treadmill training.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the job-related stressors and coping methods of rural nurses. The conceptual basis for the study was based on theories by Selye (1965) on stress and Pearlin (1979) on coping. To identify rural nurses perceptions of stress and coping related to their jobs, the researcher utilized the ethnographic interview technique by Spradley (1979). The sample consisted of 24 female nurses who lived and worked in four rural settings of central Montana. Their positions ranged from staff to administration with several in mixed roles of administration, staff, and maintenance. Nurses experience job-related stress in rural areas from an inability to feel self-esteem from their jobs or from relationships between themselves and doctors, the institution, co-workers, other nurses, and the public. Coping methods are predominantly healthy, such as the use of talking, problem-solving, engaging in outside activities, and working as a cohesive <b>group.</b> <b>Exhaustion</b> was alluded to in coping methods such as forgetting and going on and trying to leave work at work.

40|$|Given the {{potential}} of reactive oxygen species to damage intracellular proteins during subsequent bouts of muscle contractions, it was suggested that, when this production exceeds the antioxidant capacity, the preexisting antioxidant pathways may be complemented by the synthesis of the defense mechanism represented by heat shock proteins (HSPs), stress proteins with the function of repair and maintaining protein folding. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed reactive carbonyl derivatives in plasma and the expression of HSP 72 and activities of enzymes from the oxidative and antioxidant defense systems in the soleus muscle of sedentary rats and rats trained by two protocols: continuous and intermittent. We analyzed all three groups at rest and 2 h after acute exercise. After 8 wk of training, the animals from both groups clearly demonstrated higher resistance to exercise. Both trained groups showed significantly higher citrate synthase, catalase, and glutathione reductase activities {{than the control group}} (P < 0. 01). After acute exercise, catalase and glutathione reductase activities significantly decreased (P < 0. 01) and plasma reactive carbonyl derivatives significantly increased (P < 0. 05) in the sedentary group, suggesting an oxidative-stress condition as responsible for <b>exhaustion</b> in this <b>group.</b> Finally, after acute exercise, the induction of HSP 72 expression occurred only in the sedentary group, suggesting that HSP 72 acts as a complementary protective mechanism in exercise-induced oxidative stress...|$|R

Employees perform emotional labor in response to explicit and perceived display rules for emotional expressions in the workplace.

This study proposes a process model of emotional labor that extends from display rules to job attitudes and behaviors. It is unique in that it investigates display rules and emotional labor at the group level of analysis. It also includes coworkers as well as customers as targets of emotional labor. Display rule commitment is proposed as {{an important}} moderator between emotional labor and important individual job attitudes and behaviors that may account for previously mixed findings in the literature.

40|$|Parentification (adolescents' {{adoption}} of adult family roles by providing instrumental or emotional {{support for their}} parents) {{is assumed to be}} higher in immigrant than native families. An often discussed reason for parentification is the adolescent-parent acculturation gap in immigrant families whereby immigrant adolescents acculturate faster and outperform their parents socio-culturally. The aim of this multi-informant, multi-group study was to investigate levels, predictors, and psychosocial outcomes of instrumental and emotional parentification. The sample comprised 197 native (adolescents: mean age 14. 7 years, 52 % female) and 185 ethnic German immigrant (adolescents: mean age 15. 7 years, 60 % female) mother-adolescent dyads. Results revealed higher levels of emotional and instrumental parentification among immigrant adolescents. Parents' partnership dissatisfaction predicted instrumental and emotional parentification only in the native German sample. Among immigrants, language brokering related to instrumental and emotional parentification, and a larger mother-adolescent acculturation gap was associated with higher levels of emotional parentification.

40|$|Removal of Cu(II) and Cd(II) from {{wastewater}} using porous chitosan beads {{is likely}} to be enhanced by the introduction of thiol groups (−SH). This is because, in accordance with the Hard Soft Acid Base concept, the soft Lewis base of –SH forms a strong bond with soft Lewis acid of Cd(II) or with borderline Lewis acids such as Cu(II). Possible formation of thiourea and disulfide crosslinks (−S–S–) may also confer increased bead stability in acidic solution. Thiolated chitosan beads (ETB) prepared and investigated in this study had a total sulfur content of 7. 9 %. The thiolation process slightly increased the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of the chitosan beads from 39. 5 to 46. 3 m 2 /g. This ETB was categorised as a microporous material (pore aperture: 1. 8 nm) with multiple and uniform porous layers. Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of three sulfur species, S(−I), S(−II) and S(V) attributed to –S–S–, –SH and sulfonate (−SO 3 −) groups. The Langmuir sorption capacity, qmax, for Cd(II) was improved by 18 times by thiolation of chitosan. However, the qmax for Cu(II) by ETB was seven times lower than that of pristine chitosan beads, possibly due to <b>exhaustion</b> of amine <b>groups</b> (−NH 2). The batch sorption data was generally fitted well by a linearised Freundlich isotherm model and a Ho’s pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating metal interaction with the heterogeneous surface of ETB and chemical adsorption as the possible rate-limiting step, respectively. The metal uptake has resulted in the oxidation of –SH to –SO 3 − group in ETB, thereby decreasing the stability of metal-sulfide bonds as well as their metal uptake. ...|$|R

Consequently, transfemoral amputee VO 2 max may be systematically underestimated, and the validity of these test protocols is questionable. Objectives: (1) Investigate validity and reliability of a VO 2 max walking protocol and (2) compare the VO 2 max of a transfemoral amputee group {{with a group of}} matching controls. Study design: (1) Randomized crossover study: walking versus running VO 2 max for the control group and (2) case-control study: transfemoral amputees versus control group VO 2 max. Methods: Twelve transfemoral amputees and control participants performed a walking VO 2 max test with increasing treadmill inclinations to voluntary <b>exhaustion.</b> The control <b>group</b> also completed a running (“gold-standard”) VO 2 max test. Results: Mean (standard deviation) control group VO 2 max following walking and running was similar, that is, 2. 99 (0. 6) L min− 1 and 3. 09 (0. 7) L min− 1, respectively. Mean (standard deviation) transfemoral amputee walking VO 2 max was 2. 14 (0. 8) L min− 1 (compared to CON; p < 0. 01). Mean intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated VO 2 measurements was 0. 97, and within-subjects standard deviation was 60 mL min− 1. Conclusions: The walk protocol is valid. Walking VO 2 max of transfemoral amputees was 40 % lower compared to control group. Reliability of the walking protocol is comparable to other walking protocols. Clinical relevance The design, alignment, and materials of prostheses are important for effective ambulation. Cardio-respiratory fitness is, however, also important in this regard, and a low fitness may compromise health and independent living.

Rats were killed by decapitation immediately (E 0 group, n = 6), 2 (E 2 group, n = 6), and 6 h (E 6 group, n = 6) after the exhaustive exercise, which consisted of running on a treadmill (approximately 70 % V(O 2 max)) for 50 min and then running at an elevated rate that increased at 1 m/min, until <b>exhaustion.</b> The control <b>group</b> (C group, n = 6) was not subjected to exercise. In RPAT, TLR- 4, MYD- 88, and IkB alpha increased in the E 2 group after exercise. MYD- 88 and TRAF 6 remained increased in the E 6 group in comparison with the control group. DNA-binding of NF-kappa Bp 65 was not altered. In MEAT, TLR- 4, MYD- 88, TRAF 6, and DNA-binding of NF-kappa Bp 65 were increased only in the E 6 group. In conclusion, we have shown that increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue pads after exhaustive exercise may be mediated via TLR- 4 signaling, leading to increases in NF-kappa Bp 65 binding to DNA in MEAT.

40|$|In many sports {{strength}} training improves performance {{significantly more than}} bare sport specific training. Combined strength and endurance (SE) training can lead to similar cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal adaptations compared to strength (S) or endurance (E) training alone. When both training types are performed in the same training session, {{strength training}} performed immediately after endurance training (E+S) may hinder strength development and improve endurance performance more than the opposite order (S+E). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate differences between S+E and E+S training during a 24 -week combined training period in muscle CSA and force production. A total of 32 men and 26 women participated to this study. Subjects were randomly assigned to four groups: men S+E, men E+S, women S+E, women E+S (mS+E, mE+S, wS+E, wE+S) and they performed two 12 weeks training periods with measurements at weeks 0 (pre), 12 (mid) and 24 (post). Measurements included neuromuscular (1 RM, isometric strength, MVC 500, power), cardiorespiratory (VO 2 max, time to exhaustion) and muscle size (ultrasound, DXA) measurements. Subjects trained twice a week during weeks 0 – 12 and five times in two weeks during weeks 13 – 24. In the first training period the strength training included loads of 40 – 60 % (weeks 0 – 2) 60 – 80 % (weeks 3 – 7) and 80 – 95 % (weeks 8 – 12) of 1 RM. The endurance training included two different training sessions. The first training session included continuous cycling around the aerobic threshold for 30 – 45 min, whereas the second training session was interval training. The training program both for strength and endurance was similar during training period 2, but the loads were increased based on the development. All training groups improved significantly 1 RM (all groups p< 0. 001), isometric strength (mS+E and wS+E p< 0. 01, mE+S and wE+S p< 0. 001), MVC 500 (mS+E, mE+S and wS+E p< 0. 01, wE+S p< 0. 001), power (mS+E p< 0. 001, mE+S, wS+E and wE+S p< 0. 01), time to <b>exhaustion</b> (all <b>groups</b> p< 0. 001), CSA (VL 50 % (mS+E p< 0. 001, mE+S, wS+E and wE+S p< 0. 01), and lean mass of legs (all groups p< 0. 001) during the 24 -week training period. In VO 2 max all except mE+S improved significantly (mS+E and wS+E p< 0. 01, wE+S p< 0. 05). In the ultrasound measurement wE+S increased CSA in VL 50 % significantly more than wS+E (18. 7 ± 11. 2 % vs. 8. 8 ± 8. 7 %, p< 0. 05) and mE+S (18. 7 ± 11. 2 % vs. 10. 4 ± 8. 4 %, p< 0. 05). In time to exhaustion, wE+S improved significantly more than mE+S (21. 7 ± 10. 9 % vs. 13. 1 ± 8. 6 %, p< 0. 05). According to this study, muscle CSA, muscle strength and endurance performance improved with combined single session strength and endurance training independently of the training order. In addition, wE+S showed larger muscle hypertrophy (CSA) than that of observed when training by the opposite order and larger than in men using the same E+S order...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{exhaustive}} exercise increases serum and skeletal muscle IL- 6 concentrations. However, the effect of exhaustive exercise on the concentrations of other cytokines in the muscle and in the adipose tissue is controversial. {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of exhaustive exercise on mRNA and protein expression of IL- 10, TNF-alpha and IL- 6 in different types of skeletal muscle (EDL, soleus) and in two different depots of white adipose tissue (mesenteric-MEAT and retroperitoneal-RPAT). Rats were killed by decapitation immediately (E 0 group, n = 6), 2 (E 2 group, n = 6) and 6 (E 6 group, n = 6) hours after the exhaustion protocol, which consisted of running on a treadmill (approximately 70 % VO 2 max for 50 min and then subsequently at an elevated rate that increased at 1 m/min every minute, until <b>exhaustion).</b> the control <b>group</b> (C group, n = 6) was not subjected to exercise. Cytokine protein expression increased in EDL, soleus, MEAT and RPAT from all exercised groups, as detected by ELISA. EDL IL- 10 and TNF-alpha expression was higher than that of the soleus. the IL- 10 /TNF-alpha ratio was increased in the skeletal muscle, especially in EDL, but it was found to be decreased in the adipose tissue. These results show that exhaustive exercise presents a different effect depending on the tissue which is analysed: in the muscle, it induces an anti-inflammatory effect, especially in type 2 fibres, while the pro-inflammatory effect prevails in adipose tissue, possibly contributing to increased lipolysis to provide energy for the exercising muscle.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Strength {{training}} or aerobic exercise programmes might optimise muscle and cardiorespiratory function and prevent additional disuse atrophy and deconditioning {{in people with}} a muscle disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2004. OBJECTIVES: To examine the safety and efficacy of strength training and aerobic exercise training in people with a muscle disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (July 2012), CENTRAL (2012 Issue 3 of 4), MEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2012), EMBASE Classic (1947 to 1973) and CINAHL (January 1982 to July 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing strength {{training or}} aerobic exercise programmes, or both, to no training, and lasting at least six weeks, in people with a well-described diagnosis of a muscle disease. We {{did not use the}} reporting of specific outcomes as a study selection criterion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data obtained from the full text-articles and from the original investigators. We collected adverse event data from included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (170 participants). The first trial compared the effect of strength training versus no training in 36 people with myotonic dystrophy. The second trial compared aerobic exercise training versus no training in 14 people with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. The third trial compared strength training versus no training in a factorial trial that also compared albuterol with placebo, in 65 people with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). The fourth trial compared combined strength training and aerobic exercise versus no training in 18 people with mitochondrial myopathy. The fifth trial compared combined strength training and aerobic exercise versus no training in 35 people with myotonic dystrophy type 1. In both myotonic dystrophy trials and the dermatomyositis and polymyositis trial {{there were no significant differences}} between training and non-training groups for primary and secondary outcome measures. The risk of bias of the strength training trial in myotonic dystrophy and the aerobic exercise trial in polymyositis and dermatomyositis was judged as uncertain, and for the combined strength training and aerobic exercise trial, the risk of bias was judged as adequate. In the FSHD trial, for which the risk of bias was judged as adequate, a + 1. 17 kg difference (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 18 to 2. 16) in dynamic strength of elbow flexors in favour of the training group reached statistical significance. In the mitochondrial myopathy trial, there were no significant differences in dynamic strength measures between training and non-training groups. Exercise duration and distance cycled in a submaximal endurance test increased significantly in the training group compared to the control group. The differences in mean time and mean distance cycled till <b>exhaustion</b> between <b>groups</b> were 23. 70 min (95 % CI 2. 63 to 44. 77) and 9. 70 km (95 % CI 1. 51 to 17. 89), respectively. The risk of bias was judged as uncertain. In all trials, no adverse events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-intensity strength training in myotonic dystrophy and FSHD and aerobic exercise training in dermatomyositis and polymyositis and myotonic dystrophy type I appear to do no harm, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that they offer benefit. In mitochondrial myopathy, aerobic exercise combined with strength training appears to be safe and may be effective in increasing submaximal endurance capacity. Limitations in the design of studies in other muscle diseases prevent more general conclusions in these disorders...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver {{two million}} pilgrims perform annual rituals in Makkah region, which when coincides with summer months, exposes them to outdoor {{temperatures}} exceeding 45 °C and humidity approaching 80 %. Accordingly, heat illnesses are common including explicit heat strokes and heat exhaustion. No previous studies elaborated on electrocardiographic changes among this unique cohort. ObjectiveTo compare electrocardiographic changes in three groups exposed to high outdoor temperatures, namely, patients with heat stroke compared {{to patients with}} heat exhaustion and a control group exposed to the same outdoor temperatures without clinical manifestations. Subjects and methodsThrough case control design, two case groups of patients were selected. The first group (G 1) was 34 patients admitted to the cooling units with clinical picture of heat stroke and the second group (G 2) comprised 28 patients admitted with heat <b>exhaustion.</b> The control <b>group</b> (G 3) included 31 patients selected from relatives of patients and outdoor workers. The outcome for comparison was 12 -lead electrocardiographic changes done for all selected individuals. For (G 1), the ECG was done while they were prepared for cooling or immediately when cooling was started. ResultsIn G 1, 18 were females and 16 males with ages of 20 – 76 years (59 ± 11 years). Their heart rates ranged from 64 to 160 beats per minute (mean 120 ± 24 per minute). Only 5 / 34 ECGs were completely normal. Sinus tachycardia was present in 27 / 34 patients (79 %), with ischemic changes in 9 / 34 ECGs. In G 2, 24 were males and four females with ages of 25 – 80 (mean 47 ± 15 years), the heart rate ranged from 64 to 170 per minute (mean 97 ± 16 per minute). Seven out of 28 ECGs were normal (25 %) while 21 / 28 had some abnormalities. None had ischemic changes. Control group (G 3), was five females and 26 males ages 18 – 80 years (mean 38 ± 15 years), 22 / 31 had normal ECGs (71 %). All had normal sinus rhythm, 56 – 98 beats per minute (74 ± 11). Nine patients had some electrocardiographic abnormalities but none had ischemic changes. ConclusionWe conclude that electrocardiographic abnormalities occur with a high frequency in patients with heat stroke and heat exhaustion, with sinus tachycardia and ischemic changes occurring more frequently in patients with heat stroke...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: As proteínas do soro de leite são consideradas de alto valor nutritivo. Elas têm escore químico {{superior}} às de outras proteínas de origem animal, possuem elevadas concentrações de aminoácidos de cadeia ramificada (BCAA), com excelente balanço e biodisponibilidade de aminoácidos essenciais. As proteínas de soro de leite vêm sendo largamente utilizadas pela indústria de alimentos como suplemento na alimentação de esportistas, devido às suas características fisiológicas e funcionais, destacando-se o uso dos hidrolisados, que tem sido recomendado para situações de estresse metabólico como o exercício físico em que a reposição de proteínas no organismo se torna necessária. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar alterações metabólicas induzidas pelo consumo de proteínas do soro de leite [isolado (ISL) e seu hidrolisado (HSL) com grau de hidrólise 10 %] em comparação com a dieta padrão [caseína (CAS) ], utilizadas como única fonte protéica em ratos submetidos ao exercício físico. Foram utilizados 96 ratos machos Wistar (~ 100 g) divididos em grupos segundo o tipo de dieta (CAS, ISL e HSL) e a intensidade do exercício físico [treinados (T), treinados exaustos (TEX), sedentários (S) e sedentários exaustos (SEX) ] durante 35 dias. Os seguintes parâmetros foram analisados: tempo de exaustão, concentração de lactato no sangue, glicogênio hepático (GH) e muscular (GM), atividade das enzimas marcadoras de lesão tecidual, incluindo lactato desidrogenase (LDH), creatina quinase (CK), alanina e aspartato aminotranferase (ALT e AST, respectivamente). Os animais alimentados com HSL nos grupos TEX e SEX conseguiram correr por muito mais tempo até atingir a exaustão em relação aos que receberam as dietas com CAS e ISL (p< 0. 05). O tempo de exaustão em relação à dieta CAS foi 72 min maior no grupo TEX e 44 min maior no grupo SEX. A diferença no tempo de exaustão entre os animais alimentados com as dietas de HSL e ISL foi de 40 min. no grupo TEX e de 13 min no grupo SEX. A concentração de lactato dos animais alimentados com ISL e HSL foi significativamente menor em relação aos alimentados com CAS nos grupos T e S (p< 0, 05). A concentração de glicogênio hepático dos animais que receberam as dietas com ISL e HSL foi estatisticamente superior em comparação com os que consumiram CAS nos grupos T(46 %) e S (61 %). A concentração de glicogênio muscular não apresentou diferenças significativas entre as três dietas nos diferentes grupos de treinamento (TEX, SEX, T e S). A atividade da ALT dos animais que consumiram HSL nos grupos SEX e S foi estatisticamente menor que os que receberam CAS. A atividade da AST dos animais alimentados com HSL foi significativamente menor que a dos que consumiram a dieta com CAS nos diferentes grupos de treinamento (TEX, SEX, T e S). A atividade da CK e LDH dos ratos que receberam a dieta com HSL foi estatisticamente menor que dos alimentados com CAS em todos os grupos de treinamento exceto no grupo S. Dos resultados obtidos neste trabalho pode-se concluir que o uso das proteínas do soro de leite [principalmente o hidrolisado (10 % grau de hidrólise) ] em relação à proteína padrão (CAS) como única fonte protéica em ratos submetidos a exercício físico, promoveu a) menor ganho de peso em todos os grupos, b) maior resistência à exaustão tanto no grupo TEX como no SEX, c) maior concentração de glicogênio hepático nos grupos T e S e d) maior proteção contra possíveis lesões hepáticas e musculares nos diferentes grupos estudados (TEX, SEX, T e S) Abstract: The {{milk whey}} proteins {{are considered to}} be of high nutritive value and superior chemical score in comparison to other proteins of animal origin. They have high concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) with excellent balance and bioavailability of essential amino acids. The milk whey proteins are widely used in the food industry as supplements for sportsmen due to their physiological and functional properties, and their hydrolysates are thought to be more efficient in the recovery of debilitated organisms under pronounced catabolic state because of their great stimulation to protein synthesis. In view of the energy value of proteins in exhaustive exercise, several studies on exercise and protein metabolism have been carried out in the attempt to elucidate the proper amount of protein that must be consumed by sportsmen. The present work had the objective of evaluating the metabolic changes induced by consumption of milk whey proteins [isolate (WPI) and its hydrolysate (WPH) with hydrolysis degree 10 %] used as the only protein source in comparison to the standard diet [casein (CAS) ] in rats submitted to physical exercise. 96 male Wistar rats (~ 100 g) were divided in groups according to the type of diet (CAS, ISL and HSL) and the intensity of physical exercise [trained (T), trained taken to exhaustion (TEX), sedentary (S) and sedentary exhausted (SEX) ] during 35 days. The following parameters were analyzed: time of exhaustion (min.), blood lactate concentration (mmol/L), liver glycogen (LG) and muscular glycogen (MG) (g/ 100 g of tissue), activity of tissue injury marker enzymes (U/L) including lactate desidrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and alanine and aspartate aminotranferase (ALT and AST respectively). The results showed that the animals fed with HSL in the groups TEX and SEX ran for much longer times until exhaustion in relation to the ones that received the diets with CAS and ISL (p< 0. 05). The exhaustion time in relation to the CAS diet was 72 min longer for the TEX group and 44 min longer for the SEX group. The difference in exhaustion time between the animals fed with the WPH and WPI diets was of 40 min for the group TEX and 13 min for the SEX group. The lactate concentration in the animals fed with WPI and WPH was statistically lower than in the ones fed with CAS in the groups T and S (p 99 < 0, 05). The concentration of liver glycogen in the animals that received the diets with WPI and WPH was statistically higher than in the animals that consumed CAS in the groups T (46 %) and S (61 %). The concentration of muscular glycogen did not have significant differences between the three types of diet in the different groups of training (TEX, SEX, T and S). The activity of the ALT of the animals that consumed WPH in the groups SEX and S was statistically lower than that of the animals that received CAS. The activity of the AST of the animals fed with WPH was significantly lower than that of the animals that consumed the diet with CAS in all of the groups of training (TEX, SEX, T and S). The activity of CK and LDH in the rats fed with HSL diet was statistical lower than in the ones fed with CAS in all of the groups of training except in the group S. From the results obtained in this work it can be concluded that the use of milk whey proteins [mainly the whey protein hydrolysate (10 % hydrolysis degree) ] in relation to the standard protein (CAS) as the only protein source in rats submitted to physical exercise promoted a) lesser weight gain in all of the groups, b) higher resistance to <b>exhaustion</b> in <b>groups</b> TEX and SEX, c) higher hepatic glycogen concentration in groups T and S and d) higher protection against possible hepatic and muscular injuries in all of the studied groups (TEX, SEX, T and S...|$|R
