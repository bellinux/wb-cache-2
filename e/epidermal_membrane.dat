The distribution of Heparin within skin tissue was studied by the tape stripping method. Heparin concentrations were measured with a biological assay. Transepidermal water loss was determined to characterize barrier properties of skin. No consistent permeation of Heparin through <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> was detected. Penetration into the <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> was for LMWH significantly greater than for UH. Accumulation of UH was largely restricted to the outermost layers of the stratum corneum while LMWH penetrated into deeper epidermal layers. UH penetration into epidermis was detected for the PL 80 liposomal formulation only. The extent of LMWH penetration was independent of the formulation, LMWH, however, showed a trend to accumulate in deeper epidermal layers for the PL 80 compared to the aqueous formulation. Thus, molecular weight and liposomal formulations influenced the penetration pattern of Heparin in the epidermis. It can not be concluded whether the concentration of LMWH achieved at the blood capillaries is sufficient to exert a pharmacological effect. UH permeated readily through dermis irrespectively of formulation and its accumulation in the dermis was significantly enhanced and its lag time of permeation increased in the presence of SM liposomes...|$|E

In the current work we examined the in vitro topical delivery of punicalagin (major phytochemical of PRE) and zinc from hydrogels across epithelial membranes that can become infected with HSV. Porcine epidermal, buccal and vaginal mucous membranes were excised and mounted in Franz diffusion cells and dosed with a simple hydrogel containing PRE and zinc sulphate (ZnSO 4). The permeation of punicalagin and zinc were determined by HPLC and ICPMS respectively; punicalagin was also determined in the basal layers by reverse tape stripping. Receptor phases from the <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> experiment were also used to challenge HSV- 1 in Vero host cells, and ex vivo porcine skin was used to probe COX- 2 modulation. Punicalagin and zinc permeated {{each of the three}} test membranes, with significantly greater amounts of both delivered across the <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane.</b> The amounts of punicalagin permeating the buccal and vaginal membranes were similar, although the amount of zinc permeating the vaginal membrane was comparatively very large – it is known that zinc interacts with vaginal mucosa.

Absorption rates for each phthalate ester were determined and a second tritiated water permeability assessment made to quantify any irreversible alterations in barrier function due to contact with the esters. Rat skin was consistently more permeable to phthalate esters than the human skin. As the esters became more lipophilic and less hydrophilic, the rate of absorption was reduced. Contact with the esters caused little change in the barrier properties of human skin, but caused marked increases in the permeability to water of rat skin. Although differences were noted between species, the absolute rates of absorption measured indicate that the phthalate esters are slowly absorbed through both human and rat skin...|$|R

Due to the immuncompromised {{status of}} AIDS patients, {{secondary}} infections and malignancies are common. Conditions secondary to AIDS for which patients require treatment include Karposi's sarcoma (treated with methotrexate), varicella-zoster (treated with antivirals such as acyclovir) and herpes simplex (also treated with antivirals like acyclovir or idoxuridme). However the clinical efficacy {{of these drugs}} is limited by poor skin permeability. Few reports, however, {{have dealt with the}} delivery of low molecular weight hydrophilic drugs from these vesicles (El Maghraby et al, 2000). The aim of our study was to investigate in vitro permeation of methotrexate, acyclovir and idoxuridine across human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> from elastic liposomes. The intent was to establish whether formulation of these hydrophilic drugs into elastic liposomes would enhance their skin permeation parameters. We developed and validated high-performance liquid chromatographic techniques for quantitative analysis of methotrexate, idoxuridine and acyclovir. Elastic liposomes were prepared from various phospholipids- phosphatidylcholine 78. 6 %; phosphatidylcholine 50 %; hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine 90 %; phosphatidylcholine 95 % and surfactants - sodium cholate, sodium deoxycholate, Span 20, 40, 60, 80. These vesicles were characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The solubilities of methotrexate, acyclovir and idoxuridine were determined. Phospholipon G (95 % phosphatidylcholine) was chosen for the preparation of the liposomes with different surfactants. Permeation of methotrexate, acyclovir and idoxuridme from these vesicles across human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> was investigated. Flux values for methotrexate, acyclovir and idoxuridine values (J) obtained by curve-fitting of data using Easyplot were compared to those obtained by linear regression. We used Student's t-test to determine statistically significant differences in the flux values of the formulations. A computer program [URL] bulk-form. html was used for this purpose. Our results indicate that there are no statistically significant differences between flux values from elastic liposomes and saturated aqueous solutions. Doctora...|$|E

Furthermore, FT-IR studies were conducted to understand to possible enhancement mechanism. Piperine, at all three concentrations tested, significantly increased flux of the drug compared to control (p< 0. 05). Similarly permeability coefficient (Kp), cumulative amount release (Q 24) and enhancement ratio (ER) shown significant increase over control sample whereas skin content of aceclofenac and lag-time of enhancer treated <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> shown proportionate reduction over control. FT-IR studies reveal that piperine reduces peak area by 19. 17 % and 16. 87 % for symmetric and asymmetric stretching peaks.

In vitro experiments were carried out in static diffusion cells using viable full-thickness skin membranes (rat and human), non-viable <b>epidermal</b> <b>membranes</b> (rat and human) and a perfused-pig-ear model. Percutaneous penetration of propoxur in human volunteers was measured by analysis of its metabolite (2 -isopropoxyphenol) in blood and urine; in all other studies radiolabeled propoxur ([ring-U- 14 C]propoxur) was used. In order to allow for direct comparison, experimental conditions were standardized with respect to dose (150 μg propoxur per cm 2), vehicle (60 % aqueous ethanol) and exposure time (4 h). In human volunteers, {{it was found that}} approximately 6 % of the applied dose was excreted via the urine after 24 h, while the potential absorbed dose (amount applied minus amount washed off) was 23 μg/cm 2.

In vivo studies were performed in rats and human volunteers, applying the test compound to the dorsal skin and the volar aspect of the forearm, respectively. In vitro studies were performed using static diffusion cells with viable full-thickness skin membranes (rat and human), nonviable <b>epidermal</b> <b>membranes</b> (rat and human), and a perfused pig ear model. For the purpose of conducting in vitro/in vivo comparisons, standardized experimental conditions were used with respect to dose (120 μg OPP/cm 2), vehicle (60 % aqueous ethanol), and exposure duration (4 h). In human volunteers, the potentially absorbed dose (amount applied minus dislogded) was 105 μg/cm 2, while approximately 27 % of the applied dose was excreted with urine within 48 h. In rats these values were 67 μg/cm 2 and 40 %, respectively. In vitro methods accurately predicted human in vivo percutaneous absorption of OPP {{on the basis of}} the potential absorbed dose.

This research seeks {{to develop a new}} lipid-based nanosome that enables the effective delivery of siRNA into human skin. The major finding is that an ultraflexible siRNA-containing nanosome—prepared using DOTAP, cholesterol, sodium cholate, and 30 % ethanol—penetrates into the epidermis of freshly excised intact human skin and is able to enter into the keratinocytes. The nanosomes, called surfactant-ethanol-cholesterol-osomes (SECosomes), show excellent size, surface charge, morphology, deformability, transfection efficiency, stability, and skin penetration capacity after complexation with siRNA. Importantly, these nanosomes have ideal characteristics for siRNA encapsulation, in that the siRNA is stable for at least 4 weeks, they enable highly efficient transfection of in vitro cultured cells, and are shown to transport siRNA delivery through intact human skin where changes in the keratinocyte cell state are demonstrated. It is concluded that increasing flexibility in nanosomes greatly enhances their ability to cross the intact human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> and to unload their payload into targeted epidermal cells. ...|$|E

The specificity of the alkaline enzyme with respect to acyl groups could not be determined due to the marked hydrolysis of lysophosphatidyl choline.

The acid phospholipase was localized primarily in a fragile large particle fraction while the alkaline enzyme was present in various subcellular fractions and most active in the soluble supernatant.

Human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> fluxes and stratum corneum solubilities of neat and diluted solutions of three esters were determined under hydrated and dehydrated conditions.

Further, we showed that unlike methyl and ethyl salicylate, glycol salicylate is hygroscopic and the ∼ 10 -fold hydration-induced flux enhancement seen with neat glycol salicylate may be due to its ability to hydrate the stratum corneum to a greater extent. The hydration-induced enhancements in in vitro epidermal flux seen here for glycol and ethyl salicylate were similar to those reported for their percutaneous absorption rates in a comparable in vivo study, whilst somewhat higher enhancement was seen for methyl salicylate in vivo. This may be explained by a physiologically induced self enhancement of neat methyl salicylate absorption in vivo which is not applicable in vitro...|$|E

In studies of human skin, papulonodular basal cell carcinomas have served as a useful model for the investigation of various basement membrane antigens and matrix proteins. To further investigate the presence of C 3 d,g within <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> as well as examine its relationship with other known basement membrane constituents, we have analyzed serial sections of ten papulonodular basal cell carcinomas by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. In these studies, C 3 d,g was either absent (N = 9) or minimumly detectable (N = 1) in tumor nest basement membranes. While bullous pemphigoid and KF- 1 antigens were absent (N = 6 and N = 3, respectively) or significantly decreased (N = 4 and N = 7, respectively), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen was routinely present though somewhat (N = 3) or moderately decreased (N = 3). Laminin and type IV collagen were expressed normally in all tumor nest basement membranes. All constituents, including C 3 d,g, were present in adjacent normal <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> of these tumor samples. This study has demonstrated antigenic alterations within each ultrastructural subregion of papulonodular basal cell carcinoma tumor nest basement membranes by identifying the virtual absence of C 3 d,g (sublamina densa) as well as a significant reduction in KF- 1 (lamina densa) and bullous pemphigoid (lamina lucida) antigens. Moreover, the presence of laminin, type IV collagen, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen in tumor nest basement membranes suggests that these particular constituents neither cleave C 3 nor act as essential binding sites for passive incorporation of this complement component in <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane.</b> These studies give additional support to the hypothesis that C 3 d,g is a previously unrecognized constituent of normal <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> and does not represent passive incorporation of circulating C 3 at this site in human skin...|$|R

No such reactivity is present within dermal microvascular basement membranes. By direct immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-human C 3 d,g antibodies bind {{the base of the}} cleavage plane in 1 M NaCl split human skin. By immunoelectron microscopy, anti-human C 3 d,g reactivity is found along the base of the lamina densa and in the sublamina densa region. Control antibodies directed against human C 3, C 3 c, CS, IgG, IgA, or IgM do not bind normal human <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> or identify in situ deposits of immune complexes in multiple samples of normal human skin that are all positive for C 3 d,g. Preabsorption of monoclonal or polyclonal anti- human C 3 d,g antibodies with purified human C 3 d completely blocks these reagents' <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> reactivity. Studies of skin samples from a patient with con- genital C 3 deficiency reveal that anti-human C 3 d,g antibodies do not bind this subject's <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane.</b> Moreover, in vitro treatment of this patient's skin with normal serum, aged serum containing C 3 d,g, purified human C 3, or zymosan-serum reaction mixtures does not restore <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> anti-human C 3 d,g binding. Studies of other primate tissues demonstrate that C 3 d,g is not restricted to basement membranes of stratified squamous epithelia as it is also present within renal tubule and glomerular basement membranes. While a recent study has demonstrated that C 3 d binds laminin in vitro, our investigations show a difference in both the regional and ultrastructural distribution of laminin and C 3 d,g in normal human skin. Furthermore, C 3 d,g is absent from laminin-rich basement membranes of papulonodular basal cell carcinomas. These findings suggest that C 3 d,g is not passively incorporated within selected epithelial basement membranes but rather is a previously unrecognized normal constituent. Basement membrane-associated C 3 d,g {{may play a role in}} adhesive interactions between leukocytes and matrix proteins. Moreover, a C 3 d,g binding site(s) in selected epithelial basement membranes may account for the accumulation of C 3 containing immune complexes in such tissues...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{interaction}} between lipids, solvents and active substances in lipid based formulations have been studied and related to formulation structure or release behavior on human skin or a model thereof. For the different investigations, isotropic equilibrium lipid phases, i. e. bicontinuous cubic and sponge phases or water-in-oil microemulsions, were used. 	Bicontinuous liquid crystalline cubic phases formed of the polar lipids monoolein (MO) and phytantriol (PT) were used to deliver δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its methylester (m-ALA) in nude BALB/c mice in vivo and the fluorescent probe sulphorhodamine B (SRB) in full-thickness human skin in vitro. Fluorescence imaging and spectrophotometric measurements revealed that ALA and m-ALA delivered from the cubic phases induced an intense and homogenous fluorescence in mice. By using two-photon microscopy (TPM), {{it was revealed that}} the lipid cubic formulations penetrated into micro-fissures of the skin, thus, were acting as reservoirs for the active substance (SRB), which may explain the results in the former study. 	A detailed phase diagram was made for the propylene glycol (PG) -PT-water system to reveal the effect caused by the lipid- as well as water-miscible solvent, i. e. PG. The results showed that lower amounts of PG could be incorporated in the cubic phase, but larger amounts did not induce a sponge phase, which is possible in the corresponding MO system. MO contains an ester bond that is susceptible to hydrolysis and therefore the PT system is a good alternative when high and low pH is present. 	A characterization of the bicontinuous MO sponge phase with up to 16 % (w/w) of m-ALA was performed with polarized light, small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) and NMR diffusometry (NMRD). Additions over 4 % m-ALA, transformed the isotropic sponge phase into an anisotropic phase. Isotropic phases were re-formed with small additions of water to the anisotropic samples. All methods used indicated that a bicontinuous structure was present in the investigated samples. The sponge phase was also shown to be able to conduct electrical current and was therefore used in iontophoretic experiments. The MO sponge phase with 16 % m-ALA showed in combination with iontophoresis slightly lower fluxes than the clinically used references, while results from passive diffusion were similar to the references. 	The in vitro transport of benzophenone- 3 (BZ- 3) from a medium chain triglyceride (MCT) based microemulsion (ME) over silicone and human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> was also investigated as the polarity of the hydrophobic domain was changed. The polarity change was done by an exchange of the slightly polar lipid MCT to the non-polar lipid isohexadecane. Passive diffusion experiments performed over the silicone membrane revealed an unexpected minimum in release rate as the polarity was changed into less polar. NMRD and SAXD were used to characterize the microstructures of the MEs, and revealed the presence of loosely held organizations in some of the investigated samples. However, a minimum in release was not found when using the human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> instead of the silicone membrane...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of liposome formulations consisting of Phospholipon 80 and sphingomyelin with human skin was investigated. These formulations were shown previously {{to have a}} composition-dependent effect on the penetration of Heparin into the skin. Fluorescence labelled phosphatidylethanolamine (PE-NBD) was incorporated in the liposomes and the depth in which the fluorescent phospholipid label enters into <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> and full thickness skin was studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Confocal sections parallel {{to the surface of}} the skin were recorded in heat separated epidermis. An even distribution of phospholipid in the lipid matrix of the stratum corneum surrounding the corneocytes was observed with Phospholipon 80 but not when sphingomyelin was included in the formulation. The addition of Heparin which formed a coating around the liposomes, caused a strong localization of fluorescence within the epidermis. For full thickness skin, mechanical cross sections of skin were made and optical sections were recorded parallel to the plane of cut. Phospholipid penetrated and was distributed fairly homogeneously in the lower dermis layers within 30 min of application regardless of liposome composition and the presence of Heparin. This rather quick penetration process seemed to follow distinct pathways along the epidermis and the upper dermis, notably the hair follicle route. Thus, a strong and in some respects composition-dependent {{interaction of}} phospholipids with skin is evident. These observations, however, are limited to the level of phospholipid molecules, rather than of entire liposomes interacting with skin...|$|E
40|$|The {{stratum corneum}} (SC) {{represents}} a significant {{barrier to the}} delivery of gene therapy formulations. In order to realise the potential of therapeutic cutaneous gene transfer, delivery strategies are required to overcome this exclusion effect. This study investigates the ability of microfabricated silicon microneedle arrays to create micron-sized channels through the SC of ex vivo human skin and the resulting ability of the conduits to facilitate localised delivery of charged macromolecules and plasmid DNA (pDNA). Microscopic studies of microneedle-treated human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> revealed the presence of microconduits (10 - 20 microm diameter). The delivery of a macromolecule, beta-galactosidase, and of a 'non-viral gene vector mimicking' charged fluorescent nanoparticle to the viable epidermis of microneedle-treated tissue was demonstrated using light and fluorescent microscopy. Track etched permeation profiles, generated using 'Franz-type' diffusion cell methodology and a model synthetic membrane showed that > 50 % of a colloidal particle suspension permeated through membrane pores in approximately 2 hours. On {{the basis of these}} results, it is probable that microneedle treatment of the skin surface would facilitate the cutaneous delivery of lipid:polycation:pDNA (LPD) gene vectors, and other related vectors, to the viable epidermis. Preliminary gene expression studies confirmed that naked pDNA can be expressed in excised human skin following microneedle disruption of the SC barrier. The presence of a limited number of microchannels, positive for gene expression, indicates that further studies to optimise the microneedle device morphology, its method of application and the pDNA formulation are warranted to facilitate more reproducible cutaneous gene delivery...|$|E
40|$|Although much {{is known}} about the initial {{construction}} of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), less well understood are the processes that maintain the position and connections of nerves during postembryonic growth. Here, we show that the posterior lateral line nerve in zebrafish initially grows in the epidermis and then rapidly transitions across the <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> into the subepidermal space. Our experiments indicate that Schwann cells, which myelinate axons in the PNS, are required to reposition the nerve. In mutants lacking Schwann cells, the nerve is mislocalized and the axons remain in the epidermis. Transplanting wild-type Schwann cells into these mutants rescues the position of the nerve. Analysis of chimeric embryos suggests that the process of nerve relocalization involves two discrete steps – the degradation and recreation of the <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane.</b> Although the outgrowth of axons is normal in mutants lacking Schwann cells, the nerve becomes severely disorganized at later stages. In wild-type embryos, exclusion of the nerve from the epidermis isolates axons from migration of their targets (sensory neuromasts) within the epidermis. Without Schwann cells, axons remain within the epidermis and are dragged along with the migrating neuromasts. Our analysis of the posterior lateral line system defines a new process in which Schwann cells relocate a nerve beneath the <b>epidermal</b> basement <b>membrane</b> to insulate axons from the postembryonic remodeling of their targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{glycoprotein}} {{components of}} a plasma membrane-enriched fraction from pig epidermis were isolated by deoxycholate extraction and affinity chromatography on concanavalin A (ConA) -Sepharose 4 B. Reduction with 5 % 2 -mercaptoethanol, electrophoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide slab gels, and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining resolved the major glycoproteins into at least 5 components of Mr 180 K, 150 K, 130 K, 100 K and 85 K. Neuraminidase removed essentially all the salic acid {{whether or not the}} glycoproteins were solubilized with detergents. Neuraminidase treatment increased the electrophoretic mobility of most components on one- dimension polyacrylamide gels, indicating their sialoglycoprotein nature. An antiserum was raised in rabbits against isolated <b>epidermal</b> plasma <b>membrane</b> glycoproteins. Isolated immunoglobulins were used in crossed immunoelectrophoretic analysis of the glycoproteins and produced 5 major immunoprecipitates. The glycoprotein nature of the immunoprecipitates was shown by their susceptibility to neuraminidase. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis was used to examine the lectin binding specificity of isolated <b>epidermal</b> plasma <b>membrane</b> glycoproteins. The immunoprecipitation patterns were affected strongly by Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA), moderately by wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA), and weakly by soybean agglutinin (SBA). Peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) had little effect on the immunoprecipitation patterns, indicating little interaction between <b>epidermal</b> plasma <b>membrane</b> glycoprotein and these lectins. Other glycoproteins and/or glycolipids must therefore be responsible for the binding of these lectins by epidermal cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} human skin {{penetration}} of linalool [CAS # 78 - 70 - 6] was assessed in three vehicles relevant to fragrance exposure [1 : 3 Ethanol:diethyl phthalate (1 : 3 EtOH:DEP), 1 : 3 Ethanol:dipropylene glycol (1 : 3 EtOH:DPG) and petrolatum]. The assays were conducted under both occlusive and non-occlusive conditions. Diffusion cells were prepared with <b>epidermal</b> <b>membranes</b> obtained from surgical donors. Permeation of linalool, from a 5 μl/cm 2 target dose of a 4 % (w/v) solution, was measured at twelve time-points over 24 hours, using a {{phosphate buffered saline}} receptor phase. At 24 hours, the <b>epidermal</b> <b>membranes</b> were wiped, tape stripped 10 times and the linalool content of the wipes, strips and remaining epidermis determined. The fi lter paper skin supports were extracted and the diffusion cell donor chambers washed and wiped. Potential evaporative loss of linalool was estimated by measuring the loss from PTFE sheets under the same experimental conditions. Levels of linalool in the epidermis (plus any remaining stratum corneum after tape stripping), fi lter paper membrane support and receptor fl uid were combined to produce a total absorbed dose value. Under non-occlusive conditions 2. 71 ± 0. 2 % of the applied dose was absorbed at 24 hours in 1 : 3 EtOH:DEP, 2. 01 ± 0. 2 % in 1 : 3 EtOH:DPG and 3. 54 ± 0. 4 % in petrolatum. Under occlusive conditions 7. 33 ± 0. 58 % of the applied dose was absorbed at 24 hours in 1 : 3 EtOH:DEP, 12. 1 ± 1. 5 % in 1 : 3 EtOH:DPG and 10. 5 ± 1. 1 % in petrolatum. Evaporative loss was signifi cant and accounted for the differences in absorption between occluded and non-occluded conditions. From these results, systemic exposure to linalool from use in fragrances {{would be expected to}} be low based on currently reported use levels. In addition to providing information to risk assessments, the variety of vehicles will provide comparative data to assist in the development of dermal absorption models for this material...|$|R

DOI: 10. 1007 / 978 - 1 - 59745 - 210 - 6 _ 5 Human skin serves a protective function by imposing physicochemical limitations {{to the type of}} permeant that can traverse the barrier. For a drug to be delivered passively via the skin it needs to have a suitable lipophilicity and a molecular weight 500 Da. In contrast active methods, normally involving physical or mechanical methods of enhancing delivery {{have been shown to be}} generally superior. The delivery of drugs of differing lipophilicity and molecular weight including proteins, peptides, and oligonucletides has been shown to be improved by active methods such as iontophoresis, electroporation, mechanical perturbation, and other energy-related techniques such as ultrasound and needless injection. This chapter details one practical example of an active skin abrasion device to demonstrate the success of such active methods. The enhanced in vitro permeation of acyclovir through human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> using a rotating brush abrasion device was compared to acyclovir delivery using iontophoresis. It was found that application of brush treatment for 10 seconds at a pressure of 300 Nm- 2 was comparable to 10 minutes of iontophoresis. The observed enhancement of permeability observed using the rotating brush was as a result of disruption of the cells of the stratum corneum causing a reduction of the barrier function of the skin. However, for these novel delivery methods to succeed and compete with those already on the market, the prime issues that require consideration include device design and safety, efficacy, ease of handling, and cost-effectiveness. This chapter provides a detailed review of the next generation of active delivery technologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to further investigate the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) in mouse skin tumor promotion by evaluating the status of the EGFr in tumor promoter-treated mouse epidermis and in mouse skin tumors. Female SENCAR mice received three topical treatments of either the phorbol ester 1 2 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 1 3 -acetate (TPA) or the nonphorbol esters okadaic acid and chrysarobin. Membrane proteins from SENCAR mouse epidermis were isolated 6 h after the last treatment, and the phosphotyrosine content of the EGFr and several potential substrates were examined by Western blot analysis. The results indicated that multiple applications of all three tumor promoters led to an increase in the phosphotyrosine content of the EGFr and also of several lower molecular weight proteins (Mr 8 O,OOO 85,OO 0). Phosphorylation of PLCyl on tyrosine residues could not be detected in tumor promoter-treated mouse epidermis when the phosphotyrosine content of the EGFr was elevated or in cultured keratinocytes exposed to exogenous [CF. When two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrphostins RC 50864 and RG 1 3022) were incorporated into the treatment regimens, the TPA-induced epidermal hyperplasia and cell proliferation were effectively blocked, and the TPA-stimulated EGFr tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly reduced. Examination of the phosphotyrosine content of <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> proteins isolated from skin papillomas revealed that the EGFr also had elevated phosphotyrosine levels. These results demonstrate that multiple topical treatments with both phorbol ester and nonphorbol ester tumor promoters lead to activation of the EGFr tyrosine kinase in mouse epidermis. In addition, these data suggest that signaling through the EGFr pathway {{plays an important role in}} the tumor promotion stage of multistage carcinogenesis in mouse skin...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{delivery}} of macromolecules is significantly impeded by the inherent barrier {{properties of the}} stratum corneum (SC). Within the last decade sophisticated engineering techniques have enabled the manufacture of microneedle arrays. These are innovative devices consisting of micron-sized needles which when inserted into the skin create physical conduits across the SC but do not impinge upon underlying nerve fibres or blood vessels. This study assessed the ability of microfabricated silicon microneedle arrays to penetrate the SC of ex vivo human skin for the localised delivery and subsequent expression of non-viral gene therapy formulations. Cutaneous gene therapy may represent a new method for the treatment of, or vaccination against, a range of candidate diseases. Microneedle arrays of variant geometries and morphologies, created using dry- and wet-etch microfabrication methods, were characterised by scanning electron microscopy. The potential of these devices for the cutaneous {{delivery of}} gene therapy formulations was initially demonstrated by permeation of a size and surface representative fluorescent nanoparticle across microneedle treated human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membrane</b> and observation of these nanoparticles in micron-sized conduits created in excised human skin. The ability to express exogenous genes within ex vivo human skin was subsequently proven by intradermal injection of the pCMVp reporter plasmid. However, a non-viral gene therapy vector failed to enhance cutaneous transfection. Cutaneous plasmid DNA delivery using the microneedle device facilitated effective, if somewhat limited and irreproducible, transfection of epidermal cells proximal to microchannels created in the skin. These investigations confirmed {{the ability of a}} silicon microneedle device to deliver macromolecular formulations, including plasmid DNA, to the viable epidermis and have demonstrated exogenous gene expression within human skin. However, limited and unpredictable gene expression following microneedle mediated delivery indicate that further studies to optimise the microneedle array morphology, its method of application and the plasmid DNA formulation are warranted...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{cellulose}} (BC) membranes {{were explored}} as novel nanostructured transdermal delivery systems for diclofenac sodium salt (a typical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Diclofenac sodium salt loaded BC membranes were prepared through a simple methodology, using glycerol as plasticizer, and characterized {{in terms of}} structure, morphology and swelling behavior. The membranes were very homogeneous, quite flexible and presented a considerably higher swelling behavior when compared with pure BC. In vitro diffusion studies with Franz cells, were conducted using human <b>epidermal</b> <b>membranes,</b> and showed that the incorporation of diclofenac in BC membranes provided similar permeation rates to those obtained with commercial patches and substantially lower than those observed with a commercial gel. This release profile together with the ease of application and the simple preparation and assembly of the drug-loaded membranes clearly indicates the enormous potentialities of using BC membranes for transdermal administration of diclofenac.

40|$|Green {{plant tissue}} {{should not be}} {{considered}} as having a uniguely high near-infrared reflectance but rather a low visual reflectance. Leaf tissue without chloroplasts appears to reflect well both visual and near infrared wavelengths. The sensitometry of color infrared film is such that a spectral imbalance strongly favoring infrared reflection is necessary to yield a red record. It is the absorption of visual light by chlorophyll that creates the imbalance that makes the typical red record for plants possible. Reflectance measurements of leaves that have been chemically blanched or which have gone into natural chloride decline strongly suggests that it is the rise in the visual reflectance that is most important in removing the imbalance and degrading the red CIR record. The role of water in leaves appears to be that of rendering <b>epidermal</b> <b>membranes</b> translucent so that the underlying chlorophyll controls the reflection rather than the leaf surface...|$|R
