500|$|Vulović {{told reporters}} {{that she did not}} think of her fall every day, but {{admitted}} to struggling with survivor's guilt. [...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should not have survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the writing}} process for her lyrics, Holter noted, [...] "I {{basically}} just write stream of consciousness to a certain extent, I let the song kind of go where it wants to go. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> that's a new idea, at all, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> do it to an extreme." [...] Both [...] "Sea Calls Me Home" [...] and [...] "Betsy on the Roof" [...] were written years prior to recording and often performed during Holter's live performances. [...] "Lucette Stranded on the Island" [...] was influenced by Colette's novella, Chance Acquaintances, while novelist Christopher Isherwood's recurring fictional character, Sally Bowles, was an influence in writing [...] "How Long?".|$|R
5000|$|In fall 2008, Starr {{appeared}} in Fox Reality's Gimme My Reality Show, {{in which she}} competed with such D-listers as Kato Kaelin and A.J. Benza {{for the chance to}} star in her own reality show. Shocked at being cut after the second round, a tearful Starr told the camera, [...] "I sometimes regret doing American Idol because sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> that's why <b>I</b> don't have a record deal... But I promised myself I'd never do anything else I regretted that much. I regret doing this show, and it's going to stay with me for a long time. I regret doing this show." ...|$|R

"Yeah, I {{was able}} to manage them quite well but {{something}} I {{want to say is}} that yesterday was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> can speak for all of us drivers, quite a sad day to see Felipe not with us here today. Hopefully I speak on behalf of all of us when I say we miss him and wish him well and wish him a speedy recovery. But back to the car, it was just fantastic. The team asked me to look after the tyres in which through all the great experiences I have had - good or bad - I {{was able to}} apply that today, so really a big thank you to all the guys and all the fans that have always given me support and never gave me up and to all my family."

But, to speak the plain truth, that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a man is liable to interruption. You see that yourself. Vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the public, no doubt, but then I do not like to attract so much attention as it calls forth. I can't write with comfort when I am interrupted so much as I have been to-day. I like this berth well enough, but I don't like to be left here to wait on the customers. The experiences are novel, I grant you, and entertaining, too, after a fashion, but they are not judiciously distributed. A gentleman shoots at you through the window and cripples me; a bomb-shell comes down the stove-pipe for your gratification and sends the stove-door down my throat; a friend drops in to swap compliments with you, and freckles me with bullet-holes till my skin won't hold my principles; you go to dinner, and Jones comes with his cowhide, Gillespie throws me out of the window, Thompson tears all my clothes off, and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom of an old acquaintance; and in less than five minutes all the blackguards in the country arrive in their war-paint, and proceed to scare the rest of me to death with their tomahawks. Take it altogether, I never had such a spirited time in all my life as I have had to-day. No; I like you, and I like your calm, unruffled way of explaining things to the customers, but you see I am not used to it. The Southern heart is too impulsive; Southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger. The paragraphs which I have written to-day, and into whose cold sentences your masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of Tennessean journalism, will wake up another nest of hornets. All that mob of editors will come--and they will come hungry, too, and want somebody for breakfast. I shall have to bid you adieu. I decline to be present at these festivities. I came South for my health; I will go back on the same errand, and suddenly. Tennessean journalism is too stirring for me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Andy {{said in an}} {{interview}} at the Download Festival that [...] "We've got three songs tracked. We've set ourselves a deadline of the end of August to finish it. We've got 20 to 25 songs written and we're narrowing it down now. John Feldmann is producing it. It's going {{to be more of a}} punk rock record than anything we've done before. It's Social Distortion meets Metallica." [...] Based on this statement, many people were led to believe that the record would literally be a punk rock album, but Biersack clarified his statement in {{an interview}} with Artisan News, stating [...] "The intention was never to make a punk rock record. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that... <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should have chosen my words better when I said that. The intention was to play on our influences a lot more and really go back to basics with how we wrote songs and focusing sic on the more punk rock ethic and the things that we felt early on when we were making our own merchandise; touring in a car with, you know, all of us sitting on top of each other in a U-haul trailer; and, you know, playing in clubs on soap, like, sic little soapboxes and stuff... I didn't wanna make a Stiff Little Fingers record." ...|$|R

I couldn't get over it; seemed like I {{could have killed}} myself when I thought of any mean thing I might have said to her--not meaning anything, but hasty-like, as a man will. Couldn't seem to get over it. Evenings were just hell; they were so--empty. Even when I {{was out on the}} road, there wasn't anybody to write to, anybody that cared. Just sit in a hotel room and think about her. And I just couldn't realize that she was gone. Do you know, Miss Golden, for months, {{whenever}} I was coming back to Boston from a trip, it was her I was coming back to, seemed like, even though I knew she wasn't there--yes, and evenings at home when I'd be sitting there reading, I'd <b>think</b> <b>I</b> heard her step, and I'd look up and smile--and she wouldn't be there; she wouldn't ever be there again....

Though you're really a lot brighter and better educated than what she was--I can see it now. I don't mean no disrespect to her; she was a good sport; they don't make 'em any better or finer or truer; but she hadn't never had much chance; she wasn't educated or a live wire, like you are....

40|$|Let’s {{start with}} the obvious: Language is a shared resource. I wrote that five-word phrase—“language is a shared resource”—all by my-self. I swear I did, or I thought I did. But then I did a phrase search in Google and {{discovered}} that the phrase is not original! It was said before, in a 2002 book by Tor Nørretranders called The Generous Man. Well, that’s not quite true—actually, the phrase is the English translation by Jonathan Sydenham of a phrase Nørretranders expressed in Danish. The English phrase also appeared in a 2006 article by J. C. Spender in a business journal, so he must have plagia-rized it from Nørretranders—or, rather, Sydenham. What a trail of deceit; it’s all very dense and confusing. Things get even worse. The more egregious act of plagiarism in paragraph one is actually the phrase “let’s {{start with the}} obvious, ” a journalistic cliché of the first rank. Don’t even bother to Google search that one—it’s ubiquitous in sports and entertainment features, in editorials, in advertising. I thought what I wrote as paragraph one was my own, but clearly it is not. I must have plagiarized it, the entire first two sentences of my paper. The textual evidence is conclusive, incontrovertible, damning. Am I {{to be charged with}} academic dishonesty, along with Steve Westbrook, who admits to stealing a phrase from Raymond Carver for the title of his chapter? Or else [...] .

It was a nice idea seven years ago. … After a while it became like an obligation hanging over my head, like a homework assignment.” He said that he “didn’t know if he would have done it” had he known how large the Suite would grow: “If I had realized what I was getting myself into five albums ago … <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> would have written one song that encompassed all twelve steps.” ...|$|E
5000|$|It took Koenig {{a decade}} to bring the film to fruition. He {{initially}} wrote the lead role for himself, but reevaluated his view [...] "that the audience would buy me as a romantic interest", and offered it to Battlestar Galactica's Richard Hatch. He also considered playing attorney Ellis: [...] "In retrospect, I {{might have had a}} great deal of fun playing the lawyer — which, I have to admit, Erick Avari so brilliantly played — but I love comedy and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could've brought something to it." [...] He chose the role of antagonist Dr. Schilling instead: [...] "I've played heavies before — I had a recurring role on Babylon Five as one — so I'm not unfamiliar with emotional mechanisms and mechanics that go along with it." ...|$|E

After Welch said that Davis and the rest of Korn cared only about money, Davis responded in kind, opening a rift between them that has since been resolved. In an interview in which Welch was asked about his book and Korn's reaction to the book and the attacks in the media he made earlier at the band:They heard that I'd written it, and there was rumors going around in Hollywood that I was totally trashing them and that it was a 'tell all' book about everything they did and I did. And so they actually wrote two songs on their new album bashing me about the book. But once I heard that they were concerned about the book, I sent them a copy and put a note in there and said, 'I love you guys. I didn't trash you like people say. Read it yourselves. It is what it is.' And now they're doing interviews, and I've read that they're totally cool with the book, and it's not what they {{thought it was going to}} be. So everyone's happy. But, now they've got two songs hating on me on their record. But it's cool. It's all good. I love them, they love me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> deserved those songs because of some of the stuff that I said after I quit the band. So it's all good.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am more attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield.

[...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|R
