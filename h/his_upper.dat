5|$|Fast {{was called}} up to the Rangers in April 2014 to replace Chris Kreider, who {{suffered}} a left hand injury. Playing on a line with Hagelin and Brad Richards, Fast played in New York's last three regular season games, as well as three post-season matches. He recorded his first career NHL playoff point with an assist in Game 1 of the Metropolitan Division Semifinal against the Philadelphia Flyers on April 17. At {{the conclusion of the}} season, the Rangers coaching staff told Fast to add strength, so he worked on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> body and leg strength during the off-season, adding 10 to 15pounds of muscle, bringing him to 20pounds heavier than when he was drafted in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on July 31, 1912. His parents, Sára Ethel (née Landau) and Jenő Saul Friedman, were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Beregszász in Carpathian Ruthenia, Kingdom of Hungary (now Berehove in Ukraine). They both worked as dry goods merchants. Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to Rahway, New Jersey. In his early teens, Friedman was injured in a car accident, which scarred <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> lip. A talented student, Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928, just before his 16th birthday.|$|E
5|$|High relates {{that the}} great serpent Jörmungandr, also {{described}} as a child of Loki in the same source, will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it. The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring, and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his mouth wide open, <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> jaw reaching to the heavens, his lower jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir's side, Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout {{the air and the}} sea.|$|E

Bullets from a strafing German fighter struck <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> chest and carried on through his body, piercing his lungs, stomach, and intestines. He underwent five operations and spent fourteenmonths recovering. He was replaced as commander of X Corps by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard McCreery.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009–10 season, Yi {{returned}} to the starting lineup for New Jersey. Starting in every game he played but one, Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games. He sprained his medial collateral ligament on 4 November 2009, had a laceration on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> lip on 8 December 2009, and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2009.

5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus's {{success in}} high school led to a {{scholarship}} to the University of Notre Dame, where he played from 1940 to 1942. He was known in college as a tough and durable tackle. In a 1941 game against Georgia Tech, Rymkus was elbowed in <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> lip. He left the game to get 14 stitches and returned {{to play in the}} 20–0 Notre Dame victory. Notre Dame went undefeated that season, coach Frank Leahy's first year at the school. During his junior year in 1942, Rymkus earned All-America honors, and in his final season at Notre Dame he was named the team's Most Valuable Player.|$|E

5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E

5|$|To secure {{his hold}} over Aleppo, Fath invited Fatimid troops from Afamiyah led by Ali al-Dayf. Al-Hakim {{requested}} Salih {{to cooperate with}} al-Dayf and bestowed on him the title of asad al-dawla (lion of the state). However, Salih opposed the Fatimid presence in Aleppo and proposed an arrangement to Fath giving the latter control of the citadel and the Kilab control of the city. Fath responded favorably, but Aleppo's inhabitants protested the rumored deal, demanding the establishment of Fatimid rule; they enjoyed al-Hakim's tax exemptions and opposed Bedouin governance. Fath was compelled to relocate to Tyre by al-Hakim, who also sent more troops to Aleppo. Salih was thus prevented from seizing the city. Nonetheless, Mansur's flight and the instability of Fatimid rule enabled Salih to strengthen <b>his</b> <b>Upper</b> Mesopotamian emirate. He established his own administration and tribal court. As early as 1019, the court was visited by the Arab poet Ibn Abi Hasina, who would become a prominent eulogist of the Mirdasid dynasty.|$|E
5|$|A {{recently}} built sabha-mandapa (assembly-hall) has idols of god Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi. It {{leads to}} central hall {{built by the}} Patwardhan Rulers of Kurundwad. The ceiling of this hall is formed from a single stone. The garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) has a central image of Ganesha as Mayureshwar or Moreshwar, facing the North. The Ganesha image is depicted in a seated posture with its trunk turning to the left, four arms and three eyes. He holds a noose (pasha) and elephant goad (ankusha) in <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> hands, while his lower right rests on his knee {{and the other one}} holds a modaka (a sweet). The navel and the eyes are embedded with diamonds. A cobra hood raised over Ganesha's head, shelters the Lord. The image is actually smaller than it looks as it is smeared with a thick level of saffron-coloured Sindoor (vermillion), which peels off once every century. It last fell off in 1882, and prior to that in 1788. Ganesha is flanked by idols of his consorts Riddhi and Siddhi sometimes called Siddhi and Buddhi. These idols are made of an alloy of five metals or of brass. The deities are covered with crafted silver and gold. Like all Ashtavinayaka shrines, the central Ganesha image is believed to be svayambhu (self-existent), naturally occurring {{in the form of an}} elephant-faced stone. In front of the central image, the vahanas of Ganesha – the mouse and the peacock are placed. To the left outside the garbhagriha is an image of Nagna-Bhairava.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and {{brought up in the}} working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|His {{military}} training began on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School (Luftkriegsschule 2) at Gatow, on the south-western outskirts of Berlin. He swore the National Socialist {{oath of allegiance}} on 21 April 1936. Flight training began on Monday, 7 August 1936 at Gatow. His first flight was in a Heinkel He 72 Kadet D-EYZA single engine biplane. Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz. By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook. In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises, Lent {{was involved in a}} road accident, breaking <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months. This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to Fähnrich. On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to Oberfähnrich (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to Leutnant. By this time, he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time, mostly in daylight flights, in single engine training aircraft.|$|E
