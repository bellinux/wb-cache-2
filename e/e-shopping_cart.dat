40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} online shopping carts abandonment {{from the point of}} view of the consumer behaviour: what drives consumers into completing versus abandoning the online purchase? This is analyzed by the means of a questionnaire, distributed online to a heterogeneous sample, which aims to reduce the sampling bias and ensure a better representation of the online shoppers’ community. It is hypothesized that internet experience, attitudes and subjective norms have a predictive power in explaining consumers’ intentions to abandon versus to finalize the online purchase. Additionally, it is hypothesized the existence of a behaviour-action gap, leading consumers who originally intended to purchase, to abandon the <b>e-shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> This gap is suggested to be triggered by the intention to procrastinate the purchase. The results show the existence of a positive relationship between internet experience and attitudes towards online shopping. In the same line, consumers with higher attitudes towards e-shopping and higher levels of social influence showed higher intentions to finalize the purchase. Consumers with lower levels of attitudes and social influence showed higher intentions to abandon the purchase. Consumers with higher intentions to abandon the purchase have also admitted to abandon a higher percentage of e-carts. Finally, the intention-action gap is stimulated by the intention to postpone the purchase only when intentions to purchase are negative. However, when the intentions to purchase are positive, online procrastination does not influence abandonment. These results provide insight into the problem of online shopping cart abandonment, and can be applied to the field of online buying behaviour. The results suggest that marketing campaigns targeted at increasing internet experience as well as the attitudes and social influence will decrease <b>e-shopping</b> <b>cart</b> abandonment. However, postponement is not a good predictive of <b>e-shopping</b> <b>cart</b> abandonment for consumers who originally intended to finalize the purchase...|$|E
50|$|Some setup {{must be done}} in the HTML code of the website, and the {{shopping}} cart software must be installed on the server which hosts the site, or on the secure server which accepts sensitive ordering information. <b>E-shopping</b> <b>carts</b> are usually implemented using HTTP cookies or query strings. In most server based implementations however, data related to {{the shopping}} cart is kept in the session object and is accessed and manipulated on the fly, as the user selects different items from the cart. Later at the process of finalizing the transaction, the information is accessed and an order is generated against the selected item thus clearing the shopping cart.|$|R

Analysis of big data is currently considered {{as an integral part of}} many computational and statistical departments. As a result, novel approaches in {{data analysis}} are evolving on a daily basis. Thousands of transaction requests are handled and processed everyday by different websites associated with e-commerce, e-banking, <b>e-shopping</b> <b>carts</b> etc. The network traffic and weblog analysis comes to play a crucial role in such situations where Hadoop can be suggested as an efficient solution for processing the Netflow data collected from switches as well as website access-logs during fixed intervals.
