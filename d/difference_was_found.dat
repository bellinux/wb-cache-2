5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E

40|$|Leading human-computer {{interaction}} (HCI) researchers recognize {{a fundamental difference}} exists between men and women. Some HCI {{research has been done}} regarding gender differences in hand-eye coordination for interactions with computer touch display interfaces, navigation through virtual environments (VE) and language in computer-mediated communication.

25|$|There {{were also}} further {{follow-up}} studies conducted {{using a different}} approach. In these follow-up studies the experimenters contacted certain individuals after foreseeable emotional experiences, such as {{the birth of a}} child, giving blood, or taking an exam. This way, the experimenters chose not only the emotional event to be recalled, but furthermore the types of emotional events they would be studying so that they could examine possible differences between types of emotional events. The findings of these studies supported those of the retrospective studies: 96–100% of emotional events were socially shared. Furthermore, no significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the frequency of social sharing between different types of emotional events.|$|E
25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} their emotions with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are no sex differences concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative sex differences were found, one qualitative <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> between the social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share their emotions equally between family members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, men tend to share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E

2500|$|Theoretical {{reasons are}} given for believing {{mortality}} might be lower in patients treated with imipenem: first, less endotoxin is released by dying bacteria during imipenem treatment, and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) for imipenem is lower than for ceftazidime. However, no clinically relevant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in mortality between imipenem and ceftazidime treatments. [...] The MIC of meropenem is higher for B.pseudomallei than for many other organisms, and patients being haemofiltered will need more frequent or higher doses.|$|E

2500|$|Many genetic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions and Druze, Palestinians, Bedouin, Lebanese and other Levantines cluster near one another genetically. Many studies have found that Jews and Palestinians are closer to each other than the Palestinians or European Jews are to non-Jewish Europeans or Africans. They also found substantial genetic overlap between Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. A small but statistically significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions of Sephardic Jews and Palestinians, but {{no significant differences were found}} between Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians nor between the two Jewish communities, However, a highly distinct cluster was found in Palestinian haplotypes. 32% of the 143 Arab Y-chromosomes studied belonged to this [...] "I Arab clade", which contained only one non-Arab chromosome, that of a Sephardic Jew. This could possibly be attributed to the geographical isolation of the Jews or to the immigration of Arab tribes in the first millennium. The Druze people, a [...] "genetic sanctuary" [...] for the diversity of the Near East in antiquity, have been found in genetic studies to be the closest to Jews of the populations in the Levant. Lebanese also cluster closely with Jewish ethnic groups, closer than Syrians and Palestinians, according to a 2010 study by Behar et al.

60|$|Nearly a year later, in June 1609, the exhumed {{remains of}} Logan were brought into court (a regular {{practice}} {{in the case of}} dead traitors), and were tried for treason. Five letters by Logan, of July 1600, were now produced. Three were from Logan to conspirators unnamed and unknown. One was to a retainer and messenger of his, Laird Bower, who had died in January 1606. These letters were declared, by several honourable witnesses, to be in Logan’s very unusual handwriting and orthography: they were compared with many genuine letters of his, and no <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found.</b> The Parliamentary Committee, ‘The Lords of the Articles,’ previously sceptical, were convinced by the five letters, the evidence to handwriting, the energy of the Earl of Dunbar, and the eloquence of the King’s Advocate. Logan’s children were all forfeited, and Dunbar saved the money which he owed to Logan’s estate. This trial is not alluded to, either by Calderwood or Archbishop Spottiswoode, in their histories.
