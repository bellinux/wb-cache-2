5|$|Investigating {{appropriations}} led Randall {{to focus}} on financial impropriety <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares {{that they had been}} allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E
5|$|When the South {{returned}} to firm Democratic {{control at the}} end of the 1870s, Indiana, which was closely split between the two parties, was one of a few key swing state that often decided the balance of power <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presidency. Five Hoosier politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets held between 1868 and 1916, as the nation's political parties vied for the support of the state's electorate. In 1888, at the height of the state's post-war political influence, former Civil War general Benjamin Harrison was elected president, and served in that capacity from 1889 to 1893.|$|E

25|$|The {{thalidomide}} tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill {{to enhance}} drug regulation that had stalled <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth {{had to prove}} to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.|$|E
25|$|Gunsmoke was TV's number one-ranked {{show from}} 1957 to 1961 before {{slipping}} into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned {{to cancel the}} series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> behind-the-scenes pressure from the wife of CBS's president) prevented its demise. On the Biography Channel's Behind The Scenes: Gilligan's Island (2002); Gilligan's Island producer Sherwood Schwartz states that the wife of CBS's president pressured her husband not to cancel Gunsmoke in 1967, so the network cut Gilligan's Island instead. The show continued in its new time slot at 8pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that had it once again rally to the top 10 in the Nielsen ratings until the 1973–74 television season. In September 1975, despite still ranking among the top 30 programs in the ratings, Gunsmoke was canceled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by Mary Tyler Moore spin-offs Rhoda and Phyllis (though Rhoda actually debuted while Gunsmoke was still airing first-run). Thirty TV Westerns came and went during its 20-year tenure, and Gunsmoke was the sole survivor, with Alias Smith and Jones and Bonanza both leaving the airwaves in January 1973.|$|E
25|$|During {{the several}} decades {{that led up}} to the {{production}} of the Washington-Franklin issues the printing technology of U.S. Postage stamps was in many respects still in its development stages. As a consequence the U.S. Post Office would often receive complaints from the general public about its postage stamps. In 1869 the Post Office faced its first nationwide complaints when it issued a set of ten stamps that broke from the tradition of honoring and depicting statesmen (selected Presidents and Franklin) on the faces of all U.S. Postage stamps. Withering criticism also cited the small size and inconvenient shapes of the 1869 stamps and faulted their adhesive gum as inadequate. Consequently, this issue was short lived and pulled from post offices across the nation. As the years passed other complaints ranged from criticism about stamp subject and design, difficulty with perforations and even objections to the often unpleasant taste of the gum on the backs of stamps. Many of the criticisms also came from postal clerks who complained about the insufficiently varied choice of colors used on the issues, which sometimes resulted in the same or similar color appearing on several different denominations, making it visually difficult to sort mail quickly. Shortly {{after the turn of the}} 19th–20th century the problem of improving stamps and production prompted debates <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate, debates into which President Theodore Roosevelt sometimes injected himself. For example, Roosevelt argued that in observance of the upcoming 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, Lincoln should be included in the new definitive 1908 issue then being planned. Lincoln, however, was omitted: instead he would be honored with his own anniversary commemorative stamp in 1909. Many of the innovations employed in the production of the Washington-Franklin Issues were the result of this ongoing effort to improve on the production of U.S. Postage.|$|E

500|$|In 1954 Furcolo {{ran for the}} U.S. Senate, but was {{narrowly}} {{defeated by}} incumbent Republican Leverett A. Saltonstall. [...] The election exposed a personal dispute between Furcolo and fellow Democrat John Fitzgerald Kennedy. [...] Furcolo and Kennedy had served together <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two reportedly had not gotten along. [...] In the 1954 campaign Kennedy refused to make a public endorsement of Furcolo, and Saltonstall recounted in his memoir that Kennedy's campaign staff worked with his in opposition to Furcolo, and that Saltonstall regularly announced legislation he and Kennedy had cosponsored.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Senator Jesse Helms {{attempted}} {{to cut off}} financial aid to Nicaragua. [...] In his report to the Senate, he stated that the Sandinistas were still controlling much of the Nicaraguan administration and suggested that the Nicaraguan government replace all former Sandinista officers with ex-Contras, replace all judges, and return all property that was taken from US citizens during the revolution. [...] Chamorro's administration denied Helm's allegations while still trying to comply with his demands. [...] Helms managed to sway opinion <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> US government denied Nicaragua the $104 million that had been promised for that year. The aid was cut-off and Helms' demands were put forward the month after Chamorro withdrew the compensation claims associated with the Nicaragua vs. United States verdict.|$|E
500|$|The South as a whole, however, {{remained}} divided. In January 1853 Senator Thomas Jefferson Rusk of Texas {{introduced a}} bill to create two railroads, one with a northern route and one with a southern route starting below Memphis on the Mississippi River. Under the Rusk legislation, the President would be authorized to select the specific termini and routes {{as well as the}} contractors who would build the railroads. [...] Some southerners, however, worried that northern and central interests would leap ahead in construction and opposed any direct aid to private developers on constitutional grounds. [...] Other southerners preferred the isthmian proposals. An amendment was added to the Rusk bill to prohibit direct aid, but southerners still split their vote <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> amendment failed.|$|E

50|$|As {{political}} scientists have shown, political polarization has several {{important implications for}} the United States Congress.

500|$|The Supreme Court's docket was congested, swelled by war {{litigation}} and laws that allowed a party {{defeated in the}} {{circuit court of appeals}} to have the case decided by the Supreme Court if a constitutional question was involved. Taft believed an appeal should usually be settled by the circuit court, with only cases of major import decided by the justices. He and other Supreme Court members proposed legislation to make most of the court's docket discretionary, with a case getting full consideration by the justices only if they granted a writ of certiorari. To Taft's frustration, Congress took three years to consider the matter. [...] Taft {{and other members of the}} court lobbied for the bill <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Judges' Bill became law in February 1925. [...] By late the following year, Taft was able to show that the backlog was shrinking.|$|E
500|$|In May 1979, Kennedy {{proposed}} a new bipartisan universal {{national health insurance}} bill—choice of competing federally regulated private health insurance plans with no cost sharing financed by income-based premiums via an employer mandate and individual mandate, replacement of Medicaid by government payment of premiums to private insurers, and enhancement of Medicare by adding prescription drug coverage and eliminating premiums and cost sharing. In June 1979, Carter proposed more limited health insurance reform—an employer mandate to provide catastrophic private health insurance plus coverage without cost sharing for pregnant women and infants, federalization of Medicaid with extension {{to all of the}} very poor, and enhancement of Medicare by adding catastrophic coverage. Neither plan gained any traction <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure to come to agreement represented the final political breach between the two. (Carter wrote in 1982 that Kennedy's disagreements with Carter's {{proposed a}}pproach [...] "ironically" [...] thwarted Carter's efforts to provide a comprehensive health-care system for the country. In turn, Kennedy wrote in 2009 that his relationship with Carter was [...] "unhealthy" [...] and that [...] "Clearly President Carter was a difficult man to convince– of anything.") ...|$|E
500|$|When Andrew Johnson {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} after President Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, Senators Sumner and Wilson both hoped Johnson {{would support the}} policies of the Republican Party, since Johnson, a Democrat, had been elected with Lincoln on a pro-Union ticket. After the Civil War ended with a Union Victory in May 1865, the defeated former Confederacy was ruined. [...] It had been devastated economically, politically, and much of its infrastructure had been destroyed during the war. The opportunity was ripe for Congress and Johnson to work together on terms for Southern restoration and reconstruction. Instead, Johnson launched his own reconstruction policy, which was seen as more lenient to former Confederates, and excluded African American citizenship. [...] When Congress opened the session which began in December 1865, Johnson's policy included a demand for admission of Southern Senators and Representatives, nearly all Democrats, including many former Confederates. [...] Congress, still in Republican hands, responded by refusing to allow the Southern Senators and Representatives to take their seats, beginning a rift between Republicans <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> President. Wilson favored allowing only persons who had been loyal to the United States to serve in positions of political power in the former Confederacy, and believed that Congress, not the President, had the power to reconstruct the southern states. As a result, Wilson joined forces with the Congressmen and Senators known as Radical Republicans, those most strongly opposed to Johnson.|$|E
