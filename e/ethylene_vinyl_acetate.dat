25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity <b>ethylene</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E

Refractive index of prepared polymer nanocomposites were calculated from dielectric study using Hioki 3532 - 50 LCR HITESTER at various frequencies and temperatures.

30|$|EVA is {{a random}} {{copolymer}} consisting of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> as repeating units. VA content has two fundamental effects that influence the properties of EVA copolymers. The first effect is to disrupt the crystalline regions formed by the polyethylene segments of the copolymer. The second overriding effect of VA content results from the polar nature of the acetoxy side chain. The EVA shows various properties by varying the VA content. The properties of EVA depend on the crystallinity of the EVA [15 – 18], which can be controlled by the VA content.|$|R

50|$|The {{athletic}} shoe midsole {{is one of}} {{the main}} contributors that lead to a generation of end-of-life waste because it is composed of polymeric foams based on <b>ethylene</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (EVA). <b>Ethylene</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (EVA) is a polyolefin copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate that provides durability and flexibility, making it the most commonly used material found in athletic shoe midsoles. Although the synthetic polymer is a useful material for the athletic shoe industry, it has become an environmental concern because of its poor biodegradability. EVA goes through an anaerobic decomposition process called thermal degradation that often occurs in landfills resulting in releases of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) into the air. VOC’s “contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone, which is harmful to humans and plant life.” Thermal degradation of EVA is temperature dependent and occurs in two stages; in the first stage acetic acid is lost, followed by the degradation of the unsaturated polyethylene polymer.|$|E

30|$|Ethylene–vinyl acetate {{copolymers}} (EVA) are widespread materials, with hot-melt adhesives {{and plastic}} wraps being common applications [54]. Although free-radical copolymerizations usually produce gradient or block polymers, perfectly random copolymers are {{obtained from the}} polymerization of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> due to similar reactivities [55]. However, undesired and random branching is inherently promoted via a back-biting process, significantly altering the characteristics and performance of the copolymers. However, perfectly linear ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers can be prepared by means of ADMET polymerization [56]. A number of monomers with various methylene run lengths ranging from 8 to 12 were subjected to polymerization and subsequent hydrogenation, furnishing copolymers with different <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> contents (acetate branches separated by 18 – 26 carbons). Commercial samples with similar <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> ratios were compared with the ADMET copolymers. Similar to the commercial copolymers, the precision polymers displayed a linear relationship between the melting temperature and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> content, but with dissimilar slopes.

50|$|Ethylene {{vinyl alcohol}} (EVOH) is a formal {{copolymer}} of ethylene and vinyl alcohol.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{various aspects of the}} {{homogeneous}} acetoxylation of <b>ethylene</b> to <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> by palladium acetate using ultraviolet-visible (UV/vis), Raman, and infrared spectroscopic methods. Vibrational assignments for the Raman and the infrared spectra of crystalline palladium acetate have been made. Density functional theoretical calculations were used to help with our assignments. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that Pd acetate solvated in glacial acetic acid maintains a trimeric structure, {{similar to that of the}} crystal. Upon addition of potassium acetate in concentrations between 0. 10 and 0. 20 M, the palladium acetate trimers decompose to dimers. It remains, however, an open question whether monomers, or perhaps dimers that are fully coordinated by acetate ligands, form with increasing potassium acetate concentration. In the presence of ethylene, dimeric species appear to form by decomposition of the trimers, and it is the dimers which are the catalytically active and selective species in the formation of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> During reaction with ethylene, palladium(II) in palladium acetate is reduced to palladium black, and the hydrocarbon products <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and acetaldehyde are formed.

General evidence suggests that these materials offer considerable improvements compared to traditional mortars although the mechanisms for this are not fully understood.

In view of {{the wide range of}} commercial systems available, investigations concentrated on the use of three of the most commonly available groups of polymers. These were: (1) Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR), (2) Acrylics and, (3) <b>Ethylene</b> <b>Vinyl</b> <b>Acetates</b> (EVA). The later two were in the form of both emulsions and redispersible powders. Experiments concentrated on: (1) Rheological behaviour of polymer modified cement pastes; (2) Workability of polymer modified mortars; (3) Influence of curing conditions on the pore size distribution and diffusion of chloride ions; (4) Bond strength of polymer modified cement and mortar patches; and (5) Microscopic examination and semi-quantitative analyses of the bulk and interfacial microstructures. The following main conclusions were reached: (1) The addition of polymer emulsions have a considerable influence on the workability of fresh cement pastes, the extent of this {{depending on the type of}} system used. (2) The rheological parameters of fresh polymer modified mortars can be established using a two-point workability test which may be used when comparing the properties of different systems at constant workability. (3) Curing conditions affect the properties of polymer modified systems and a wet/dry curing regime was essential for good adhesion of these materials to mortar substrates. (4) In contrast, the wet/dry curing regime resulted in a curing affected zone at the surface of patch materials. This can result in a much coarser pore structure and enhanced diffusion of e. g. chloride ions.

40|$|Polyolefins are an {{inexpensive}} class of compounds {{that can be}} used to prepare a plethora of different materials. Poly(ethylene) is the worldwide most produced polymer and is mostly synthesised by free radical polymerisation or catalytic coordination insertion using high temperature and pressure. The controlled radical polymerisation of ethylene is very difficult to achieve because of secondary reactions of this unconjugated monomer, e. g. chain transfer and termination reactions. Cobalt-mediated radical polymerisation (CMRP) represents a solution to control its polymerisation in mild conditions: in a reversible deactivation mechanism, a cobalt complex reversibly traps the active growing chains and converts them into dormant species, avoiding side reactions and allowing for a controlled polymerisation. Using CMRP, statistical copolymers of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (VAc) have been synthesised, as well as block-like and block copolymers. Furthermore, functionalisation of the α- and ω-chain ends are now possible.

The current global production of this raw material amounts to 160 million tons per year with an average growth rate of 4  % per year. Ethylene is commercially produced by steam cracking dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon feedstock like natural gas and naphtha [9]. This process has several drawbacks like endothermicity of the reaction, thermodynamic limitation in the paraffin conversion and severe coke formation. Catalytic ODE using molecular oxygen has emerged as a highly attractive alternative in overcoming these difficulties [12]. The reaction becomes exothermic. Elimination of thermodynamic limitation, minimization of coke formation {{because of the presence of}} oxygen and decrease in the frequency of catalyst regeneration [1, 2, 12] are the additional advantages. However, the requirement of an air separation unit to generate pure oxygen, thermal run-away of reaction and the difficulty of controlling ethylene selectivity are the major issues associated with this process [2, 12, 14]. Another alternative is the utilization of N 2 O as the oxidant, wherein high conversions could be realised due to the formation of O− radical species, but the limited availability of the oxidant and low ethylene selectivity [19] at high conversions make this methodology of ethylene generation less attractive.|$|R
