Bundy helped lure the girl into sexual games and posing for sexual photographs. The pedophilia wasn't enough for them, however, and Clark started to talk about how much he would like to kill a girl during sex and persuaded Carol to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> two automatic pistols for him to use. Reportedly, Clark was striving to fulfill his fantasy of killing a woman during sex and feeling her vaginal contractions during the death spasms.|$|E
25|$|While {{recovering}} in {{the hospital}} from gunshot wounds he incurred in late 2001, Game told his brother to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> all of the classic hip-hop albums. Over the course of five months, he studied all of the various influential rap albums and developed a strategy to turn himself into a rapper. With {{the help of his}} older brother Big Fase, they founded the label. It originally featured such artists as Glasses Malone, Vita, and Nu Jerzey Devil, along with Game himself. His stage name was coined by his grandmother, who was a huge fan of the 1997 blockbuster, The Game. Game first gained prominence when he attended a hip-hop summit hosted by Russell Simmons and Louis Farrakhan. After he had fully recovered, Game and Big Fase made a mixtape together. He released his first mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 1 in 2002, and landed a record deal with the independent label Get Low Recordz owned by JT the Bigga Figga.|$|E

By the end of the night, Dwight has put exorbitant amounts on the items and ends up accidentally donating over $34,000. He flees when he discovers his mistake. Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) tries to talk with Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) by complaining about the food.

Lynn Staus, the mayor of East Grand Forks initially complained on the NWS's predictions, [...] "They missed it, and they not only missed it, they blew it big." [...] He later commented again, saying [...] "I am not trying to blame the weather bureau.

British organist James Taylor said the Hammond [...] "became popular [...] when people such as Booker T. & the M.G.'s and artists on the Stax Records label came over to London and played gigs."

Louis Bedigian of GameZone wrote a positive review, saying that [...] "any Crash Bandicoot fan would be a fool not to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> this game.

[...] Official US PlayStation Magazine felt that [...] "when the strongest feeling I get from a game is the desire to play its predecessors, something's not quite right." [...] Game Informer criticized the [...] "outrageously bad load times", saying that they [...] "keep the game from being average."

500|$|Johnson was a devout, {{conservative}} Anglican and {{a compassionate}} man who supported {{a number of}} poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, [...] "no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him". However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as Donald Greene points out, [...] "a predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings. Although Johnson respected John Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the [...] "next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies". Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats, especially his own two cats, Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote, [...] "I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself used to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature." [...] It is a common error to think that these oysters were expensive, since they are so in modern Britain. However, in Johnson's time they were very cheap and eaten by the poor. [...] He thought that his servant, Frank, might resent Hodge {{if he had to}} go buy the oysters for him.|$|E

After dinner with his obese, impolite family, Sherman asks Carla out on a date, which she accepts, much to Sherman's surprise due to his parents' embarrassing behavior. The date begins well with Carla showing admiration for Sherman's work, but the club's obnoxious guest comedian, Reggie Warrington, publicly mocks him about his weight. Sherman becomes depressed and has a nightmare in which he becomes a rampaging giant and wrecks the city with a single fart that is ignited to cause an explosion. He tests his serum on himself and loses 300 pounds within seconds.

Nevertheless, Billy asks the coach at his school for a tryout even though the track season is two months old and only two months remain until the county meet. Billy hardly looks like a track star in his black high top Chucks and greased back long hair, but the coach gives him a tryout due to his brother's {{reputation as one of}} the best runners in the county, during the tryout he demonstrates surprising speed, running an 800m race at 2:04.
