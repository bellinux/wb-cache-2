40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to study the {{etiology}} of mastitis, determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Staphylococcus spp. and to identify the risk factors associated with infection in dairy cows in the states of Bahia and Pernambuco, Brazil. From the 2, 064 milk samples analyzed, 2. 6 % were associated with cases of clinical mastitis and 28. 2 % with subclinical mastitis. In the microbiological culture, Staphylococcus spp. (49. 1 %) and Corynebacterium spp. (35. 3 %) were the main agents found, followed by Prototheca spp. (4. 6 %) and Gram negative bacilli (3. 6 %). In the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, all 218 Staphylococcus spp. were susceptible to rifampicin and the least effective drug was amoxicillin (32. 6 %). Multidrug resistance to three or more drugs was observed in 65. 6 % of Staphylococcus spp. The risk factors identified for mastitis were the extensive production system, not providing feed supplements, teat drying process, not disinfecting the teats before and after milking, and inadequate hygiene habits of the milking workers. The presence of multiresistant isolates in bovine milk demonstrates the importance of the choice and appropriate use of antimicrobial agents.

40|$|Mastitis in ewes is {{responsible}} for massive economic expenses. Other than the loss of ewes due to clinical mastitis, when subclinical mastitis occurs, {{because it is not}} readily detected, the milk with the causative pa- thogens is used to make dairy products. This fact is disadvantageous both for the technological process and for the consumer security. The knowledge of prevalence and aetiological agents of mastitis is of outmost importance to carry out an effective control of mastitis in sheep. The aim of this work is to bring out ovine mastitis in- formation in Portugal. We conducted a study focused on 18 milking producing sheep flocks to determine the prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis and to assess the aetiology of mastitis in sheep. Four hundred and fourteen milk samples randomly collected from sheep with subclinical mastitis and 27 milk samples from animals with clinical mastitis were bacteriological analysed according to an adaptation of the National Mastitis Council methodology. Anaerobic bacteria were also assessed. The identification was processed based on biochemical characterization, using the API system, API Staph, API 20 Strep, API 20 E, API 20 NE and API Coryne (BioMérieux). The results revealed high subclinical mastitis (SCM) prevalence (32. 2 %) and low clinical mastitis (CM) prevalence (1. 7 %). There was a higher prevalence in mechanically milked sheep than in hand milked animals. Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) were in account of 42. 9 % of the CM events. Staphylococcus epidermidis represented 25 % of all CM causative agents. Regarding subclinical mastitis, 70. 1 % of aetiological agents were identified as CNS species. From these, 43. 4 % were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis accounting for 30. 4 % of total aetiological agents of SCM. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 22 specimens (6. 2 %) from SCM cases, which is of outmost importance in terms of public health, and Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated 15 times (4. 2 %) and showed to be in account of subclinical outbreaks with high prevalence rates. The fact that the majority of mastitis events were due to coagulate negative staphylococci out stresses the need for a proper management and rigorous <b>hygienic</b> <b>milking</b> procedure.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of milk products, especially made from raw milk, {{have been reported}} to be associated with food borne diseases. Since most sheep’s milk products are made from raw milk, it is clear how udder health is an important prerequisite to produce <b>hygienic</b> <b>milk.</b> Ewes with mastitis, particularly in their subclinical form, serve as reservoir of pathogens that can be shed into the milk and constitute a potential risk for human health. Milk somatic cell count (SCC) is not a public health concern itself but it is an indicator of the general state of udder health in a dairy sheep flock and can be used as an indication of <b>hygienic</b> <b>milk</b> and to improve safety of dairy products. This thesis presents three different strategies, within a comprehensive SCC control program in dairy ewes. All the studies were carried out at the University of Wisconsin, Madison dairy sheep research facility, which is the only University dairy sheep research station in North America. The study presented in Chapter 2 describes an automated method to assess SCC on farm. In Chapter 3 is presented a study aimed to determine the effect of intramammary antibiotic dry treatment on intramammary infection and somatic cell count in the subsequent lactation.

40|$|The {{concern in}} milk quality, milk production, and in animals’ welfare is in {{constant}} increase. Mastitis {{is recognized as}} the main disease affecting dairy animals because of changing in milk composition and reduction in milk production. In Brazil, the highest incidence of mastitis is related to infectious agents. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of pathogenic microorganisms in milk produced by 60 cows from four dairy farms (15 cows/farm) located at Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Milk samples from each teat were collected fortnight in sterile tubes, previously identified, during two months. In each herd 240 samples were obtained, except on the farm A, where an extra collection was done, in a total amount of 300 samples. On the farm A, the sampling was done {{in a period of}} transition between the dry and rainy season. On the farm B, samples were collected mostly in the season of high temperatures. On the farm C the collections were made over a period of heat and humidity. On the farm D, on a period of warmer temperatures and reduced rainfall. The isolation and identification of microorganisms were conducted at Laboratory of Milk Quality from Instituto de Zootecnia, Nova Odessa, São Paulo, Brazil. Aliquots of 100 mL of milk were grown on plates with 5 % sheep blood agar. After incubation, they were used for the production of catalase and Gram stain. Gram positive and catalase positive samples were classified as Corynebacterium spp. (Coryne.). Gram positive cocci and catalase negative samples were classified as Streptococcus spp. (Strepto.). Milk were then proceeded to coagulase test in rabbit plasma. Gram-positive cocci, catalase positive and coagulase-negative were classified as Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (SCN). Gram positive, catalase positive and coagulase positive samples were subsequently subjected to biochemical tests: mannitol salt agar, maltose, trehalose, and acetoin production. Strains that were positive for these tests were classified as Staphylococcus aureus. Farms B and C had the lowest rates of infection. In contrast, on the farm D the worst results were detected, having high rates of infection, being followed by farm A. The adequacy of practices aiming the <b>hygienic</b> <b>milking</b> is paramount, especially mechanisms to control infectious microorganisms.

We carried out a risk assessment study for E. coli 0157 :H 7 in marketed raw and fermented milk in Kenya, Tanzania and Ghana. Data for the risk models were obtained from our on-going studies and other relevant literature. Scenario pathway models were developed for raw and fermented milk using event and fault trees, respectively. Because of the lack of suitable dose-response models, we used published models in our analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty and variability associated with the model. Our analysis demonstrated that the risk associated with raw milk was relatively minimal since the raw milk is generally boiled before consumption. The risk also varied significantly due to the differences in methods of fermentation including time and duration, and the amounts consumed. Translating our findings in the context of regulations showed that current regulations should be re-assessed and based on an appropriate food safety objective of the particular country and the acceptable level of protection.

The objective {{of this study was}} to identify on-farm factors associated with dairy cattle cleanliness. The study also examined differences in risk factors and preventive factors between contrasting herds regarding cattle cleanliness. In total, 60 dairy herds, selected from a national database, were visited by 2 trained assessors during the indoor feeding period in February and March 2009. In Norwegian abattoirs, cattle are assessed and categorized according to hide cleanliness, based on national guidelines, using a 3 -category scale. Dirty animals result in deductions in payment to farmers. “Dirty” herds (n= 30) were defined as those that had most deductions in payment registered due to dirty animals slaughtered in 2007 and 2008. “Clean” herds (n= 30) were those that had similar farm characteristics, but slaughtered only clean animals during 2007 and 2008, and thus had no deductions in payments registered. The dairy farms were located in 4 different areas of Norway. Relevant information, such as housing, bedding, feeding, and management practices concerning cleaning animals and floors, was collected during farm visits. In addition, the cleanliness of each animal over 1 yr of age (4, 991 animals) was assessed and scored on a 5 -point scale, and later changed to a dichotomous variable during statistical analysis.

40|$|The {{dairy farming}} sector of European Agriculture is {{currently}} under considerable economic pressure so {{the aim of}} each farmer should be to produce saleable milk, at the lowest cost. One important area of concern is the expenditure on hot water for hygiene, as to be acceptable to the buyer the milk must have {{a low level of}} contaminants. Clean milk is produced from clean, healthy udders by means of equipment which is adequately and appropriately cleaned. To facilitate this <b>hygienic</b> <b>milk</b> production most dairies are eguipped with heaters to provide water at 40 °C (for cleaning udders) and 80 - 100 °C (for plant cleaning). The practice of udder washing is a subjective process as it depends on the operator's judgement of a 'clean' udder and his view of necessity. In England and Wales there are two only accepted methods of plant cleaning, circulation cleaning and Acidified Boiling Water (A. B. W.). Prior to the. audit described it was expected that water and electricity consumption for plant cleaning would be predictable. To date there has been little information on the volume and temperature of water used on commercial dairy farms and the electricty consumed to produce this hot water. It is therefore difficult for farmers to make informed judgement on methods of reducing their electricity costs. Thirteen farms in South Devon have been monitored, to establish current practice: farmers were questioned about their water use; electricity and water consumption were metered for two years; and cleaning practices were observed. This survey has revealed that many non-standard cleaning methods are used on dairy farms, making the prediction of water and electricity consumption difficult. The management of equipment has been revealed as the most important aspect in determining the energy used. A computer model has been produced to simulate water heating in the farm dairy, which can be used to advise farmers as to the energy cost of their cleaning practices. This model has. been successfully used on several of the farms surveyed, on one farm its use resulted in energy savings in excess of 400 kWh per month. The Electricity Counci...|$|R
30|$|As {{pointed out}} in Chitika (2008) {{studies have shown that}} informally marketed milk is {{associated}} with zoonotic health risks (which include brucellosis, coliforms and bovine tuberculosis) and high bacteria counts which are due to poor hygiene and a long time lag between milking and sale. The absence of pasteurization increases the risk posed by such organisms. There is therefore a need for effective control measures including <b>hygienic</b> handling of <b>milk</b> and its pasteurization to protect public health. However, actual health risks from bacterial contamination are judged to be low because of the common consumer practice of boiling milk before consumption.|$|R

Biodynamic milk showed a higher oxidation of the milk fat and a longer renneting time. Conventional milk often tasted better. There is a correlation between several <b>hygienic</b> parameters in <b>milk</b> (germ count, etc) {{and the quality of}} degradation. However, the total germ count could not explain all differences and the question was raised if biodynamic milk might have a better resistance to degradation due to a specific bacterial flora or other defence mechanisms in the bio-dynamic milk...|$|R

The basic parameter to detect this illness is the somatic cell count SCC, which are defensive cells located in the goat’s udder. In order to assess the goat milk, this study was made upon the somatic cells from the selected goats and their relation with the milk production and the extensive system farms from which the samples were taken. The results were in conformity with the European standards. Regarding the factors of influence, the amount of milk production in combination with the system type of farm must be taken into consideration...|$|R

During {{the last}} three decades many changes took place in the {{modernization}} of milk production in Vojvodina. The milk yield per cow was increased considerably, new techniques and advanced technology were implemented and some legal regulations on milk quality were passed as well.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the microbiological and <b>hygienic</b> quality of <b>milk</b> of Bionda dell’Adamello goats. Forty-three samples of bulk untreated goats’ milk and 42 milk-filter samples, obtained from six farms, were analysed. The results showed the absence of Listeria spp. in all the milk and milk-filter samples. Considerable differences were observed in terms of milk hygiene (related to total coliforms, E. coli and plate count at 30 °C) as the microbiological quality of the milk from only half (3 / 6) of the farms resulted satisfactory. This finding provides that the ideal way of using the milk of Bionda dell’Adamello goats is producing cheese matured for more than 60 days, as the typical cheese Fatulì...|$|R
