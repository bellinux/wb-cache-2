40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{has caused the}} need for a stronger positioning of the European Court of Justice in the new model of economic governance in the European Union. The Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice contributes in creating the optimal legal control mechanism of budget spending in the <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>law</b> and ensure maintenance of euro-zone fiscal framework. The role of the European Court of Justice in the EMU in earlier periods was secondary, but in times of crisis, it points to the growing need of Jurisdiction's extending in the field of monetary relations between member states and respect of convergence rules. Court's Jurisdiction in resolving of monetary and fiscal disputes is increasingly implemented in determining the legal nature of international agreements, whose ratio is economic stability, where the Judgments regarding complementarities of these legal documents with primary law provisions have the crucial impact on the future direction of national fiscal policies coordination. Although, the Court's Jurisdiction in this area is still underdeveloped and Judgments are often conditioned by pragmatism reasons, by development of credible macroeconomic dialogue between Court of Justice, European Central Bank and European Court of Auditors may establish conditions for fullfiling legal gaps in the performance of monetary and fiscal Jurisdiction of the Court...|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> Institute (EMI), the predecessor of the European Central Bank, on 1 January 1994, was a milestone {{in the process of}} <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration. In this paper, we look at the work on the international and <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> system of Alexandre Lamfalussy, its first president. Lamfalussy pursued a threefold career: as a private banker, a central banker and an academic. Partly under the influence of Robert Triffin, Lamfalussy soon became interested in international monetary issues. This paper analyses his views on the international monetary system and on <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration, including his contributions to the Delors Report, which provided the framework for <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> union. The paper draws extensively on archival research in the Lamfalussy papers at the Bank for International Settlements and the minutes of the EEC Committee of Governors' meetings. The paper provides not only an analysis of Lamfalussy's thought on <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration, but also offers crucial insight into the Weltanschauung and way of thinking of European central bankers in this period.

40|$|This work {{discusses}} the constitutionalization of rules in macroeconomic policy-making in the European Union (EU) {{with reference to}} <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration. The analysis deals with two main <b>monetary</b> arrangements, the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> System (EMS) and the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), and focuses on one country - Italy. Using an interdisciplinary perspective and a constitutional political economy approach, three sets of factors are identified to explain how and why policy-makers may decide to self-limit their sovereignty in monetary and fiscal policies, as they {{have done in the}} process of <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration.

40|$|This paper investigates {{theoretically}} and empirically {{the effect}} on exchange rates of integrating monetary policy in Europe.

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> Union is {{of great}} {{importance}} for its member states, since being its part implies a lot of privileges.

Lower transaction costs enable easier and much more profitable trade between Member States of the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> Union. The most notable achievement of the <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> Union is the single currency - the euro which becomes frequently used today in the international trade. A significant benefit is an elimination of foreign exchange risks since it influences reinforcement of internal market and reduces investment risks.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the process of {{exchange}} rate management during the two <b>European</b> <b>Monetary</b> System(EMS) crises, in 1981 - 83 and 1992 - 93, and examines the factors which led the French governments to adhere to the EMS. France's strong franc (franc fort) policy is a useful test case for maintaining national commitment to <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration. The origin of the franc fort policy {{can be traced back to}} the exchange rate crisis of 1981 - 83. By actively supporting European institutions and emphasizing the emergence of a strong and united European common currency, France discovered the way to bolster confidence in her economic policy. Beyond this focal point, political justification and economic rationality became mutually reinforcing, configuring French national preference in <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration. The response of the French government to the EMS crisis of 1992 - 93 was more consistent compared to the response to the 1981 - 83 crisis, and reflected the accumulation of loyalty to <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration. This loyalty, however, was made neither from purely economic calculation nor out of normative commitment French <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> policy reflected the interaction between domestic politics and <b>European</b> <b>monetary</b> integration. The French commitment to the franc fort also was based on domestic political bases such as the existence of a core policy group, a centralized policy-making structure, and an issue linkage between the franc fort and European integration.
