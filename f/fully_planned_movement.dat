40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} {{provides}} an overview of the dominant conservative legal doctrines and governing practices that limited planners 2 ̆ 7 goals and strategies in New Haven during the period from 1907 through 1913, and that planning advocates sought to change. Part II provides a narrative of the New Haven <b>planning</b> <b>movement</b> prior to the publication of a 1910 report by Cass Gilbert, a well-known New York-based architect, and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., a nationally recognized city planner, on how best to improve New Haven 2 ̆ 7 s physical environment and infrastructure. To illustrate the difficulties facing the nascent <b>planning</b> <b>movement</b> in New Haven, Part II chronicles an early attempt by planning proponents to expand the creation and enforcement of one form of land use regulation, building lines. Part III discusses the Gilbert-Olmsted report, the reaction to it, and the events that led to the establishment of a new administrative agency in New Haven devoted to city planning. Parts II and III include not only those arguments about law and municipal structure made by participants in the New Haven movement, but also those made by attorneys and lay planning proponents associated with the national <b>planning</b> <b>movement.</b> Part IV summarizes the role of law and governance in limitating upon what planners during this era could propose and what the municipal administrative agencies that planners advocated could enact and enforce. In addition, Part IV describes the relationship between the early city <b>planning</b> <b>movement</b> and the centralized city planning that would occur in the years after World War II...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of <b>planning</b> <b>movements</b> of dual-arm {{anthropomorphic}} systems, with the aim of reducing the computational cost of the problem and making the movements look as human-like as possible. The key idea of the proposal is the search of synergies of the dual-arm anthropomorphic system in order to use them to reduce the dimension of the search space while preserving human-like appearance. This idea was already developed and successfully used to <b>plan</b> <b>movements</b> of robotic hands, thus the extension to a dual-arm system is attractive. The paper presents a description of the proposed approach as well as real experimental results that encourage doing further research in this line. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|Do <b>movement</b> <b>plans,</b> like {{representations}} {{in working}} memory, share a limited pool of resources? If so, the precision with which each individual <b>movement</b> <b>plan</b> is specified should decrease {{as the total}} number of <b>movement</b> <b>plans</b> increases. To explore this, human participants made speeded reaching movements toward visual targets. We examined if preparing one movement resulted in less variability than preparing two movements. The number of <b>planned</b> <b>movements</b> was manipulated in a delayed response cueing procedure that limited planning to a single target (Exp. 1) or hand (Exp. 2), or required <b>planning</b> of <b>movements</b> toward two targets (or with two hands). For both experiments, initial movement direction variability was higher in the two-plan than in the one-plan condition, demonstrating a cost associated with <b>planning</b> multiple <b>movements,</b> consistent with the limited resource hypothesis. In a third experiment we show that the advantage in initial variability of preparing a single movement was present only when the trajectory could be fully specified. This indicates that the difference in variability between one and two plans reflects the specification of full motor plans, not a general preparedness to move. The precision cost related to concurrent plans represents a novel constraint on motor preparation, indicating that multiple <b>movements</b> cannot be <b>planned</b> independently, even if they involve different limbs...|$|R
