40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> with leptomeningeal disease (LMD) have an {{extremely}} poor prognosis and {{a paucity of}} effective treatment options. We assessed the safety and efficacy of intrathecal interleukin- 2 (IT IL- 2) in <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> with LMD. METHODS: We reviewed the outcomes of 43 consecutive <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> with LMD who were treated with IT IL- 2 from 2006 to 2014 in a Compassionate Investigational New Drug Study. All patients had evidence of LMD based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, radiology, and/or surgical pathology. IL- 2 at a dose of 1. 2 mIU was administered intrathecally via Ommaya reservoir up to 5 times per week in the inpatient setting for 4 weeks; patients with good tolerance and clinical benefit received maintenance IT IL- 2 every 1 to 3 months thereafter. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 46. 7 years (range 18 - 71); 32 (74 %) were male; 31 (72 %) had positive CSF cytology, and 39 (91 %) had radiographic evidence of LMD. Median overall survival (OS) from initiation of IT IL- 2 was 7. 8 months (range, 4. 7 - 16. 3 months), with 1 -, 2 -, and 5 -year OS rates of 36 %, 26 %, and 13 %. The presence of neurological symptoms (HR 2. 1, p= 0. 03), positive baseline CSF cytology (HR 4. 1, p= 0. 001) and concomitant use of targeted therapy (HR 3. 0, p= 0. 02) were associated with shorter OS on univariate analysis. All patients developed symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure. There were no treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSION: IT IL- 2 treatment is safe and achieves long-term survival in a subset of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> with LMD...|$|R

We assessed MGMT promoter methylation in formalin-fixed, primary tumor tissue of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> treated with <b>first-line</b> temozolomide and bevacizumab from the trial SAKK 50 / 07 by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the MGMT expression levels were also analyzed by MGMT immunohistochemistry. Eleven of 42 primary melanomas (26 %) revealed a methylated MGMT promoter.

40|$|Tumor-infiltrating {{lymphocytes}} {{appear to}} be a predictor of survival in many cancers, including cutaneous melanoma. We applied automated multispectral imaging to determine whether density and distribution of T cells within primary cutaneous melanoma tissue correlate with survival of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> after dendritic cell (DC) vaccination. CD 3 (+) T cell infiltration in primary tumors from 77 <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> was quantified using the ratio of intratumoral versus peritumoral T-cell densities (I/P ratio). Patients with longer survival after DC vaccination had stronger T-cell infiltration than patients with shorter survival in a discovery cohort of 19 patients (P = 0. 000026) and a validation cohort of 39 patients (P = 0. 000016). I/P ratio was the strongest predictor of survival in a multivariate analysis including M substage and serum lactate dehydrogenase level. To evaluate I/P ratio as a predictive biomarker, we analyzed 19 chemotherapy-treated patients. Longer survival times of DC-vaccinated compared with chemotherapy-treated patients was observed for high (P = 0. 000566), but not low (P = 0. 154) I/P ratios. In conclusion, T-cell infiltration into primary melanoma is a strong predictor of survival after DC vaccination in <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> who, on average, started this therapy several years after primary tumor resection. The infiltration remains predictive even after adjustment for late-stage prognostic markers. Our findings suggest that the I/P ratio is a potential predictive biomarker for treatment selection.

We profiled a panel of human melanoma cell lines and control melanocytes for altered expression of hedgehog pathway members and determined the consequences of both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the hedgehog pathway activator Smoothened (SMO) in melanoma, both in vitro and in vivo. We also {{examined the relationship between}} altered expression of hedgehog pathway mediators and survival in a well-characterized cohort of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> with prospectively collected follow up information. Studies revealed that over 40 % of the melanoma cell lines examined harbored significantly elevated levels of the hedgehog pathway mediators SMO, GLI 2, and PTCH 1 compared to melanocytes (p < 0. 05). SMO inhibition using siRNA and the small molecule inhibitor, NVP-LDE- 225, suppressed melanoma growth in vitro, particularly in those cell lines with moderate SMO and GLI 2 expression. NVP-LDE- 225 also induced apoptosis in vitro and inhibited melanoma growth in a xenograft model. Gene expression data also revealed evidence of compensatory up-regulation of two other developmental pathways, Notch and WNT, in response to hedgehog pathway inhibition. Pharmacological and genetic SMO inhibition also downregulated genes involved in human embryonic stem cell pluripotency. Finally, increased SMO expression and decreased expression of the hedgehog pathway repressor GLI 3 correlated with shorter post recurrence survival in <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients.</b> Our data demonstrate that hedgehog pathway inhibition might be a promising targeted therapy in appropriately selected <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

Sampling the blood compartment to detect the mutational status of a solid tumor represents a highly innovative advance in cancer medicine, and such an approach could have advantages over tissue-based techniques. We report the development of a fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect mutant BRAF alleles in plasma. A mutant-specific PCR assay was optimized to specifically amplify the mutant BRAF allele without amplifying the wild-type allele. Experiments mixing DNA from a BRAF mutant melanoma cell line with wild-type human placental DNA in varying proportions were performed to determine the threshold of this assay and to compare it with routine DNA sequencing. The assay was then applied to tissue and plasma specimens from <b>patients</b> with <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma.</b> The assay detected 0. 1 ng of mutant DNA mixed in 100 ng of wild-type DNA and was 500 -fold more sensitive than DNA sequencing.

40|$|Objectives: Defining the BRAF {{mutation}} {{status in}} <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> {{is critical to}} selecting patients for therapeutic treatment with targeted therapies. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) can provide an alternative source of contemporaneous tumour genetic material. However methodologies to analyse the presence of rare mutations in a background of wild-type DNA requires a detailed assessment. Here we evaluate the sensitivity of two technologies for cancer mutation detection and the suitability of whole genome amplified DNA as a template {{for the detection of}} BRAF-V 600 mutations. Design and methods: Serial dilutions of mutant BRAF-V 600 E DNA in wild-type DNA were tested using both competitive allele-specific PCR (castPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), with and without previous whole genome amplification (WGA). Using immunomagnetic beads, we partially enriched CTCs from blood obtained from <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> with confirmed BRAF mutation positive tumours and extracted RNA and DNA from the CTCs. We used RT-PCR of RNA to confirm the presence of melanoma cells in the CTC fraction then the DNAs of CTC positive fractions were WGA and tested for BRAF V 600 E or V 600 K mutations by ddPCRs. Results: WGA DNA produced lower than expected fractional abundances by castPCR analysis but not by ddPCR. Moreover, ddPCR was found to be 200 times more sensitive than castPCR and in combination with WGA produced the most concordant results, with a limit of detection of 0. 0005 %. BRAF-V 600 E or V 600 K mutated DNA was detected in 77 % and 44 %, respectively, of enriched CTC fractions from <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> carrying the corresponding mutations. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that using ddPCR in combination with WGA DNA allows the detection with high sensitivity of cancer mutations in partially enriched CTC fractions...|$|R

Treatment was given until progression. A two stage phase II design was used, with response rate the primary endpoint. Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were also explored. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were recruited with 37 patients receiving at least 2 cycles and 17 patients at least 6 cycles. Myelosuppression occurred with 25 patients (54 %) requiring a 25 % dose reduction in temozolomide.

Methods:We constructedmelanoma tissuemicroarrays in a large series ofmelanoma patients, including 29 normal nevi, 52 dysplastic nevi, 270 primarymelanomas, and 148 <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanomas.</b> The expression level of subcellular p 27 in different stages of melanocytic lesions and its prognostic significance were evaluated. Results: Compared with dysplastic nevi, nuclear p 27 expression was remarkably reduced in primary melanomas and further reduced in <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> (P < 0. 001 for both), whereas cytoplasmic p 27 expression is significantly increased from dysplastic nevi to primary melanomas (P 0. 032) and further increased in melanoma metastases (P 0. 037). Although loss of nuclear p 27 expression is correlated with a worse 5 -year survival of primary melanoma patients in Kaplan–Meier analysis (P 0. 046), {{it is not a}} prognostic factor by multivariate Cox regression analysis. On the contrary, Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that gain of cytoplasmic p 27 was associated with a poor 5 -year survival of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> (P < 0. 001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that positive cytoplasmic p 27 expression is an independent prognostic factor to predict <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patient</b> outcome.

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of solid {{evidence}} for treatment benefit of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) as part of loco-regional surgical treatment of non-distant <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma,</b> there might be variation in surgical treatment strategies in the Netherlands. The objective of the current study was to assess differences in the performance of SLNB, in geographical regions in the Netherlands, of non-distant <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I-III). A total of 28 550 melanoma patients, diagnosed between 2005 and 2013, were included in this population based retrospective study. Data were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Treatment strategies in 8 regions of the Netherlands were compared according to stage, excluding patients with distant metastasis (AJCC stage IV). Throughout the Netherlands, there was substantial practice variation across the regions. The performance of SLNB in patients with clinically unsuspected lymph nodes and Breslow thickness > 1. 0 mm was significantly different between the regions. In a post hoc analysis, we observed that patients aged over 60 years, female patients and patients with a melanoma located in head and neck have lower odds to receive a SLNB. There is considerable loco-regional practice variation which cannot completely be explained by the patient and tumor characteristics, in the surgical treatment of non-distant <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> in the Netherlands. Although national guidelines recommend considering SLNB in all patients with a melanoma thicker than 1 mm, only half of the patients received a SLNB. Future research should assess whether this practice variation leads to unwanted variations in clinical outcom...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{prospective}} study of a combination therapy involving a cardenolide and a MEK inhibitor for <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma.</b> Whereas BRAF mutant melanomas can exhibit profound responses to treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, there are fewer options for BRAF wild-type melanomas. In preclinical studies, we discovered that cardenolides synergize with MEK inhibitor to promote the regression of patient-derived xenografts irrespective of BRAF mutation status. We therefore conducted a phase 1 B study of digoxin 0. 25 mg and trametinib 2 mg given orally once daily in 20 patients with advanced, refractory, BRAF wild-type melanomas. The most common adverse events were rash, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. The response rate was 4 / 20 or 20 % with response durations of 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. The disease control rate (including partial responses and stable disease) was 13 / 20 or 65 % of patients, including 5 / 6 or 83 % of patients with NRAS mutant melanomas and 8 / 14 or 57 % of NRAS wild-type melanomas. Patients with stable disease had disease control for 2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 10 months. Xenografts from four patients recapitulated the treatment responses observed in patients. Based on these pilot results, an expansion arm of digoxin plus MEK inhibitor is warranted for NRAS mutant <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> who are refractory or intolerant of immunotherapy. Key points: Digoxin plus trametinib is well tolerated and achieves {{a high rate of}} disease control in BRAF wild-type <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the antitumor activity of combi-nation cisplatin (CDDP) and a-interferon (a-IFN) in ad-vanced, measurable <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma.</b> <b>Patients</b> and Methods: Adult <b>patients</b> with <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> {{were required to}} have bidimensionally mea-surable lesions and a Karnofsky performance status 2 - 60 %. Serum creatinine s 1. 5 mg/dL, creatinine clearance> 60 mL/min, adequate organ and bone marrow func-tion, and radiologic proof {{of the absence of}} brain me-tastases were required. CDDP 40 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) on day 1 and day 8, and a-IFN 3 million units/m 2 subcutaneously on days I to 5 and 8 to 12 were adminis-tered every 3 to 4 weeks.

40|$|Antibodies to immune checkpoints {{have entered}} the {{clinical}} arena and {{have been shown to}} provide a clinical benefit for <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> and, possibly, for other tumors as well. In this review paper we summarize this therapeutic activity and underline the functional mechanisms that may be involved. Among them, we discuss the so far neglected role of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) deriving from tumor somatic mutations and summarize the results of recent trials showing the immunogenic strength of such TAAs which can be specifically targeted by T cells activated by immune checkpoint antibodies. Finally we discuss new immunotherapy approaches that involve the combination of self/shared- or neo-TAAs-based vaccines and immune checkpoint blockade antibodies, to increase the clinical response of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Melanoma is an {{immunogenic}} cancer. However, {{the ability}} of the immune system to eradicate melanoma tumors is affected by intrinsic negative regulatory mechanisms. Multiple immune-modulatory therapies are currently being developed to optimize the immune response to melanoma tumors. Two recent Phase III studies using the monoclonal antibody ipilimumab, which targets the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA- 4), a negative regulator of T-cell activation, have demonstrated improvement in overall survival of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients.</b> This review highlights the clinical trial data that supports the efficacy of ipilimumab, the immune-related response criteria used to evaluate clinical response, and side-effect profile associated with ipilimumab treatment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose <b>Metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> have a poor prognosis. No {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{has improved}} overall survival. More effective treatments are needed. Docetaxel has clinical activity in melanoma {{and may be}} more active when combined with vinorelbine. Granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has shown activity as an adjuvant melanoma therapy. We carried out a phase II study of these agents in patients with stage IV melanoma. Methods Patients had documented stage IV melanoma and may have had prior immuno or chemotherapy. Previously treated brain metastases were allowed. Docetaxel (40 mg/m 2 IV) and vinorelbine (30 mg/m 2 IV) were administered every 14 days, followed by GM-CS...|$|R
40|$|High-dose interferon-alpha {{remains the}} {{first-line}} {{treatment in the}} adjuvant therapy of <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma.</b> More recently, high-dose pegylated interferon-alpha- 2 b has {{been approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration. Actually, an adjuvant therapy alternative to high-dose interferon-alpha is represented by ipilimumab. Moreover, combination therapy of IFN-alpha or ipilimumab with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been proved in patients with specific mutations. It is mandatory to understand what the best adjuvant treatment is for resected <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients,</b> particularly at stage III-N 1, in terms of overall survival rather than recurrence-free survival. The ECOG 1609 clinical trial compared high-dose interferon-alpha and ipilimumab alone or combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of early <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma.</b> In the past, ECOG 1684, 1690 and 1694 trials showed improvement in recurrence-free survival more than overall survival for high-risk melanoma patients (stage IIB-III) treated with high-dose interferon-alpha, whereas more recently the EORTC 18991 trial reported successful therapeutic results in terms of recurrence-free survival rather than overall survival for stage III-N 1 melanoma patients treated with high-dose pegylated interferon-alpha- 2 b. Toxicity was more acceptable within one year of treatment. Randomized trials have demonstrated that ipilimumab as second-line therapy is able to increase dose-dependent overall survival rates in advanced melanoma patients despite severe but reversible immune-related adverse events. Old tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been used in combination with interferon for the treatment of advanced melanoma patients with moderate benefits and increased toxicity, but new selective drugs seem to be more efficacious. Early <b>metastatic</b> <b>melanoma</b> <b>patients</b> (stage III-N 1) should be the principal subset to be treated with the most suitable adjuvant therapy to achieve the best overall survival. New schedules have to be tested with high-dose interferon-alpha and ipilimumab alone or combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors while waiting for results from ECOG 1609...|$|R
