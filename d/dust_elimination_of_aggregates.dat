40|$|CNS neurons are {{endowed with}} the ability to recover from {{cytotoxic}} insults associated with the accumulation <b>of</b> proteinaceous <b>aggregates</b> in mouse models of polyglutamine disease, but the cellular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we show that autophagy is essential for the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> forms <b>of</b> mutant huntingtin and ataxin- 1 from the cytoplasmic but not nuclear compartments. Human orthologs of yeast autophagy genes, molecular determinants of autophagic vacuole formation, are recruited to cytoplasmic but not nuclear inclusion bodies in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|AbstractCell {{survival}} under severe {{thermal stress}} requires {{the activity of}} the ClpB (Hsp 104) AAA+ chaperone that solubilizes and reactivates aggregated proteins in concert with the DnaK (Hsp 70) chaperone system. How protein disaggregation is achieved and whether survival is solely dependent on ClpB-mediated <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregates</b> or also on reactivation <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> proteins has been unclear. We engineered a ClpB variant, BAP, which associates with the ClpP peptidase and thereby is converted into a degrading disaggregase. BAP translocates substrates through its central pore directly into ClpP for degradation. ClpB-dependent translocation is demonstrated to {{be an integral part of}} the disaggregation mechanism. Protein disaggregation by the BAP/ClpP complex remains dependent on DnaK, defining a role for DnaK at early stages of the disaggregation reaction. The activity switch of BAP to a degrading disaggregase does not support thermotolerance development, demonstrating that cell survival during severe thermal stress requires reactivation <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{chaperone}} protein network controls both initial protein folding and subsequent maintenance of proteins in the cell. Although the native {{structure of a}} protein is principally encoded in its amino-acid sequence, the process of folding in vivo very often requires the assistance of molecular chaperones. Chaperones {{also play a role}} in a post-translational quality control system and thus are required to maintain the proper conformation of proteins under changing environmental conditions. Many factors leading to unfolding and misfolding of proteins eventually result in protein aggregation. Stress imposed by high temperature {{was one of the first}} aggregation-inducing factors studied and remains one of the main models in this field. With massive protein aggregation occurring in response to heat exposure, the cell needs chaperones to control and counteract the aggregation process. <b>Elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregates</b> can be achieved by solubilization <b>of</b> <b>aggregates</b> and either refolding of the liberated polypeptides or their proteolysis.

40|$|Type I {{collagen}} is a {{major component}} of the extracellular matrix, and mutations in the collagen gene cause several matrix-associated diseases. These mutant procollagens are misfolded and often aggregated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although the misfolded procollagens are potentially toxic to the cell, little is known about how they are eliminated from the ER. Here, we show that procollagen that can initially trimerize but then aggregates in the ER are eliminated by an autophagy-lysosome pathway, but not by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Inhibition of autophagy by specific inhibitors or RNAi-mediated knockdown of an autophagy-related gene significantly stimulated accumulation <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> procollagen trimers in the ER, and activation of autophagy with rapamycin resulted in reduced amount <b>of</b> <b>aggregates.</b> In contrast, a mutant procollagen which has a compromised ability to form trimers was degraded by ERAD. Moreover, we found that autophagy plays an essential role in protecting cells against the toxicity of the ERAD-inefficient procollagen <b>aggregates.</b> The autophagic <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> procollagen occurs independently of the ERAD system. These results indicate that autophagy is a final cell protection strategy deployed against ER-accumulated cytotoxic aggregates that are not able to be removed by ERAD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAutophagy, {{literally}} translated means self-eating, is {{a primary}} degradative pathway and {{plays an important role}} in the regulation of cellular homeostasis through <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> proteins, damaged organelles, and intracellular pathogens. Autophagy has been classified into microautophagy, macroautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy, depending on the choice of the pathway by which the cellular material is delivered to lysosomes. Dysregulation of autophagy may contribute to the development of cardiorenal metabolic syndrome (CRS), including insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, maladaptive immune modulation, and associated cardiac and renal disease. Clarifying the pathways and mechanisms of autophagy under normal conditions is essential to understanding its dysregulation in the development of CRS. Here, we highlight a recent surge in autophagy research, such as the cellular quality control through the disposal and recycling of cellular components, and summarize our contemporary understanding of molecular mechanisms of autophagy in diverse organ or tissues involved in the pathogenesis of CRS.

The half-life of the clearance from circulation decreased from 2. 5 hr to 4. 2 min and from 22 min to 1. 8 min after aggregation of mIgA and pIgA, respectively. Tissue localization experiments indicated that the liver was the organ predominantly involved in the uptake and catabolism of the proteins injected.

The four substances injected, pIgA, A-pIgA, mIgA and A-mIgA, were predominantly localized in nonparenchymal cells when the uptake was expressed per volume of cells, due to their lower protein content.

40|$|Macroautophagy (often {{referred}} to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular system by which macromolecules and organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. Autophagy is robustly induced in response to starvation in order to generate nutrients and energy through the lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components. Constitutive, basal autophagy serves as a quality control mechanism for the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> proteins and worn-out or damaged organelles, such as mitochondria.

One archival brain tumour and two archival breast carcinoma were studied, corresponding to 7120 elements (3764 nuclei, 3356 debris and aggregates). Three automatic classification methods were tested to eliminate debris and aggregates from DNA ploidy measurements (mathematical morphology (MM), multiparametric analysis (MA) and neural network (NN)). Performances were evaluated by reference to interactive sorting. The results obtained for the three methods concerning the percentage <b>of</b> debris and <b>aggregates</b> automatically removed reach 63, 75 and 85 % for MM, MA and NN methods, respectively, with false positive rates of 6, 21 and 25 %.

The author proposes to measure welfare gains as {{the increase in}} consumption growth, instead of consumption levels. When the consumption process is non-stationary, the author's proposed measure has several attractive features: it {{does not depend on}} the horizon, and it is robust to alternative specifications of the consumption stochastic processes (from geometric Brownian processes, to Orstein-Ulhenbeck mean-reverting processes), and preferences (from constant relative risk aversion preferences to Kreps-Porteus preferences). The author then uses this measure to estimate potential welfare gains from international risk-sharing for a representative U. S. consumer. The author finds that if international risk-sharing leads only to a complete <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregate</b> consumption volatility (with no impact on consumption growth), it represents gains to a U.

Here, we investigate the separation behaviors of nonspherical and spherical particles∕cells in the hydrodynamic filtration (HDF) scheme, which was previously developed for continuous size-dependent particle∕cell separation. Nonspherical particle models were prepared by coating the hemisphere of spherical polymer particles with a thin Au layer and by bonding the Janus particles to form twins and triplets resembling dividing and aggregating cells, respectively. High-speed imaging revealed {{a difference in the}} separation behaviors of spherical and nonspherical particles at a branch point; nonspherical particles showed rotation behavior and did not enter the branch channel even when their minor axis was smaller than the virtual width of the flow region entering the branch channel, w 1. The confocal-laser high-speed particle intensity velocimetry system visualized the flow profile inside the HDF microchannel, demonstrating that the steep flow-velocity distribution at the branch point is the main factor causing the rotation behavior of nonspherical particles. As applications, we successfully separated spherical and nonspherical particles with various major∕minor lengths and also demonstrated the selection of budding∕single cells from a yeast cell mixture. We therefore conclude that the HDF scheme can be used for continuous shape-based particle∕cell separation...|$|R

40|$|Neurodegeneration, {{a result}} of {{multiple}} dysregulatory events, is a lengthy multistep process manifested by accrual of mutant variants and abnormal expression, posttranslational modification, and processing of certain proteins. Accumulation of these dysregulated processes requires a mechanism that maintains their functional stability and allows {{the evolution of the}} neurodegenerative phenotype. In malignant cells, the capacity to buffer transformation has been attributed to heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp 90). Although normal proteins seem to require limited assistance from the chaperone, their aberrant counterparts seem to be highly dependent on Hsp 90. Whereas enhanced Hsp 90 affinity for mutated or functionally deregulated client proteins has been observed for several oncoproteins, it is unknown whether Hsp 90 plays a similar role for neuronal proteins and thus maintains and facilitates the transformed phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases. Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant phosphorylation and/or expression of Tau protein, leading to a time-dependent accumulation <b>of</b> Tau <b>aggregates</b> and subsequent neuronal death. Here, we show that the stability of p 35, a neuronal protein that activates cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 through complex formation leading to aberrant Tau phosphorylation, and that of mutant but not WT Tau protein is maintained in tauopathies by Hsp 90. Inhibition of Hsp 90 in cellular and mouse models of tauopathies leads to a reduction of the pathogenic activity of these proteins and results in <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> Tau. The results identify important roles played by Hsp 90 in maintaining and facilitating the degenerative phenotype in these diseases and provide a common principle governing cancer and neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|SummarySelective ubiquitin-dependent {{autophagy}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>aggregates,</b> assemblies, or organelles and counteracts the cytotoxicity of proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Following substrate ubiquitylation, the cargo is delivered to autophagosomes involving adaptors like human p 62 that bind ubiquitin and the autophagosomal ubiquitin-like protein Atg 8 /LC 3; however, whether similar pathways exist in lower eukaryotes remained unclear. Here, we identify by a screen in yeast a new class of ubiquitin-Atg 8 adaptors termed CUET proteins, comprising the ubiquitin-binding CUE-domain protein Cue 5 from yeast and its human homolog Tollip. Cue 5 collaborates with Rsp 5 ubiquitin ligase, and the corresponding yeast mutants accumulate aggregation-prone proteins and are vulnerable to polyQ protein expression. Similarly, Tollip depletion causes cytotoxicity toward polyQ proteins, whereas Tollip overexpression clears human cells from Huntington’s disease-linked polyQ proteins by autophagy. We thus propose that CUET proteins play a critical and ancient role in autophagic clearance <b>of</b> cytotoxic protein <b>aggregates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} {{system is a}} pivotal component of the innate immune system which protects the host from infection and injury. Complement proteins can be induced in all cell types within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), where the pathway seems to play similar roles in host defense. Complement activation produces the C 5 cleavage fragment C 5 a, a potent inflammatory mediator, which recruits and activates immune cells. The primary cellular receptor for C 5 a, the C 5 a receptor (CD 88), has been reported to be on all CNS cells, including neurons and glia, suggesting a functional role for C 5 a in the CNS. A second receptor for C 5 a, the C 5 a-like receptor 2 (C 5 L 2), is also expressed on these cells; however, little is currently known about its potential role in the CNS. The potent immune and inflammatory actions of complement activation are necessary for host defense. However, if over-activated, or left unchecked it promotes tissue injury and contributes to brain disease pathology. Thus, complement activation, and subsequent C 5 a generation, is thought to {{play a significant role in}} the progression of CNS disease. Paradoxically, complement may also exert a neuroprotective role in these diseases by aiding in the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> and toxic proteins and debris which are a principal hallmark of many of these diseases. This review will discuss the expression and known roles for complement in the CNS, with a particular focus on the pro-inflammatory end-product, C 5 a. The possible overarching role for C 5 a in diseases of the CNS is reviewed, and the therapeutic potential of blocking C 5 a/CD 88 interaction is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a late-onset {{neurodegenerative disease}} {{characterized by the}} selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons associated with the abnormal aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ALS remain unclear, however. Autophagy is a major pathway for the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>aggregates</b> and damaged organelles and therefore contributes to cellular homeostasis. This catabolic process begins {{with the formation of}} the double membrane-bound autophagosome that engulfs portions of the cytoplasm and subsequently fuses with a lysosome to form an autolysosome, in which lysosomal enzymes digest autophagic substrates. Defects at various stages of autophagy have been associated with pathological mutations of several ALS-linked genes including SOD 1, p 62, TDP- 43, and optineurin, suggesting that such defects may play a causative role in the pathogenesis of this condition. In this review, we summarize the dysregulation of autophagy associated with ALS as well as potential therapeutic strategies based on modulation of the autophagic process...|$|R
40|$|<b>Elimination</b> <b>of</b> {{extracellular}} <b>aggregates</b> and apoptotic neural membranes without inflammation {{is crucial}} for brain tissue homeostasis. In the mammalian central nervous system, essential molecules in this process are the Fc receptors and the DAP 12 -associated receptors which both trigger the microglial immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif- (ITAM-) Syk-signaling cascade. Microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells- 2 (TREM 2), signal regulatory protein- 1, and complement receptor- 3 (CD 11 b/CD 18) signal via the adaptor protein DAP 12 and activate phagocytic activity of microglia. Microglial ITAM-signaling receptors are counter-regulated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif- (ITIM-) signaling molecules such as sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamily lectins (Siglecs). Siglecs can suppress the proinflammatory and phagocytic activity of microglia via ITIM signaling. Moreover, microglial neurotoxicity is alleviated via interaction of Siglec- 11 with sialic acids on the neuronal glycocalyx. Thus, ITAM- and ITIM-signaling receptors modulate microglial phagocytosis and cytokine expression during neuroinflammatory processes. Their dysfunction could lead to impaired phagocytic clearance and neurodegeneration triggered by chronic inflammation...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of ubiquitinated proteinaceous inclusions represents a complex process, reflecting the disequilibrium between aggregate formation and aggregate clearance. Although decreasing aggregate formation or augmenting aggregate clearance will {{ultimately lead to}} diminished aggregate-burden, in terms of disease pathogenesis, the different approaches can have distinct outcomes. Using a novel cell based assay that can distinguish newly formed versus preformed inclusions, we demonstrate that two proteins previously implicated in the autophagic clearance of expanded polyglutamine inclusions, HspB 7 and Alfy, actually affect very distinct cellular processes to affect aggregate-burden. Using this cell-based assay we also establish that constitutive expression of the aggregation prone protein can measurably slow the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>aggregates,</b> since not all aggregates appear to be available for degradation. This new assay can therefore not only determine at what step a modifier may impact aggregate burden, but {{also can be used}} to provide new insight into how protein aggregates are targeted for degradation...|$|R
40|$|Autophagy is a self-degradative {{process that}} is {{important}} for balancing sources of energy at critical times in development {{and in response to}} nutrient stress. Autophagy also plays a housekeeping role in removing misfolded or aggregated proteins, clearing damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, as well as eliminating intracellular pathogens. Thus, autophagy is generally thought of as a survival mechanism, although its deregulation has been linked to non-apoptotic cell death. Autophagy can be either non-selective or selective in the removal of specific organelles, ribosomes and protein aggregates, although the mechanisms regulating aspects of selective autophagy are not fully worked out. In addition to <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> intracellular <b>aggregates</b> and damaged organelles, autophagy promotes cellular senescence and cell surface antigen presentation, protects against genome instability and prevents necrosis, giving it a key role in preventing diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, liver disease, autoimmune diseases and infections.

40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb), the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis (TB), {{is the single}} most deadly pathogen. An estimated 2 billion people are currently infected and 2 million die each year {{as a result of the}} disease. However, only 10 % of the cases are symptomatic. Majority of the infections are latent, which is characterized by non-replicative, slow metabolic, and dormant Mtb surrounded by a plethora of immune called the granuloma in the lungs. The nonreplicating persistent state of infection poses a great challenge to the efforts to eradicate TB. The frontline drugs, which were discovered almost half a century ago, are primarily efficacious against actively dividing or metabolically active bacilli. To ensure the latent infection would not transition into active infection, in a process called reactivation, the drugs are to be administered up to 9 months. The long regimen leads to high non-compliance rates and directly fuels the appearance of multiple drug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and just recently, the discovery of totally drug-resistant (TDR) TB. To complicate matters, the co-infection with HIV promotes the progression to AIDS and animate dormancy to active infections. Unfortunately, due to the lack of financial incentive, TB research in pharmaceutical industry has largely been absent. The responsibility falls in the hands of academic labs to discover new drugs that can target Mtb in the latent phase to eliminate the episode of reactivation, shorten the regimen, and increase compliancy. This thesis presents the utilization of high-throughput screening in an effort to identify small molecule inhibitors that target the sulfate assimilation pathway, which is believed to be critical during the latent phase of TB infection. Chapter 1 reviews the molecular pathways that govern the sulfate assimilation pathway. Chapter 2 discusses the efforts of devising an assay amenable to high throughput screening, target production, library selection, and quality control.

Recent evidence suggests that lysosomal dysfunction leads to insufficient <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> toxic protein <b>aggregates.</b> We tested whether enhancing lysosomal function with transcription factor EB (TFEB), an essential regulator modulating lysosomal pathways, would promote Aβ clearance in microglia. Here we show that microglial expression of TFEB facilitates fibrillar Aβ (fAβ) degradation and reduces deposited amyloid plaques, which are further enhanced by deacetylation of TFEB. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we firstly confirmed acetylation as a previously unreported modification of TFEB and found that SIRT 1 directly interacted with and deacetylated TFEB at lysine residue 116. Subsequently, SIRT 1 overexpression enhanced lysosomal function and fAβ degradation by upregulating transcriptional levels of TFEB downstream targets, which could be inhibited when TFEB was knocked down. Furthermore, overexpression of deacetylated TFEB at K 116 R mutant in microglia accelerated intracellular fAβ degradation by stimulating lysosomal biogenesis and greatly reduced the deposited amyloid plaques in the brain slices of APP/PS 1 transgenic mice. Our findings reveal that deacetylation of TFEB could regulate lysosomal biogenesis and fAβ degradation, making microglial activation of TFEB a possible strategy for attenuating amyloid plaque deposition in AD.|$|R

40|$|Application of {{amphotericin}} B in lipid emulsions (AmB/L) reduced membrane toxicity {{in vitro}} and decreased amphotericin B-associated toxic side effects in vivo {{when compared to}} that of amphotericin B applied in 5 % glucose (AmB/G). Therefore, a comparative analysis of the pharmacological parameters of AmB/L and AmB/G was performed. Thirteen patients were analyzed, and nine of these patients received a subsequent treatment with AmB/G and AmB/L. In patients in both treatment groups amphotericin B showed a biphasic elimination from serum, with a prolonged terminal half-life of approximately 27 h. Patients treated with AmB/L showed significantly lower peak concentrations (44. 2 %; P = 0. 008) and correspondingly lower area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) values (64. 3 %; P = 0. 015) compared to the values for the same patients treated with AmB/G at a dose range of 0. 6 to 1. 5 mg/kg of body weight. The enhanced clearance of AmB/L may be due to a faster initial <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> amphotericin B-lipid <b>aggregates</b> by the reticuloendothelial system. Lower peak concentrations and AUC values in serum and a correspondingly faster deposition of AmB/L in tissues may at least partly explain the lower toxicity of AmB/L. A comparative pharmacokinetic analysis with data for a single patient treated with AmB/L demonstrated that hemodialysis did not significantly affect the disposition of amphotericin B...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} the progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and the abnormal appearance of intracellular inclusions named Lewy bodies (LBs). Over the past few years, the discovery of genes involved in hereditary forms of the disease led to {{new insights into the}} pathogenesis of PD. Mutations in the α-synuclein gene have been associated with autosomal dominant PD, and mutations in parkin with autosomal recessive-juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP). α-synuclein has emerged as a key protein in the pathogenesis of PD, as it appears to be the major structural component of LBs and its accumulation seems to play a prominent role in sporadic PD. To date, genetic PD models based on α-synuclein conventional transgenesis in rodents have been unsuccessful in recapitulating the main features of the human pathology, especially the loss of nigral dopamine neurons. The lack of clear dopaminergic cellular degeneration in these transgenic animal models is likely to be attributed to insufficient expression levels of α-synuclein in the substantia nigra. Injection of viral vectors constitutes an alternative approach for the development of genetic models, as viral vectors allow high gene expression levels in a localized brain region and can be applied in mammalian species other than mice. In the present study, the viral-mediated expression of different α-synuclein forms (normal or mutated) was explored in the substantia nigra of rats. Following the full characterization of this new genetic model, several neuroprotective strategies based on the delivery of potential neuroprotective factors such as the neurotrophic factor GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), the E 3 ligase parkin or the chaperone Hsp 104 were evaluated in this α-synuclein rat model. As HIV- 1 -derived lentiviral vectors can efficiently transduce neurons in the brain, these retroviral vectors were used to overexpress normal or mutated forms of α-synuclein in the substantia nigra of adult rats. In contrast to α-synuclein transgenic mice, the lentiviral-based model developed a progressive and selective loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons associated with a dopaminergic denervation of the striatum in animals expressing either wild-type or mutant forms of human α-synuclein. The neuronal degeneration correlated with the appearance of ?α-synuclein-positive inclusions. This viral-based model thus constitutes an excellent genetic model for testing molecules that can interfere with the neurodegenerative process induced by α-synuclein. Delivery of GDNF, a potent neuroprotective factor for the survival of dopaminergic neurons, is currently the most promising strategy for the treatment of PD. The neuroprotective properties of GDNF were therefore evaluated in the lentiviral-based model expressing mutated human α-synuclein. Although a robust expression of GDNF was observed in the whole nigrostriatal pathway due to retrograde and/or anterograde transport, nigral GDNF delivery did not prevent the α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration. As loss of function of parkin leads to dopaminergic cell loss in Autosomal Recessive-Juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) patients, parkin may represent a critical survival factor for dopaminergic neurons. The neuroprotective role of the E 3 ubiquitin ligase parkin was assessed in the viral-based model overexpressing mutated human α-synuclein. Co-expression of parkin with α-synuclein prevented the nigrostriatal degeneration and increased the number of hyperphosphorylated α-synuclein inclusions. These results suggest that parkin may also {{play a key role in}} the formation <b>of</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Abnormal folding and aggregation of α-synuclein is now recognized as a critical issue in the pathology of PD. Chaperones can block or reverse the incorrect folding of misfolded proteins, and increase the clearance <b>of</b> <b>aggregates.</b> To enhance the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregated</b> α-synuclein and to understand the importance of inclusions in the α-synuclein pathogenesis, we expressed a protein disaggregase, the yeast chaperone Hsp 104, in the lentiviral-based model of PD. This chaperone can facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins from an <b>aggregate</b> state. Expression <b>of</b> Hsp 104 reduced the dopaminergic cell loss induced by lentiviralmediated expression of PD-linked mutated α-synuclein. This neuroprotective effect correlated with a reduction in the formation of hyperphosphorylated α-synuclein inclusions, indicating that enhancing clearance <b>of</b> protein <b>aggregates</b> through the disaggregase activity of Hsp 104 may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for PD and other diseases caused by misfolded protein accumulation. The present thesis demonstrates that lentiviral vectors expressing human α-synuclein constitute a powerful and flexible tool to mimic the neuropathological features of PD. Although not effective in the lentiviral-based model of PD, GDNF may still represent a promising molecule to promote the sprouting of dopaminergic axons. On the contrary, the E 3 ligase parkin and the chaperone Hsp 104 have demonstrated potent neuroprotective properties against the accumulation of the toxic mutated α-synuclein. Therapeutic approaches aiming at increasing parkin or chaperone levels in the brain may therefore open new perspectives for the treatment of PD...|$|R
