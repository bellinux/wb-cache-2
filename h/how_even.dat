They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and <b>how</b> <b>even</b> though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and <b>how</b> <b>even</b> our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes <b>how</b> <b>even</b> the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E

25|$|Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Peter Richerson's 2003 {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of third party punishment demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>even</b> though the logic underlying altruistic giving and altruistic punishment may be the same, the evolutionary dynamics are not.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{complicated}} problems that exist within these anti-transgender themes. Roffee and Waling established <b>how,</b> <b>even</b> throughout the LGBTIQ+ community, there {{continues to be}} confusion regarding what individual people may identify with, and how this correlates to other people. This confusion often leads to offensive assumptions and judgement {{so that there are}} tensions and anti-social behaviours occurring, sometimes even within the community itself.|$|E
25|$|Crowding {{is found}} to be {{alleviated}} through macro-changes in occupational segregation. Teaching, for example, at least in recent generations, is traditionally a female- dominated profession. However, when positions open up for women in business and other high-earning occupations, school boards must raise the salaries of potential teachers to attract candidates. This is an example of <b>how</b> <b>even</b> women in traditionally female-dominated professions still benefit salary-wise from the gendered integration of the market.|$|E

25|$|Their split LP with Void As well {{as their}} more catchy but still raging EP Subject to Change. Known for their inward-looking lyrics—a {{pioneering}} thing in a scene more given to social and political themes—and the gruff allure of Alec MacKaye's vocals, The Faith was highly esteemed by local punk fans. They have probably made a deeper impact on the underground. They created the sound that went on to shape much of what came after, especially later period D.C. bands. The Faith shows why hardcore has lasting power, <b>how</b> <b>even</b> music recognised mainly for its brevity and brutality can convey something emotional and immediate, even several years on.|$|E
25|$|Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses {{himself and}} fate {{before leaving the}} stage. The chorus laments <b>how</b> <b>even</b> a great man can be felled by fate, and {{following}} this, a servant exits the palace to speak {{of what has happened}} inside. When Jocasta enters the house, she runs to the palace bedroom and hangs herself there. Shortly afterward, Oedipus enters in a fury, calling on his servants to bring him a sword so that he might cut out his mother's womb. He then rages through the house, until he comes upon Jocasta's body. Giving a cry, Oedipus takes her down and removes the long gold pins that held her dress together, before plunging them into his own eyes in despair.|$|E
25|$|A Holocaust {{survivor}} named Joseph Tschofenig wrote {{a statement}} on these seawater experiments at Dachau. Tschofenig explained how while working at the medical experimentation stations he gained insight {{into some of the}} experiments that were performed on prisoners, namely those where they were forced to drink salt water. Tschofenig also described how victims of the experiments had trouble eating and would desperately seek out any source of water including old floor rags. Tschofenig was responsible for using the X-ray machine in the infirmary and describes <b>how</b> <b>even</b> though he had insight into what was going on he was powerless to stop it. He gives the example of a patient in the infirmary who was sent to the gas chambers by Dr. Sigmund Rascher simply because he witnessed one of the low-pressure experiments.|$|E

It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|E
25|$|The film {{rights were}} picked up by Rogue Pictures in 2006, with the remake being the first film {{produced}} by Wes Craven's new production studio Midnight Pictures. Craven, who wrote and directed the 1972 original, was interested {{to see what kind}} of film could be produced on a large budget, as the limited funds in 1972 forced him to eliminate scenes he had wanted to film to tell a complete story. Alleca's original script included elements of the supernatural, which prompted the studio to reject it and bring in Ellsworth to perform a rewrite. One of the elements director Iliadis wanted to avoid with this film, given its graphic nature, was turning it into torture porn — a subgenre of horror popularized by the Saw franchise. For Craven and Iliadis, The Last House on the Left primarily illustrates <b>how</b> <b>even</b> the most normal of families can be driven to evil acts if pushed too far.|$|E

Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both {{the young and the}} old die. Seton writes of the film's [...] "lyrical" [...] qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon.

Greene liked the juxtaposition of impassioned and political lyrics, commenting that the album is capable of [...] "rubbing emotions raw and minds numb". Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic felt that with Revolutions per Minute, Rise Against took their craft and musicianship more seriously.

[...] San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "a rich trove of sharply written essays from the campaign". The New York Times criticized the work for its lack of moderation. The Daily Beast characterized it as [...] "raucous, trenchant, knee-slapping". Adelaide Review said it was, [...] "one of the finest exponents of polemic journalism". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette criticized the book for not delving deeply into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.
