5|$|Other {{attempts}} to modify general relativity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of cosmology. In the modern cosmological models, most {{energy in the}} universe is in forms {{that have never been}} detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics of cosmic expansion, for example modified Newtonian dynamics.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{northern}} and alpine in distribution, and rarely encountered. Collections <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States (including Maine, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, and Alaska), Canada (Quebec and British Columbia), China, Japan, and Korea. The disjunct distribution {{of this species}} in North America and East Asia has been noted to occur {{in a number of}} other fungal species as well. Polyozellus multiplex is also found in the Queen Charlotte Islands, where it is commercially harvested.|$|E

Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools {{in a manner similar to}} how they would work with samples.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} manuscripts {{containing}} the story are MS. XXXVI in the National Library of Scotland and H.6.8 in Trinity College, Dublin, written 1690–1691 and c. 1777 respectively. These represent a modernisation {{of the story}} that might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th or 16th century. The two manuscripts differ from each other in some respects, and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS. XXXVI was based on the redaction contained in Rawlinson B 512, but not upon that specific manuscript. The changes are so considerable in these modernisations that they are of no value for reconstructing the original text.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} first {{constructed}} in the early 19th century following the path of Nine Mile Creek, which connected several early settlements in Central New York. The northern half of the route, between the villages of Marcellus and Camillus, was later improved as a plank road in 1855 by a private corporation that collected tolls from travelers on the road. The state took over {{the maintenance of the}} road {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century. The former plank road and an extension south to Otisco Lake and southwest to Skaneateles Lake was first designated as Route174 in the 1930 state highway renumbering. Since then, several minor realignments <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under {{the central part of the}} Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E

5|$|US 5 roughly {{follows the}} route {{used by the}} Upper Boston Post Road, an early colonial highway for {{transporting}} mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of New Haven and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston Post Road corridor was designated as Route 2 of the New England road marking system, crossing {{to the east of}} the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, Route 2 was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities of New Haven and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between New Haven and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a secondary route today.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to found his own printery may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time around 1464, when Eggestein lost his office of Siegelbewahrer {{for the second}} time, possibly {{in connection with the}} setting up of the Offizin (an old German term for a book printery). On 31 March 1466 the printer received a Schutzbrief of the Elector Frederick I of the Palatinate, giving him special protection, somewhat like a patent. His first larger work {{is considered to be a}} Latin Bible, which must have been produced before 24 May 1466.|$|E

25|$|Ceramics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Toluca Valley region since {{far into}} the pre-Hispanic period, mostly by Matlatzincas and Nahuas.

The most traditional handcrafted wares are produced {{in places such as}} Metepec, Valle de Bravo, Texcoco and Almoloya de Juárez among others. The best known pottery and ceramics locale is Metepec, which specializes in large decorative pieces and sculptures called Trees of Life. Cooking utensils are made as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of which pitch to use {{can depend on}} a wide variety of situations such as; the type of hitter that is being faced, whether there are any base runners, how many outs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inning, or the current score, among others. The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch was traditionally made by the catcher. However, current form is to have the manager or a coach relay the pitch selection to the catcher, via secret hand signals to prevent the opposing team from having the advantage of knowing what the next pitch will be.|$|E
