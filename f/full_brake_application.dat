5000|$|Pre-Safe with {{pedestrian}} {{detection and}} City Brake function Thanks to {{the combination of}} stereo camera and radar sensors, {{it is now possible}} to detect pedestrians in front of the vehicle. Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted by BAS PLUS as the situation requires, right up to a <b>full</b> <b>brake</b> <b>application.</b> Should the driver fail to react, PRE-SAFE® Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. The PRE-SAFE® Brake with pedestrian detection is active up to approx. 72 km/h, and is able to prevent collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to 50 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|... for {{the same}} reason, on a very long train, a {{considerable}} volume of air has {{to be admitted to}} the train pipe to make a <b>full</b> <b>brake</b> <b>application,</b> and a considerable volume has to be exhausted to release the brake (if for example a signal at danger is suddenly lowered and the driver requires to resume speed); while the air is traveling along the train pipe, the brake pistons {{at the head of the}} train have responded to the brake application or release, but those at the tail will respond much later, leading to undesirable longitudinal forces in the train. In extreme cases this has led to breaking couplings and causing the train to divide.|$|E
50|$|Britannia Pacific No 70052 Firth of Tay {{was leading}} the 21:05 8-carriage express train from Glasgow St Enoch to London St Pancras. On the descent from Ais Gill summit, the driver heard a {{repeated}} knocking which he thought came from the connecting rods where they were connected to the locomotive's drive wheels. He reduced speed and later stopped the train in a gale force wind while it was snowing at Garsdale, {{but was unable to}} find the cause of the noise. He continued south at what he thought was less than 20 mph, however timings from the signal boxes showed the speed was 40 mph. The fireman on the right of the train then saw sparks {{from the side of the}} locomotive as ballast began to be thrown up against the cab. As the driver made a <b>full</b> <b>brake</b> <b>application,</b> an LMS class 5-hauled 20-wagon goods train passed in the opposite direction. The freight engine and eight leading wagons derailed, colliding with the side of the express, ripping out the side of the first three carriages and scoring the remainder. Five people were killed and eight more were injured. The accident happened near the village of Langcliffe, immediately north of Settle.|$|E
50|$|The S80 is {{available}} with optional Adaptive cruise control (ACC) with Collision Warning with <b>full</b> <b>Brake</b> Support (CWBS). Brake Support offers additional assistance by preparing {{the braking system}} so that the car can begin stopping faster and preparing for panic <b>brake</b> <b>application.</b> S80 is also equipped with an adaptive brake light as standard which is active at speeds above 30 mph, and can sense the difference between normal and panic braking. Ready Alert Brakes (RAB) are also available to anticipate severe braking. It prepares for this by moving the brake pads closer to the discs.|$|R

5000|$|... 2013: Mercedes updated Pre-Safe on the W222 S-Class as plus with cross-traffic assist. Pre-Safe with {{pedestrian}} {{detection and}} City Brake function {{is a combination}} of stereo camera and radar sensors to detect pedestrians in front of the vehicle. Visual and acoustic warnings are triggered when a hazard is spotted. If the driver then reacts by braking, the braking power will be boosted as the situation requires, up to a <b>full</b> <b>brake</b> <b>application.</b> Should the driver fail to react, Pre-Safe Brake triggers autonomous vehicle braking. Pedestrian detection is active up to about 72 km/h , and is able to reduce collisions with pedestrians autonomously from an initial speed of up to 50 km/h. A radar sensor in the rear bumper monitors the traffic behind the vehicle. If the risk of an impact from the rear is detected, the rear hazard warning lights are activated to alert the driver of the vehicle behind (not on vehicles with USA/Canada coding). Anticipatory occupant protection measures, such as the reversible belt tensioners, are deployed. If the vehicle is stopped and the driver indicates a wish to remain stationary - by depressing the brake pedal, activating the hold function, or moving the selector lever to [...] "P" [...] - the system increases the brake pressure to keep the vehicle firmly braked during a possible rear-end collision. [...] Pre-Safe Impulse works an early phase of the crash, before the resulting deceleration starts to increase, the front occupants are pulled away from the direction of impact and deeper into their seats by their seat belts. By the time the accident enters the phase when loads peak, the extra distance they are retracted by can be used while dissipating energy in a controlled fashion. Pre-acceleration and force limitation allow the occupants to be temporarily isolated from the effects of the crash, significantly reducing the risk and severity of injuries in a frontal collision.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} {{brake rotors}} {{are made with}} cast iron. Besides having economical advantage, cast iron rotor provides many disadvantages due to its weight, such as reduction in fuel efficiency, increase in green house gas emission, and increase in noise, vibration and hardness. With the development of commercial aluminum composites, composite brake rotors are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property. In this paper, the unique properties offered by an aluminum composite for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is addressed, and an approach to compensate its properties for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|This {{proof-of-concept}} {{research was}} performed to explore the feasibility of using real-world braking data from commercial motor vehicles to make a diagnosis of brake condition {{similar to that of}} the performance-based brake tester (PBBT). This was done by determining the relationship between pressure and brake force (P-BF), compensating for the gross vehicle weight (GVW). The nature of this P-BF relationship (e. g., low braking force for a given <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure) may indicate brake system problems. In order to determine the relationship between brake force and <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure, a few key parameters of duty cycle information were collected. Because braking events are often brief, spanning only a few seconds, a sample rate of 10 Hz was needed. The algorithm under development required <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure and speed (from which deceleration was calculated). Accurate weight estimation was also needed to properly derive the braking force from the deceleration. In order to ensure that braking force was the predominant factor in deceleration for the segments of data used in analysis, the data was screened for grade as well. Also, the analysis needed to be based on pressures above the crack pressure. The crack pressure is the pressure below which the individual brakes are not applied due the nature of the mechanical system. This value, which may vary somewhat from one wheel end to another, is approximately 10 psi. Therefore, only pressures 15 psi and above were used in the analysis. The Department of Energy s Medium Truck Duty Cycle research has indicated that under the real-world circumstances of the test vehicle brake pressures of up to approximately 30 psi can be expected. Several different types of data were collected during the testing task of this project. Constant-pressure stopping tests were conducted at several combinations of <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure (15, 20, 25, and 30 psi), load conditions (moderately and fully laden), and speeds (20 and 30 mph). Data was collected at 10 Hz. Standard and stepped-pressure performance-based brake tests with brake pressure transducers were performed for each loading condition. The stepped-pressure test included the constant-pressure intervals of <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> at 15, 20, 25, and 30 psi. The PBBT data files included 10 Hz streaming data collected during the testing of each axle. Two weeks of real-world duty cycle (driving and braking) data was also collected at 10 Hz. Initial analysis of the data revealed that the data collected in the field (i. e., day-to-day operations) provided the same information as that obtained from the controlled tests. Analysis of the data collected revealed a strong linear relationship between <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressure and deceleration for given GVWs. As anticipated, initial speed was not found to be a significant factor in the deceleration-pressure relationship, unlike GVW. The positive results obtained from this proof of concept test point to the need for further research to expand this concept. A second phase should include testing over a wider range of speeds and include medium <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> pressures in addition to the low pressures tested in this research. Testing on multiple vehicles would also be of value. This future phase should involve testing to determine how degradation of braking performance affects the pressure-deceleration relationship...|$|R
