30|$|In summary, {{this letter}} {{presents}} an AFM-based nanomachining method to fabricate nanochannels with ladder nanostructure at the bottom. The ladder nanostructures {{can be obtained}} by continuous scanning of the AFM tip according to the matching relation of the velocities of the <b>tip</b> <b>feeding</b> and the precision stage moving. With the high-precision stage moving in the same direction with the <b>tip</b> <b>feeding</b> velocity, the <b>tip</b> <b>feed</b> can hardly reach as large as the value to ensure the cutting state playing a main role in the scratching test. Simultaneously, in this condition, when the stage moving velocity is larger than the <b>tip</b> <b>feeding</b> velocity, the nanochannel cannot be obtained due to extremely small attack angle in the machining process and the materials cannot be effectively removed. On the contrary, when the stage moves opposite to the feeding direction, an appropriate feed value can be easily achieved. Moreover, the edge of the tip {{plays an important role in}} the scratching tests. The materials are mainly removed by the cutting state in this condition resulting in good surface quality. The perfect nanochannel with ladder nanostructure at the bottom can be obtained under this condition. Moreover, a large scale of the length of 500  μm and the width of 10  μm of such kind of nanochannel is machined successfully using this novel method.|$|R

30|$|The AFM is {{controlled}} to scan with a setting scan size regularly. As shown in Figure  1 c, the AFM tip {{moves from the}} initial position (denoted by 1) to the end position (denoted by 2) to achieve one scanning cycle. After completing one scan, the AFM tip returns to the initial position (denoted by 1) to start another new scan operation. This process is repeated until the machining process is finished. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure  1 a, the X direction high-precision stage moves at a low velocity (V stage) along the slow-scanning axis of the tip continuously. Two conditions can be generated: the stage moves {{in the same direction}} with the <b>tip</b> <b>feeding</b> velocity (V tip); the stage moves in the opposite direction to the <b>tip</b> <b>feeding</b> velocity (V <b>tip).</b> The scan size of AFM and the displacement moved by the high-precision stage are to control the width and the length of the nanochannel, respectively. Meanwhile, the dimension and the structure of the ladder machined {{at the bottom of the}} nanochannel are determined by the matching relationship between V tip and V stage, which will be described in detail in the following sections.|$|R

50|$|The {{nematode}} feeds as an ectoparasite, {{most often}} {{at the site of}} cell division and elongation of the root (Huang and Becker, 1997). The long stylet allows the nematode to feed on the inner cortex and endodermis. The <b>feeding</b> at root <b>tips</b> causes root abbreviation and stunting (Crow and Han, 2005). In corn roots swelling at root tips may occur due to repeated attempts by the plant to produce new root branches. In cotton the feeding may cause lesions which eventually cause root girdling.|$|R
40|$|Virtual workspaces {{make it more}} {{difficult}} to maintain a sense of awareness about who else is present in the workspace, where they are operating, and what they are doing. In a physical workspace, people use peripheral vision, auditory cues, and quick glances to keep track of what goes on around them. In a groupware system, the visual field is greatly reduced, and many of our sensory perception for gathering information are unfit since the required information may be absent from the display. Groupware systems like BSCW resolve this problem by offering a variety of awareness features notifying users actions. Workflow management enhancements on top of BSCW additionally need application specific awareness. In this paper we try to discuss the problem of an overwhelming offer of awareness information, such as activity icons, notifications, RSS <b>feeds,</b> tool <b>tips,</b> etc, and how to tailor the goupware interface to the very different user demands...|$|R

40|$|Microtubules {{attached}} to the pellicle at the tips of tentacles pivot through about 140 ° on these attachments, splay apart, and bend along their longitudinal axes when feeding occurs. The tubules could be bending in response to pellicular contractions; active bending, sliding, or contraction of the tubules may not be involved. Intertubule links apparently prevent tubules from splaying apart at certain levels. These links are probably under tension during feeding. They stretch; they sometimes become half as thick and eight times {{as long as they}} are before feeding. Often, tubules joined together by these links also change in shape; they become slightly flattened and elliptical in cross section. Cytoplasm from the ciliate Tetrahymena is drawn down a feeding tentacle inside an invagination of the Tokophrya cell membrane from the tentacle tip. The positions of arm-bearing microtubules around such invaginations indicate that arms are involved in moving invaginations along. The edges of the perforated Tetrahymena cell membrane are "sealed" to the cell membrane of Tokophrya around each <b>feeding</b> tentacle <b>tip...</b>|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on {{a number}} of large plants in the grass family Poaceae; these include oats (Avena sativa), {{citronella}} grass (Cymbopogon winterianus), Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), Java grass (Cyperus rotundus), jungle rice (Echinochloa colona), barley (Hordeum vulgare), rice (Oryza sativa), millet (Panicum), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea mays). Young larvae eat small holes in the leaves, particularly the leaf sheaths. As they grow, the larvae <b>feed</b> on the <b>tips</b> of the shoots, killing the growing points, and later still, they bore into the stems, creating galleries and producing frass which drops from the holes. The stems become brittle and the dead hearts of the plants are characteristic of this pest.|$|R

50|$|If the {{electrical}} field is sufficiently high, the individual currents from multitudes of streamers combine {{to create a}} hot, highly conductive path that projects from the electrode, going some distance into the gap. The projecting channel of hot plasma is called a leader, and it can have an electrical conductivity approaching that of an electric arc. The leader effectively projects {{the electrical}} field from the nearby electrode further into the gap, similar to introducing a short length of wire into the gap. The tip of the conductive leader now forms a new region from which streamers can entend even further into the gap. As new streamer discharges <b>feed</b> the <b>tip</b> of the leader, the streamer currents help to keep the leader hot and conductive. Under sufficiently high voltages, the leader will continue to extend itself further into the gap, doing so {{in a series of}} jumps until the entire gap has been bridged. Although leaders are most often associated with the initial formative stages of a lightning stroke, they are characteristic of the development of all long sparks. In the case of a lightning leader, each extension (called a step leader) is typically 10 - 50 meters in length. The branching, visible blue-white discharges from a Tesla Coil are also examples of leaders.|$|R

If a cone is ripe but closed, the pinyon jay removes it to a place where it can be held open with the bird's feet. Then the bird hammers the cone open with its bill. Pinyon jays can differentiate between filled and empty seeds by a combination of color, weight, and sound produced by clicking seeds with their bills. Pinyon jays can hold up to 43 ponderosa pine seeds [...] and 56 pinyon seeds in their expandable esophagus.|$|R
