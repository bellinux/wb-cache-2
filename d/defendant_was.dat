5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Proof of {{specific}} intent to endanger life is unnecessary {{on a charge}} of attempting this offence. In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), {{on a charge of}} attempted aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{against the}} <b>defendants</b> <b>was</b> mainly circumstantial. Nonetheless, twenty-four of the twenty-six <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{sentenced to death}} by hanging on 18 January 1911, and the {{remaining}} two <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to 8 years and 11 years respectively for violation of explosives ordinances.|$|R
50|$|In November-December 1915, most <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{released}} from custody on bail. A trial {{took place on}} 1 April 1916 and the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> acquitted.|$|R
2500|$|... (a) A <b>{{defendant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{guilty of}} a Class B1 felony if the defendant engages in vaginal intercourse or a sexual act with another person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old and the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> at least six years older than the person, except when the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> lawfully married to the person.|$|R
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's Bench to gain {{jurisdiction}} over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of the insanity defence; where it is claimed that the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> insane {{at the time that}} he committed the crime, and where it is claimed that he was insane at the time of the trial and thus unable to effectively defend himself. The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
50|$|Gender {{discrimination}} {{also helps}} explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> sentenced to death and other female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> sentenced to lesser punishments. Phillip Barron argues that female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.|$|R
5000|$|... (a) A <b>{{defendant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{guilty of}} a Class B1 felony if the defendant engages in vaginal intercourse or a sexual act with another person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old and the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> at least six years older than the person, except when the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> lawfully married to the person.|$|R

5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex {{exploited}} the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior {{to the introduction}} of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill of arrest. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.|$|E

50|$|A {{federal grand}} jury in Baltimore has charged 22 {{defendants}} with conspiracy {{to participate in a}} violent racketeering enterprise. All but one <b>defendant</b> <b>are</b> also charged with conspiring to distribute drugs.

40|$|This study compares final {{sentencing}} decisions {{ordered by}} judges to {{federal and state}} sentencing guidelines for protective order violations. The authors reviewed violations that were pled before the largest district court in Utah and found that {{in the majority of}} cases, <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> not sentenced in accordance with federal and state guidelines. Although state guidelines mandate defendants who violate a protective order to attend a batterer intervention program, less than one fourth of <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> sentenced to attend such programs. Fewer than half of the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> arrested and incarcerated, as opposed to the 100 % mandated by state sentencing guidelines. Federal guidelines mandate that all <b>defendants</b> <b>be</b> ordered to surrender firearms, but only six <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> given that order.

25|$|In general, if a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> found incompetent {{to proceed}} to trial, the {{criminal}} proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where the charges are petty, the charges are often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which the charges are nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|R
