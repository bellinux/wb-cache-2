2500|$|The WABCO N-Type coupler {{was first}} {{developed}} for the prototype Pittsburgh Skybus system with the initial model N-1 as applied only to the three Skybus cars. The updated model N-2 with a larger [...] gathering range was first applied to the new [...] "Airporter" [...] rapid transit cars on the Cleveland Rapid Transit line. The model N-2 used lightweight <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> slung below the center sill, {{to allow for the}} wide swings required to go around sharp curves. This made the N-2 unsuitable for main line railroad use so an updated version N-2-A was developed for that market. The first of these were fitted in 1968 to the UAC TurboTrain with 228 electrical contacts and the Budd Metropolitan EMU with 138 contacts. Starting in the 1970s the N-2-A was fitted to the entire SEPTA Silverliner family of MU's, the NJT Arrow series of MU's and the Metro-North/Long Island Rail Road M series of MU railcars. The N-2 was also used by the PATCO Speedline, but was replaced due to issues with the electrical contacts. Later WABCO would create a new model N-3 for the BART system with a [...] gathering range which required a rectangular funnel.|$|E

30|$|To {{study the}} curving {{performance}} of trains, 1 D and 3 D dynamic models of trains were built using numerical methods. The 1 D model {{was composed of}} 210 simple wagons, each allowed only longitudinal motion; whereas the 3 D model included three complicated wagons for which longitudinal, lateral, and vertical degrees of freedom were considered. Combined with the calculated results from the 1 D model under braking conditions, the behavior of <b>draft</b> <b>gears</b> and brake shoes {{were added to the}} 3 D model. The assessment of the curving performance of trains was focused on making comparisons between idling and braking conditions. The results indicated the following: when a train brakes on a curved track, the wheel-rail lateral force and derailment factor are greater than under idling conditions. Because the yawing movement of the wheelset is limited by brake shoes, the zone of wheel contact along the wheel tread is wider than under idling conditions. Furthermore, as the curvature becomes tighter, the traction ratio shows a nonlinear increasing trend, whether under idling or braking conditions. By increasing the brake shoe pressure, train steering becomes more difficult.|$|R
5000|$|Heart’s Delight Farm, {{the land}} that would become Miner Institute, was {{developed}} by William Henry Miner on his family homestead of 144 acres, beginning in 1903. Miner became a wealthy railroad industrialist as the inventor of railcar <b>draft</b> <b>gears.</b> After becoming a successful entrepreneur in Chicago he returned to Chazy. [...] He focused on farming and philanthropy, founding the Chazy Central Rural School, Physician's Hospital (now CVPH Medical Center) and expanding Heart’s Delight Farm into all areas of agricultural production. Miner also oversaw construction of hydroelectric dams and powerhouses throughout Chazy and Altona. The largest dam, finished in 1915, cost one million dollars and held one billion gallons of water. It supplied power to the area for seven years until equipment failure forced its closing. [...] Between 1910 and 1920 Miner purchased over 5,000 acres of land. At peak size the farm had 4,000 acres of tillable land, 2,000 acres of pasture and 6,000 acres of woodland. Fruits, vegetables, beef and dairy cattle, mules, sheep, pigs, chickens, turkeys, pheasants and brook trout were raised on the farm. In addition to the 800 regularly employed workers Miner hired around 100 families to camp at Flat Rock and pick berries. At the height of production Miner was shipping 16,000 quarts of berries a day to major metropolitan areas.Heart’s Delight food products were sold nationwide. The farm’s 800 workers at that time worked draft horses, purebred horses and the farm had its own dairy, box factory, ice house, natatorium, greenhouses and gristmill. Miner also built a 20-bedroom guesthouse and an entertainment center named Harmony Hall, which included an auditorium, complete with a stage large enough for 300 people. Miner’s will established the school and farm, The William H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{efficient}} and reliable gearing mechanism is governed, among other factors, by {{its ability to}} withstand the frictional contact condition and high bending stresses experienced at the tooth root. One of the major impediments facing designers is the effective <b>drafting</b> of <b>gears</b> to required configuration. For involutes spur gears, the geometry is tedious and time-consuming; and the geometric complexity increases with helical, bevel and worm gears. This study presents a model developed by utilizing the integration of VBA technology built in AutoCAD for the <b>drafting</b> of spur <b>gear</b> to standard configuration. The design was based on full-depth involute gears of pressure angles 14 °, 20 °, and 25 °; with module ranging between 0. 3 and 25 mm, and number of teeth varying between 12 and 60. The algorithm employed the conventional manual drafting techniques by navigating the IDE of VBA with AutoCAD objects, properties, methods, events, and application of errors handling techniques that will ensure smooth running of the model. The model was tested by physically comparing gear tooth template of the automated and manual techniques for three cases of 14 -tooth spur gears with pressure angles 20 ° and modules 6, 8, and 10; and gave a good representation of the tested cases. The model was implemented for simulation of cases of varying modules and varying number of teeth to investigate the significance of module and pressure angle on the gear structure and tooth profile. The model’s flexibility for simulation makes it a virtual prototyping tool that can enhance design, analysis and also makes it a veritable educational tool...|$|R
40|$|Car coupler {{forces have}} a {{significant}} effect on the longitudinal train dynamics and stability. Because the coupler inertia is relatively small in comparison with the car inertia; the high stiffness associated with the coupler components can lead to high frequencies that adversely impact the computational efficiency of train models. The objective of this investigation is to study the effect of the coupler inertia on the train dynamics and on the computational efficiency as measured by the simulation time. To this end, two different models are developed for the car couplers; one model, called the inertial coupler model, includes the effect of the coupler inertia, while in the other model, called the noninertial model, the effect of the coupler inertia is neglected. Both inertial and noninertial coupler models used in this investigation are assumed to have the same coupler kinematic degrees of freedom that capture geometric nonlinearities and allow for the relative translation of the <b>draft</b> <b>gears</b> and end of car cushioning (EOC) devices as well as the relative rotation of the coupler shank. In both models, the coupler kinematic equations are expressed in terms of the car body and coupler coordinates. Both the inertial and noninertial models used in this study lead to a system of differential and algebraic equations that are solved simultaneously in order to determine the coordinates of the cars and couplers. In the case of the inertial model, the coupler kinematics is described using the absolute Cartesian coordinates, and the algebraic equations describe the kinematic constraints imposed on the motion of the system. In this case of the inertial model, the constraint equations are satisfied at the position, velocity, and acceleration levels. In the case of the noninertial model, the equations of motion are developed using the relative joint coordinates, thereby eliminating systematically the algebraic equations that represent the kinematic constraints. A quasistatic force analysis is used to determine a set of coupler nonlinear force algebraic equations for a given car configuration. These nonlinear force algebraic equations are solved iteratively to determine the coupler noninertial coordinates which enter into the formulation of the equations of motion of the train cars. The results obtained in this study showed that the neglect of the coupler inertia eliminates high frequency oscillations that can negatively impact the computational efficiency. The effect of these high frequencies that are attributed to the coupler inertia on the simulation time is examined using frequency and eigenvalue analyses. While the neglect of the coupler inertia leads, as demonstrated in this investigation, to a much more efficient model, the results obtained using the inertial and noninertial coupler models show good agreement, demonstrating that the coupler inertia can be neglected without having an adverse effect on the accuracy of the solutio...|$|R
40|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} (CRAs) bear {{some responsibility for}} the financial crisis that started in 2007 and remains ongoing. This is acknowledged by policymakers, market participants, and by the agencies themselves. It soon became clear that, given {{the depth of the}} crisis, CRAs {{would not be able to}} satisfy policymakers by eliminating flaws in their rating methods and improving corporate governance. Although the CRAs were more or less unregulated before the outbreak of the financial crisis, after the crisis started, politicians became increasingly vocal in demanding regulation. Initially, these demands were confined to a more binding form of self-regulation. But as the crisis progressed, the calls for state regulation grew ever louder. It became apparent after the November 2008 G- 20 summit in Washington that state regulation could no longer be avoided. In Europe, the course had been set in this direction even before then. Since European policymakers saw the crisis as evidence that the Anglo-Saxon approach to the financial markets had failed, they believed they were now strongly placed to have a decisive influence on shaping a new international financial order. It is remarkable to note the shift in European policy from a self-regulatory approach, which was comparatively liberal in international terms, to quite rigorous state regulation of CRAs. Both the European Commission and the European Parliament drew up far-reaching plans. Although European policymakers knew that only globally consistent regulation would be appropriate for a new world financial order, their initial <b>draft</b> legislation was <b>geared</b> more toward stand-alone European regulation. While the final version of the European Union Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies focuses firmly on the European arena, the key point for all market participants is that this is unlikely to have an adverse effect on the global ratings market. It must nevertheless be recognized that the scope of the selected regulatory approach is extremely narrow. Certainly, it has the potential to improve the corporate governance of CRAs and prevent conflicts of interests. But it can do nothing to address the repeated calls for greater competition or for CRAs to be made liable for their ratings. credit {{rating agencies}}, financial crisis, financial regulation, European Regulation...|$|R

50|$|Slack action {{creates a}} danger of {{accident}} as {{the length of a}} train increases. This is particularly the case when a train stops in a siding and is more or less compressed. Then the driver will release the brake while standing, while the locomotive direct brake applied and the train will stretch backwards and will possibly foul the switch/points behind the train. There have been very serious incidents with this effect. Slack action also can lead to severe longitudinal forces in a train that can result in a divided train. While accidents from slack action do occur in the operation of passenger trains, they are not of sufficient severity to cause serious injury or damage, regardless of train length. The <b>draft</b> <b>gear</b> of modern couplers is designed to reduce slack action over older technology, such as link and pin connections.|$|E

If the cars do not incorporate a continuous center sill extending {{the entire length of the}} car, the two draft sills at each end are referred to as stub sills, and the tank carries draft forces between couplers. In this case, reinforcing bars may be extended underneath the tank between the draft sills. Body bolsters and their associated body bolster pads centered above the railcar trucks support the tank and protect it against lateral forces. The draft sill center plate serves as the attachment point between the tank car body and the truck assembly. (See schematic cutaway at right.) ...|$|E
