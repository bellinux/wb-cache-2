60|$|Me and Buck hurries {{down to the}} office.

6000|$|Worst of all, {{she listened}} {{to what he said}} in the night. Corp had a habit of talking in his sleep. He was usually taking tickets at such times, and it had been her custom to stop him violently; but now she changed her tactics: she {{encouraged}} him. [...] "I would be lying in my bed," [...] he said to Tommy, [...] "dreaming that a man had fallen into the Slugs, and instead o' trying to save him I cried out, 'Tickets there, all tickets ready,' and first he <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> a glove and neist he <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> a boot and havers o' that kind sich as onybody dreams.

6000|$|... "He did; and Aunt scolds me {{from morning}} till night, because I won't accept the fine {{establishment}} he offers me. That's what I was sent here for!

60|$|She <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> {{the paper}} {{which she had}} taken from the lawyer's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God, I ain't {{really his}} wife! My {{husband is a}} fine man--Mr. Kloh--Dlorus Kloh, my name is. Mr. Kloh's got a fine job with the mill, at North Yakima. Oh, I was a fool! This gambler Pinky Parrott, he comes along with his elegant ways, and he <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> out a swell line of gab, and I ups and leaves poor Kloh, and the kid, and the nicest kid---- Say, please, could you folks take me {{wherever}} you're going? Maybe I could get a job again--used to was a good waitress, and I ain't going to wait here any longer for that lying, cheating, mean-talking----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes; but I don't see {{any chance}} of that being found out. A gent comes to me at a spot we have settled on, say on the road halfway between Pitsea and Stanford; he <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> a box, {{sometimes}} two; I puts them {{on one of the}} horses, and rides over here with them; then I stows them away in that secret place off the store, where there aint a shadow of a chance of the sharpest-eyed coastguardsman ever finding them. They would be too delighted to light on the spirits and bacca to think of digging up the floor underneath. There they lie, till I take them down to the Marden. They put them into the eel tank, and next morning off she sails." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we got there, and I breezed up to {{the desk}} and said to the clerk, 'Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?' Saaaay! You'd 'a' thought I'd sold him a second, or asked him to work on Yom Kippur! He <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> the cold-boiled stare and yaps, 'I dunno, friend, I'll see,' and he ducks behind the rigamajig they {{keep track of the}} rooms on. Well, I guess he called up the Credit Association and the American Security League to see if I was all right--he {{certainly}} took long enough--or maybe he just went to sleep; but finally he comes out and looks at me like it hurts him, and croaks, 'I think I can let you have a room with bath.' 'Well, that's awful nice of you--sorry to trouble you--how much 'll it set me back?' I says, real sweet. 'It'll cost you seven bucks a day, friend,' he says.|$|E

A man who's seen Injin fightin' don't go much on this here West Point fightin' by rule-of-three--but that ain't here or there! Well, I'd bin out a-scoutin'--just to help the boys along, and I was sittin' in my wagon about daybreak, when along comes a brigadier-general, and he looks into the wagon flap. I oughter to tell you first, gentlemen, that every minit he was expecting an attack--but he didn't let on a hint of it to me. 'How are you, Jim?' said he. 'How are you, general?' said I. 'Would you mind lendin' me your coat and hat?' says he. 'I've got a little game here with our pickets, and I don't want to be recognized.' 'Anything to oblige, general,' said I, and with that I strips off my coat and hat, and he peels and puts them on. 'Nearly the same figure, Jim,' he says, lookin' at me, 'suppose you try on my things and see.' With that he <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> his coat--full uniform, by G-d!--with the little gold cords and laces and the epaulettes with a star, and I puts it on--quite innocent-like. And then he says, handin' me his sword and belt, 'Same inches round the waist, I reckon,' and I puts that on too. 'You may as well keep 'em on till I come back,' says he, 'for it's mighty damp and malarious at this time around the swamp.' And with that he lights out. Well, gentlemen, I hadn't sat there five minutes before Bang! bang! rattle! rattle! kershiz! and I hears a yell. I steps out of the wagon; everything's quite dark, but the rattle goes on. Then along trots an orderly, leadin' a horse. 'Mount, general,' he says, 'we're attacked--the rear-guard's on us!'" ...|$|E
