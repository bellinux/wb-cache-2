5000|$|Kneading can be {{performed}} by hand (the traditional way), with a mixer equipped with a dough hook, or with a bread machine. In hand kneading, the dough is put on a <b>floured</b> <b>surface,</b> pressed and stretched {{with the heel of}} the hand, folded over, and rotated through 90° repeatedly. This process continues until the dough is elastic and smooth. The dough can then be allowed to rise or [...] "prove".|$|E
50|$|The {{dough is}} allowed to rise, covered, for 12 to 18 hours until doubled in size and covered with bubbles, then scraped onto a <b>floured</b> <b>surface,</b> given a few folds, shaped, then allowed to rise, covered, for another hour or two. It is then dropped in a pot that has been {{preheated}} in an oven at 230 C. The bread is baked in the covered pot for 30 minutes and, with the lid removed, for another 15 to 30 minutes until the crust is a deep brown, then removed from the pot and allowed to cool for an hour.|$|E
50|$|The biscuit maker {{measures}} and forms the dough. A handful of dough approximately 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter is {{pulled from the}} whole. This is formed by turning {{the edges of the}} dough-ball down and tucking them {{into the middle of the}} bottom of the ball. If the ball feels sticky, the biskit maker adds a dusting of flour. A ball is formed which has been pulled smooth on top and has a dimple on the bottom. The ball is then placed on the <b>floured</b> <b>surface</b> — dimple down. The biscuit maker should have one or two of these finished balls ready so that they have a minute or two to rest before they are rolled.|$|E
50|$|Next {{the round}} is rolled {{with a special}} steel rolling pin. The pin has deep grooves about 1/8 inch wide and 1/8 inch apart. It is also cut {{laterally}} at 1/8 inch intervals. The pin presses creases into the round {{but because of the}} lateral grooves it does not cut the round into ribbons of dough. This pin is firmly rolled across the round and then again at right angles to the original direction leaving a cross-hatch pattern which seals the top and bottom surfaces of the round to each other. The round may also be slightly sealed to the tabletop. A lefse stick is a thin, flat, wooden stick with straight sides about 2 ft long and 1½ inches wide which has been sanded smooth. This stick is used to slide under the krotekake to release it from the <b>floured</b> <b>surface.</b> It is also used to scrape the table or pin clean of dough.|$|E
50|$|Various {{commercial}} preparations {{of chicken}} and dumplings are available, including canned and frozen {{versions of the}} prepared dish. Frozen raw dumplings, typically very flat strips about 1x4 inches, can be cooked in any broth. The consistency of the prepared dish, whether homemade or purchased, varies from a thin soup to a very thick casserole-like consistency, easily eaten with a fork. Thicker preparations are made by boiling the dumplings longer and/or adding flour or another thickening agent directly to the broth. Flour tortillas or canned biscuits, rolled thin on a <b>floured</b> <b>surface,</b> cut into strips, are a quick and easy substitute for homemade dough. Butter may {{be added to the}} recipe for added richness.Since chicken meat would become dry and tough if it is boiled long enough to cook the dumplings and thicken the broth, the chicken or parts are removed from the broth before adding the dumplings. While the dumplings are cooking, the meat is separated from the bones. When the dumplings are done and the broth seasoned and thickened, the chicken is returned to the broth. The dish is then ready to be served, but may be kept on low heat so as to not further cook the chicken.|$|E
