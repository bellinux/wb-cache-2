I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E

In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time.

500|$|Upon release, [...] "Take a Bow" [...] {{received}} general acclaim. Taraborrelli {{called it}} a [...] "melancholy and beautifully executed ballad". Author Chris Wade wrote in his book The Music of Madonna that [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was a standout from the album. He complimented Madonna and Babyface's vocals, while calling the music [...] "stunning". He declared {{it as one of}} the singer's [...] "purest songs, totally free of any gimmicks, self consciousness or knowing sexual references; a graceful end to the album." [...] Encyclopedia Madonnica writer Matthew Rettenmund {{called it a}} [...] "sentimental ballad with showbiz theme" [...] while finding similarities in the song to that of [...] "Superstar" [...] by The Carpenters. In his review of Bedtime Stories, Billboards Paul Verna called it a [...] "holiday feast for Top 40, rhythm crossover, and AC". Also from Billboard, Larry Flick gave the single a particularly positive review; [...] "The follow-up to the top five smash 'Secret' [...] is as perfect as top 40 fare gets. This single has a delightful, immediately memorable melody and chorus, engaging romance-novel lyrics and a lead vocal that is both sweet and quietly soulful. A lovely way for [...] to kick out '95". J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun stated that the song, about [...] "innocent romance" [...] has a [...] "gently cascading melody". Peter Calvin from The Advocate praised the lyrical flow of the song, saying that the [...] "effect is truly heartbreaking.

500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout. GameZone's reviewer said [...] "This is a game that harkens back to the good old days of adventure D video-gaming", and IGN said [...] "this feels like an homage to the old school D games of the past". [...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, you roll up a party of four average joes <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> did way back when in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party". [...] Reviewers also appreciated the [...] "Party Conversation System", which allows typically underutilized social skills to be used by the entire party during conversation. [...] GameSpy said [...] "It's a terrific convention in which the game responds not to one but to every member of an adventuring party. [...] have the option to interject some special comment into a conversation that might open up otherwise unavailable avenues". [...] Reviewers were grateful that the time-based, [...] "spirit-eating" [...] gameplay mechanic of Mask of the Betrayer was not included.|$|E

2500|$|The {{songs on}} Dylan's 1975 album Blood on the Tracks have been {{described}} by several of Dylan's biographers and critics as arising from the tension as his marriage to Sara collapsed. The album was recorded soon after the couple's initial separation. Dylan biographers Robert Shelton and Clinton Heylin have cautioned against interpreting the album as naked autobiography, arguing that Blood On The Tracks works on many levels—musical, spiritual, poetic—as well as a personal confession. [...] Dylan himself denied {{at the time of}} the album's release that Blood on the Tracks was autobiographical, but Jakob Dylan has said, [...] "When I'm listening to 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' I'm grooving along <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>you.</b> But when I'm listening to Blood On The Tracks, that's about my parents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodore Decker of the Columbus Dispatch, {{the daily}} {{newspaper}} in Columbus, Ohio, where Cornell {{was due to}} play his next show, noted that Ian Curtis, lead singer of the British post-punk band Joy Division, whom Cornell had said in a 1994 Rolling Stone interview was popular {{with the members of}} Soundgarden, took his life on May 18, 1980, exactly 37 years before Cornell and by the same method. Curtis, known for lyrics that, as Cornell's sometimes had, explored despair and depression, had become legendary as a result after his death, Decker recalled. However, Stephen Morris, one of Curtis's bandmates (who later became New Order) recalled Curtis not as the [...] "brooding rock deity" [...] Decker said he became posthumously but as [...] "an ordinary bloke <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> or me."

2500|$|As {{shown in}} the first legs of the tour, the first four songs are always the same. The concert begins with footage of Brooks' {{silhouette}} while singing the opening lines to [...] "Man Against Machine". He then appears via elevator through {{the floor of the}} stage, pauses, and [...] The bridge and final chorus are omitted and it transitions to [...] "Rodeo", followed by [...] "Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House", and [...] "The Beaches of Cheyenne". Next, depending on the venue, other songs such as [...] "The River", [...] "Two Pina Coladas", [...] "Papa Loved Mama", and [...] "Ain't Goin' Down ('Til the Sun Comes Up)". [...] "Unanswered Prayers" [...] follows, with the audience singing the entire song with little accompaniment from Brooks. Additional songs, including [...] "That Summer", [...] "The Thunder Rolls", and [...] "We Shall Be Free" [...] may follow. Excluding the opening, Brooks only performs one song from Man Against Machine, his new album (either [...] "People Loving People" [...] or [...] "All American Kid"; occasionally [...] "Mom"). When questioned on his lack of new songs in the setlist, he remarked, [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>you...</b> I see the guys I like and I want to hear the old stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Robeson {{was called}} before HUAC after {{he refused to}} sign an {{affidavit}} affirming {{that he was not}} a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, [...] "because my father was a slave and my people died to build , I am going to stay here, and have a part of it <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!" [...] At that hearing, Robeson stated [...] "Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights." [...] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town Hall sold out within an hour, and Wales via the transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1: [...] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another way to sing".|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{there existed}} a {{fluidity}} between all three national orientations, with people changing their allegiance throughout their lives, and until approximately {{the turn of}} the 20th century members of all three groups frequently identified themselves by the ethnonym Ruthenians (Rusyny). Initially the most prominent ideology was Ruthenianism, or Rutenstvo. Its proponents, referred to as [...] "Old Ruthenians", were mainly wealthier or more influential priests and the remnants of the nobility who had not been Polonized, and were quite loyal to the Habsburgs to whom they owed their higher social standing. While emphasizing their separateness from the Poles in terms of religion and background, these people nevertheless maintained an elitist attitude towards the peasantry. They frequently spoke the Polish language among themselves, and tried to promote a version of Church Slavonic with elements of the local Ukrainian vernacular as well as the Russian language as a literary language for western Ukraine [...] This language was never standardized, however. The language actually spoken by the common people was viewed with contempt. Old Ruthenians rejected both Ukrainophilism and Russophilism. [...] The Ukrainian thinker Mykhailo Drahomanov wrote [...] ironically of them, that [...] "you Galician intellectuals really do think of creating some kind of Uniate Paraguay, with some kind of hierarchical bureaucratic aristocracy, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> have created an Austro-Ruthenian literary language!" [...] Old Ruthenianism dominated Galicia's cultural scene until the mid-19th century, when it was supplanted by Russophilia (many of the proponents of old Ruthenianism eventually became Russophiles).|$|E
