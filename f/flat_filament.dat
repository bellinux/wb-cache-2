40|$|Abstract––Mechanical crimp texturising {{technique}} is {{making use of}} differential migration behavior of the constituent filaments during their torsional deformation as well as bending deformation. Types of yarn, yarn fineness, filament fineness, shape factor etc. are the detrimental factors for these extents of deformations. Fully drawn continuous filament yarns with contrasting colours, apart from variation {{in one or more}} contributing factors mentioned above were grouped together for the desired production of fancy yarns. Structure of fancy yarn was analyzed by microscopical examination. The colour analysis of the product yarn was also done on Hunter lab colour measurement instrument Spectra Span 9100. This has permitted in identifying apparent colour of fancy yarn scientifically, which is different than its parent yarn colour. Favorable transformation of cheaper and stronger <b>flat</b> <b>filament</b> feeder yarn structure to favourable crimpy/bulky yarn structure was an added gain of this production process. All the samples were also shown good crimp associated properties. Thus newly designed fancy yarn produced out of <b>flat</b> <b>filament</b> yarn found to be a good option for value addition along with added comfort to apparel textiles as well as home furnishing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a detailed study concerning {{the effects of}} chemicals like sodium hydroxide and environmental conditions such as temperature and time {{on the degradation of}} Poly lactic acid (PLA) as compared to Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The aim is to study the effects of chemical and environmental conditions on the degradation of Poly lactic acids. In view of this, samples of PLA <b>flat</b> <b>filament</b> yarns and partially oriented PET yarns were hydrolysed with two different pH media i. e. neutral pH 7, and alkali pH 12. 0 - 13. 5 to study the physical changes that occurred in the yarn structure. Both the hydrolysed and non-hydrolysed yarns subjected to tensile test, DSC scans and FTIR analysis and the changes and the effects that took place before and after hydrolytic degradation at varied temperatures and times were analysed. The study showed that, at 60 o C and 90 o C hydrolysis yielded significant change in the physical appearance of the sample yarns as well as the structure. It could therefore be concluded that degradation highly occurred in the alkali medium than in the neutral medium when the time and temperatures were increased. This was also testified by the fact that elevated time and temperature aided in degrading the PLA <b>flat</b> <b>filament</b> yarns significantly than that of the partially oriented PET yarns...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAim: The {{purpose of}} the study was the {{characterization}} of a type of rupture occurring on warp-knitted polyester vascular prostheses. Materials and Methods: We studied 20 cases of warp-knitted polyester vascular prostheses that were explanted from humans that showed a longitudinal rupture as a part of a collaborative retrieval program. All the prostheses were immediately fixed in a 10 % formaldehyde solution after their explantation in the operating room. The clinical data of these cases were recorded. The explants were photographed, washed to eliminate the surrounding tissues, and photographed again. The ruptures were characterized with macroscopic examination, optical stereomicroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Results: The mean duration of implantation of the prostheses was 16. 0 ± 3. 3 years (range, 9 - 20. 7 years). The prostheses were Cooley Double Velour (n = 15) and Microvel Double Velour (n = 5). There were 16 aortobifemoral bypass grafts, 1 aorto-biiliac, 1 aorto-aortic, 1 iliofemoral, and 1 axillobifemoral. The longitudinal ruptures occurred on two specific parts of the prostheses: the guide line (6 cases) and the remeshing line (11 cases). In three cases both lines were affected. Scanning electron microscopy showed major degradation of the trilobar filaments of the velour and gradual ruptures of the <b>flat</b> <b>filaments</b> of the remeshing and guide lines. Conclusions: In this study, we have identified a specific mechanism of late (9 - 20 years) longitudinal rupture of knitted polyester prostheses consisting of degradation of the polyester filaments along the remeshing and guide lines that run the length of the graft.  (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 1015 - 21. ...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (TIMS) {{is one of}} the most powerful techniques used to determine, both, the absolute and the relative isotopic abundance of elements. Thermal ionization is efficient for elements which have relatively low or moderate first ionization energies, and with sufficient vapor pressure at the source operating temperature. Although TIMS is a very sensitive technique, sample utilization efficiency is usually limited in conventional ion sources. For example, the traditional <b>flat</b> ribbon-type <b>filament</b> thermal ionization sources commonly have sample utilization efficiency of less than 0. 2 % for uranium. Thus, techniques that enhance the ionization efficiency for TIMS have been widely explored. In the early 1970 s, a new type of thermal ionization source was developed by Beyer et al. and by Johnson et al., in which a refractory metal tube resembling a crucible with a deep cavity was used instead of a filament to evaporate and ionize the samples. The crucible was heated to ionizing temperatures, up to 3000 C, by high energy electron impact from a heated filament surrounding the crucible. In this way, the thermal temperature of the sources and the atom-surface interactions can be significantly increased. Therefore, considerably improving the sample ionization efficiency...|$|R

In first developing the cyclotron, Lawrence chose to ionize the gas by electron bombardment which method is used in the majority of cyclotrons now in existence. A <b>flat</b> spiral <b>filament</b> one-half inch in diameter was mounted in the centre of the cyclotron chamber directly above the diametral gap in the dees and kept at 1000 volts negative with respect to its water cooled shield and the walls. The gas to be ionized, in this case, hydrogen, filled the chamber at a pressure of 10 ^- 4 mm Hg and the pressure of other gases in the chamber was kept below 10 ^- 5 mm Hg. The electrons emitted by the filament were accelerated by the 1000 volt electric field and passed down the vertical lines of force of the cyclotron magnet, ionizing the gas molecules in their paths. The resulting electron and positive ion current amounted to 100 ma. It is difficult to produce,by this means, a large electron current because of the electron space charge about the filament.

40|$|Chaetoceros wighamii Brightwell is a planktonic diatom species {{originally}} described from brackish waters. Since {{its original}} description, the species {{has been reported}} {{in a wide variety of}} habitats, ranging from freshwater to marine. Varying descriptions exist in the taxonomic literature and several taxa have been considered as synonyms, including freshwater species Chaetoceros amanita. In this study we provide morphological and ultrastructural information on a cultured strain isolated from freshwater sample collected in the Lake Vrana (Vransko jezero) in Croatia, in April 2011. The cells form short and robust chains with very narrow apertures, often partially occluded by silica membranes. Other distinctive features observable in light microscopy are the shape and orientation of the setae which are very long, straight and robust, diverging in various directions from the chain axis and the single parietal chloroplast extending from valve to valve. Distinct ultrastructural characteristics are the absence of processes either in intercalary or terminal valves and the ornamentation of the valve face with densely distributed ribs spreading from an irregular eccentric hyaline area without a clearly defi ned annulus. The outer surface of the terminal valve is ornamented with small spines and setae are composed of <b>flat</b> longitudinal <b>filaments</b> interconnected with short bars and ornamented with small spines tightly arranged around the setae. Our description agrees well with that reported for the freshwater morphotypes of C. wighamii (syn. C. amanita) and contributes for a reliable distinction of this intriguing taxon from similar morphotypes. This finding supports the interpretation of Chaetoceros wighamii as a freshwater/brackish species and represents the first report of a Chaetoceros species in lacustrine environment in Croatia and possibly in any Central European habitats...|$|R

40|$|A {{mud volcano}} field was {{recently}} discovered within the Malta Plateau in the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea). Box-core sediments and associated authigenic carbonates {{have been collected}} in water depths of 140 – 170 m from two distinctive sectors of the area, and analyzed for major, trace and rare earth elements, stable isotopes, and mineralogy. Relative homogeneity in the mineralogy and geochemistry of bulk sediments, and 210 Pb activity distributions, argue against an active mud ejection activity. In the Malta Plateau western sector, the sediments show high concentrations of Fe, As, Sb, and Mo, exceeding the background values estimated for the Strait of Sicily. Active fluid seepage {{in this area is}} thought to be responsible for these enrichments and for the formation of authigenic carbonate crusts. Evidence of bacterial involvement in carbonate (mainly aragonite) formation is recorded in the authigenic crusts, which contain <b>flat</b> and spiralled <b>filaments</b> resembling Beggiatoa-like sulphide oxidising bacteria and biofilm-like remains which occur inside the interspaces. Carbonate crusts consistently show extremely negative ? 13 C values (down to ? 49 ‰) that suggest contribution of carbon originating from anaerobic methane oxidation.

30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts <b>flat,</b> continuous synthetic <b>filament</b> yarns into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single filament yarn is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more filaments yarns are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different filament yarns are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R
40|$|SomEm RiNG's ring is {{a special}} form of after-cataract which is formed in the {{following}} ways: In extra-capsular extraction of cataract in which the central portion of the anterior capsule is removed, or in injury of the lens, or in discission operations in which the anterior capsule is torn and the central portion of the lens substance is penetrated and becomes absorbed, a greater part of the capsule sac remains intact. According to Wessely (1910), when {{the central part of}} the anterior capsule is opened up, it then loses its stretching capacity and collapses, forming at first a <b>flat</b> ring. Now <b>filaments</b> of the lens substance frequently remain at the equator of the capsule sac; with this also remain parts of the lens nucleus and subcapsular epithelium. The torn anterior capsule then becomes retracted and adheres to the posterior capsule at the margin, so that the remains of the lens fibres cannot be absorbed and therefore form a ring of folded capsule. The epithelial cells can grow in this ring and, associated with the deposition of hyaline capsular material in the remains of the lens substance, a swollen ring or cushion is formed. This ring, remaining hidden behind the iris and being held in position by the zonule of Zinn, cannot be seen in the ordinary eye. There is also practically no disturbance of vision when the ring hangs in its original position, because the central portion always remains clear. When operative treatment for high myopia was in vogue, such ring formations were not uncommon. The procedure known as Fukala's operation had as its first step the discission of the lens; the swollen lens material formed as the result of discission was then washed out, and in most cases parts of the anterior and posterior capsule with remains of lens fibres and subcapsular epithelium were left behind and formed a swollen ring. This ring in its typical form can also arise after discission of congenital cataract. The name derives from D. W. Soemmering of Mainz who examined a number of eyes of dead persons, who had been operated upon in life for cataract. He dissected these eyes through the equator and in eight cases saw more or less crystal clear, nearly invisible, ring-like substances behind the iris. When the dissected eyes were immersed in spirit, these almost invisible rings became * Received for publication November 11, 1950...|$|R
