40|$|We examine three {{theories}} {{proposed to}} explain the rise in poverty rates and geographically concentrated urban poverty during the 1970 s in American cities. Charles Murray (1984) argued that <b>increased</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> during the 1960 s and 1970 s altered the incentive structure of the poor. The result {{was an increase in}} unemployment, unwed child-bearing, and female-headed families. William J. Wilson (1987) argued that an economic transformation of the urban economy reduced male employment opportunities. The result was a {{reduction in the number of}} males who were able to support a family and a proliferation of female-headed families. Wilson also argued that a black middle class exodus from the ghetto caused a rise in geographically concentrated urban poverty. Massey (1990) argued that changes in the black class structure within a racially segregated environment caused the rise in concentrated urban poverty. When minority unemployment rises the shock is principally absorbed by a few neighborhoods. Thus, Massey argued that racial segregation, not class-specific migration, was the cause of poverty concentration^ This dissertation evaluated each of these hypotheses by estimating structural equations using data from 60 large U. S. metropolitan areas in 1970 and 1980. Among blacks and Hispanics, we found evidence supporting the poverty theories of both Murray and Wilson. High welfare benefits and the structural transformation of the urban economy increased unemployment rates, female-headed families and poverty. Among whites, we found that neither theory explained poverty rates well. For all three groups we found that general economic conditions were the most important determinants of the poverty rate. ^ Turning to the concentration of poverty, we found that middle class out-migration and increasing interclass segregation among blacks were inadequate explanations. Hispanics and Asians experienced higher levels of interclass segregation than blacks and, except for Hispanics in the northeast, did not experience high levels of concentrated poverty. Hispanics in the northeast and blacks everywhere experienced high levels of racial segregation, however, and when racial segregation and rising poverty rates interact, the rise of concentrated urban poverty can be explained. We conclude that racial segregation is the most important determinant of concentrated urban poverty. ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this paper}} is to re-examine the hypothesis that <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> may be responsi-ble for the observed differences in cross- country unemployment rates and test its validity by using panel data from 19 countries over the 1970 - 2000 period. For this purpose, we set up a general equi-librium model encompassing the private and public sectors of the economy, where the government comes to the relief of the unemployed by <b>increasing</b> the <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> per man. From this model, we extract an unemployment rate equation. The results that emerge from the empirical analysis sug-gest that social benefits per man may indeed adversely influence the rate of unemployment in EU- 15. But the results change significantly when the EU member states are classified as high-, low- and average unemployment countries. In particular, we find that, whereas unemployment benefits exert perceptible positive influences in the high and average unemployment sub-groups, their influence in the low unemployment sub-group is nil. This finding, in conjunction with the evi-dence that the unemployment rate is invariant with respect to social benefits in USA and Canada, leads us to the conclusion that some EU countries may have to restructure their welfare systems, so as to reduce <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> in favour of greater labour market flexibility and self-reliance on the part of workers. unemployment rate, <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits,</b> European Union...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{there has}} been a {{spirited}} debate over the impact of the welfare expansion associated with the War on Poverty. Many analysts have maintained that public assistance expansion during this period decreased poverty by raising the incomes of the poor (an income enhancement effect), while others have contended that <b>welfare</b> expansion <b>increased</b> poverty by discouraging the poor from working (a work disincentive effect). There has been considerable empirical research about the historical effect of welfare on poverty, nearly all of which relies on the poverty rate (i. e., the percentage of persons with income less than the “poverty threshold”) as an indicator of the extent of poverty. However, this work has not employed designs that allow researchers to sort out distinct income enhancement and work disincentive effects. We develop a model of poverty rates in the American states that permits estimation of these distinct effects—based on state-level time-series data observed annually for the years 1960 – 90 —and we find that welfare had both effects during our period of analysis. We also calculate the net impact of <b>increases</b> in <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> on the poverty rate—taking into account both work disincentive and income enhancement effects. Our results indicate that this net impact is dependent on three variables: the initial level of cash benefits, wage levels for unskilled workers, and the share of the benefit increase provided through cash rather than in-kind assistance. Because of historical trends in these variables, since the 1970 s welfare spending has become increasingly less effective in reducing the poverty rate. However, the significance of this result for policymakers must be tempered by evidence that flaws in the poverty rate as an indicator of poverty make it so that any finding about the net effect of an <b>increase</b> in <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> on the poverty rate underestimates welfare’s ability to lessen the true extent of poverty.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} financial integration on {{the stability of the}} banking system. Financial integration allows banks in different regions to smooth local liquidity shocks by borrowing and lending on a common interbank market. We show under which conditions financial integration induces banks to reduce their liquidity holdings and to shift their portfolios towards more profitable but less liquid investments. Integration helps to reallocate liquidity when different banks are hit by uncorrelated shocks. However, when a systemic (correlated) shock hits, the total liquid resources in the banking system are lower than in autarky. Therefore, financial integration leads to more stable interbank interest rates in normal times, but to larger interest rate spikes in crises. Similarly, on the real side, financial integration leads to more stable consumption in normal times and to larger consumption drops in crises. These results hold in a setup where financial integration is welfare improving from an ex ante point of view. We also look at the model's implications for financial regulation and show that, in a second-best world, financial integration can <b>increase</b> the <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> of liquidity requirements...|$|R

These women accepted the offer out of desperation without receiving counseling on alternative birth control methods (Fig. 1).

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that, higher <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> in some local jurisdictions {{compared}} to others {{have a great}} impact on welfare migrations. And as a result it leads to a race to the bottom outcome in setting preferred levels of <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> by local jurisdictions. To address this phenomenon most countries introduced welfare reforms. The introduction of the national guideline welfare norm in Norway led to the race to the bottom outcome in setting preferred levels of <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> by local governments. This thesis evaluates the evidence of race to the bottom outcome triggered by the implementation of the national guideline welfare norm. Furthermore it investigates whether local authorities in Norway set their <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> levels based on that of neighboring local authorities. These objectives were accomplished by undertaking a pre- and post-reform evaluation of the <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> levels offered by municipalities in Norway. The study was based on secondary data on <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits.</b> Data on <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> before the reform was derived from the study of Fiva (2009) while the post-reform data was derived from Statistics Norway (SSB) database on <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> norms that different municipalities in Norway offered after the welfare reform was introduced. The main argument was that if many local governments responded by offering <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> levels closer or just equal to the national guideline welfare norm it implies quite significant result of a model with welfare migration. With welfare migration, policymakers of different local authorities are influenced to observe the levels of <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> being offered by neighboring local authorities.
