50|$|As of mid-1996, {{four and}} {{one-half}} {{years after the}} launching of Russia's post-Soviet economic reform, experts found the results promising but mixed. The Russian economy has passed through a long and wrenching depression. Official Russian economic statistics indicate that from 1990 {{to the end of}} 1995, Russian GDP declined by roughly 50%, far greater than the decline that the United States experienced during the Great Depression. (However, alternative estimates by Western neoliberal pro-disregulation analysts described a much less severe decline, taking into account the upward bias of Soviet-era economic data and the <b>downward</b> <b>bias</b> of post-Soviet data. E.g. IMF estimates: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=1992&ED=1999&R1=1&R2=1&CS=3&SS=2&OS=C&DD=0&OUT=1&C=922&S=NGDPRPC-NGDPPC-NGDPDPC-PPPPC&CMP=0&x=41&y=9) Much of the decline in production has occurred in the military-industrial complex and other heavy industries that benefited most from the economic priorities of Soviet planners but have much less robust demand in a free market.|$|E
40|$|Part of the {{folklore}} of capture-recapture experiments is that ignoring {{heterogeneity of}} capture probabilities {{results in a}} <b>downward</b> <b>bias.</b> This {{has been based on}} experience and simulation studies but is often interpreted as being due to individuals with lower capture probabilities. Here estimating equation arguments are used to show that the effect on Horvitz [...] Thompson-type estimators of ignoring heterogeneity in capture-recapture experiments is to introduce a <b>downward</b> <b>bias.</b> The arguments are extended to continuous-time experiments and to an influence function constructed to determine the effect of a small number of individuals with heterogeneous capture probabilities in an otherwise homogeneous population and the influence function is shown to be negative. The <b>downward</b> <b>bias</b> holds even if the small number of heterogeneous individuals have capture probabilities larger than the homogeneous majority, and this is confirmed by simulations.

As difference GMM estimators are strongly <b>downward</b> <b>biased,</b> Blundell and Bond (1998) proposed system GMM estimators to mitigate this issue. Thus, in this research system GMM estimators show more consistent and unbiased results compared with the difference GMM. So, here it placed both results to show that how <b>downward</b> <b>biased</b> difference GMM estimators produce more inflated impact than system GMM estimator. Therefore, in this paper system GMM estimator shows the real impact which can be contributed to the theoretical and policy implication of global current account imbalance.|$|R

40|$|While price-setting models usually suggest {{constant}} {{or increasing}} hazard functions for price changes, empirical studies often find decreasing hazards, possibly due to misspecified or neglected heterogeneity. This paper attempts to disentangle the <b>downward</b> <b>bias</b> into various sources: observed and unobserved heterogeneity {{which can be}} either constant or time-varying. Based on micro data from the Swiss CPI, the paper finds {{that in order to}} resolve the <b>downward</b> <b>bias</b> of the hazard function for price changes, we have to (i) control for time-varying heterogeneity in addition to cross-sectional factors and (ii) exclude temporary price changes such as sales prices from the data set. Among the time-varying factors affecting the probability of price changes, various proxies of firms' marginal costs seem to be key. The empirical findings presented in this paper are consistent with recent menu cost models which stress the role of time-varying heterogeneity and temporary price cuts for price setting. price setting, hazard function, <b>downward</b> <b>bias,</b> heterogeneity, sales prices, state-dependent pricing...|$|E

It also shows that failure {{to account for the}} part-time wage effect leads to a <b>downward</b> <b>biased</b> estimate of labor supply elasticities of interest. Using three different datasets, we show that both work hours and wages drop sharply at ages 62 and 65. The Social Security rules produce strong incentives to reduce work hours at these ages. We present evidence that these sharp drops in work hours cause a drop in wages for men, although we find little evidence for a similar effect among women. Estimates indicate that, holding all else equal, cutting the workweek from 40 to 20 hours results in roughly a 25 percent wage penalty for male workers at these older ages. Given these estimates, the labor supply response to a tax change, for example, is <b>downward</b> <b>biased</b> by about 26 percent. Wages; Social security; Labor supply...|$|R
