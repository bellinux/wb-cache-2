40|$|This {{paper is}} to provide {{quantitative}} data on some critical issues {{in anticipation of the}} forthcoming international negotiations in Denmark on the control of atmospheric CO(2) concentrations. Instead of letting {{only a small number of}} countries dominate a few controversial dialogues about <b>emissions</b> reductions, a comprehensive global system must be established based on <b>emissions</b> allowances for different countries, to realize the long-term goal of controlling global atmospheric CO(2) concentrations. That a system rooted in "cumulative <b>emissions</b> per capita," the best conception of the "common but differentiated responsibilities" principle affirmed by the Kyoto Protocol according to fundamental standards of fairness and justice, was demonstrated. Based on calculations of various countries' cumulative <b>emissions</b> per capita, estimates of their cumulative <b>emissions</b> from 1900 to 2005, and their annual <b>emissions</b> allowances into the future (2006 - 2050), a 470 ppmv atmospheric CO(2) concentration target was set. According to the following four objective indicators. total <b>emissions</b> allowance from 1900 to 2050, actual <b>emissions</b> from 1900 to 2005, <b>emissions</b> levels in 2005, and the average growth rate of <b>emissions</b> from 1996 to 2005 -all countries and regions whose population was more than 300000 in 2005 were divided into four main groups: countries with <b>emissions</b> deficits, countries and regions needing to reduce their gross <b>emissions,</b> countries and regions needing to reduce their <b>emissions</b> growth rates, and countries that can maintain the current <b>emissions</b> growth rates. Based on this proposal, most G 8 countries by 2005 had already expended their 2050 <b>emissions</b> allowances. The accumulated financial value based on <b>emissions</b> has reached more than 5. 5 trillion US dollars (20 dollars per ton of CO(2)). Even if these countries could achieve their ambitious <b>emissions</b> reduction targets in the future, their per capita <b>emissions</b> from 2006 to 2050 would still be much higher than those of developing countries; under such circumstance, these future <b>emissions</b> would create more than 6. 3 trillion US dollars in <b>emissions</b> deficits. Because of their low cumulative <b>emissions</b> per capita, most developing countries fall within one of the latter two groups, which means that they have leeway for making <b>emissions</b> decisions in the future. Although China accounts for more than 30 % of the total global <b>emissions</b> allowance from 2006 to 2050, its total <b>emissions</b> can be controlled within that allowance by no other way than reducing its future <b>emissions</b> growth rates.

5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant <b>emission</b> benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial <b>emission</b> benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, <b>emission</b> benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such as Los Angeles, México City, Santiago, Chile, São Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful <b>emission</b> to electric generation plants located outside the cities.

5|$|The {{observed}} {{relationship between}} the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped. Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present {{a problem with this}} model for compact <b>emission</b> components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism. However, a model of maser <b>emission</b> with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl <b>emission.</b> A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 micrometres are the primary pump for main line maser <b>emission,</b> and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 kelvins.
