The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate the <b>intangible</b> <b>costs</b> of MS, and determine whether these costs increase as disability progresses. We studied 211 consecutive patients with MS who attended our MS unit. Patients mean age was 41. 6 (SD: 10. 7) years, 69 % were female, and their mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 2. 47 (SD: 2. 05). Quality-of-life was measured with the EuroQoL visual analogue scale. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was calculated for each patient. Patients were grouped into five disability stages according to their EDSS, and QALY was compared between patients and a group of healthy controls matched by age and sex. A benchmark value was ascribed to each QALY lost, and the <b>intangible</b> <b>costs</b> per patient-year were calculated as t 0 (EDSS/ 0), t 1100 (EDSS/ 13), t 8250 (EDSS/ 3. 55. 5), t 9900 (EDSS/ 67) and t 11 000 (EDSS / 7. 5).

The riskof fetal anomalies {{can be specified}} using biochemical screening tests such as the triple test.

However, disadvantages of the triple test include the utility loss of pregnant womenwho, following a false-negative test result, do not undergo amnio-centesis and bear a disabled child {{as well as the}} <b>intangible</b> <b>cost</b> of a false-positive triple test. This paper employs a deci-sion-analytic model to reveal the evaluation of this tradeoff, which is implicitly fixed by policy recommendations for a di-rect amniocentesis at maternal age of 35. It then determines the optimal level of cutoff risk for the triple test, and derives comparative static results: the optimal test accuracy de-creases with increasing a-priori risk and increases with a rise in the miscarriage risk and in the woman’s preference for de-tecting an affected fetus as compared to avoiding a miscar-riage of an unaffected fetus. These results are in contrast to current clinical practice, where the cutoff of the triple test usually remains fixed.

40|$|Abstract Background/Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{very costly}} pathology. Total costs of AD result from the sum of direct and {{indirect}} costs. Intangible costs represent an additional burden {{that is difficult to}} quantify. This paper has reviewed the evaluation of the costs of AD and the methodologies to estimate them, and proposes the use of some tools which may be useful in establishing the financial weight of the disease. Method: A systematic literature search was conducted using the Pubmed and Medline databases as a source of published papers. Results: In AD, direct and indirect costs and their sum (total costs) are very high and tend to increase parallel with the evolution of the pathology. The evolution of AD is characterized by the loss of functional autonomy, the onset of behavioral and sleep disorders, and the development of delusions and hallucinations. This requires more frequent medical examinations and hospitalizations resulting in higher direct costs, which become the relevant weight. None of the papers reviewed investigated <b>intangible</b> <b>cost.</b> Conclusion: The calculation of costs of AD is frequently based on cognitive decline and the degree of dependence of patients. The evaluation of intangible costs (psychological pain of the patient and of the unpaid caregivers' and their impaired quality of life) is a missing aspect in all reviewed studies.

The purpose of these studies was to inform policymakers about the real economic burden of risky behaviors and to provide conditions for evidence-based and well-informed decision making in this area. MethodsThe cost-of-illness method was applied to estimate the social cost of substance abuse. The <b>intangible</b> <b>cost</b> {{was not included in}} estimation. A prevalence-based approach was applied to estimate the tangible cost. For the estimation of direct costs, a top-down method was used. Indirect costs were estimated using two methods: the human capital and the friction cost. ResultsIn 2008, the social cost of substance abuse in Russia comprised 677. 2 billion rubles if the friction cost method is applied and 1965. 9 billion rubles if the human capital method is used. The social cost of substance abuse is defined to the greatest extent by alcohol consumption, comprising about 45 % of the economic burden. Illicit drug use comprises about 30 % of the economic burden and tobacco consumption 25 %. ConclusionsThe results of economic studies demonstrated that psychoactive substances impose a considerable economic burden on society.

40|$|Safety is costly, {{but lack}} of safety {{can be even}} more expensive. This {{contribution}} considers the various dimensions of “Economics of Safety”, ranging from safety at work to road safety, terrorism and crime. Economic science helps to understand the role of safety as a (public or private) good which is supplied and demanded under technological and budgetary constraints {{as well as individual}} incentives. However, realized equilibrium levels of safety might be affected by market failure, for instance due to moral hazard problems. The paper highlights the need for regulated safety markets and minimum standards. The level of safety in a society depends on the opportunity costs of non-realized safety levels. For instance, when societal costs of crime are considered exuberant, public pressure will be high and more police would be hired. Thus, measuring costs of lacking safety and willingness-to-pay for security measures are crucial for practical policy and empirical aspects of the economics of safety. This paper presents common approaches found in the literature which distinguish between direct and indirect costs as well as between tangible and intangible costs. An illustrative example is taken from the calculation of societal costs of fatal traffic accidents which is contrasted by the way such costs measures are considered in the health sector and the economics of crime. Approaches are similar but differ in the evaluation of pain, harm and mental illness. Future policy advice would benefit from standardisation of <b>intangible</b> <b>cost</b> measures. ...|$|E

The study aims were to identify key HT related health outcomes and to quantify and monetize the impact on health outcomes attributable to environmental noise-related HT. A reiterative literature review identified key HT related health outcomes and their quantitative links with HT. The health impact of increases in environmental noise above recommended daytime noise levels (55 dB[A]) were quantified in terms of quality adjusted life years and then monetized. A case study evaluated the cost of environmental noise, using published data on health risks and the number of people exposed to various bands of environmental noise levels in the United Kingdom (UK). Three health outcomes were selected based on the strength of evidence linking them with HT and their current impact on society: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke and dementia. In the UK population, an additional 542 cases of HT-related AMI, 788 cases of stroke and 1169 cases of dementia were expected per year due to daytime noise levels ≥ 55 dB(A). The cost of these additional cases was valued at around £ 1. 09 billion, with dementia accounting for 44 %. The methodology is dependent on the availability and quality of published data and the resulting valuations reflect these limitations.

40|$|In {{the current}} paper we study {{a real life}} {{inventory}} problem whose operating conditions match {{to the principles of}} the classical newsvendor model. Applying appropriate tests to the available sample of historical demand data, we get the sufficient statistical evidences to support that daily demand is stationary, uncorrelated, and normally distributed. Given that at the start of each day, the selling price, the purchasing cost per unit, and the salvage value are known, and do not change through the whole period under investigation, we derive exact and asymptotic prediction intervals for the daily maximum expected profit. To evaluate their performance, we derive the analytic form of three accuracy information metrics. The first metric measures the deviation of the estimated probability of no stock-outs during the day from the critical fractile. The other two metrics relate the validity and precision of the two types of prediction interval to the variability of estimates for the ordered quantity. Both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates the importance of implications of the loss of goodwill to the adopted inventory policy. Operating the system at the optimal situation, this <b>intangible</b> <b>cost</b> element determines the probability of no stock-outs during the day, and assesses the precision of prediction intervals. The rising of the loss of goodwill leads to smaller estimates for the daily maximum expected profit and to wider prediction intervals. Finally, in the setting of the real life newsvendor problem, we recommend the asymptotic prediction interval since with samples over 25 observations this type of interval has higher precision and probability to include the daily maximum expected profit almost equal to the nominal confidence level. ...|$|E

A review of related literature was made to reveal the status of the need for the development of a comprehensive method to evaluate possible alternatives. Three techniques were developed in this research effort to estimate the investment costs of a reservoir project, a levee project, and a basin conservation reservoir project in an economic region. The application of the methodologies were illustrated by a case study. The cost of a reservoir project in the case study area determined by the method developed in this investigation was in excellent agreement with the Corps of Engineers' estimate using conventional methods. In general, the dependability of all the three methodologies were considered good for use in order-ofmagnitude estimates. Selected solutions for water resources development problems in the Navasota River watershed were analyzed. The cost of water supply by desalination in the service area of the proposed Millican reservoir was computed following the procedure recommended by the Office of Saline Water. The investment costs of the alternatives were compared. The multipurpose reservoir project for flood control, water supply and recreation was found to be the least costly project.

In 2003 the LIS (with 180, 000 catalog records) was running on a 7 -year old DEC Unix system with unsupported hardware, a CPU with inadequate response time, and full disk drives. Method: Recognizing the need to upgrade the system, the Deputy Directors analyzed several options: 1) combining systems with the main campus libraries; 2) purchasing a new Compaq Alpha server at $ 20, 000; or 3) implementing a Linux-based LIS running on Intel ‘commodity’ hardware. We selected option 3 and, {{at the conclusion of}} the project, became the first library in the United States to implement III LIS software on a Linux server. HSLIC employees in both library services and technology support consulted with III staff throughout the process of configuring the server, updating the III software, and migrating records. Main Results: 1) 	The project successfully upgraded hardware, the operating system, and application software to current III standards. 2) 	There was a significant increase in performance and functionality. 3) 	This implementation was accomplished at 1 / 3 the cost of using a non-Intel server platform. 4) 	The Linux-based Intel system represents significantly decreased hardware capital and maintenance costs. 5) 	There is no longer a need for the library to have in-house DEC Unix expertise, an intangible but significant cost savings. 6) 	Additional <b>intangible</b> <b>cost</b> savings are expected in the future when, in contrast to standard server hardware, the new hardware running Linux can be repurposed after the current system is upgraded. Conclusion: A small to mid-sized library can effectively run a Linux/Intel LIS system at demonstrably lower cost than doing so on proprietary RISC*-based software/hardware. *Reduced Instruction Set Computin...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} general principle that a taxpayer should capitalize an expenditure that produces a benefit lasting beyond the current tax period. Yet rules putting this principle into practice {{are among the most}} controversial in all of federal income taxation. Many argue that a retreat from the general principle is warranted when designing capitalization rules, and even those who argue that capitalization rules ought to be sweeping usually conclude that exceptions are necessary or desirable. For instance, most commentators accept uncritically that expenses incurred to procure certain intangible capital should be expensed, as under current law, without exploring whether expensing of <b>intangibles</b> <b>costs</b> is inevitable, although some have considered the implications of excepting <b>intangibles</b> <b>costs</b> from capitalization. Although the arguments with respect to exceptions to capitalization for tangible assets have received more attention, no consensus view has emerged regarding whether many of the exceptions are desirable as a matter of policy. This Article is a systematic analysis of the arguments in favor of departing from the normative or first-best capitalization rule...|$|R
