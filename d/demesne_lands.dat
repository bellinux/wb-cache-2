5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} abbey began to lease out its land (most {{probably}} {{as a solution}} to their falling income). By 1477 only the <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> in Leicester, Stoughton and Ingarsby remained un-leased, and were directly farmed by the abbey.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{retained}} {{and reinforced}} the manorial system with its division between demesne and peasant lands paid for in agricultural labour. Landowners could {{profit from the}} sales of goods from their <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> and a local lord could also expect to receive income from fines and local customs, whilst more powerful nobles profited from their own regional courts and rights.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the Manners, Etal Castle was managed by the Collingwood family, who {{gradually}} became the castle's hereditary constables, renting the <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> on the estate from the family as well. The castle was heavily involved in the border wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, one step removed from the fortifications along the border itself.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own <b>demesne</b> <b>lands,</b> the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the Black Death. With the shortage of manpower after the Black Death, wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions and diet improved steadily. A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more wheat and rye, and to replace bread in their diet with more meat, had been apparent since before the Black Death, but intensified during this later period. Nonetheless, England's much smaller population needed less food {{and the demand for}} agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult. Revenues from <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> were diminishing as demand remained low and wage costs increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Despite attempts to increase money rents, {{by the end of the}} 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.|$|E

5|$|The {{records of}} the priory and abbey have not survived, but the {{excavations}} {{and the study of}} other documents have produced evidence of how the monastic lands were managed. The principal source of income came from farming. This income was required not only for the building and upkeep of the property, but also for feeding the canons, their guests, and visiting pilgrims. The priory also had an obligation from its foundation to house travellers fording the Mersey. It has been estimated that nearly half of the <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> were used for arable farming. The grain grown on priory lands was ground by a local windmill and by a watermill outside the priory lands. Excavations revealed part of a stone handmill in the area used in the monastic kitchen. In addition to orchards and herb gardens in the moated enclosures, it is likely that beehives were maintained for the production of honey. There is evidence from bone fragments that cattle, sheep, pigs, geese and chickens were reared and consumed, but few bone fragments from deer, rabbits or hares have been discovered. Horseflesh was not eaten. Although few fish bones have been discovered, it is known from documentary evidence that the canons owned a number of local fisheries. The fuel used consisted of wood and charcoal, and turf from marshes over which the priory had rights of turbary (to cut turf).|$|E

5|$|Steps {{were taken}} during David's reign {{to make the}} {{government}} of that part of Scotland he administered more like the government of Anglo-Norman England. New sheriffdoms enabled the King to effectively administer royal <b>demesne</b> <b>land.</b> During his reign, royal sheriffs were established in the king's core personal territories; namely, in rough chronological order, at Roxburgh, Scone, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Stirling and Perth. The Justiciarship too was created in David's reign. Although this institution had Anglo-Norman origins, in Scotland north of the Forth at least, it represented some form of continuity with an older office.|$|R
5000|$|These new villages {{had adopted}} {{an open field}} system in which fields were divided into small strips of land, {{individually}} owned, with crops rotated between the field each year and the local woodlands and other common lands carefully managed. Agricultural land on a manor was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage and cultivate directly, called <b>demesne</b> <b>land,</b> {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants who would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields, or through cash or produce.|$|R
50|$|The parkland {{south of}} Walworth Castle was {{originally}} enclosed <b>demesne</b> <b>land,</b> {{and as such}} there is still evidence of ridge and furrow fields. This field system {{may be associated with}} the lost settlement at North Farm, Walworth; however a possible enclosure has been identified in the park, close by. That means that besides the lost settlement near the castle at North Farm there could have been a second and possibly sequential lost settlement, or the same settlement was scattered or moved. At the southern edge of the park there is evidence of a U−shaped earthwork which may be associated with the possible enclosure.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the properties, the abbey had many important rights and concessions. Pope Alexander III exempted the abbey's <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> from payment of tithes. In 1269 the abbot was given the right to hold an annual fair at Atcham: lasting three days, it {{took place at the}} feast of St Giles, which is 1 September.

Among Banbury's four Medieval mills was {{probably}} a forerunner of Banbury Mill, first referred to by this name in 1695.

2500|$|Estates (shiga), roughly {{similar to}} the English manorial system, were granted {{by the state and}} were hereditary, though revocable. As {{agricultural}} properties they consisted of two kinds: land held by the nobility or monastic institutions (<b>demesne</b> <b>land),</b> and village land (tenement or villein land) held by the central government, though governed by district administrators. <b>Demesne</b> <b>land</b> consisted on average of one half to three quarters of an estate. Villein land belonged to the estates, but tenants normally exercised hereditary usufruct rights in exchange for fulfilling their corvée obligations. Tibetans outside the nobility and the monastic system were classified as serfs, but two types existed and functionally were comparable to tenant farmers. Agricultural serfs, or [...] "small smoke" [...] (düchung) were bound to work on estates as a corvée obligation (ula) but they had title to their own plots, owned private goods, were free to move about outside the periods required for their tribute labour, and free of tax obligations. They could accrue wealth and on occasion became lenders to the estates themselves, and could sue the estate owners: village serfs (tralpa)were bound to their villages but only for tax and corvée purposes, such as road transport duties (ula), and were only obliged to pay taxes. Half of the village serfs were man-lease serfs (mi-bog), meaning that they had purchased their freedom. Estate owners exercised broad rights over attached serfs, and flight or a monastic life was the only venue of relief. Yet no mechanism existed to restore escaped serfs to their estates, and no means to enforce bondage existed, though the estate lord held the right to pursue and forcibly return them to the land.|$|R
25|$|The Augustinian priory of Dunstable {{was founded}} by Henry I about the year 1132, and endowed by him {{at the same time}} with the lordship of the manor and town in which it stood. Tradition says that the same king was also founder of the town, and had caused the forest to be cleared away from the point where Watling Street and the Icknield Way crossed each other, on account of the robbers who infested the highway. However this may be, he {{certainly}} granted to the priory all such liberties and rights in the town of Dunstable as he held in his own <b>demesne</b> <b>lands.</b> His charter was confirmed by Henry II, who also granted to the prior and convent the lordship of Houghton Regis; and before the reign of Richard I a great many of the churches of the neighbourhood had also been granted to the priory by as many as thirteen different benefactors, besides the chapel of Ruxox, in the county of Bedford, with Cublington, North Marston and half Chesham, Buckinghamshire, and Higham Ferrers with half Pattishall, Northamptonshire. Several of these gifts were disputed before the century was out, but most of them were retained by the priory throughout its existence.|$|E
25|$|Lilleshall was not {{immediately}} dissolved but, {{like most of the}} marginal houses, surrendered itself to the king, before being compulsorily suppressed, on 16 October 1538. Henry VIII's agent, William Cavendish arrived on 16 October to take possession of the <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> and the abbey buildings. The abbey community was down to Abbot Robert Watson and ten canons. The gross revenue was found to be about £340 – a little more than in 1538, when the Lilleshall estate itself had been omitted. Watson was given a pension of £50 and the London house or, according to Walcott's transcription of the Court of Augmentations record, the “mansion of Longdon, wyth on acre of grounde ajoynyng to the seid mansion, and competente tymber for the reparacion of the samehouse, and also sufficient fyer woode duryng hys lyfe.” The canons were granted pensions of £5 to £6 each and a small lump sum as a “reward” on leaving – generally 50 shillings. The contents of the abbey and monastic buildings were sold and systematically listed as they were taken away, from liturgical items like altars and plate, to beds and bedding, pots and pans. The livestock, the small store of grain the hay were sold. Altogether, the sale of contents fetched £74 18s., although the bells, substantial amounts of plate and lead roofing remained initially unsold.|$|E
500|$|Noble {{and church}} landowners responded in various ways. They began to invest {{significantly}} less in agriculture and land was increasingly {{taken out of}} production altogether. In some cases entire settlements were abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were lost during this period. Landowners also abandoned the system of direct management of their <b>demesne</b> <b>lands,</b> which had begun back in the 1180s, and turned instead to [...] "farming" [...] out large blocks of land for fixed money rents. Initially, livestock and land were rented out together under [...] "stock and lease" [...] contracts, but this {{was found to be}} increasingly impractical and contracts for farms became centred purely on land. Many of the rights to church parish tithes were also [...] "farmed" [...] out in exchange for fixed rents. This process was encouraged by the trend for tithe revenues being increasing [...] "appropriated" [...] by central church authorities, rather than being used to support local clergy: around 39% of parish tithes had been centralised in this way by 1535. As the major estates transformed, a new economic grouping, the gentry, became evident, many of them benefiting from the opportunities of the farming system. Land distribution remained heavily unequal; estimates suggest that the English nobility owned 20% of English lands, the Church and Crown 33%, the gentry 25%, and the remainder was owned by peasant farmers. Agriculture itself continued to innovate, and the loss of many English oxen to the murrain sickness in the crisis increased the number of horses used to plough fields in the 14th century, a significant improvement on older methods.|$|E
50|$|In the courts, {{the mostly}} {{conservative}} and monarchist judges repeatedly decided {{in favour of}} the royal houses. A Reichsgericht judgment of 18 June 1925, in particular, {{was the cause of}} public resentment. It struck down a law which the USPD-dominated State Convention of Saxe-Gotha had passed on 31 July 1919 for the purpose of the confiscation of all the <b>demesne</b> <b>land</b> of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The judges held this state law to be unconstitutional. They returned all the land and forest to the former ruling house. The total value of the assets returned amounted to 37.2 million gold marks. At the time, the head of the dynastic house was Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, an avowed enemy of the Republic.|$|R
50|$|In 1551 King Edward VI {{granted the}} abbey site and <b>demesne</b> <b>land</b> to Edward Clinton, 9th Baron Clinton (later 1st Earl of Lincoln). After that, {{the site was}} used as a quarry and a farm. The remains survived the Middle Ages, however, the North Gate was {{demolished}} around 1885. Today, only the Curfew Tower and the abbey's footprints and footings remain. The majority of the remains are buried: those remains visible were built in the 20th century to show the abbey's layout, although the original walls of the abbey church stand several feet high in portions. A modern ward of the present borough is named Abbey after the ruin. The ruins sit within a public open space known as Abbey Green.|$|R

After all, Raimund’s sons had {{to be provided for}} as well. According to the instrument issued by Moravian Margrave Charles on 31 May 1343, Raimund`s sons Smil and Czenek were allowed to divide their father’s domain with [...] "Vethow" [...] and [...] "Czornstein" [...] castles.

2500|$|Each county's list {{opened with}} the king's <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> (which had {{possibly}} {{been the subject}} of separate inquiry). It should be borne in mind that under the feudal system the king was the only true [...] "owner" [...] of land in England, under his allodial title. He was thus the ultimate overlord and even the greatest magnate could do no more than [...] "hold" [...] land from him as a tenant (from the Latin verb teneo, [...] "to hold") under one of the various contracts of feudal land tenure. Holdings of Bishops followed, then of the abbeys and religious houses, then of lay tenants-in-chief and lastly the king's serjeants (servientes), and Saxon thegns who had survived the Conquest, all in hierarchical order.|$|E
2500|$|In 1535 {{the clear}} yearly {{value of the}} {{property}} amounted to £128 14s. 10d. Of this sum, over £38 was drawn from rectories. The <b>demesne</b> <b>lands</b> farmed by the prior and convent were worth £20 a year. All the granges, lands, and tenements were let. The Earl of Northumberland unjustly held possession of a wood worth £10 a year. At this time the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII was about to begin. The house was surrendered on 29 September 1538 by the prior and seven canons. The prioress and eleven nuns were included with them in the pension list. Four years later, {{in the hands of the}} crown bailiff, the property brought in £131 16s. 5d., [...] and included the rectories of Alvingham, Cockerington St. Mary, Cockerington St. Leonard, Keddington, Grainthorpe, and Stainton, and granges, lands, and rents in those places, and at Yarborough, Stewton, South Somercotes, Wold Newton, Clee, Great Grimsby, Swinfleet, Flixborough, Normanby, Boston, Rasen, Louth, Lincoln, and elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village of}} Elton, Cambridgeshire is {{representative}} of a medieval open-field manor in England. The manor, whose Lord was an abbot from a nearby monastery, had 13 [...] "hides" [...] of arable land of six virgates each. The acreage of a hide and virgate varied, but at Elton a hide was 144 acre. A virgate was 24 acre. Thus, the total of arable land amounted to 1872 acre. The abbot's <b>demesne</b> <b>land</b> consisted of three hides plus 16 acre of meadow and 3 acre of pasture. The remainder of the land was cultivated by 113 tenants {{who lived in a}} village on the manor. Counting spouses, children, and other dependents, plus landless people the total population resident in the manor village was probably 500 to 600.|$|R
25|$|The English {{economy was}} {{fundamentally}} agricultural, depending on growing {{crops such as}} wheat, barley and oats on an open field system, and husbanding sheep, cattle and pigs. Agricultural land became typically organised around manors, and was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage directly, called <b>demesne</b> <b>land,</b> {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants. These peasants would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce. By the eleventh century, a market economy was flourishing across much of England, while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade. Around 6,000 watermills were built to grind flour, freeing up labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, Dunmurry {{became known}} as one of the many 'linen villages' that were spread across Ulster as many of the local {{factories}} and mills were promoted by local entrepreneurs. It remained very much a village until the late 1920s, when developers became keen to seize the greenfield sites for overspill housing and for industry - a phenomenon which became particularly evident after World War II. The largest expansion of the village in this era came with the advent of the Housing Trust, who, in response to a 1951 order for 1500 units of social housing to be built between Belfast and Lisburn, purchased a large amount of land at Suffolk and former <b>demesne</b> <b>land</b> at Seymour Hill and Conway. One third of these housing units were reserved for residents of Belfast.|$|R
