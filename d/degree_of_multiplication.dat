Let us now consider how the matter would have stood if the uniformity had been known only as an empirical law; if we had not been aware that the sun’s light and the earth’s rotation (or the sun’s motion) were the causes on which the periodical occurrence of daylight depends. We could have extended this empirical law to cases adjacent in time, though not to so great a distance of time as we can now. Having evidence that the effects had remained unaltered and been punctually conjoined for five thousand years, we could infer that the unknown causes on which the conjunction is dependent had existed undiminished and uncounteracted during the same period. The same conclusions, therefore, would follow as in the preceding case, except that we should only know that during five thousand years nothing had occurred to defeat perceptibly this particular effect; while, when we know the causes, we have the additional assurance that during that interval no such change has been noticeable in the causes themselves as by any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> or length of continuance could defeat the effect.|$|E
5000|$|High-velocity {{electrons}} often {{collide with}} neutral atoms inelastically, sometimes ionizing them. In a chain-reaction — or an 'electron avalanche' — additional electrons recently {{separated from their}} positive ions by the strong potential gradient, cause a large cloud of electrons and positive ions to be momentarily generated by just a single initial electron.

In air at STP, free electrons exist for only about 11 nanoseconds before being captured.

50|$|Chaetocnema pulicaria, {{the primary}} vector for P. stewartii, overwinters as adults and begins feeding on corn {{seedlings}} {{early in the}} spring. The bacterium overwinters in the gut of the adult corn flea beetles. Warmer winter temperatures allow for greater beetle survival and in effect, higher populations in the spring. Emerging beetles in the spring transmit the bacteria into corn leaf tissue through feeding. The corn flea beetles wound the leaf and contaminate the wounds with insect frass (excrement), which additionally contains the bacteria. Once the bacteria are inside the plant, they multiply and fill the xylem and intercellular spaces of the leaves. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> is highly dependent on susceptibility of the cultivar. Highly susceptible plants become systemically infected and face symptoms such as stunting, wilting, and death. In less severe cases, a plant may show long and irregularly shaped leaf lesions. Some genotypes are able to greatly restrict pathogenic growth. In such plants, the leaf lesions are short, insignificant, or may even be nonexistent. In certain corn varieties, kernels can be infected later in the growing season after flowering occurs. Although corn kernels can {{be a source of}} inoculum, seed transmission is quite rare.|$|E

40|$|The many {{different}} types and variations of deformities of limbs in animals and man are usually described and grouped from the morphological or genetical point of view. A very few biological experiments have been done {{for the purpose of}} elucidating the causes which produce special types of deformities in the embryo. In an earlier paper (Brandt, 1940) the author has shown that supernumerary limbs such as reduplica-tions and some higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>multiplications</b> can be produced experimentally in the frog embryo by special methods. Contrasting with the group of supernumerary limbs is the group showing stunted growth or even absence of the limb as a whole. On the other hand, there may be absence of parts of a single limb such as phocomelias and stunted growth or abnormal position of the digits. The following experiments are the first which have been published concerning the problem of experimental production of various types of atrophied limbs in the amphibian embryo. MATERIAL AND METHODS The methods of production of atrophied or partly deficient limbs in the embryo are different from those which {{can be applied to the}} adult animal. The removal of parts of aprimordium of the limb or of the whole limb bud in the amphibian embryo is followed by its perfect regeneration. The larva which develops later from such an embryo shows no trace of the operation as a rule, but it was found (Brandt, 1924) that after removal of the limb bud in the embryo newt there was no regeneration of the limb in 6 % of the cases. Implantation of foreign bodies, such as small pieces of coal, wax, or glass, into the primordium of the limb bud is followed either by their elimina-tion in the course of a few hours after the operation or by a large hydrops of the affected area and its adjacent parts which usually causes death of the animal. • The work was aided by a Grant of the Medica...|$|R

For α = 0, the phase model is just the Adler equation, while it becomes the canonical type-I theta model for α = 1. For the subthreshold case, the effect of noise on the oscillating characteristics is investigated by increasing α from 0. A characteristic correlation time τc has a maximum at some optimal noise intensity D ∗, independently of α. However, the phase model exhibits spectrally a coherent or incoherent response to noise, depending {{on the value of}} α. For α = 0, a spectrally coherent response to noise occurs in the Adler equation (i. e., noise-induced peaks appear in the output power spectrum) and is maximized near D ∗. Thus, the Adler equation exhibits a “strong ” coherence resonance (i. e., a maximal correlation occurs along with a spectral coherence resonance). However, as α increases and passes a threshold value α ∗, such a spectrally coherent response ceases because the noise-induced peaks disappear from the output power spectrum for α> α ∗.

Material and methods: A prospective study, which included 46 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 36 healthy persons determined according to the clinical and biochemical criteria, was performed. The oxidative stress was assessed through the level of the advanced oxidation protein products, advanced glycation end-products, fibrinogen, amino acid catabolic products, activity of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase. The determination of the total antioxidant activity of plasma was performed through ABTS and CUPRAC methods. IL- 8 and TNF-α were assessed using analysis kits of BOSTER (USA) producer. Results: Was established high level of the oxidative stress following the assessment of the concentration of the advanced oxidation protein products, advanced glycation end-products, fibrinogen, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, urea and creatinine. High concentration of amino acid catabolic products was attributed to the nephrotoxic properties of the medication.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) to replicate in T-cells and macrophages {{has been shown to}} be influenced by immunomodulatory cytokines; furthermore, HIV infection of these cells can alter the kinetics of cytokine transcription. We found that chronic HIV IIIB infection of myelomonoblastic PLB 985 cells resulted in an altered pattern of type 1 interferon (IFN) transcription. Paradoxically, despite the antiviral effects of IFN, HIV-induced dysregulation of IFN transcription may actually lead to the establishment of a cellular environment that supports a chronic infection. Since HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines which deactivate T-cells and macrophages may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We previously demonstrated the anti-HIV effects of IFN$ alpha$ 2, alone and in a cooperative combination with 3 $ sp prime$-azido- 2 $ sp prime$ 3 $ sp prime$-dideoxythymidine (AZT), in limiting the expression of HIV IIIB in promonocytic U 937 cells. We further tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$ beta$ 1) and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), alone and in combination with AZT. TGF-$ beta$ 1 as a single agent had no effect on the <b>multiplication</b> <b>of</b> HIV IIIB in de novo infected PLB 985 cells; however, co-treatment with TGF-$ beta$ 1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection.

This distinguishes it from previous works where mapping strategies for an individual type <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> operation have been investigated and the type <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> operation {{is assumed to be}} known a priori. A new cost model, independent of device and synthesis tools, for establishing priority among different types <b>of</b> <b>multiplication</b> operations for mapping to on-chip DSP blocks is also proposed. This cost model is used by a proposed analysis and priority ordering based mapping strategy targeted at making efficient use of hard DSP blocks on FPGAs while maximizing the operating frequency of designs. Results show that the proposed methodology could result in designs which were at least 2 × faster in performance than those generated by commercial HLS tool: Vivado-HLS...|$|R
