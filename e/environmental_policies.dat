5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

40|$|A Schumpeterian growth {{model is}} {{developed}} to investigate how <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> affects economic growth when <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> also affects {{the direction of}} technical change. In contrast to previous models, production and pollution abatement technologies are embodied in separate intermediate good types. A set of stylized facts related to pollution emission, <b>environmental</b> <b>policy,</b> and pollution abatement expenditures is presented, and it is shown that the developed model is consistent with these stylized facts. It is shown analytically that a tightening of the <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> unambiguously directs research efforts toward pollution abatement technologies and away from production technologies. This directed technical change reduces economic growth and pollution emission growth. Simulation results indicate that even large <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> reforms have small economic growth effects.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} partial {{equilibrium}} trade model to analyse {{the interaction of}} trade and <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> {{in the context of}} agriculture’s multifunctionality. We formally demonstrate that free trade is suboptimal if no efficient <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> addressing the provision of multifunctional benefits is in place. However, tariff reductions in a large net-importing country reinforce the incentive for that country to introduce <b>environmental</b> <b>policy,</b> though this policy will be strategically distorted to partly substitute for the tariff. Despite its strategic character, this <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> programme will unambiguously enhance global welfare if it is introduced in conjunction with tariff reductions. We conclude that, although the multifunctionality argument may lend some support to the criticism of trade liberalisation, the argument is not solid when trade liberalisation induces the introduction of <b>environmental</b> <b>policy.</b> agricultural trade, agricultural multifunctionality, strategic <b>environmental</b> <b>policy,</b> welfare economics...|$|R
