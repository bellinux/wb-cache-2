Six <b>grape</b> <b>musts,</b> with different nitrogen composition, from cultivars of the ‘Vinhos Verdes’ Region, in Portugal, were used.

Troubles about their isolation and cultivation in laboratory media has been well reported. The viable but not cultivable state seems mainly influenced by environmental stress conditions and current isolation methods allow to access only a small subset of AAB population. Also the handling and preservation of strains isolated from high selective sources is still a hard practice. Among vinegars, traditional balsamic vinegar is made through cooking the <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> in which spontaneous alcoholic fermentation and acetic oxidation take place, then it is aged to be bottled. Cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> is characterized by very low pH and high sugars content. In previous works we observed high selective pressure of cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> on AAB growth and the loss of strains viability under laboratory conditions.

40|$|Aims: To {{characterize}} reference yeast strains {{and identify}} indigenous strains isolated from wine fermentations by PCR methods. Methods and Results: We compared several PCR techniques for yeast identification. We used oligonucleotide primers that are complementary to (i) intron splice sites, (ii) REP and (iii) ERIC elements to produce PCR fingerprints that display specific patterns {{between the different}} yeast species. These three techniques were used to characterize 41 reference yeast strains belonging to 15 different species and to identify 40 indigenous strains isolated <b>from</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and wine fermentations.

However, {{the link between}} phenotype variation and genetic determinism is still difficult to identify, especially in wild populations. Using genome hybridization on DNA microarrays, {{it is now possible}} to identify single-feature polymorphisms among divergent yeast strains. This tool offers the possibility of applying quantitative genetics to wild yeast strains. In this instance, we studied the genetic basis for variations in acetic acid production using progeny derived from two strains <b>from</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> isolates. The trait was quantified during alcoholic fermentation of the two strains and 108 segregants derived from their crossing. A genetic map of 2212 markers was generated using oligonucleotide microarrays, and a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) was mapped with high significance. Further investigations showed that this QTL was due to a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism that targeted the catalytic core of asparaginase type I (ASP 1) and abolished its activity. This QTL was only effective when asparagine was used as a major nitrogen source.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} the influence of variety, clarification type, fermentation tempera-ture, and the addition of selected yeast on wines to obtain dry wines <b>from</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> of Muscatel and Malvasia varieties. An experimental design was tried, based on 74 white wine samples identified through 19 analytical variables and submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and principal component analysis (PCA). The study is carried out with two varieties of white Vitis vinifera grapes (Muscatel and Malvasia) which are used in the production of Spanish white wine. The must was clarified following two different procedures (static decantation and membrane filtration) and later fermented at laboratory scale at three temperatures (15 °C, 18 °C, and 21 °C) and two yeast types (D 47 and K 1 M) were inoculated into the must. Significant differences were found according to grape variety, clarifica-tion, temperature, and yeast type when ANOVA and MANOVA were performed. The application of PCA to the data showed that differences between organic acids and higher alcohols are mainly due to the grape variety and the yeast type used for fermentations.

Results: The results indicate that the fermentative capacity of strains grown in 2 % glucose was similar in all the strains tested.

We have grouped the different products {{on the basis of}} their Protected Geographical Status, ingredients and additives used, as well as the production technology. The consumer perception of the attribute “balsamic” isassociated with a series of common features that clearly discriminates them from other types of vinegars. They are dark, opalescent, shiny, thick and viscous, and the acidic taste is modulated by a variable amount of sugars. The features described are usually achieved in different ways and this make the difference among the balsamic vinegarsand sauces. The key point refers to the fact that different methods, used for the same purpose, can have dramaticallydifferent costs, which then affect the price and quality of the finished product; i. e. the dark colour can be obtained with addition of caramel (E 150 d) or by long aging. The differences on production cost is huge and obvious. The most expensive step in industrial production is aging, and of course this is particularly important for traditional balsamic vinegars. Aging plays a key role in determining many valuable characteristics of balsamic, for example, the dark brown colour belongs from the initial process of must cooking, which triggers a series of non-enzymatic browning reactions that slowly continue over the years. The process of aging in wood barrels increases the specific gravityand viscosity due to the progressive loss of water and theformation of high molecular weight compounds (melanoidins) that modify the rheological properties of the product...|$|E
