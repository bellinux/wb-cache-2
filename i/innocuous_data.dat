We evaluate the performance for three input spaces consisting of the power spectral density, byte probability distribution and sliding-window entropy of the byte sequence in a file.

40|$|Smartphones, {{and other}} mobile {{computing}} devices, are being widely adopted globally as the de-facto personal computing platform. Given {{the amount of}} sensitive information accumulated by these devices, there are serious privacy and security implications for both personal use and enterprise deployment. Confidentiality of data-at-rest can be effectively preserved through storage encryption. All major mobile OSes now incorporate some form of storage encryption. In certain situations, this is inadequate, as users may be coerced into disclosing their decryption keys. In this case, the data must be hidden so that its very existence can be denied. Steganographic techniques and deniable encryption algorithms have been devised to address this specific problem. This dissertation explores the feasibility and efficacy of deniable storage encryption for mobile devices. A feature that allows the user to feign compliance with a coercive adversary, by decrypting plausible and <b>innocuous</b> decoy <b>data,</b> while maintaining the secrecy of their sensitive or contentious hidden data. A deniable storage encryption system, Mobiflage, was designed and implemented for the Android OS, the first such application for mobile devices. Current mobile encryption mechanisms all rely, in some way, on a user secret. Users notoriously choose weak passwords that are easily guessed/cracked. This thesis offers a new password scheme for use with storage encryption. The {{goal is to create}} passwords that are suitably strong for protection of encryption keys, easier to input on mobile devices, and build on memorability research in cognitive psychology for a better user experience than current password guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Access control {{mechanisms}} {{are commonly used}} to provide control over who may access sensitive information. However, malicious users can exploit the correlation among the data and infer sensitive information {{from a series of}} seemingly <b>innocuous</b> <b>data</b> access. In this paper, we proposed a detection system that utilizes both the user’s current query and past query log to determine if the current query answer can infer sensitive information. A semantic inference model (SIM) is constructed based on the data dependency, database schema and semantic relationship among data. After the SIM is instantiated via specific instances, it can then be mapped to a Bayesian network and used for evaluating the inference probability. The decision of answering the current query is based on if any of the sensitive attributes can be inferred with a probability higher than their pre-specified thresholds. This detection system is being extended to the cases of multiple collaborative users based on the query history of all the users and their collaborative levels for specific sensitive information. 1...|$|E
40|$|Malicious {{users can}} exploit the {{correlation}} among data to infer sensitive {{information from a}} series of seemingly <b>innocuous</b> <b>data</b> accesses. Thus, we develop an inference violation detection system to protect sensitive data content. Based on data dependency, database schema and semantic knowledge, we constructed a semantic inference model (SIM) that represents the possible inference channels from any attribute to the pre-assigned sensitive attributes. The SIM is then instantiated to a semantic inference graph (SIG) for query-time inference violation detection. For a single user case, when a user poses a query, the detection system will examine his/her past query log and calculate the probability of inferring sensitive information. The query request will be denied if the inference probability exceeds the pre-specified threshold. For multi-user cases, the users may share their query answers to increase the inference probability. Therefore, we develop a model to evaluate collaborative inference based on the query sequences of collaborators and their task-sensitive collaboration levels. Experimental studies reveal that information authoritativeness and communication fidelity are two key factors that affect the level of achievable collaboration. An example is given to illustrate the use of the proposed technique to prevent multiple collaborative users from deriving sensitive information via inference...|$|E
40|$|India is {{undertaking}} the world’s largest biometric ID card project – Aadhaar, also {{dubbed the}} "the world's biggest mass surveillance project". The government seems unaware, or unconcerned, {{that because of}} an inadequate legal framework for protecting citizens’ privacy this project will have catastrophic consequences. This overzealous project is obtaining demographic and biometric information and being forced upon Indian citizens, with no choice for an individual to opt-out of the system. The Indian government has claimed that setting up Aadhaar would establish a system of protection against wastage and corruption in the dispensation of social benefits. This draconian ID system is linking with every aspect of an individual’s life, from booking train tickets, registering marriages, or seeking scholarships, to mobile phone numbers, bank accounts, and schools and colleges. In many of these cases, it is mandatory. Thus, the government can exert absolute control by cross-referencing all transactions authenticated by or linked with Aadhaar. Indian society and politics {{has gone through a}} tectonic shift and is now in the grip of ‘absolutism’. Amid mounting governmental pressure, more than a billion Indians have signed up for Aadhaar. The aggregation of this data, along with various other data sets interlinked to Aadhaar, will enable the government to trace the movements, social relationships, and interactions of residents so that their private lives are laid bare. Seemingly <b>innocuous,</b> <b>data</b> when collated is capable of profiling residents’ lives. Once such data is in the government’s hands, wide latitude in access and use facilitates government abuse. Indeed, coercive application of Aadhaar creates a potential for mass surveillance, which in turn threatens the privacy of Indian citizens. We argue that this systemic mass invasion of privacy will diminish citizens’ autonomy of decision making: the choice of what to make public or keep private will no longer be theirs. In a high-octane, emotionally charged democracy like India, the fear of backlash will stop individuals from expressing disagreement with the government; they will increasingly self-censor their speech and interactions. Subjecting citizens to greater scrutiny and control will tilt the already imbalanced dynamics between the administration and the citizens, leading to erosion of democracy...|$|E

[33] explores the vulnerability of attackers sniffing sensors on smartphones. TaintDroid [34] modifies the Android system and framework to establish system-wide dynamic taint tracking and analysis for sensitive data including data from sensors. Based on TaintDroid, AppFence [35] substitutes sensitive data demanded by apps with <b>innocuous</b> shadow <b>data</b> to protect users’ privacy, which inspired Sensor Guardian’s Randomization policy. FlaskDroid [36] modifies the Android system to enforce mandatory access control on both Android’s middleware and kernel layers, including on the sensor data. ipShield [6, 37] tries to solve the PIS problem by modifying the Android system and monitoring apps’ access to innocuous sensors. It then uses the monitored information to provide the user with privacy risk assessment. SemaDroid [38] also modifies the Android system to extend its sensor management framework and enforces several fine-grained control policies. Perceptual Assistant (PA) [28] follows ipShield to allow users to customize control policies. It relies on Xposed [39] on rooted Android devices to dynamically hook apps’ related API calls. SSG [40] hooks apps’ sensor-related APIs by modifying the Android system, {{and it needs to}} be installed with root privilege. Compared to these prior works, Sensor Guardian has much improved performance and incurs less overhead during runtime control. And those methods relying on modifying the system may be affected by the problem of Android fragmentation, while Sensor Guardian is not.|$|R

40|$|In the {{superficial}} dorsal horn (SDH) processing of noxious and innocuous stimuli is critically {{dependent on the}} input–output relationship of its component neurones. Such relationships are routinely examined by assessing neuronal responses to somatic current injection or activation of synaptic inputs. A more complete understanding of input–output relationships would be achieved by comparing, in the same neurone, how the two forms of activation contribute to neuronal output. Therefore, we examined how SDH neurones transform depolarizing current injections and synaptic excitation via peripheral cutaneous stimuli (brush and pinch of the hindpaw) into trains of action potentials, in an in vivo preparation of the adult mouse spinal cord. Under whole-cell current clamp recording conditions four action potential discharge patterns were observed during depolarizing current injection: tonic firing neurones (21 / 93) discharged spikes throughout the step; initial bursting neurones (35 / 93) discharged several spikes at step onset; single spiking neurones (16 / 93) discharged one or two spikes at step onset; and delayed firing neurones (21 / 93) discharged spikes delayed from the step onset. Four characteristic profiles were observed in response to application of noxious (pinch) and innocuous (brush) cutaneous stimuli: nociceptive neurones (20 / 37) responded maximally to pinch stimulation; light touch neurones (9 / 37) responded maximally to brush stimulation; subthreshold neurones (4 / 37) exhibited depolarizing responses without firing action potentials; and hyperpolarizing neurones (4 / 37) exhibited a sustained pinch-induced hyperpolarization. Comparisons of current-evoked discharge patterns with peripherally evoked responses indicate SDH neurones expressing {{each of the four}} discharge patterns could receive, and therefore participate in the processing of information concerning, either noxious or <b>innocuous</b> stimuli. These <b>data</b> suggest that a neurone's response to current injection does not necessarily help identify or predict how the same neurone will respond to physiologically or functionally relevant stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Since 1967, when {{it decided}} Katz v. United States, the Supreme Court has tied {{the right to}} be free of {{unwanted}} government scrutiny to the concept of reasonable xpectations of privacy. [1] An evaluation of reasonable expectations depends, among other factors, upon an assessment of the intrusiveness of government action. When making such assessment historically the Court has considered police conduct with clear temporal, geographic, or substantive limits. However, in an era where new technologies permit the storage and compilation of vast amounts of personal data, things are becoming more complicated. A school of thought known as “mosaic theory” has stepped into the void, ringing the alarm that our old tools for assessing the intrusiveness of government conduct potentially undervalue privacy rights. Mosaic theorists advocate a cumulative approach to the evaluation of data collection. Under the theory, searches are “analyzed as a collective sequence of steps rather than as individual steps. ”[2] The approach is based on the recognition that comprehensive aggregation of even seemingly <b>innocuous</b> <b>data</b> reveals greater insight than consideration of each piece of information in isolation. Over time, discrete units of surveillance data can be processed to create a mosaic of habits, relationships, and much more. Consequently, a Fourth Amendment analysis that focuses only on the government’s collection of discrete units of trivial data fails to appreciate the true harm of long-term surveillance—the composite. In the context of location tracking, the Court has previously suggested that the Fourth Amendment may (at some theoretical threshold) be concerned with the accumulated information revealed by surveillance. [3] Similarly, in the Court’s recent decision in United States v. Jones, a majority of concurring justices indicated willingness to explore such an approach. [4] However, in general, the Court has rejected any notion that technological enhancement matters to the constitutional treatment of location tracking. [5] Rather, it has found that such surveillance in public spaces, which does not require physical trespass, is equivalent to a human tail and thus not regulated by the Fourth Amendment. In this way, the Court has avoided quantitative analysis of the amendment’s protections. The Court’s reticence is built on the enticingly direct assertion that objectivity under the mosaic theory is impossible. This is true in large part because there has been no rationale yet offered to objectively distinguish relatively short-term monitoring from its counterpart of greater duration. As Justice Scalia recently observed in Jones: “it remains unexplained why a 4 -week investigation is ‘surely’ too long. ”[6] This article suggests that by combining the lessons of machine learning with the mosaic theory and applying the pairing to the Fourth Amendment we can see the contours of a response. Machine learning makes clear that mosaics can be created. Moreover, there are also important lessons to be learned on when that is the case. Machine learning is the branch of computer science that studies systems that can draw inferences from collections of data, generally by means of mathematical algorithms. In a recent competition called “The Nokia Mobile Data Challenge,”[7] researchers evaluated machine learning’s applicability to GPS and cell phone tower data. From a user’s location history alone, the researchers were able to estimate the user’s gender, marital status, occupation and age. [8] Algorithms developed for the competition were also able to predict a user’s likely future location by observing past location history. The prediction of a user’s future location could be even further improved by using the location data of friends and social contacts. [9] Machine learning of the sort on display during the Nokia competition seeks to harness the data deluge of today’s information society by efficiently organizing data, finding statistical regularities and other patterns in it, and making predictions therefrom. Machine learning algorithms are able to deduce information—including information that has no obvious linkage to the input data—that may otherwise have remained private due to the natural limitations of manual and human-driven investigation. Analysts can “train” machine learning programs using one dataset to find similar characteristics in new datasets. When applied to the digital “bread crumbs” of data generated by people, machine learning algorithms can make targeted personal predictions. The greater the number of data points evaluated, the greater the accuracy of the algorithm’s results. In five parts, this article advances the conclusion that the duration of investigations is relevant to their substantive Fourth Amendment treatment because duration affects the accuracy of the predictions. Though it was previously difficult to explain why an investigation of four weeks was substantively different from an investigation of four hours, we now {{have a better understanding of}} the value of aggregated data when viewed through a machine learning lens. In some situations, predictions of startling accuracy can be generated with remarkably few data points. Furthermore, in other situations accuracy can increase dramatically above certain thresholds. For example, a 2012 study found the ability to deduce ethnicity moved sideways through five weeks of phone data monitoring, jumped sharply to a new plateau at that point, and then increased sharply again after twenty-eight weeks. [10] More remarkably, the accuracy of identification of a target’s significant other improved dramatically after five days’ worth of data inputs. [11] Experiments like these support the notion of a threshold, a point at which it makes sense to draw a Fourth Amendment line. In order to provide an objective basis for distinguishing between law enforcement activities of differing duration the results of machine learning algorithms can be combined with notions of privacy metrics, such as k-anonymity or l-diversity. While reasonable minds may dispute the most suitable minimum accuracy threshold, this article makes the case that the collection of data points allowing predictions that exceed selected thresholds should be deemed unreasonable searches in the absence of a warrant. [12] Moreover, any new rules should take into account not only the data being collected but also the foreseeable improvements in the machine learning technology that will ultimately be brought to bear on it; this includes using future algorithms on older data. In 2001, the Supreme Court asked “what limits there are upon the power of technology to shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy. ”[13] In this piece, we explore an answer and investigate what lessons there are in the power of technology to protect the realm of guaranteed privacy. After all, as technology takes away, it also gives. The objective understanding of data compilation and analysis that is revealed by machine learning provides important Fourth Amendment insights. We should begin to consider these insights more closely. [1] Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring).

In {{view of their}} nano-scale dimensions and high aspect ratio, they should be examined for their potential to cause respiratory toxicity. Here, we evaluated the respiratory biopersistence and lung toxicity of 2 samples of nanometer-long Ge-imogolites. MethodsRats were intra-tracheally instilled with single wall (SW, 70  nm length) or double wall (DW, 62  nm length) Ge-imogolites (0. 02 - 2  mg/rat), {{as well as with}} crocidolite and the hard metal particles WC-Co, as positive controls. The biopersistence of Ge-imogolites and their localization in the lung were assessed by ICP-MS, X-ray fluorescence, absorption spectroscopy and computed micro-tomography. Acute inflammation and genotoxicity (micronuclei in isolated type II pneumocytes) was assessed 3 d post-exposure; chronic inflammation and fibrosis after 2  m. ResultsCytotoxic and inflammatory responses were shown in bronchoalveolar lavage 3 d after instillation with Ge-imogolites. Sixty days after exposure, a persistent dose-dependent inflammation was still observed. Total lung collagen, reflected by hydroxyproline lung content, was increased after SW and DW Ge-imogolites. Histology revealed lung fibre reorganization and accumulation in granulomas with epithelioid cells and foamy macrophages and thickening of the alveolar walls. Overall, the inflammatory and fibrotic responses induced by SW and DW Ge-imogolites were more severe (on a mass dose basis) than those induced by crocidolite. A persistent fraction of Ge-imogolites (15 % of initial dose) was mostly detected as intact structures in rat lungs 2  m after instillation and was localized in fibrotic alveolar areas. In vivo induction of micronuclei was significantly increased 3 d after SW and DW Ge-imogolite instillation at non-inflammatory doses, indicating the contribution of primary genotoxicity. ConclusionsWe showed that nm-long Ge-imogolites persist in the lung and promote genotoxicity, sustained inflammation and fibrosis, indicating that short high aspect ratio nanomaterials should not be considered as <b>innocuous</b> materials. Our <b>data</b> also suggest that Ge-imogolite structure and external surface determine their toxic activity...|$|R
