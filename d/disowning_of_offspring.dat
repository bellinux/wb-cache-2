The impression is given that illness is associated with variation in the sex ratio (proportion male) <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> patients. Two points are worth making: (1) The association depends on {{the timing of the}} illness vis-a-vis the conception <b>of</b> the <b>offspring.</b> In the data of Olsson and Brandt (1982). the sex ratio <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> male non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients is strongly associated with the time of initiation of the disease (before or after age 50) (X 2 = 12. 9.

40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the effects of}} intraspecific variation in offspring size is important from both an ecological and an evolutionary perspective. While the relationship between offspring size and overall offspring performance is key, most studies are restricted to examination of the effects <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> size on early life-history stages only, and too few have examined the effects <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> size throughout the life history. Here, we examine the effects <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> size on post-metamorphic survival, growth, and fecundity under field conditions for the polychaete Janua sp. Larger offspring became larger adults and had higher levels of fecundity than those from smaller offspring, though the effect on fecundity was weaker and more variable over different experimental runs. Adults derived from larger larvae had shorter lifespans than adults derived from smaller larvae. Our results suggest that the maternal effect <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> size can influence the frequently observed trade-off between longevity and fecundity. Future studies should seek to measure the effects <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> size over as much of the life history as possible in order to avoid misestimating the relationship between offspring size and fitness...|$|R
40|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> {{attaining}} {{reproductive age}} {{is an important}} measure of an individual's fitness.

We also studied the effects of the manipulations on growth, survival and reproductive success <b>of</b> the <b>offspring.</b> Potentially confounding effects of varying maternal quality were avoided by cross-fostering. Our results showed that the number <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> alive in the next breeding season was higher in offspring number manipulation groups, despite their smaller body size at weaning. Offspring size manipulation had no effect on offspring growth or survival. Further, the first litter size <b>of</b> female <b>offspring</b> did not differ between treatments.

40|$|There {{has been}} a long-standing {{conceptual}} debate over the legitimacy of assigning components <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> fitness to parents for purposes of evolutionary analysis. The benefits and risks inherent in assigning fitness <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> to parents have been given primarily as verbal arguments and no explicit theoretical analyses have examined quantitatively how the assignment of fitness can affect evolutionary inferences. Using a simple quantitative genetic model, we contrast the conclusions drawn about how selection acts on a maternal character when components <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> fitness (such as early survival) are assigned to parents vs. when they are assigned directly to the individual offspring. We find that there are potential shortcomings of both possible assignments of fitness. In general, whenever there is a genetic correlation between the parental and direct effects on offspring fitness, assigning components <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> fitness to parents yields incorrect dynamical equations and may even lead to incorrect conclusions {{about the direction of}} evolution. Assignment <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> fitness to parents may also produce incorrect estimates of selection whenever environmental variation contributes to variance of the maternal trait. Whereas assignment <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> fitness to the offspring avoids these potential problems, it introduces the possible problem of missing components of kin selection provided by the mother, which may not be detected in selection analyses. There are also certain conditions where either model can be appropriate because assignment <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> fitness to parents may yield the same dynamical equations as assigning offspring fitness directly to offspring. We discuss these implications of the alternative assignments of fitness for modelling, selection analysis and experimentation in evolutionary biology...|$|R

40|$|Parentally biased favouritism' {{occurs when}} the two parents {{differentially}} care for individual <b>offspring</b> or kinds <b>of</b> <b>offspring.</b> Examples in birds include brood division and differential investment by the two parents {{in relation to the}} size or sex <b>of</b> the <b>offspring.</b> This paper uses mathematical models to investigate which ideas can, in theory, explain parentally biased favouritism. One previous explanation is that the parents differ in their cost of reproduction and that the parent who consequently invests least concentrates its care on the more valuable offspring. However, a mathematical model predicts the total care given by each parent and received by each offspring, not how much each parent cares for each offspring, and hence does not explain parentally biased favouritism. Parentally biased favouritism towards particular types <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> can be explained by a difference between the parents in the benefits of caring for a given type <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> or in the effort incurred in providing care to a given type <b>of</b> <b>offspring,</b> but then it is extreme, with {{at least one of the}} parents providing care to only one type <b>of</b> <b>offspring.</b> Parentally biased favouritism towards particular individual offspring (brood division) can be explained by parent-offspring conflict or sexual conflict.

RESULTS: About half of both oocyte and sperm donors expressed an opinion that the number <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> from one donor {{should be limited to}} between one and 10, and many donors reported having no firm opinion.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to assess the long-term consumption of the seeds of Nigella sativa L., also known as black seed and garlic by the female rats on the fecundity and gender ratio of their male and female offspring for two consecutive pregnancies, locomotory behavioural activities <b>of</b> <b>offspring</b> and on some important blood chemistry parameters <b>of</b> the <b>offspring</b> at adolescent age. The dose of black seed oil or garlic oil (0. 8 ml per day) was administered orally and daily through gavage to the females until the weaning age <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> second pregnancy. The offspring (at PD 28 age) were subjected to the locomotory test and subsequently their serum analysis was done to measure the level of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT or AST), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT or ALT), cholesterol (HDLP), triglycerides (TG), and glucose (GLU). It was observed that black seed consumption increased the fecundity (total number <b>of</b> <b>offspring)</b> in both pregnancies. The number <b>of</b> male <b>offspring</b> increased significantly whereas the number <b>of</b> female <b>offspring</b> remained unaffected in both pregnancies. On the contrary, garlic showed {{no change in the}} sex ratio <b>of</b> <b>offspring.</b> Male <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> the mothers consuming black seed oil were comparatively more active than the <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> mothers consuming garlic oil. However, female <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> mothers consuming both black seed and garlic oils were significantly active as compared to the controls. Black seed and garlic oil consumption by the mothers had a lowering effect on the level of TG, GOT, GPT and GLU in the serum <b>of</b> the <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> both pregnancies, whereas no change was observed on the level of serum HDLP.
