40|$|Traversing large {{open spaces}} is a {{challenging}} task for blind cane users, as such spaces are often devoid of tactile fea-tures {{that can be}} followed. Consequently, in such spaces cane users may veer from their intended paths. Wearable de-vices have great potential for assistive applications for users who are blind as they typically feature a camera and sup-port hands and <b>eye</b> <b>free</b> <b>interaction.</b> We present HEADLOCK, a navigation aid for an optical head-mounted display that helps blind users traverse large open spaces by letting them lock onto a salient landmark across the space, such as a door, and then providing audio feedback to guide the user towards the landmark. A user study with 8 blind users eval-uated the usability and effectiveness of two types of audio feedback (sonification and text-to-speech) for guiding a user across an open space to a doorway. Qualitative results are reported, which may inform the design of assistive wearable technology for users who are blind...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study that}} explores the issues of mobile multimodal interactions {{while on the move}} in the real world. Because multimodal interfaces allow new kinds of <b>eyes</b> and hands <b>free</b> <b>interactions,</b> usability issues while moving through different public spaces becomes an important issue in user experience and acceptance of multimodal interaction. This study focuses on these issues by deploying an RSS reader that participants used during their daily commute every day for one week. The system allows participants on the move to access news feeds <b>eyes</b> <b>free</b> through headphones playing audio and speech and hands free through wearable sensors attached to the wrists. The results showed participants were able to interact with the system on the move and became more comfortable performing these interactions as the study progressed. However, participants were far more comfortable gesturing on the street than on public transport, which was reflected in the number of interactions and the perceived social acceptability of the gestures in different contexts...|$|R

40|$|Background: Feeding {{innovation}} {{occurs when}} individuals choose a novel, unknown type of food and/or acquire new feeding skills. Here we studied feeding innovation and social {{transmission of the}} new feeding habit in canaries. Adult canaries eat {{a wide variety of}} seeds but avoid larger ones such as those of sunflowers. We determined whether adults of both sexes are equally prone to innovate when confronted with sunflower seeds and whether free-interactions facilitate transmission of the new feeding habit in a sex-dependent manner. Methodology/Principal Findings: First we determined which sex was more innovative, i. e., was more successful at husking and eating the novel seeds. Males were clearly more innovative than females. Due to this, experienced males served as model for either male or female observers in three different conditions (<b>free</b> <b>interaction</b> with a demonstrator, visual interaction with a demonstrator placed behind a transparent wall and access to seeds {{in the presence of a}} nondemonstrating bird). During <b>free</b> <b>interactions,</b> the new feeding habit was only transmitted to females. In contrast, transmission of seed handling to male observers only occurred if demonstrator and observer were separated by the transparent wall. Indeed, aggressive behaviors between males prevented social transmission during <b>free</b> <b>interactions.</b> Finally, we studied the influence of the less innovative females in feeding-habit transmission. First, we obtained female demonstrators by making them freely interact with male demonstrators. Once they acquired innovative responses t...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} retinal vessel signs are {{independent}} predictors {{of the long-term}} development of age-related maculopathy (ARM). Design: Prospective population-based cohort study. Participants: Blue Mountains Eye Study participants aged � 49 years (n � 3654) were examined during 1992 through 1994; 2335 (75 % of survivors) were reexamined after 5 years and 1952 (76 % of survivors) were reexamined after 10 years. Methods: Baseline focal arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous (AV) nicking were assessed and vessel calibers were measured from retinal photographs. A side-by-side grading method {{was used to assess}} ARM incidence. Eye-specific data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation models, adjusting for age, gender, smoking, and blood pressure. Main Outcome Measures: Incident early ARM (soft indistinct or reticular drusen or combined soft distinct drusen and retinal pigment abnormality) was defined in <b>eyes</b> <b>free</b> of both early and late ARM at baseline. Incident late ARM (either geographic atrophy or neovascular macular degeneration) was defined in <b>eyes</b> <b>free</b> of these 2 lesions at baseline.
