500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

2500|$|Savita Halappanavar, {{pregnant}} at 17 weeks {{with her first}} baby, {{went to the hospital}} with her husband Praveen on 21 October 2012 complaining about back pain. She was examined and discharged, and then returned to the hospital a few hours later after she felt something [...] "coming down." [...] An examination showed that the gestational sac had protruded into her vagina, almost to the opening. She was admitted to the hospital for observation, as a miscarriage appeared to be inevitable. [...] Her water broke just after midnight on 22 October. On the 23 the Halappanavars discussed terminating the pregnancy early with one of the consultant doctors: according to the 2013 Health Service report: [...] "O Consultant 1 stated that the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this. At interview the consultant stated 'Under Irish law, if there’s no evidence of risk {{to the life of the}} mother, our hands are tied so long as there’s a fetal heart'. The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on actual risk and not a theoretical risk of infection 'we can’t predict who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> infection'". [...] Midwife manager Ann Maria Burke attempted to calm the couple and explained that the termination cannot be carried out because Ireland is [...] "a Catholic country". [...] Halappanavar began to develop signs of sepsis, and the hospital decided to insert a central line to better manage her condition, and had also decided to administer misoprostol to induce delivery; the medication was not given because on 24 October she delivered a stillborn girl in the procedure room where the central line was being inserted. The sepsis continued to worsen, and at 1:09am, on Sunday 28 October, she died from cardiac arrest caused by the sepsis.|$|E
