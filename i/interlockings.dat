Since the {{official}} {{establishment of the}} Macao Special Administrative Region [MSAR] in 1999, which meant its handover to the People's Republic of China [PRC], this territory has been in delirious transformation. The liberalization of the gambling industry and the consequent proliferation of casinos and luxury hotels, {{as well as the}} recent inscription of its Historical Centre in the UNESCO's World Heritage List are the most significant events of the last decade. In fact, the territory has become a severe case of a flourishing economy since then, especially due to its blooming tourism industry, mostly driven by the gambling sector and its high revenues. Together, these singularities have been leaving an impressive mark on the city which has been attracting millions of tourists every year, while making way for remarkable financial growth, promoting Macao's wealthy status. Undoubtedly, Macao has evolved into a well known touristic city {{in the first decade of}} the new authority, but with no further land to grow, limited infrastructures and reduced array of industries, the city could not afford being on the verge of becoming a victim of its own success. New measures became necessary to prevent Macao from urban and economic failure. In order to inhibit the city of running out of attractiveness, the government has realized the need to implement new measures tailored to the territory's updated reality and ambitions. In addition, one must not disregard the powerful influence of its surrounding area, the Pearl River Delta [PRD] region. Since the late 1970 's, when the PRC introduced a new open-door policy, the financial growth of the nation has been unquestionable. The world now looks up to the PRC as an economic powerhouse, where the PRD has played a crucial part, revealing itself as one of the motors of such prosperous economy. Once under the PRC sovereignty and with its matchless location at the doorway of the Chinese mainland, Macao has been recognized as an integrating element of the national development blueprint and acknowledged as part of a larger regional endeavour. It is the PRC's will to launch the implementation of a mega conurbation having the MSAR, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR] and the city of Guangzhou (in PRC's mainland) as the three main supporting cores, taking advantage of each area's main specificities: "[ [...] . ] the Pearl River Delta will strengthen its cooperation and coordination with Hong Kong and Macao to bring into play each other’s advantages. The region is supported to pursue convergence with Hong Kong and Macao in terms of urban planning, rail transit networks, information networks [ [...] . ] so as to forge jointly the most dynamic and internationally competitive city cluster of the Asia-Pacific region. " 2 In addition, the development plan for the PRD has "set for the first time the placement of Macao as a tourism and leisure centre at the global level [ [...] . ], which demands more effort from the administration of the MSAR and introduces a new dynamic for a more efficient participation of Macao in the regional cooperation. " 3 The MSAR government had already defined the city as a selling product through various measures on the development of Macao as a touristic city, but the PRC's announcement came as a reinforcement of the MSAR tourism-oriented governmental discourse, whose future development is now supposed to occur in concurrence with its neighbours, readjusting itself to the stated PRC's course of action. Being Architecture a key strategy within the management and marketing of territories, How to sell Macau 4 proposes a journey along the urban reinvention planned for the territory, which is being conducted as a means to provide the city with a new promotional image and superior living quality, surpassing its inherent morphological drawbacks. In fact, several projects are being implemented already, whose effects on the territory will be irreversible. For this research, the structuring of the city planning was based on three major topics: CITYSCAPE; REGIONAL <b>INTERLOCKING</b> and TRANSPORTATION NETWORK, essential to attract investors and potential inhabitants; to promote a global satisfaction level amongst the residents and, most importantly, to serve as a tourism booster. This research is presented in two main chapters. Chapter 1 will firstly focus on Macao, contextualizing its latest urban and economic transformations, providing an overall understanding of the territory's urban change narrative until what Macao stands for nowadays. Also, taking into account that "China's international cities cannot form without the surrounding metropolitan interlocking region," 5 it will take a tour around Macao to get to know its neighbours, comprehend its role within this vast area and assess the valuable significance of such urban region for its future development. Chapter 2 will embark on the analysis of the most decisive projects for the upcoming years. These will be divided into sub-chapters according to their nature. CITYSCAPE will focus on the main project affecting the territory's skyline and waterfront arrangement: the new landfills plan, while REGIONAL <b>INTERLOCKING</b> will present the joint plan for the Hengqin island and the Shizimen Central Business District [CBD] on the nearby municipality of Zhuhai (in PRC's mainland). At last, TRANSPORTATION NETWORK will highlight the implementation of the Macao Light Rapid Transit System [LRTS] as well as the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge [HKZMB] venture. As the result of my emergent curiosity on the way this territory is perceived nowadays, this research attempts to inform of the challenging and unprecedented momentum that Macao is currently facing by picturing the overall expected transformation and mapping the city's intended expansion. Needless to say, this mise-en-scène would not be complete without pointing out eventual contradictions or adversities such as the UNESCO regulations, the high population density, the evident discrepancy between the old and the new city and, more importantly, the lack of an urban and tourism master plan, both deemed vital to successfully achieve a sustainable city vision. Acknowledging the new city's image as more than its physical appearance or outer shell, it also aims at questioning how the new proposals will intervene in the creation of a new figure for the territory and in which way they will be a catalyst for the consolidation of its status as a worldclass engaging tourism centre, along with its regional partners. What prospect of urban planning is there for Macao and who takes responsibility for it? Is it all in the hands of the PRC or does the MSAR has a valid say on its future? To what extent does the tourism-related objectives are influencing the city planning? Indeed, while revealing strategic planning as a powerful political instrument, it explores the political principles, motivations and intervenient parts lying underneath such mega territorial operation under the context of the socio-economic restructuring process in implementation since the handover. However, the city itself is never a finished project. 6 Instead, its essence relies on the continued sequence of different stages, miscellaneous strategies and plans. Therefore, this research is not able to attain an irrefutable portrayal of Macao's future urban development. In order to assure the utmost certainty and precision (for the time being), this essay was mainly based on official reports and governmental publications and ordinances, academic papers, interviews and articles, attended seminars and exhibitions. Nonetheless, it still has a fair margin of error. None of the mentioned projects is near conclusion, allowing enough time for eventual amend of the plans, circumstances or even the players involved. Whether Macao will survive or not to this ambitious announced metamorphosis is hard to tell so far. Even so, I still find it essential these days to build up awareness, thereby one should still address the hereafter presented intentions and perhaps, learn with Macao's sui generis citymaking...|$|R
25|$|<b>Interlockings</b> {{are places}} where tracks are {{connected}} by switches and where routes may conflict. They are arranged in a specific way, with switches and signals that prevent conflicting movements once one route is set up. Interlocking signals are fixed signals within an interlocking, containing two separate red-yellow-green signal heads and often other indications. A home signal is defined as an interlocking signal {{at the entrance to}} a route or block to control trains entering that route or block. These terms are used interchangeably, as most <b>interlockings</b> only have one controlled signal on each track.|$|E
25|$|In November 2008, Westinghouse (subsequently {{known as}} Invensys Rail, and {{now part of}} Siemens Rail Automation) was awarded a £20M {{contract}} for a 30-month programme of signalling enabling work. Over a series of 12 commissionings, Invensys Rail will re-lock the existing Reading Station and Spur <b>interlockings</b> to three new WESTLOCK Interlocking units, re-control the remaining 18 relay <b>interlockings</b> and move signalling and telecommunications control from Reading Station to the new Thames Valley Signalling Centre at Didcot. The work culminates in a final commissioning, scheduled for 5 December 2010 and paves the way for future stages of the remodelling programme.|$|E
25|$|The local tracks {{would also}} get CBTC {{as part of}} the 2015–2019 Capital Program, as well as the entire line between Church Avenue and West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium. The Ditmas Avenue, Kings Highway, and Avenue X <b>interlockings</b> would be upgraded.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} frame, wooden track ties on the Main Line, {{as well as}} other major lines, were {{replaced}} with new concrete ties. Major upgrades to signals and <b>interlockings</b> were done as part of bigger projects that provided electrification extensions or new main line tracks.|$|E
25|$|The SHELL and E SHELL <b>interlockings</b> were {{recently}} upgraded to allow Amtrak trains to cross-over {{the main line}} faster and in a more orderly fashion. As a result, the tracks in New Rochelle station were rearranged so that Amtrak boards only on the outbound Metro-North platform.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other rail lines, the signal system on the Market–Frankford Line has progressed from the {{original}} lineside block signals using semaphores, to three-aspect Type D color light (green, over yellow, over red) signals, to cab signalling, eliminating the lineside block signals except at <b>interlockings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glasgow Central Signalling Centre {{closed on}} 27 December 2008, when its area of control was {{transferred}} to the new West of Scotland Signalling Centre (WSSC) at Cowlairs. The NX panel is to be preserved. The station is currently signalled by two Westinghouse Westlock <b>Interlockings</b> which are controlled via a GE MCS control system.|$|E
25|$|The {{block system}} handles all control and {{supervision}} of routes through <b>interlockings</b> including switch (point) control and switch status, for broken rail protection, and tracking of trains with failed (or not equipped for) CBTC. CBTC lines are fully track circuited with power frequency, single-rail track circuits. (Broken-rail protection is only guaranteed {{on one of}} the two rails, however.) Equipment aboard every train identifies the location of the train using wayside transponders as a basis. Once the Zone Controller has determined, based on track circuit information and train localization, that the CBTC train is a single discrete train ("sieved"). The Wayside Zone Controller uses this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead. The CBTC Zone Controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from the Wasyide (Legacy) Signaling system. Trains, with CBTC, can then operate closer together, although as before, platform dwell times and train performance are the true limiting factors in terms of headway performance. With the new system, signals and <b>interlockings</b> are still absolutely required, their job being done better by relay <b>interlockings</b> or Solid State Interlocking controllers. The ATS system at the Control Center is not a vital (life-safety) system and serves only to automate the routing of trains based on the overall timetable. The location of the train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times. The MTA's form of CBTC uses a reduced form of the old fixed-block signaling system, requiring that both be maintained at high cost.|$|E
25|$|Fixed {{signals are}} only present at <b>interlockings.</b> They show a red over red aspect for “stop and stay,” a lunar (white) aspect for “proceed,” and a {{flashing}} lunar aspect for “proceed on diverging route” (only present on newer interlockings; older <b>interlockings</b> are being updated with signals that show this aspect). Tracks {{are divided into}} block sections, {{which can only be}} occupied by one train at a time, a method to protect against collisions used by most railway systems worldwide, but there are generally no fixed signals to protect block sections (signals tend to be only at beginning/end of route and just before track switches). Virtual signal aspects are transmitted to the train by a cab signaling system and displayed to the operator in the cab, as well as transmitted to the ATC system. Entry into an occupied block is prevented by an automatic train protection system (ATP), which supervises both manual and ATC operation and stops the train well before it would enter an occupied block.|$|E
25|$|Most {{lines in}} Melbourne operate under an {{automatic}} block system of safeworking with three-position power signalling. This permits signals to operate automatically {{with the passage}} of trains, enforcing the distance between them. At junctions signals are manually controlled from signal boxes, with <b>interlockings</b> used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The Flemington Racecourse line has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.|$|E
25|$|The {{route is}} part of the trans-European {{high-speed}} railway network as defined in the Technical Specification for Interoperability. The route is to be controlled by seven electronic <b>interlockings</b> that are remotely controlled from signalling control centres in Munich and Leipzig. In 2014, the Federal Audit Office criticised the fact that the provision of €54 million for the signaling technology of the line had been {{made on the basis of}} an outdated operating program from 1995.|$|E
25|$|LZB {{consists}} of equipment {{on the line}} {{as well as on}} the trains. A 30–40km segment of track is controlled by a LZB control center. The control center computer receives information about occupied blocks from track circuits or axle counters and locked routes from <b>interlockings.</b> It is programmed with the track configuration including the location of points, turnouts, gradients, and curve speed limits. With this, it has sufficient information to calculate how far each train may proceed and at what speed.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Subway system has, for {{the most}} part, used block {{signalling}} since its 1904 opening. , the system consists of about 14,850 signal blocks, 3,538 mainline switches, 183 major track junctions, 10,104 automatic train stops, and 339,191 signal relays. Trains used {{to be controlled by}} signal towers at <b>interlockings,</b> but this was eventually phased out in favor of master towers. Eventually, these master towers were replaced by a single rail control center: the New York City Transit Power Control Center in Midtown Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|The line is signalled with {{advisory}} wayside signals, {{except on}} surface portions in street medians or in-street running. Wayside signal territory stretches from Lechmere {{to the surface}} portals at Kenmore, and along {{the entire length of}} the D–Riverside branch. There are no automatic protection devices, but the cars have track brakes, giving the ability to stop quickly under control of the operator. <b>Interlockings</b> are controlled through a wayside Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) system that relies on the operator properly entering the destination manually on a roto-wheel in the train cab at the beginning of a run.|$|E
25|$|Funding for {{the design}} of CBTC on the IND Eighth Avenue Line from 59th Street–Columbus Circle to High Street is also {{provided}} in the 2015–2019 Capital Program, along with the modernization of <b>interlockings</b> at 30th and 42nd Streets. The design of the Eighth Avenue Line CBTC project will be done concurrently with the Queens Boulevard Line automation, allowing the majority of the E route to be semi-automated when the project is done, since nearly all of the E's route runs along these two lines. It will get two new electrical substations to support CBTC upgrades. Construction is scheduled to begin in October 2018.|$|E
25|$|At {{switches}} {{entering into}} pocket tracks {{in a direction}} reverse to the normal operating direction, there is a “P Signal”. The P Signal is a single lunar signal that displays the letter “P” and is found {{at the entrance to}} some but not all pocket tracks and other selected main line <b>interlockings</b> in the reverse direction of the normal flow of traffic. Below the P signal on the same post is a punch box to allow the train operator to manually set the switch to the diverting direction (reverse) when the P Signal is lit. The P signal is only lit when a train occupies the two track circuit approaching the P Signal and all possible routes into the interlocking are not occupied.|$|E
25|$|The CBTC {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 1994 {{and approved by}} the MTA in 1997. Installation of the signal system was begun in 2000. Initial testing began in 2004, and installation was mostly completed by December 2006, with all CBTC-equipped R143 subway cars in service by that date. Due to an unexpected ridership increase on the Canarsie Line, the MTA ordered more R160 cars and these were put into service in 2010. This enabled the agency to operate up to 26 trains per hour up from the May 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour, an achievement that would not be possible without the CBTC technology or a redesign of the previous automatic block signal system. The R143s and R160s both use Trainguard MT CBTC, supplied by Siemens. In the 2015–2019 Capital Program, funding was provided for three more electrical substations for the line so that it could accommodate even more trains per hour. Also included in the Capital Program is the installation of automatic signals on the line to facilitate the movement of work trains between <b>interlockings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside automatic block signal system with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled <b>interlockings</b> are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Protection {{sub-system}} uses coded {{track circuit}} technology originally supplied by Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when {{the line was}} constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum safe speed via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe stopping distance from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at <b>interlockings.</b> The cab signalling system relies on track circuits to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code. Although the ATP system {{was designed to be}} fail-safe, the track circuit control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident.|$|E
25|$|The MTA is {{planning}} to implement CBTC on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. CBTC is to be installed on this line in five phases, with phase one (50th Street/8th Avenue and 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center to Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike) being included in the 2010-2014 capital budget. The 63rd Street Connection to 21st Street–Queensbridge would also be retrofitted with CBTC. Following {{the success of the}} Culver Line CBTC test track, the MTA awarded a $205.8 million contract for the installment of phase one to Siemens and Thales in 2015. These two suppliers were the only MTA-qualified suppliers that could install CBTC on New York City Transit tracks. Of this initial cost, the MTA will pay $156.2 million to Siemens and $49.6 million to Thales. Both of these suppliers would install the new signaling system on the tracks themselves. Seven of 8 <b>interlockings</b> in the first-phase section of the line would be upgraded under this contract. In addition, 309 four- or five-car sets of R160s will receive Trainguard MT CBTC, the same CBTC system installed on trains assigned to the BMT Canarsie Line, which will be compatible with the SelTrac CBTC system installed on the tracks. Of the 309 units set to be converted for CBTC-compatibility, 305 will receive new onboard equipment, which NYCT contractors will install in 301 of these 305 units.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, the MTA {{announced}} that several {{portions of the}} Culver Line would be undergoing extensive rehabilitation. The first renovation involved repairs of the elevated Culver Viaduct (including the Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue stations) and modernization of the <b>interlockings</b> at Bergen Street, 4th Avenue, and Church Avenue. The B5 layup track was removed {{as part of the}} project. This also allowed the G train to be extended from its longtime terminus at Smith–Ninth Streets to a more efficient terminus at Church Avenue beginning in July 2009. The project was completed in 2013. Around the time the rehabilitation project was announced, a petition to restore express service along the line gained attention, due to increasing ridership on both the F and G services in Brooklyn. The petition, which gained over 2,500 signatures by June 2007 and nearly 4,000 by September, proposed to restore express service by making the Church Avenue extension of the G permanent and extending the [...] (eliminated in 2010) from its Manhattan terminus to Brooklyn, sharing the Rutgers Street Tunnel with the F. The G extension was made permanent in July 2012, freeing up the express tracks formerly used to relay trains.|$|E

Some other <b>interlockings</b> may be removed or reconfigured. With the reconfiguration near Zoo, the Overbrook interlocking can be removed and replaced with 4 through tracks. Bryn Mawr interlocking may have storage tracks added west of the station to allow R5 Bryn Mawr locals to turn without occupying an express track. Paoli interlocking may be removed if the four-track configuration were to continue west of the station. Paoli station may be reconfigured with high-level island platforms serving all four tracks, as part of a new Paoli transportation center. Frazer interlocking may be reconfigured for turning SEPTA trains and as the point where four tracks become two.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station has}} a control tower {{at the eastern}} end of the {{southbound}} platform, which monitors trains between Broadway Junction and the station, and controls the <b>interlockings</b> east of Euclid Avenue.

The automation project was among the first in the world to use a radio frequency-based system. The plans for installation were laid out between 1999 and 2002. Communications-based train control (CBTC) was installed in pieces between 2003 and January 2006: the elevated section of the line south of Broadway Junction was completed first, followed by the underground section north of Broadway Junction. The project cost $340 million, with $78 million of it used to upgrade track <b>interlockings</b> on the line.|$|E
2500|$|Identification of Trains and Routing Automatically (IDENTRA) was {{implemented}} {{on the line}} in the 1957 and used until 1997, when a route selector punch box with B1 Astoria, local/express buttons was installed at the 10/11 car marker on the upper level of Queensboro Plaza. IDENTRA used a removable round circular disc type radio antenna assembly, slide-mounted on the small mounting brackets that were attached on the front of R12, R14, R15, and R17 cars that were assigned to the 7 route, which had been used on the line since 1948. Similar to the use of radio transponders in the CBTC installation, the system used the antennas to determine whether a train was running local or express, and then accordingly switched the track at <b>interlockings</b> near the Queensboro Plaza and Flushing–Main Street stations. This move reduced the number of signal towers on the line from 9 to 2 and allowed to operate 37 eleven-car trains instead of only 30 nine-car trains per hour.
