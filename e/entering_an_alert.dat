40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effectiveness of preceding synthesized voice warning mes-sages with <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue as <b>a</b> function {{of the amount of}} information presented by the voice synthesizer and the workload level in the primary task. Subjects performed a simplified air traffic control task in which they were required to monitor two visual displays and to <b>enter</b> commands via <b>a</b> standard keyboard. Emergency messages were always presented by phoneme-based synthesized speech. However, the presence of <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue (light and tone) prior to emergency messages and the presentation mode of noncritical messages (visual or auditory) were varied experimentally. When synthesized speech was used only for emergency messages, the presence of <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue lengthened the response time to the message. However, when computer-generated speech was used for multiple functions, more emergency messages were detected when <b>an</b> <b>alerting</b> cue was used...|$|R

It is possible to knock a shibito out for {{a small amount of}} time; however, it will eventually resurrect and attack again.
