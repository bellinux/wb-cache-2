40|$|Man-made {{vitreous}} fibre (MMVF) is {{a generic}} name {{used to describe}} an inorganic fibrous material manufactured primarily from glass, rock, minerals, slag and processed inorganic oxides. The MMVFs produced are non-crystalline (glassy, vitreous, amorphous). Other names for MMVFs include manufactured vitreous fibres, man-made mineral fibres (MMMF), machine-made mineral fibres and synthetic vitreous fibres. Continuous <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> is sometimes {{also referred to as}} ‘glass textile fibre’. The term ‘mineral wool ’ has been used in the USA to describe only rock (stone) wool and slag wool. In Europe, ‘mineral wool ’ also includes glass wool. In this monograph, the terms rock (stone) wool, slag wool and glass wool are used rather than mineral wool, whenever possible. Man-made vitreous fibres are manufactured by a variety of processes based on the attenuation of a thin stream of molten inorganic oxides at high temperatures. All commercially important MMVFs are silica-based and contain various amounts of other inorganic oxides. The non-silica components typically include, but are not limited to, oxides of alkaline earths, alkalis, aluminium, boron, iron and zirconium. These additional oxides may be constituents of the raw materials used to make the fibres, or they may be added to enhance the manufacturing process or the product performance. Depending on the process of fibre formation, MMVFs are produced either as wool, which is a mass of tangled, discontinuous fibres of variable lengths and diameters, or as filaments, which are continuous fibres (of indeterminate length) with diameters having ranges that are more uniform and typically thicker than those of wool.

40|$|Advances in {{the study}} of the rate {{processes}} in spray drying have helped improve product quality. Single droplet drying (SDD) is an established method for monitoring the drying kinetics and morphological changes of an isolated droplet under a controlled drying environment, mimicking the droplet convective drying process in spray drying. To enhance particle quality requires understanding of both the particle formation process and knowledge of how different particle properties are affected by the drying conditions used. The latest development in the SDD technique enables evaluation of these aspects by incorporating a dissolution test in the drying experiment. The experiment is realized by attaching a solvent droplet to a dried/semi-dried single particle in situ and then video-recording the resultant morphological changes. Some of the particle (e. g., crystallinity) properties obtained under different drying conditions can be modelled using the measured droplet drying kinetics. This paper reviews the applications of SDD experiments in measuring the drying kinetics and monitoring the droplet morphological changes during drying. Some examples of extending the <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> SDD technique to examine particle functionalities are discussed.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the evaporation of drops of pure liquids, drops containing solids and droplet sprays has been critically reviewed.

Individual drops were suspended from a <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> balance in a 26 mm I. D. vertical wind tunnel, designed and constructed to supply hot de-humidified air, to simulate conditions encountered in commercial spray driers. A novel thin film thermocouple was developed to facilitate the simultaneous measurement of drop weight and core temperature. The heat conduction through the thermocouple was reduced because of its unique design; using essentially a single 50 μ diameter nickel wire.

A model was proposed for the drying of slurry drops, based on a receding evaporation interface. The model was solved numerically for the variation of core temperature, drop weight and crust thickness as a function of time.

The model is validated using experimental data obtained in this study on top of those already available in the literature. The experimental apparatus {{as well as the}} processing routines to optically measure droplet evaporation at a range of ambient conditions are presented. The droplet was suspended using a <b>glass</b> <b>filament.</b> Data were collected for droplets with an initial radius of 500 μm at three temperatures 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C and three air velocities 0. 5 m/s, 1. 5 m/s, and 2. 5 m/s to provide a comprehensive validation dataset. Based on experimental and simulation data, a correlation is presented that captures the start time of solid formation. This time {{plays an important role in}} cooling tower design as it shows the time that the outer surface of the droplet dries. Using the validated model, it is shown that for 500 μm radius droplets with 3 % initial mass concentration the start time of reaching the final size is 17 % less than evaporation time of a pure water droplet. Also, the net energy required to evaporate the droplet falls by 7. 3 % compared to a pure water droplet. For 5 % initial concentration these values are 24. 9 % and 12. 2 %, respectively. Using saline water in spray-cooling has two major effects: the energy extracted from the air per unit droplet volume is reduced (which can be compensated for by increasing the liquid flow rate). Moreover, compared to the time taken for the evaporation of a pure water droplet, the period with wet surface is shorter as a result of crust formation around the saline water droplet.

This result suggests that the sizing is an organic polymer with a high shear yield strength.

40|$|Droplet drying is an {{important}} phenomenon that widely presents in industrial powder manufacturing processes. Droplet drying involves simultaneous heat and mass transfer. When a droplet being dried contains dissolved solids, {{the properties of the}} solids could lead to interesting behaviours in drying, such as shell formation, crystallization and denaturation of bioactive materials. Such phenomena could make droplet drying a very complex process to understand. Meanwhile, these would also affect the functionality of the final dried particles. The study of droplet drying, the associated functionality changes and the mechanisms behind these changes require careful and sometimes new experimental approaches. Firstly, this study has extended the <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> single droplet drying (SDD) experiment for studying the three phenomena mentioned above. The <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> SDD technique was initially optimized to realize accurate measurements of droplet kinetics parameters during drying, including droplet diameter, droplet temperature and droplet mass. Using this technique, the effect of initial droplet properties on the drying behaviour was investigated. It was found that the initial droplet sizes tested did not affect drying behaviour. The drying kinetics of lactose droplets with three initial sizes could collapse to a general trend when correlated using the Reaction Engineering Approach (REA). This {{was the first time that}} this has been investigated. The so-called material-specific master activation-energy curve provides a useful quantitative description of the drying history for all the initial sizes tested. The drying kinetics of high solids skim milk droplets with an initial concentration of 50 wt% was also experimentally determined for the first time in literature and correlated with the REA modelling. Once again, a master activation energy curve was established, which is useful for predicting the drying history of the high solids content skim milk droplets at varied drying air conditions. It is noted that industrial operation in skim milk drying plants, 50 wt% or thereabout is a common practice. By comparing the drying behaviour of 50 wt% skim milk droplets to that of lower initial concentrations previously reported, it was found that the effect of drying air temperature is solids content dependent at high solids levels. Both droplet shrinkage kinetics and shrinkage ratio during the high solids milk drying were more significantly affected by the drying air temperature used. On the contrary, the drying rate appeared to be less affected by the increase in the drying air temperature. Perhaps this indicates that the mass transfer limiting regimes become real. The shrinkage coefficient of milk droplets with initial concentrations between 10 and 50 wt%, when correlated to the corresponding initial concentration, formed an consistent trend. This trend was used to develop a master equation for predicting the shrinkage kinetics of milk droplets within the stated range of initial concentration. The newly developed in situ analysis of particle surface formation allows the changes in the dissolution behaviour of the semi-dried particle to be monitored while droplet drying is in progress. By comparing the changes in dissolution behaviour of four dairy materials during drying, the possible material migration behaviour during milk droplet drying was examined. Fat was considered to start to accumulate on the surface of the droplet being dried as soon as drying started. Such accumulation appeared to take some time to complete. By the middle stage of drying, the fat was most probably concentrated on the surface layer leading to the dominant fat coverage on the spray dried milk powders, which provided evidence to the claims made in previous studies using XPS. Lactose was used as a model sugar to study its crystallization behaviour during droplet drying, which was achieved by both the improved SDD experiments incorporating dissolution tests and post-drying instrumental analysis including SEM and XRD. Dried lactose particles could possess two-layer morphology with the interior showing higher crystallinity. This finding demonstrated the importance of the moisture content on the crystallization during drying. It is believed that as drying progresses there is a critical crystallization period where the crystallization rate was maximal. Drying conditions that enhance the lactose crystallization during drying include a higher drying air temperature, a higher initial α-lactose level, and a longer exposure time. The study of the retention of microbial viability was carried out with a model bacterium, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. By correlating the inactivation kinetics explicitly to the drying process parameters, it was found that the inactivation constant kd obtained at six drying conditions can be correlated to the droplet temperature Td with a general trend. The results indicated that the heat-induced inactivation remained to be the main cause of cell death during a convective droplet drying process at an elevated temperature. The effects of other droplet drying parameters on cell survival were also discussed. Environmental parameters influence the cell inactivation kinetics by either stabilizing cellular components or by altering the droplet drying kinetics. The prominent protective effect provided by reconstituted skim milk was found to have at least two mechanisms: (1) particle temperature was kept lower at the later stage of drying; (2) there were fewer cells presented on the surface of dried particle. The trend of kd plotted against Td showed that a transition temperature exists at around 62 - 65 oC, coinciding with the peak of denaturation of 30 S ribosomal subunit on a thermogram as measured by DSC in previous works...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a systematic {{investigation of the}} DHA-encapsulated particles. Special research attention {{was drawn to the}} particle drying behavior and surface phenomenon during and after the particle formation. As a heat and chemical sensitive substance, DHA is often errapsulated to decrease oxidation or to mask unpleasant taste and odour. Selection of the rest coating materials and micro-encapsulation process technology is crucial. In this study, different shell materials (protein-based and starch-based, respectively) were examined to indicate their feasibility for DHAoil encapsulation and to understand their drying behavior. Spray drying is a primary method to manufacture food and pharmaceutical powders. Before subjecting a new formulation (ingredient or wall material) to this process, informations about drying kinetics and shrinkage parameters, which are crucial to 100 del the spray drying process, can be obtained via single-droplet drying experiments. In this study, a <b>glass</b> <b>filament</b> method was adopted to measure the changes in droplet size, weight, and temperature during the drying of emulsion droplets containing DHA at specific solid-liquid ratios under hot air convection. The Reaction Engineering Approach (REA) could then be adopted to describe the drying behavior of the emulsion droplets, and correlate the shrinkage coefficients against the solids content. The heat transfer and mass transfer models of s~cific types of emulsion were also established. The REA model in this thesis has provided an accurate description of drying behaviour of the tested emulsion systems. Significant differerres could be found when comparing the present master curves with previous reJX>rted master curves. The early shell formation process was assumed to be the reason and was confirmed by the further studies. In addition, when an emulsion droplet was dried, the pro~rties of different dissolved solids could lead to different behaviors, for example, different shell formation process. Such phenomena could make droplet drying a very complex process to understand and also would affect the functionality of tre final dried particles. Thus, the surface phenomena of DHA-containing emulsion during convective droplet drying, with the associated functionality changes, were analyzed by the extended glass-filament single droplet drying approach to understand the mechanisms behind these changes. The in situ analysis of particle surface formation allowed changes in the dissolution behavior of tre semi-dried/dried particle to be monitored while droplet drying was in progress. By comparing the changes in dissolution behavior with different shell materials during drying, the possible material migration behavior during the DHA-containing emulsion droplet drying was examined and generated. Discussion based on visual observations of the emulsion morphologies, droplet drying behaviors and dissolution process was presented. The quick crust formation processes of tre DHA-containing emulsion droplets during drying were verified. The surface characterization for DHA containing particle before and after surface oil extraction were also carried out to detect tre influence of different wall materials on the surfa:e formation and surface com}X) sition. The modified-starch showed a better protective property of tre oil than protein. The knowledge developed from this thesis will provide theoretical and technical support for the industrial-scale production of DHA-oil micro-capsule...|$|E

This protocol describes the ex ovo electroporation of a DNA plasmid into avian embryos as young as stage X, nearly 24 h earlier in development than most electroporation protocols. Compared to in ovo electroporation, the ex ovo method allows easier embryo orientation (the posterior half of the embryo is darker than the anterior half). Thus, positioning of the specimen and consistency of the electroporation site between embryos is improved. Furthermore, nearly all embryos can be electroporated at the same stage using the ex ovo method: If some embryos have not reached a desired stage, {{it is possible to}} temporally stop development of those embryos already at the desired stage by keeping them at room temperature while incubating the rest at 37 °C until they develop. The method described here uses relatively low voltage, and the electroporation chamber can be made easily, with no specialized equipment required. ### RELATED INFORMATION This protocol was adapted from Cui et al. (2006) and incorporates the ex ovo culture method described by New (1955). ### MATERIALS 1. Reagents - Buffered phenol red solution - DNA plasmid of interest (e. g., GFP expression plasmid) - *Store DNA plasmid stocks in endotoxin-free H 2 O. * - DNA purification kit (endotoxin-free) (e. g., Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit, 12362) - Embryonic culture dish - *Prepare by pouring 3 mL of agar substrate into a 35 -mm Petri dish (Fisher Scientific, 0875711 YZ) (Chapman et al. 2001) *. - Embryonic culture insert - *Prepare by pouring 1 mL of agar substrate into a *Millicell insert (Millipore Organotypic culture inserts*, PICMORG- 50) *. - Embryonic phosphate-buffered saline (ePBS) (1 X) - Embryos from Japanese quail eggs (*Coturnix coturnix japonica*) or chicken eggs (unincubated or incubated to desired stage) - *Early embryos in this protocol are staged according to Eyal-Giladi and Kochav (1976) *. - H 2 O, endotoxin-free - Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Mediatech/cellgro, 21 - 020 -CV) - Nail polish (clear) - Clear nail polish acts as an electrical insulator. ### Equipment 1. Coverslips (35 mm, No. 1), glass - Filter paper rings for embryo removal (see Step 8) - Forceps - Incubator at 37 °C - Microcapillaries (1. 0 -mm O. D. with <b>glass</b> <b>filament)</b> (Narishige, GD- 1) - Micromanipulators (2) (Narishige) - Petri dishes (60 mm) (BD Falcon, 353002) - Petri dishes (100 mm) (BD Falcon, 351029) - Picoliter injector (Harvard Instruments, PLI- 100) - Platinum wires (3 × 0. 35 mm and 80 × 0. 3 mm) - Scissors, angled iris (Fine Science Tools, 14063 - 09) - Single-stage glass microelectrode puller (Narishige, PC 10) - Square-pulse electroporator (BEX Co., Ltd., CUY- 21 TM) - Tissues - Transfer pipettes ### METHOD **Construction of Electroporation Chamber** *The use of a glass-bottomed chamber allows the precise placement of the specimen directly over the anode. The chamber is constructed such that the raised segment of the anode is bathed in electrolyte solution (HBSS) during electroporation. When the Millicell insert is centered over the glass window, the insert membrane touches the anode*. 1. Use a 60 -mm polystyrene Petri dish to mark the base of the chamber. - Prepare a cathode (−) consisting of a 3 × 0. 35 -mm platinum wire. Approximately 2 mm from the end, bend the wire at a 45 ° angle (see Fig. 1, top electrode). Using clear nail polish, insulate the wire near the junction where the cathode will be mounted on the micromanipulator. Couple the cathode to a stainless steel rod and mount on a coarse-grade micromanipulator. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. A cross-section of the glass-bottomed electroporation chamber used to electroporate pre-gastrulation stage avian embryos. *The cathode is positioned parallel to the anode during electroporation*. 3. Design an anode (+) that runs along the bottom of the dish using a platinum wire (80 × 0. 3 mm). Bend the wire at the midsection to create a 3 -mm segment that is raised 1 mm above the center of the dish and runs parallel to the dish floor (Fig. 1, bottom electrode). Attach the lengths of wire {{on either side of the}} raised loop to the floor of the dish using clear nail polish. 4. Create a glass-bottomed chamber by boring a 20 -mm hole in the bottoms of both the 60 -mm dish and a 100 -mm Petri dish. Align the holes, and glue the 60 -mm dish inside the 100 -mm dish. Center a 35 -mm No. 1 glass coverslip over the hole, and glue the glass to the underside of the 100 -mm dish. **DNA Plasmid Preparation** 5. Isolate and purify a GFP-expression plasmid (or other DNA plasmid of interest) using an endotoxin-free DNA purification kit, e. g., the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Store the purified stock in endotoxin-free H 2 O. 6. Prepare the plasmid DNA for electroporation by mixing a 5 μg/μL concentrated stock of endotoxin-free plasmid with buffered phenol red solution in a 1 : 1 ratio, such that the final DNA concentration is ~ 2. 5 μg/μL. - *The phenol red allows visualization of the DNA bolus during injection, and serves as an indicator dye during electroporation (see Step 12. vi) *. **Embryo Removal Using Paper Rings** *This technique for isolating and securing chicken embryos on a paper ring is described by Chapman et al. (2001) *. 7. Gently pour the albumen and yolk (with embryo) of a fertile quail or chicken egg into a 100 -mm Petri dish. Use a transfer pipette to remove the thick albumen from the poured contents. Use tissues to remove any albumen remaining on the embryo. 8. Remove the embryo from the yolk: - i. Place a paper ring around the embryo, on the vitelline membrane. - ii. Crimp the paper to the membrane by trimming the ring just inside its outer circumference using angled iris scissors. - iii. Gently grasp the ring at the posterior end of the embryo and remove the specimen. 9. With the ventral side up, gently submerge the specimen in embryo phosphate-buffered saline (ePBS) to remove any adherent yolk. - *Specimens can be stored in embryonic culture dishes at room temperature for several hours if necessary*. **Electroporation of Embryos** *With the use of Millicell inserts (in which the volume of agar substrate and thus the distance between the embryo and anode remain constant) as well as a glass-bottomed chamber (which allows the specimen to be placed directly over the anode), a specimen can be electroporated approximately every 3 min*. 10. Fill the electroporation chamber with HBSS, so that the fluid covers the anode. - *The fluid level must be high enough to be in contact with the underside of the Millicell insert membrane*. 11. Test the electrical continuity of the chamber: - i. Attach the leads to the chamber. Position the cathode parallel to the anode, at a distance of ~ 3 mm. - ii. Program the CUY- 21 TM power supply with the following pulse sequence: 5 V, 40 msec power-on, and 900 msec power-off, for a series of four square wave pulses. - *Bubbles should be visible on the cathode. An amperage value of at least 0. 01 A should be displayed after the completion of the pulse series*. - iii. Decrease the voltage setting to 4 V after conductance has been established. 12. Electroporate the embryo with the DNA plasmid: - i. Place the embryo ventral side down on the center of an embryonic culture (Millicell) insert. Transfer the embryo/insert assembly into the electroporation chamber. Adjust the position of the insert so that the targeted region is centered on the anode. - ii. Break the tip of a previously pulled fine-diameter glass micro-needle with forceps, to obtain a point sharp enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. Use the technique shown in Figure 2 to push the needle tip through the vitelline membrane at an acute angle (< 45 °), so that the membrane is penetrated without damage to the epiblast. Position the needle tip above the desired region of the epiblast. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. A schematic showing the movement of the needle tip used to penetrate the vitelline membrane (V. M.) without damaging the epiblast. The top layer is the vitelline membrane and the lower layer is the epiblast. (A) The needle is lowered to press on the surface of the vitelline membrane. (B) The needle tip is moved to the left until a fold of vitelline membrane is formed over the needle tip. (C) The needle tip is lifted slightly to release the pressure on the epiblast, without losing the vitelline-membrane fold. (D) The needle tip is moved to the left to penetrate through the vitelline membrane. Steps B through D may be repeated until the needle tip penetrates the vitelline membrane. - iii. Set the ballast pressure of the injection apparatus to the P-balance mode. Pump 20 to 100 nL of the DNA/phenol red solution (2. 5 μg/μL plasmid) into the space between the epiblast and the vitelline membrane. - *The P-balance setting allows slow (~ 5 sec), low-pressure delivery (1. 0 psi tend to displace cells and damage the embryo in early stages. Confine the plasmid bolus to a small area in the target region*. - iv. After delivery of the DNA plasmid, remove the glass needle. If necessary, adjust the position of the embryo/insert relative to the anode to correct any displacement caused by the injection. Adjust the cathode to a position parallel to the anode, as close to the specimen as possible without making contact. - v. Apply approximately one to two drops of HBSS to fill the gap between the cathode and the vitelline membrane (Fig. 3 A). Lower the cathode further, until it touches the membrane and a deformation of tissue can be seen (Fig. 3 B). Raise the cathode only until tissue deformation is no longer visible (Fig. 3 C). ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. A schematic showing movement of the cathode for electroporation. Red indicates the injected DNA plasmid solution (with phenol red). Pink indicates the presence of electrolyte solution (HBSS). (A) After the application of one to two drops of HBSS, the cathode is lowered. (B) The cathode is lifted when tissue deformation is seen. (C) The cathode is held in position as soon as tissue deformation is no longer visible. V. M. is vitelline membrane. - vi. Activate the power supply at 4 V. Look for the formation of bubbles at the cathode, as well as a change in the color of the indicator dye from pink to red, to confirm electrical continuity during the pulses. - *To transfect fewer cells within a target area (desired in some cases, such as cell tracking), 3 V may be used for electroporation (see Fig. 4 A,B). If only a small amount of DNA plasmid is pumped to the target region, a small group of cells (~ 100) can be fluorescently labeled (Fig. 4 C) *. ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. Images of GFP-expressing embryos 3. 5 h post-electroporation. (A) Bright-field image of an avian embryo. (B) Enlarged fluorescent image (GFP) of the rectangle box in A, showing that fluorescently labeled cells on the right side of the embryo are sparser than those on the left side when different voltages were used (3 V on right side and 4 V on left side). (C) A small group of cells (~ 100) were fluorescently labeled when a small amount of plasmid DNA was pumped into the region. Scale bars: 250 μm in A, B, and C, and 50 μm in inset picture of C. - vii. Remove the cathode and the embryo/insert assembly from the electroporation chamber. 13. Gently submerge the embryo/insert in an ePBS-filled dish. With the assembly submerged, float the embryo with attached ring away from the agar bed/insert. Transfer to an embryonic culture dish with the ventral side up. - *When it is kept in a 37 °C incubator, the cultured embryo normally can grow up to 40 h after electroporation, or until HH stage 12 *. 14. Culture the specimen for a time sufficient to obtain detectable nuclear fluorescence, according to the vector or fluorescent protein used. - *Using the pH 2 B-cherry expression vector, nuclear fluorescence is detectable ~ 3 h after electroporation. Vectors with less active promoters or fluorescent proteins directed to a large volume will likely require more time to produce an observable fluorescent signal. Using our H 2 B-GFP plasmid the signal can be detected < 2 h after electroporation*. ### DISCUSSION This technique, together with time-lapse imaging methods, allows researchers to study how these fluorescently labeled cells move or change their shapes during gastrulation. The technique can be extended when other reagents are used to study functionality of certain genes. For example, a specific gene can be over-expressed, and/or ectopically expressed, by electroporating a plasmid encoding the gene of interest. Alternatively, the functionality of a specific ligand can be down-regulated with the electroporation of a plasmid encoding the dominant-negative receptor for the ligand. A morpholino can also be used to interfere with a targeted gene pathway. ### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was funded in part by the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship (0620105 Z) to C.

40|$|Cement {{penetrability}} is a {{key factor}} in multifilament cement composites. However, the modes of action and the concepts vary because of brittle and ductile fibers. In the case of brittle fibers such as glass, high penetrability of cement products in between the bundle filaments can lead to brittle composite behavior, and therefore addition in ductility is required. In order to have efficient bundle action and high bonding, fillers can be introduced in between the <b>glass</b> <b>filaments,</b> keeping the telescopic mode of failure {{but at the same time}} improving the bond and stress transfer within the filaments of the bundle, even at late ages, resulting in a ductile and high strength composite. On the other hand, ductile fibers such as polypropylene (PP), which also developing low bonding with the cement matrix, result in ductile cement composite but with relatively low strength. Therefore, in this case good penetrability of the cement in between the filaments of the bundle is essential in order to maximize the reinforcing efficiency of the bundle by improving bond. The penetrability of the matrix into a fabric structure and especially in between the bundle filaments made up the fabric is a result of fiber- matrix compatibility, which depends on: level of opening and spaces between the filaments, bundle surface properties including wetting and chemical affinity to the cement matrix, matrix viscosity, processing of the composite, and the nature of the fabric junctions and the resulting tightening effects of the bundle, i. e., influenced by the fabric structure itself...|$|R

A large heterogeneous number of fibers, methods of fiber preparation, size selection, aerosolization, fiber size, and fiber burden measurement were noted, rendering difficult a comparison between results. By inhalation, RCF and asbestos used as positive controls produced a significant tumor increase. In some studies, a low tumor yield was found after inhalation of insulation wools; when all inhalation data were gathered, a significant tumor increase was found with GW. However, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the potential of other fiber types because, in addition to the different compositions of the fibers, differences in fiber number and sizes existed, especially in comparison with asbestos. Moreover, experiments using inoculation, especially by the intraperitoneal route revealed a carcinogenic potential of all fibers types but GFiI and SW. In these two groups a small number of animals has been investigated and the fiber characteristics were sometimes irrelevant. So far, a relationship between the carcinogenic potency and fiber dimensions has been established. Other fiber parameters may be of importance (surface chemistry, biopersistence, fiber structure, for example) but further investigations are necessary to determine the correlations between these parameters and tumor incidence. In vitro experiments have emphasized the fiber characteristics identified in vivo as playing a role in the carcinogenic potency and should be developed as a better approach of the mechanistic effects of MMF. - Environ Health Perspect 1 02 (Suppl 2 : 47 - 63 (1994) ...|$|R
