The different parts of the deterministic correlations are computed and compared. The present work aims to provide insight into the in uence of these correlations on the steady ow eld of the average-passage equation system. This is related to the deterministic models of the literature. Several steady computations are performed with the various correlations. These results are compared with the time-averaged ow eld. The impact of boundary conditions is also studied to highlight the importance of the non-uniform circumferential distribution at the so-called ‘mixing plane’. This work establishes that a non-uniform circumferential distribution is a key to ensure the success of steady computation. Furthermore, it demonstrates that full deterministic correlations are necessary to reproduce the time-averaged ow eld. Spatial correlations are thus <b>insuf</b> <b>cient</b> to model the stator wakes that interact with the rotor. Steady computations using only spatial correlations give less accurate results than those obtained without any correlation. This is a serious aw of most of the literature’s models...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Analyses of {{corporate}} governance problems in China’s state sector have mainly focused on administrative interference from state agencies. So far the in uence of Communist party institutions has received little attention. Although the in uence of ideology has diminished greatly, the Chinese Communist party continues {{to monitor and}} control economic actors {{at every level of}} the state sector. This article shows that the institutional structure through which the party executes its monitoring and control functions has a corrosive effect on the day-to-day governance of the vast majority of state enterprises. The party’s management structure aggravates the inadequate monitoring of managerial performance, weakens managerial incentives, and ampli es <b>insuf</b> <b>cient</b> corporate transparency, thereby allowing state asset managers to carve out informal spheres of autonomy. These spheres of autonomy create opportunities for insider control, economic corruption, and the illicit privatization of state assets. Effective and sustainable privatization and corporate governance reforms in China’s state sector will thus require the party to substantially diminish its authority over state sector executives. 1...|$|E
40|$|A mong {{the many}} reforms {{proposed}} for K– 12 education are changes ingovernance {{that would increase}} the power of parents to choose schoolsand thereby make the education system function more like a market. Within this set of reforms, which also includes offering greater choice among public schools {{and the opportunity to}} establish public “charter ” schools, school voucher programs are particularly controversial because they would permit parents to use public funds to secure education not only at public schools, but also at private schools. Proponents and opponents disagree about the effects of voucher programs on student achievement, on the social and racial segregation of students and on disadvantaged students. In addition, they differ on the importance of maintaining the separation between religious private schools and the state. School voucher programs currently exist only on a small scale in the United States. The main publicly funded voucher programs are in Milwaukee, Cleveland and Florida. In addition, small privately funded programs provide vouchers for low-and moderate-income students in cities such as New York City, Dayton, Ohio, and Washington, D. C. Another privately funded program, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, operates at the national level. Recent studies based primarily on U.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} and compare laboratory indices of thyroid function. Design: Practice-based retrospective study of patients ’ records. Materials and Methods: The records of all hypothyroid patients {{seen in a}} private practice in Antwerp, Belgium, between May 1984 and July 1997 were reviewed. Only records with <b>insuf</b> <b>cient</b> data were excluded; 832 patients {{were included in the}} study. Of these, 287 could also be followed during replacement therapy. Results: A score of 8 main symptoms of hypothyroidism, serum thyroxine radio-immunoassay (T 4 -RIA), serum T 4 -RIA/thyroid binding globulin (TBG), 24 h urine free triiodothyronine (T 3) were considered before and after treatment. The score of these 8 main symptoms is a reliable expression of their illness in 97 % of hypothyroid patients. 24 h urine free T 3 correlates better with the clinical status of hypothyroid patients (R 2 5 0. 30) than serum T 4 -RIA (R 2 5 0. 12), and even better than T 4 -RIA/TBG (R 2 5 0. 19).

40|$|Predictability in the {{composition}} of tropical assemblages of insect herbivores was studied using a sample of 35 952 caterpillars (Lepidoptera) from 534 species, feeding on 69 woody species from 45 genera and 23 families in a lowland rainforest in Papua New Guinea. Caterpillar assemblages were strongly dominated by a single species (median 48 % of individuals and 49 % of biomass). They were spatially and temporally constant (median normalized expected species shared (NESS) similarity between assemblages from the same host was {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 85 for three sites 8 – 17 km apart as well as for three four-month periods of the year). Further, the median presence of species was 11 months per year. Assemblages on hosts from different families and genera were virtually disjunct (NESS similarity less than 0. 05) as the caterpillars were mostly specialized to a single plant family (77 % of species) and, within families, to a single genus (66 % of species), while capable of feeding on multiple congeneric hosts (89 % of species). The dominance of caterpillar assemblages by a small number of specialized species, which also exhibited low spatial and temporal variability, permitted robust and reliable estimates of assemblage composition and between-assemblage similarity from small samples, typically less than 300 individuals per host plant.

The ow eld examined herein is the Mach 11 laminar ow over a 25 – 55 -deg blunted biconic. Experimental data are available for surface pressure and heat ux at a Knudsen number Kn = 0. 019 based on the nose radius. Simulations at a reduced freestream density (Kn = 0. 057) are performed to explore the region of viability of the numerical methods for hypersonic separated ows. A detailed and careful effort is made to address the numerical accuracy of these simulations, including iterative and grid convergence studies for Navier–Stokes and temporal,grid,andparticle convergence studies for DSMC. Goodagreement is found between the DSMC and Navier–Stokes simulation approaches for surface properties as well as velocity pro les within the recirculation zone for the reduced density case. The results obtained indicate that the failure of earlier DSMC simulations atKn = 0. 019 is due to <b>insuf</b> <b>cient</b> grid re nement within the recirculation zone.

The impact of slight variations in the manufacturing of electrodes was then investigated with a goal of linking electrode properties such as variations in thickness, electrode density and active material weight fraction with the performance of battery modules made from these cells. Results indicate that the initial capacity, the rate of capacity fade and other important aspects such as the distribution of state-of-charge from one cell to another depends on the extent of variability in the manufacturing of the electrodes.

40|$|This thesis {{questions}} {{the role of}} electronics in art. It de nes the meaning and consequences of non-functioning or out-of-order art when electrical components are used. Furthermore it presents a practical exploration and a case- study of an exhibition in order {{to answer the following}} research question: ‘What is a functioning artwork in relation to electronic art and experimental art-devices?’ Before one can identify an out-of-order artwork, the electronic art- eld has to be de ned. Electronic art can be de- scribed as a form of new media art, which uses electronics as a medium to explore systems, functions and technologi- cal possibilities. Electronic art-pieces can break in a technological sense, due to their use of electrical components. A non-functioning electrical artwork poses a problem, as it loses a major part of its meaning. When an out-of-order artwork needs to be repaired, the different styles that artists employ for creating electronic art-pieces need to be taken into account. Different strategies for dealing with irreparable artworks are discussed in this thesis. In order to prolong the lifespan of an electrical artwork, artists and institutions should both take responsibility for documenting art-pieces. Where institutions are becoming more aware of their role in the documentation process, artists could take more initiative in providing additional material. Art-devices were developed as a practical exploration of the role of electronics in art and out of curiosity towards how appliances, systems, and electrical objects function. They can be described as objects that produce light, sound or movement and can be composed with, controlled or in uenced by a user. The electronic component is the medium of the art-device and thus produces its meaning. The art-device is closely related to a musical instrument, but where an instrument creates pre-determined tones when played, the output that an art-device produces does not have to follow a logical structure. The art-devices and their respective hand-drawn schematics, user-manuals and a volume with background information were exhibited in the Tekniikan Museo in Helsinki in February 2017. From this exhibition the following could be concluded: Curiosity needs privacy, audience treats art-devices more carefully than expected and out-of-order instances occur due to bad design, <b>insuf</b> <b>cient</b> testing and empty batteries...|$|E
40|$|Every year, {{outbreaks}} of in. uenza appear {{across the world}} and cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the general population, particularly in persons with underlying conditions including asthma. Because the in. uenza virus changes constantly, man’s acquired immunity is usually only partial and therefore the population will always {{to a greater or}} lesser extent be susceptible. In asthmatics, in. uenza causes upper respiratory tract infections that frequently trigger exacerbations. Large population-based studies have estimated the morbidity and the risk of developing clinical complications in people with asthma. During in. uenza periods, hospitalisation, drug prescriptions and visits to physicians increase, and asthma exacerbations and pneumonia have been reported as the most common complications. Children with asthma are at a higher risk for complications than adults. Reasons to vaccinate asthmatics are the prevention of in. uenza-related illness and complications, including asthma exacerbations and death. However, the protective effect of in. uenza vaccination in asthmatic patients is still disputed. So far no unequivocal bene. cial effect of in. uenza vaccination in asthmatics was found in observational and experimental studies in the sense of reduction of asthma exacerbations and of other complications. Although opinions on the clinical effectiveness of in. uenza vaccination in asthmatic patients are currently based on consensus and indirect evidence, the guidelines of most Western countries advise to vaccinate patients with asthma. As a result, in asthma care, in. uenza vaccination is considered to be a cornerstone for quality of care. Despite these recommendations only a minority of asthma patients is vaccinated worldwide. Reasons for this are fear among patients that vaccination could cause in. uenza, and doubts about bene. ts and effectiveness of in. uenza vaccination amongst physicians and patients. Aim of this thesis is to provide evidence to either support or modify the policy of vaccinating asthmatic patients as is described in most western guidelines. I will focus on children, because in children asthma is the most important reason for in. uenza vaccination and asthma is the most frequent chronic disease in childhood. In chapter 2 we report on the available knowledge of the incidence of in. uenza, the natural course and the burden of disease. Incidence. gures are a prerequisite to reliably forecast the impact of preventive measures for in. uenza and calculate the number needed to treat in order to prevent one additional case of in. uenza. Likewise, incidence. gures are also needed to estimate the number of participants for preventive or therapeutic trials. We conducted a systematic review to estimate the incidence of in. uenza and concomitant morbidity and mortality in children 0 through 19 years (0 - 19 years). We searched for observational studies and placebo or non treated arms of experimental studies for information on laboratory proven in. uenza illness. From a total of 2758 papers, 356 papers were reviewed on the basis of abstract or title. Sixteen papers were added searching the reference list of these papers. Finally 28 studies met inclusion criteria. They showed a varying incidence of in. uenza with. gures up to 46 %. However, when looking at two long term observational studies and averaging seasonal. uctuations, the overall incidence of in. uenza in children was found to be between 5 % (children aged 0 - 19 years) and 9. 5 % (children aged 0 - 5 years) per year. Serious morbidity was seldom reported. In the studies selected we found no cases of mortality. Our conclusion is that, given the average incidence for in. uenza found, the self­limited character of the disease, the mild associated morbidity and the rare cases of mortality in children, one can question if in. uenza in children at a population level is a major public health problem. As a result of this outcome we advise that preventive strategies for children should be reconsidered. When investigating preventive strategies for in. uenza one should be led by the average incidence and include more seasons. In chapters 3 - 6 we present various results of our randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 696 children with asthma, aged 6 - 18 years. Parenteral vaccination with inactivated in. uenza vaccine or placebo took place approximately November 1 st, and children were followed until April 1 st of the next year. Local and systemic symptoms, possibly as a result of vaccination, and airway symptoms were reported in a diary. Symptoms scored during the. rst week after vaccination were considered to be adverse effects of the vaccination. When symptom scores reached a prede. ned level, a pharyngeal swab was taken and spirometry was performed. One week later a quality of life questionnaire was administered. Primary outcome was the number of asthma exacerbations associated with virologically proven in. uenza infection. Three hundred forty-nine children were assigned placebo, and 347 were assigned vaccine. In chapter 3, we address the adverse effects of in. uenza vaccination, especially on asthma. Because there is a constant debate that in. uenza vaccination may provoke an asthma exacerbation, a decisive answer to these doubts may affect vaccination rate. During the. rst week after vaccination, participants recorded local, in. uenza like and asthma symptoms as well as use of medication, health care use and absenteeism. As reported in previous studies, vaccine recipients reported redness and stiffness of the arm much more often than placebo recipients. For symptoms of in. uenza like illness, fever, headache and myalgia showed smaller though signi. cant differences during the. rst season, as did hoarseness during the second season, all favouring placebo. These differences may be an expression of the difference between strains used in the vaccine during the two seasons or may be a result of a difference between populations studied in the two in. uenza seasons. Except for cough during the day in the. rst season, favouring placebo, there were no differences indicating that vaccination exacerbates asthma. We conclude that in. uenza vaccination does not seem to exacerbate asthma and can be given safely to asthmatic children. In the literature there is little evidence that in. uenza vaccination reduces asthma exacerbations. In chapter 4 we report the main results of our randomised double­blind placebo-controlled trial in asthmatic children regarding the preventive effect of in. uenza vaccination on clinical illness, notably asthma exacerbations. Children reported, as described above, airway symptoms in a diary. When symptom scores reached a prede. ned level, a pharyngeal swab was taken. Primary outcome was the number of asthma exacerbations associated with virologically proven in. uenza infection. We considered a reduction in asthma exacerbations of at least 50 % as clinically relevant. Three hundred forty-nine children were assigned placebo, and 347 were assigned vaccine. Pharyngeal swabs positive for in. uenza were related to 42 asthma exacerbations, 24 in the vaccine group and 18 in the placebo group, a difference of 33 % favouring placebo (31 % after adjustment for confounders; 95 % con. dence interval, – 34 % to 161 %). In. uenza-related asthma exacerbations were of similar severity in both groups; they lasted 3. 1 days shorter in the vaccine group (95 % con. dence interval, – 6. 2 to - 0. 002 days, p= 0. 06). We conclude that in. uenza vaccination did not result in a signi. cant reduction of the number, severity, or duration of asthma exacerbations caused by in. uenza. We think additional studies, using in. uenza proven clinical illness as an endpoint, are warranted to justify routine in. uenza vaccination of children with asthma. Health-related quality of life (physical, social and emotional impairments) should be an important measure in evaluations of the management of childhood asthma. Therefore, in chapter 5, the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), a questionnaire in English to de. ne quality of life in asthmatic children, is validated for the Dutch translation. We assessed psychometric properties, responsiveness, and longitudinal and cross­sectional construct validity of the Dutch PAQLQ version. The study group consisted of 238 children (6 – 18 years) with asthma, a subset of children from our trial on in. uenza vaccination, with complete respiratory symptom diaries in the course of one winter season; each child had one (or more) PAQLQ measurement(s) concerning one (or more) week(s) with relatively many symptoms (n= 238). Each child also had one PAQLQ measurement concerning another week with relatively few symptoms. The PAQLQ scores of these weeks were compared. Additionally, in a subgroup of the study group that had experienced two or more ‘weeks with many symptoms’ (n= 101), we compared the PAQLQ scores for two different weeks with many symptoms of these children. All Cronbach’s a’s of the PAQLQ total score and domains were above 0. 70, except for Activities (a= 0. 54), indicating that the internal consistency of the questions in the questionnaire is moderate to good. Mean PAQLQ scores were signi. cantly different (p 0. 05) between a week with many symptoms and another week with many symptoms. These results indicate responsiveness of the instrument. Changes in lower respiratory tract symptoms, indicative of asthma severity, correlated better with changes in PAQLQ scores than changes in upper respiratory tract symptoms, which supports the longitudinal and cross-sectional construct validity. The assessed properties of the translation into Dutch were similar to those originally established for the PAQLQ in Canada. This study showed that the Dutch PAQLQ has adequate psychometric properties, excellent responsiveness, and that its longitudinal and cross-sectional construct validity is supported. As this questionnaire has been translated and validated in several languages it is an excellent tool for international and trans-cultural asthma research. In chapter 6 we show the effect of in. uenza vaccination on the well being of asthmatic children. Using PAQLQ, we measured the effects of in. uenza vaccination on physical, emotional and social impairments in asthmatic children. Supplementary we assessed whether in. uenza vaccination has an effect on the corresponding respiratory symptoms and spirometric parameters as well as on all their symptoms throughout the season. Compared to placebo, vaccination improved health-related quality of life in the weeks of illness related to in. uenza-positive swabs. However, no effect was found for respiratory symptoms recorded in the diaries during those weeks. Similarly, no differences were found for quality of life in all weeks of illness or for respiratory symptoms throughout the seasons. Our conclusion is that in. uenza vaccination has a moderate bene. cial effect on quality of life in in. uenza-positive weeks of illness in children with asthma. In chapter 7 we re. ect on our. ndings and conclude that, given the available information on the effectiveness of airway medication; the low overall incidence of in. uenza; the absence of direct evidence for serious complications of in. uenza infection in asthmatic children; the absence of evidence for the clinical effectiveness of in. uenza vaccination in asthmatic children; the absence of adverse effects of in. uenza vaccination and the doubts about cost-effectiveness of this preventive intervention in asthmatic children, guidelines on in. uenza vaccination should be revised and, despite the safety of vaccination, should reconsider the advice to vaccinate children with mild to moderate asthma. Future research should. rst of all focus on long term observational research, spanning more seasons, to determine the real impact of in. uenza in children with and without asthma. Whereas sentinel stations, in cooperation with national in. uenza centres, nowadays provide information on the number of in. uenza like illnesses per number of physicians consultations or at a population level, they could deliver information based on culture con. rmed illness and the burden of disease due to in. uenza in a well de. ned population at risk. Secondly, experiments in which populations in certain regions, covered by sentinel stations, would be asked to participate in vaccination trials, could measure the effect of in. uenza vaccination in the different age and disease categories, including asthma, for which vaccination is advocated but for which <b>insuf.</b> <b>cient</b> evidence for its effectiveness is currently available. In any case, experimental designs should take symptoms of patients on an individual level and symptom based measurements, such as PAQLQ, as an outcome. In this way, the updating of recommendations can be guided by medicine-based evidence wich in turn may improve the effectiveness of recommendations. Over de gehele wereld zijn er ieder jaar uitbraken van in. uenza die substantiële morbiditeit en mortaliteit teweeg brengen onder de bevolking, in het bijzonder bij personen met een onderliggend lijden zoals astma. Omdat het in. uenzavirus constant verandert is de bescherming die men na een infectie opbouwt slechts gedeeltelijk, hierdoor zal de bevolking altijd in meerdere of mindere mate ontvankelijk zijn voor het in. uenzavirus. Een in. uenza-infectie veroorzaakt bij patiënten met astma een ontsteking van de bovenste luchtwegen die vaak een astma-aanval uitlokt. Er zijn grote studies gedaan waarbij onderzocht is hoeveel ziekte er veroorzaakt wordt door in. uenza en wat de kans is op klinische complicaties bij patiënten met astma. Het aantal ziekenhuisopnames, medicijnvoorschriften en bezoeken aan een arts stijgt tijdens griepperiodes en als meest voorkomende complicaties treden astma­aanvallen en longontsteking op. Kinderen met astma lopen een groter risico op complicaties dan volwassenen. Patiënten met astma worden gevaccineerd ter voorkoming van door in. uenza veroorzaakte ziekte en de bijbehorende complicaties, waaronder astma-aanvallen en overlijden. Het beschermende effect van in. uenzavaccinatie is echter nog steeds onderwerp van discussie. Tot nu toe is in observationele en experimentele studies niet ondubbelzinnig aangetoond dat in. uenzavaccinatie het aantal astma-aanvallen of andere complicaties van in. uenza gunstig beïnvloedt. Hoewel de ideeën over de klinische effectiviteit van in. uenzavaccinatie bij patiënten met astma op dit moment zijn gebaseerd op consensus en indirect bewijs, wordt in de richtlijnen van de meeste Westerse landen geadviseerd patiënten met astma te vaccineren tegen in. uenza. Griepvaccinatie wordt dan ook gezien als een hoeksteen van de kwaliteit van de zorg bij patiënten met astma. Ondanks de genoemde aanbevelingen wordt wereldwijd slechts een minderheid van de astmapatiënten gevaccineerd. Bij patiënten bestaat er angst dat vaccinatie juist in. uenza veroorzaakt en bij patiënten én artsen blijven er twijfels bestaan over de voordelen en de effectiviteit van in. uenzavaccinatie. Dit proefschrift wil bewijs leveren ter ondersteuning of aanpassing van het in de meeste westerse landen gevoerde beleid om patiënten met astma te vaccineren tegen in. uenza. Ik beperk me daarbij tot kinderen: bij hen is astma de meest voorkomende chronische ziekte en tevens de belangrijkste reden voor griepvaccinatie. In hoofdstuk 2 beschrijven we de kennis die op dit moment aanwezig is met betrekking tot de incidentie, het natuurlijke verloop en de ziektelast van in. uenza. Incidentiecijfers zijn onontbeerlijk om de gevolgen van preventieve maatregelen tegen in. uenza te kunnen voorspellen en te berekenen hoeveel mensen gevaccineerd moeten worden om één geval van in. uenza te voorkomen. Deze cijfers zijn ook een voorwaarde om het aantal benodigde deelnemers voor preventieve of therapeutische trials te kunnen schatten. We voerden een systematische review uit om te bepalen wat de incidentie van in. uenza en de daardoor veroorzaakte morbiditeit en mortaliteit is bij kinderen van 0 tot en met 19 jaar (0 - 19 jaar). Daarbij zochten we naar informatie over, middels laboratoriumonderzoek bewezen, door in. uenza veroorzaakte ziekte in observationele studies en experimentele studies met een placebo arm of een arm waarin geen behandeling plaatsvond. Van in totaal 2758 artikelen werden 356 artikelen, op basis van het abstract of de titel, door de beoordelaars besproken. Zestien artikelen werden toegevoegd op basis van de referentielijsten van deze artikelen. Uiteindelijk voldeden 28 artikelen aan de inclusiecriteria. De incidentiecijfers van in. uenza varieerden nogal met als hoogste cijfer een incidentie van 46 %. Als we echter kijken naar de twee gevonden langjarige observationele studies, bleek de gemiddelde jaarsincidentie van in. uenza bij kinderen te liggen tussen 5 % (0 - 19 jaar) en 9. 5 % (0 - 5 jaar). Ernstige morbiditeit werd zelden beschreven en in de geselecteerde studies werd mortaliteit niet genoemd. Als we kijken naar de gemiddelde incidentie van in. uenza, het zichzelf beperkende karakter van de ziekte, de milde bijkomende morbiditeit en de zeldzaamheid van mortaliteit bij kinderen, is het de vraag of in. uenza bij kinderen op bevolkingsniveau een groot maatschappelijk gezondheidsprobleem is. Op basis van onze uitkomsten is ons advies de huidige preventieve maatregelen te heroverwegen. Daarnaast vinden we dat bij onderzoek van preventieve strategieën voor in. uenza men zich moet laten leiden door de gemiddelde incidentie én meerdere seizoenen in beschouwing moet nemen. In hoofdstuk 3 - 6 presenteren we de resultaten van ons gerandomiseerde dubbelblinde placebogecontroleerde onderzoek bij 696 kinderen met astma in de leeftijdsgroep van 6 tot en met 18 jaar. Rondom 1 november ontvingen de kinderen een injectie met geïnactiveerd in. uenzavaccin of placebo, de kinderen werden daarna gevolgd tot 1 april van het daaropvolgende jaar. Zij noteerden locale en algemene klachten ten gevolge van de vaccinatie en luchtwegklachten in een dagboekje. De genoteerde klachten in de eerste week beschouwden we als bijwerking van de vaccinatie. Als, na de eerste week, de gescoorde luchtwegklachten een van tevoren afgesproken grens bereikten, werd een keelwat afgenomen en vond een longfunctiemeting plaats. Een week later werd een kwaliteit van levenvragenlijst afgenomen. Van de deelnemende kinderen ontvingen 349 het placebovaccin en 347 het in. uenzavaccin. In hoofdstuk 3 onderzochten we de bijwerkingen van griepvaccinatie vooral met betrekking tot de gevolgen voor het astma. Omdat er al lang discussie is over de vraag of in. uenzavaccinatie een astma-aanval kan uitlokken is een duidelijk antwoord op deze vraag van belang. Dit kan belangrijke gevolgen hebben voor de vaccinatiegraad. Gedurende de eerste week na de vaccinatie noteerden de deelnemers aan de trial klachten op de plaats van de prik, griepachtige klachten en astmaklachten en tevens medicatiegebruik, gezondheidszorggebruik en afwezigheid. Conform eerdere studies rapporteerden de deelnemers die het echte vaccin ontvingen veel vaker roodheid en een stijve arm dan zij die met placebo gevaccineerd waren. Wat betreft griepachtige symptomen waren er kleinere maar wel signi. cante verschillen, ten voordele van de placebogevaccineerden, voor koorts, hoofdpijn en spierpijn in het eerste seizoen en heesheid in het tweede seizoen. Het verschil tussen de seizoenen zou te maken kunnen hebben met het verschil tussen de in het vaccin gebruikte stammen gedurende de twee seizoenen, maar kan ook een gevolg zijn van een verschil tussen de in de twee seizoenen deelnemende kinderen. Behalve een verschil voor hoesten overdag in het eerste seizoen ten voordele van de placebogevaccineerden waren er geen aanwijzingen dat vaccinatie astma-aanvallen uitlokte. Onze conclusie is daarom dat griepvaccinatie geen astma-aanvallen lijkt uit te lokken en veilig toegediend kan worden aan kinderen met astma. In de wetenschappelijke literatuur is er weinig bewijs dat griepvaccinatie astma­aanvallen voorkómt. In hoofdstuk 4 doen we verslag van de belangrijkste resultaten van ons gerandomiseerde dubbelblinde placebogecontroleerde onderzoek bij kinderen met astma naar het effect van in. uenzavaccinatie, waarbij we in het bijzonder naar astma-aanvallen keken. De deelnemende kinderen noteerden, zoals hiervoor beschreven, luchtwegklachten in een dagboekje. Als de gescoorde luchtwegklachten een van tevoren afgesproken grens bereikten, werd een keelwat afgenomen. Onze primaire uitkomstmaat was het aantal astma-aanvallen dat in verband gebracht kon worden met een virologisch bewezen in. uenza-infectie. We beschouwden een reductie van tenminste 50 % van het aantal astma-aanvallen als klinisch relevant. Van de deelnemende kinderen ontvingen 349 het placebovaccin en 347 het in. uenzavaccin. Van de gerapporteerde astma-aanvallen waren er 42 gerelateerd aan een in. uenzapositieve keelwat, 24 in de gevaccineerde groep en 18 in de placebogroep. Een verschil van 33 % ten voordele van de placebogroep (31 % na correctie voor ‘confounders’; 95 % betrouwbaarheidsinterval – 34 % tot 161 %). In. uenzagerelateerde astma­aanvallen waren even ernstig in beide groepen; ze duurden 3, 1 dag korter in de vaccingroep (95 % betrouwbaarheidsinterval, – 6, 2 tot – 0, 002 dag, p= 0, 06). Onze conclusie is dat in. uenzavaccinatie niet resulteerde in een signi. cante vermindering van het aantal, de ernst en de duur van in. uenzagerelateerde astma-aanvallen. We zijn van mening dat aanvullende studies, waarbij ziekte in combinatie met bewijs voor in. uenza als eindpunt gebruikt wordt, no...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of agricultural plant and microbial biotechnology {{products in the}} United States of America has a rich history that re fl ects the challenges {{the federal government has}} faced in the development of appropriate rules and standards needed to determine their safety to humans and the environment. Several factors – the <b>insuf</b> fi <b>cient</b> global food supply, loss or curtailment of the use of older chemistries to control pests due to risks and environmental persistence, the rising demand for safer food commodities, and the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of agriculture in this and other countries – have added to these challenges. The chapter introduces the U. S. Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology (“Framework”), and the roles of its members: the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in regulating agricultural biotechnology in accordance with U. S. federal statutes. The Framework agencies use scienti fi c, risk-based approaches in carrying out their regulatory responsibilities for the products of biotechnology. Relying on their experiences with risk assessment and risk management policies and principles for more conventional products, the Framework agencies have adapted new risk and exposure scenarios into their evaluations to ensure the safe use of these products in agriculture...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, we {{synthesize}} {{two powerful}} theories: {{the theory of}} symbolic violence and the theory of social death. The result is a new concept, {{a new way to}} conceptualize social structures, institutions that breed social and physical death, what we call anticultures. Modern Segregation In the summer of 2003, after teaching a graduate seminar in Heidelberg, I (i. e., the fi rst author) found myself stranded for 2 days in Frankfurt, Germany, because my outbound fl ight was canceled. Little did I know that I {{was in the middle of}} the great-est heat wave to strike Europe since 1540, according to the World Meteorological Organization (2012). While I survived, approximately 50, 000 Europeans did not (Robine et al. 2008). This heat wave expressed the weakness in the social fabric in Europe but especially France. Why France? What failed there? It was not that the physical temperatures were higher but that social conditions were different in France than elsewhere in Europe. While many blamed the government, others looked deeper into the sociocultural fabric of France. After working to address the issue, Stéphane Mantion, an of fi cial with the French Red Cross offered this explanation, “The French family structure is more dislocated than elsewhere in Europe, and prevailing social attitudes hold that once older people are closed behind their apartment doors or in nursing homes, they are someone else’s problem. These thousands of elderly victims didn’t die from a heat wave as such, but from the isolation and <b>insuf</b> fi <b>cient</b> assistance they lived wit...|$|R
40|$|Seaweeds {{and their}} {{extracts}} {{have been used}} for centuries in agriculture to improve plant growth and impart stress tolerance. There has been historical evidence that phytohormones present in seaweeds lead to these effects, but questions of this mode of action have always been raised. By quantifying phytohormones in seaweed extracts coupled with the use of phytohormone biosynthetic and insensitive mutants, we conclude that the phytohormone levels present within the extracts are <b>insuf</b> 01 <b>cient</b> to cause signi 01 cant effects in plants when extracts are applied at recommended rates. However, components within seaweed extracts may modulate innate pathways for the biosynthesis of phytohormones in plants. Phytohormone pro 01 les of plant tissue extracts were analyzed following root application of a commercial seaweed extract produced from Ascophyllum nodosum (ANE) to in vitro-grown Arabidopsis plants. We found an increase in total concentration of cytokinins (CKs), in particular, of trans-zeatin-type CKs, 24 and 96 h after ANE application, with an increase in cis-zeatintype CKs observed at 144 h. Concomitantly, increases in abscisic acid (ABA) and ABA catabolite levels were observed whereas auxin levels were reduced. Additionally, the pro 01 le of transcripts revealed that CK biosynthetic genes were upregulated, whereas the CK catabolic genes were repressed at 24 and 96 h following ANE application. Not surprisingly, the transcripts of ABA biosynthetic genes were increased whereas the auxin biosynthetic genes were repressed. These corroborated 01 ndings are the 01 rst to help explain the underlying physiological bene 01 ts derived from the application of ANE to plants. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) has rapidly {{become an important}} tool in clinical medicine and biological research. Its functional variant (functional magnetic {{resonance imaging}}; fMRI) is currently {{the most widely used}} method for brain mapping and studying the neural basis of human cognition. While the method is widespread, there is <b>insuf</b> � <b>cient</b> knowledge of the physiological basis of the fMRI signal to interpret the data con � dently with respect to neural activity. This paper reviews the basic principles of MRI and fMRI, and subsequently discusses in some detail the relationship between the blood-oxygenlevel-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal and the neural activity elicited during sensory stimulation. To examine this relationship, we conducted the � rst simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and BOLD responses. Depending on the temporal characteristics of the stimulus, a moderate to strong correlation was found between the neural activity measured with microelectrodes and the BOLD signal averaged over a small area around the microelectrode tips. However, the BOLD signal had signi � cantly higher variability than the neural activity, indicating that human fMRI combined with traditional statistical methods underestimates the reliability of the neuronal activity. To understand the relative contribution of several types of neuronal signals to the haemodynamic response, we compared local � eld potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit activity (MUA) with high spatio-temporal fMRI responses recorded simultaneously in monkey visual cortex. At recording sites characterized by transient responses, only the LFP signal was signi � cantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Furthermore, the LFPs had the largest magnitude signal and linear systems analysis showed that the LFPs were better than the MUAs at predicting the fMRI responses. These � ndings, together with an analysis of the neural signals, indicate that the BOLD signal primarily measures the input and processing of neuronal information within a region and not the output signal transmitted to other brain regions...|$|R
