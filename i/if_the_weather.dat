The graduating class processes onto the quad to the designated seating area directly in front of Alumni Hall as a hired brass ensemble plays the Pomp and Circumstance March. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is inclement, commencement takes place in the Thomas F. Sullivan Arena. The academic processional of the College's Mace, color guard, graduands, members of the monastic community, and the faculty can take over twenty minutes. The national anthem is performed by a student or students selected. The performer is usually a member of the Saint Anselm College Choir. Next, a student selected by the administration delivers the coveted student address that he/she submitted for consideration. This is followed by the College President's address. The faculty award of the year from the Saint Anselm College Chapter of the American Association of University Professors is presented to a deserving faculty member. The student award for service and citizenship is presented to a community service-minded senior in recognition for an outstanding community project. This award is not given every year, only when there is consensus among administration that a particular student is deserving. Honorary doctorates are then conferred among selected honorary degree recipients. After the keynote address by one of the honorary degree recipients, the graduates are awarded their degrees of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. After the benediction, graduates flip their graduation tassel to the opposite side of their cap and process out to the recessional song as the Abbey bells resound throughout campus. Finally, family and friends meet with the new graduates to take photographs.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{confusion}} in the primary sources over what was the target in Dresden, {{whether it was the}} marshalling yards near the centre or centre of the built up area.

If clouds obscured Dresden but Chemnitz was clear, Chemnitz was the target. If both were obscured, they would bomb the centre of Dresden using H2X radar. The mix of bombs for the Dresden raid was about 40% incendiaries—much closer to the RAF city busting mix than that the USAAF usually used in precision bombardment. Taylor compares this 40% mix with the raid on Berlin on 3 February, where the ratio was 10% incendiaries. This was a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, as Pomerol's {{transition}} to a red wine producing district was completed, Cabernet Franc was the dominant grape variety. However, an early spring frost in 1956 killed {{a large portion of}} the Cabernet Franc plantings and many estates took this event as an opportunity to replant with the higher yielding and earlier ripening Merlot. Despite Merlot's tendency to suffer from coulure <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is cold and rainy during flowering, the grape quickly rose to prominence in Pomerol and has become the grape most closely associated with the region. Nevertheless, very few Pomerols are pure Merlot and Cabernet Franc is still valued for the tannic structure and acidity it gives, which can add longevity and aging potential to the wines. In fact, as the trend of the late 20th and early 21st century towards harvesting Merlot later and at increasingly higher sugar levels has continued, the role of Cabernet Franc in balancing the opulent but potentially flabby nature of over ripe Merlot has become even more appreciated by Pomerol winemakers.|$|E

40|$|The {{habitable}} zone {{concept is}} important because it focuses the scientific search for extraterrestrial life and aids the planning of future telescopes. Recent work has shown that planets near {{the outer edge of the}} habitable zone might not actually be able to stay warm and habitable if CO$_ 2 $ outgassing rates are not large enough to maintain high CO$_ 2 $ partial pressures against removal by silicate weathering. In this paper I use simple equations for the climate and CO$_ 2 $ budget of a planet in the habitable zone that can capture the qualitative behavior of the system. With these equations I derive an analytical formula for an effective outer edge of the habitable zone, including limitations imposed by the CO$_ 2 $ outgassing rate. I then show that climate cycles between a Snowball state and a warm climate are only possible beyond this limit <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> rate in <b>the</b> Snowball climate is smaller than the CO$_ 2 $ outgassing rate (otherwise stable Snowball states result).

25|$|Larvae hatch about 12–21 {{hours after}} the eggs have been laid. The larvae are a cream color. C. hominivorax larvae dive head-first into {{whatever}} food source is nearest, and burrow deeper, eating into live flesh if available. This results in a pocket-like lesion that causes severe pain to the host. C. macellaria larvae only feed on the necrotic tissue of a wound. After 5 to 7 days, the larvae drop and {{move away from the}} food source to pupate. The larvae burrow into the first layer of topsoil, beneath leaves or garbage, and begin their pupation. The pupa is a dark brown color. This stage can last from 7 days at a warm temperature to as long as two months <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is much colder. The adults emerge and spend a day or two finishing maturity. Adults of C. hominivorax breed only once in their lifetimes. Sexually mature adults breed 3–4 days after emerging from the pupa. Males mature rapidly, and spend their time waiting and eating nearby vegetation and the nectar of flowers. The females, however, are predatory, and feed on the fluids from live wounds. The females can fly long distances to find a mate. The adult flies of this species live around two to three weeks.|$|E
25|$|Schools in Newfoundland, {{especially}} in outport settlements, faced many problems and obstacles. The {{success of the}} schools {{was influenced by the}} conditions within the settlement, and these conditions often affected student attendance, payments, learning, and so forth. For example, conditions which affected the population were such things as illnesses (or epidemics) such as the flu, fever, whooping cough, smallpox, measles, etc. The weather also posed problems, severe snowstorms in the winter months often closed schools for days; and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> was too cold, children could not make it to school or could not keep the school in fuel for heat. The fishery affected the school and its attendance greatly. During the fishing season, children were often needed to help out in the fishery and could not attend school. Also, in smaller settlements, the teacher was allowed to attend the fishery in order to supplement their low teaching salaries; therefore, closing the school during that season. A failure in the fishery also had severe consequences as parents could not pay subscriptions to the school. Poverty also led to a lack of clothes and shoes which meant children could not be sent to school. The N.S.S., unlike other schools, tried their best to counter these obstacles. For example, the N.S.S. would send shipments of clothes and shoes from England to Newfoundland to give to poverty-stricken families so their children could continue to attend school. Also, other schools in Newfoundland had trouble procuring and paying qualified teachers. The N.S.S., however, were able to recruite qualified teachers who were trained at the National School Society Training School in England {{and they were able to}} pay their teachers better salaries.|$|E
25|$|In the {{swirling}} cloud and snow they abandoned plans to descend via the sharp, unclimbed east ridge. Grove’s partner, Edward North Buxton, suggested {{remaining on the}} summit {{for a couple of}} hours to see <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> would improve, but the rest of the party rejected his proposal, recognising there was neither sufficient daylight left for them to descend the impossibly exposed and unknown east ridge, nor to down-climb the sheer route they had just ascended. They chose instead to attempt a descent down the unknown southern side of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. They found it trying work to descending the steep ice bank from the summit in the furious storm, but managed eventually to find their way down through one stone-raked couloir to another on the mountain’s south-east face. As twilight fell they reached the head of the Glacier de Bionnassay Italian which formed the northern arm of the huge Glacier du Miage. Here, at a height well above that of the Col de Miage (3,300 m) upon which they could look down, they found refuge amongst rocks beside the steep glacier. They tried to rest there, having had nothing to drink all day except a little brandy and some tasteless wine that they had brought with them; glacial meltwater flowing beneath the rocks on which they sat were totally inaccessible to them. They were also wet through from the storm which by now had passed over, revealing a clear, starry sky. The trickles of water ceased as the temperature dropped below freezing and the night slowly became calm until the silence was shattered by the roar of rockfall over their heads. Abandoning their bivouac site, they took refuge amongst steeply sloping rocks which offered protection from stonefall, but no comfort whatsoever. After a miserable night’s rest, dawn eventually arrived and the ice-rimed party again began to descend the glacier, led by their guide, Cachat. Eight hours later they arrived at the village of St Gervais and sought appropriate refreshment in a well-to-do hotel, much to the disapprobation of the other guests who regarded their appearance and clothing with horror.|$|E

40|$|The cryptoendolithic {{habitat of}} the Antarctic Dry Valleys has been {{considered}} a good analogy for past Martian ecosystems, if life arose on the planet. Yet cryptoendoliths are thought to favor the colonization of rocks that have a preexisting porous structure, e. g., sandstones.

However, the production of oxalic acid, by these lichendominated communities, and its weathering potential indicate {{that it could be}} an aid in rock colonization, enabling endoliths to inhabit a wider variety of rock types.

Differences between the colonized and uncolonized layers also occur to varying extents within colonized rocks of different mineralogical maturities. The results confirm that cryptoendoliths modify their habitat through the production of oxalic acid and suggest that over time this directly increases the porosity of their inhabited layer, potentially increasing the biomass it can support...|$|R
