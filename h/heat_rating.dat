40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{starting}} powder particle size and <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> on spark plasma sintering of Fe-Ni alloys was investigated, with the particle powder size varying from 3 to 70 μm and <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> from 50 to 150 °C/min. The {{effect of the}} starting powder particle size was more obvious when comparing 3 -FeNi and 70 -FeNi at all <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> with the former having better density and hardness than the latter. Sintered densities close to theoretical (≥ 99 %) were achieved for a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 50 °C/min for the different starting particle size powders, and decreased with increasing <b>heating</b> <b>rate.</b> The average grain size of alloys sintered at 150 °C/min was ~ 34 % smaller than those sintered at 50 °C/min. The porosity content of the sintered samples increased with increasing heating for the same particle size. The shrinkage rate depends on both <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> and particle size. At a particle size of 3 μm and a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 50 oC/min, three peaks were observed indicative of the phenomena responsible for good densification. As the <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> increases, only two peaks and one peak are observed at <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> of 100 and 150 oC/min, respectively. This suggests that, unlike high <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> the longer processing time at low <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> allows the three phenomena to take place. The hardness measurement revealed a steady decrease with increasing <b>heating</b> <b>rate.</b> At a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 150 °C/min the particles were well packed but no typical dimple structure of a ductile material was observed.

40|$|Uranium based binary and {{ternary alloy}} fuel is a {{possible}} candidate for advanced fast spectrum reactors with long refueling intervals and reduced liner <b>heat</b> <b>rating</b> [1]. An important metal fuel issue that can impact the fuel performance is the fuel-cladding gap closure, and fuel axial growth. The dimensional change in the fuel during irradiation {{is due to a}} superposition of the thermal expansion of the fuel due to heating, volumetric changes due to possible phase transformations that occur during heating and the swelling due to fission gas retention. The volumetric changes due to phase transformation depend both on the thermodynamics of the alloy system and the kinetics of phase change reactions that occur at the operating temperature. The nucleation and growth of fission gas bubbles that contributes to fuel swelling is also influenced by the local fuel chemistry and the microstructure. Once the fuel expands and contacts the clad, expansion in the radial direction is constrained by the clad, and the overall deformation of the fuel clad assembly depends upon the dynamics of the contact problem. The neutronics portion of the problem is also inherently coupled with microstructural evolution in terms of constituent redistribution and phase transformation. Because of the complex nature of the problem, a series of test problems have been defined with increasing complexity with the objective of capturing the fuel-clad interaction in complex fuels subjected {{to a wide range of}} irradiation and temperature conditions.

Three pin cross-sections were selected to study the radial concentrations of U, Np, Pu and Am in the fuel, the fuel and fission product compositions of the filled central void, the metallic and ceramic precipitates, and the fuel-clad interactions by X-ray microanalysis. The end-of-life O/M ratio of the fuel was investigated by X-ray diffraction. A strong radial redistribution of Np, Pu and Am to the gap is marked. There is a pronounced axial fuel transport along the central void to {{the upper and lower}} fuel pin ends. An influence of the pellet parameters on the relocation phenomena was not stated. The end-of-life O/M ratio of the upper end fuel region is 1. 95. The maximum inner clad corrosion is observed in the hottest upper end clad region with about 20 #mu#m thickness. A high linear <b>heat</b> <b>rating</b> is assumed in this pin region, because the central void and the gap region are completely filled with fuel up to about 60 % PuO_ 2 and high fractions of Np and Am. The thermal conductivity of the fuel is low due to the reduced O/M fuel ratio. Both effects may increase the inner clad temperature and the fuel centre temperature significantly. (orig.)
