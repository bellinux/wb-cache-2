40|$|A {{method to}} {{construct}} fractal surfaces by recurrent <b>fractal</b> <b>curves</b> is provided. First we construct <b>fractal</b> interpolation <b>curves</b> using a recurrent iterated functions system(RIFS) with function scaling factors and estimate their box-counting dimension. Then {{we present a}} method of construction of wider class of fractal surfaces by <b>fractal</b> <b>curves</b> and Lipschitz functions and calculate the box-counting dimension of the constructed surfaces. Finally, we combine both methods to give more flexible constructions of fractal surfaces...|$|R
25|$|In mathematics, the Menger sponge (also {{known as}} the Menger {{universal}} curve) is a <b>fractal</b> <b>curve.</b> It is a three-dimensional generalization of the Cantor set and Sierpinski carpet, though it is slightly different from a Sierpinski sponge. It was first described by Karl Menger in 1926, in his studies {{of the concept of}} topological dimension.|$|E
25|$|This idea {{of being}} {{detailed}} relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or fractal dimension greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric shapes are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 {{the length of the}} original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same reason as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a fractal dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The <b>fractal</b> <b>curve</b> divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its fractal dimension.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of a fractal object is reiterated in its magnifications.

40|$|A Fokker Planck {{equation}} on <b>fractal</b> <b>curves</b> is obtained, {{starting from}} Chapmann-Kolmogorov equation on <b>fractal</b> <b>curves.</b> This is done using the recently developed calculus on fractals, which {{allows one to}} write differential equations on <b>fractal</b> <b>curves.</b> As an important special case, the diffusion and drift coefficients are obtained, for suitable transition probability to get the diffusion equation on <b>fractal</b> <b>curves.</b> This equation is of first order in time, and, in space variable it involves derivatives of order α, α being the dimension of the curve. The solution of this equation with localized initial condition shows deviation from ordinary diffusion behaviour due to underlying fractal space in which diffusion is taking place. An exact solution of this equation manifests a subdiffusive behaviour. The dimension of the fractal path can be estimated from the distrubution function. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

2500|$|This {{also leads}} to {{understanding}} a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are [...] "nowhere differentiable". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot {{be measured in}} traditional ways. To elaborate, in {{trying to find the}} length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of measuring with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy <b>fractal</b> <b>curve</b> such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the next}} {{milestones}} came in 1904, when Helge von Koch, extending ideas of Poincaré and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the Koch snowflake. Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when Wacław Sierpiński constructed his famous triangle then, one year later, his carpet. By 1918, two French mathematicians, Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia, though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what are now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping complex numbers and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about attractors and repellors (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important {{in the study of}} fractals. Very shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, Felix Hausdorff expanded the definition of [...] "dimension", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have noninteger dimensions. The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by Paul Lévy, who, in his 1938 paper Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole described a new <b>fractal</b> <b>curve,</b> the Lévy C curve.|$|E

40|$|In {{complex systems}} with fractal {{properties}} the scale invariance {{has an important}} rule to classify different statistical properties. In two dimensions the Loewner equation can classify all the <b>fractal</b> <b>curves.</b> Using the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (WM) function as the drift of the Loewner equation we introduce a large class of <b>fractal</b> <b>curves</b> with discrete scale invariance (DSI). We show that the fractal dimension of the curves can be extracted from the diffusion coefficient of the trend of the variance of the WM function. We argue that, up to the fractal dimension calculations, all the WM functions follow {{the behavior of the}} corresponding Brownian motion. Our study opens a way to classify all the <b>fractal</b> <b>curves</b> with DSI.

40|$|Using {{the moving}} frame and invariants, any {{discrete}} curve in ^ 3 could be uniquely identified by its centroaffine curvatures and torsions. In this paper, {{depending on the}} affine curvatures of the <b>fractal</b> <b>curves,</b> such as Koch curve and Hilbert curve, we can clearly describe their iterative regularities. Interestingly, by the affine curvatures, the <b>fractal</b> <b>curves</b> can be quantified and encoded accordingly to a sequence. Hence, {{it is more convenient}} for future reference. Given three starting points, we can directly generate the affine Koch curve and affine Hilbert curve at the step n, ∀ n∈Z^+. Certainly, if the initial three points are standard, the curve is the traditional Koch curve or Hilbert curve. By this method, the characteristic of some <b>fractal</b> <b>curves</b> which look like irregular could be quantified, and the regularities would become more obvious.
