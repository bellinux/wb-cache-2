5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Since {{the demise}} {{of what has been}} {{labelled}} as the policy-implementation paradigm, the heyday of implementation research appears to be over. This suggests that the issues going back to the ‘top-down/bottom-up’ controversy have been resolved. Central in this article is the exploration of how these issues are being dealt with in contemporary implementation studies. An <b>issue</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> one of the ‘too many variables’ seems to have been settled, especially in quantitative studies. Other <b>issues,</b> however, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> theory/practice relationship, the multi-layer problem and the policy/politics nexus appear to have remained relatively unsolved problems. Solutions are explored how to deal with them when doing implementation research...|$|R

A total number of 886 candidates contesting in 364 seats, while 41 seats were without contest.|$|R
5|$|After {{not being}} {{selected}} to become Labour's {{candidate in the}} 2000 London mayoral election, Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the congestion charge, Oyster card, and articulated buses, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of London Underground. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was re-elected in 2004, expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012, losing both to the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson. In 2016, accused of bringing the party into disrepute, he was suspended from Labour.|$|E
5|$|In March 624, Muhammad {{led some}} three hundred warriors in {{a raid on}} a Meccan {{merchant}} caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for the caravan at Badr. Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded the Muslims. A Meccan force was sent to protect the caravan {{and went on to}} confront the Muslims upon receiving word that the caravan was safe. The Battle of Badr commenced. Though outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle, killing at least forty-five Meccans with fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl. Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were ransomed. Muhammad and his followers saw the victory as confirmation of their faith and Muhammad ascribed the victory as assisted from an invisible host of angels. The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan verses, dealt with practical problems of government and <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> distribution of spoils.|$|E

25|$|Jeffrey Herbst {{has written}} {{extensively}} on the impact of state organization in Africa. He notes, because the borders were artificially created, they generally do not conform to “typical demographic, ethnographic, and topographic boundaries.” Instead, they were manufactured by colonialists to advance their political goals. This led to large scale <b>issues,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> division of ethnic groups; and small scale issues, such as families’ homes being separated from their farms.|$|E

Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th {{century the}} East–West Schism {{took place between}} Rome and Constantinople, {{resulting}} in a separation between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church (with both claiming to represent the sole legitimate continuation of the original Church).

Prior to that, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church had frequently been in conflict, particularly during the periods of iconoclasm and the Photian schism.|$|E

25|$|Kuhn's {{approach}} to the history and philosophy of science focuses on conceptual <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> practice of Normal Science, influence of historical events, emergence of scientific discoveries, nature of scientific revolutions and progress through scientific revolutions. What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing traditional thought to earlier investigators, Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities. Such an approach is largely commensurate with the general historical school of non-linear history.|$|E
25|$|Pius XII {{delivered}} numerous {{speeches to}} medical professionals and researchers.

He also took on <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> uses of medicine in terminally ill persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, {{and the rights of}} family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.|$|E
25|$|The Reformed Churches (Liberated) are {{conservative}} in doctrine and practice.

Liturgically, they favour {{the use of the}} Genevan Psalter in their worship services, although in the last decade a number of classical hymns has also been approved for use in the worship service. In recent years evangelical influences have become stronger (e.g. a more contemporary style of the worship, including new songs and hymns and the use of a praise band). A minority of the members and ministers are questioning some traditional doctrines, and are asking for a different approach on <b>issues</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ordination of women, homosexual relationships, etc. A large middle group, however, wants to hold on to classical Calvinism.|$|E

This was of great concern to the British government since its trade represented a sixth of the British national income. It was decided to fix the problems through what is now called Pitt’s India Act. This act solved the issues of corruption and it invested powers in the Governor-General to act in the interest of King and Country to stop an <b>issue</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Mangalore from happening again.|$|R
