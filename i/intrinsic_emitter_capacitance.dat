40|$|A first direct {{measurement}} of the minority-carrier transit time in a transparent heavily doped emitter layer is reported. The value was obtained by a high-frequency conductance method recently developed and used for low-doped Si. The transit time coupled with the steady-state current enables {{the determination of the}} quasi-static charge stored in the emitter and the quasi-static <b>emitter</b> <b>capacitance.</b> Using a transport model, from the measured transit time, the value for the minority-carrier diffusion coefficient and mobility is estimated. The measurements were done using a heavily doped emitter of the Si p(+) -n-p bipolar transistor. The new result indicates that the position-averaged minority-carrier diffusion coefficients may be much smaller than the corresponding majority-carrier values for emitters having a concentration ranging from about 3 x 10 to the 19 th per cu cm to 10 to the 20 th per cu cm...|$|R

Experimental comparison of HBT's and HEBT's {{has been made}} based on the dc and the RF performance. HBT's have higher current gains than those of HEBT's in the high current regime, while HEBT's offer a smaller offset voltage and better uniformity in dc characteristics across the wafer. The current gain and cutoff frequency of the HEBT with a 150 angstroms emitter set-back layer are {{comparable to those of}} HBT's. DC (differential) current gains of 600 (900) and 560 (900) were obtained at a collector current density of 2. 5 × 104 A/cm 2 for the HBT and HEBT, respectively. The cutoff frequencies are 37 and 31 GHz for the HBT and HEBT, respectively.

40|$|Optical phase-array antennas {{can be used}} {{to control}} not only the angular {{distribution}} but also the polarization of fluorescence from quantum emitters. The emission pattern of the resulting system is determined by the properties of the antenna, the properties of the emitters and the strength of the antenna-emitter coupling. Here we show that Fourier polarimetry {{can be used to}} characterize these three contributions. To this end, we measured the angle and Stokes-parameter resolved emission of bullseye plasmon antennas as well as spiral antennas excited by an ensemble of emitters.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{limitation of}} Silicon bipolar transistors is the inherent tradeoff between the dc current gain and the base resistance. One can overcome this limitation of Si bipolar transistors by introducing Germanium {{into the base}} material. In last several decades, silicon-germanium (SiGe) technology has come into the global electronics marketplace for its better noise performance {{in terms of the}} minimum noise figure, high speed performance, high cut-off frequency, low base <b>emitter</b> <b>capacitance,</b> low base resistance, high current density. As noise is a component in the transistors that degrades the performance of mobile wireless receivers, amplifiers and oscillators from meeting the essential requirements imposed on them while working at high frequencies in the GHz range.

In this paper, an accurate noise model of SiGe HBT having 0. 18 µm base width is being presented by observing the behaviour of its noise parameters, that is, minimum noise figure (NFmin), base transit time and a variety of analytical equations are being used to analyse and to compare the minimum noise figure NFmin {{as a function of the}} Ge concentration for rectangular or box type profile and the triangular profile of SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor for the better performance.

30|$|There {{have been}} various methodologies {{proposed}} which {{attempt to reduce}} temporal instabilities. Thermal annealing or electrostatic seasoning, to remove residual surfactants and non-uniform emitter profiles, {{are perhaps the most}} common and certainly the most simple and readily implemented [160]. During thermal annealing the cathode assemblies are heated to temperatures in excess of 300 °C under high vacuum conditions. This out-gases the emitter, removing weakly surface bound chemisobed species. This increases the work function uniformity {{across the surface of the}} emitter. Such out-gassing techniques are also useful in emitter recovery following an arcing event. Arcing events stimulate high current flow which heats and subsequently out-gases the emitter. This out-gassing can lead to further transient arcs which, if allowed to continue, will degrade the emitter. If the emitter is initially well out-gassed any local arcs will only marginally increase the cavity pressure and the emitter will stabilise more rapidly. Annealing is also employed to enhance the pressure of the vacuum cavity, making local plasma formation increasingly unlikely. In the case of electrostatic seasoning, the extraction electric field is slowly ramped up to around 80 % of the nominal emission voltage. The emitters are then left emitting for tens to hundreds of hours to increase the surface smoothness of the emitter and hence, stabilise the emission current. Such approaches are critical in achieving <b>intrinsic</b> <b>emitter</b> stability, and though feedback techniques have been employed to artificially control the stability, engineering intrinsic stability remains central to the formation of a long-term stable emitter. In feedback based systems, in the same way as conventional TE generator designs, the anode current is monitored and the extraction voltage adjusted accordingly to maintain a known, safe, emission current. Though a viable and widely adopted approach to ensuring emitter stability, the slow response times of the feedback loop cannot entirely remove transient effects, such as arcing events, and only careful design of the electron source can facilitate this.|$|R

40|$|Enhanced field {{emission}} (EFE) presents the main impediment to higher acceleration gradients in superconducting niobium (Nb) radiofrequency cavities for particle accelerators. The strength, number {{and sources of}} EFE sites strongly depend on surface preparation and handling. The main objective of this thesis project is to systematically investigate the sources of EFE from Nb, to evaluate the best available surface preparation techniques with respect to resulting {{field emission}}, and to establish an optimized process to minimize or eliminate EFE. To achieve these goals, a scanning field emission microscope (SFEM) was designed and built as an extension to an existing commercial scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the SFEM chamber of ultra high vacuum, a sample is moved laterally in a raster pattern under a high voltage anode tip for EFE detection and localization. The sample is then transferred under vacuum to the SEM chamber equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer for individual emitting site characterization. Compared to other systems built for similar purposes, this apparatus has low cost and maintenance, high operational flexibility, considerably bigger scan area, as well as reliable performance. EFE sources from planar Nb have been studied after various surface preparation, including chemical etching and electropolishing, combined with ultrasonic or high-pressure water rinse. Emitters have been identified, analyzed and the preparation process has been examined and improved based on EFE results. As a result, field-emission-free or near field-emission-free surfaces at ~ 140 MV/m have been consistently achieved with the above techniques. Characterization on the remaining emitters leads {{to the conclusion that}} no evidence of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>emitters,</b> i. e., no fundamental electric field limit induced by EFE, has been observed up to ~ 140 MV/m.

40|$|Highly-efficient, {{low-voltage}} organic {{light emitting}} diodes (OLED) are well suitable for post-processing integration onto the top metal layer of CMOS devices. The operation of OLEDs on active matrix CMOS substrates requires a top-emitting, low-voltage OLED stack. Low operating voltage devices can be achieved applying the concept of electrical doping of the charge transport layers of the OLED. Devices with very high power efficiency can be prepared when combining the concept of electrical doping with highly efficient emitter systems. The typical device architecture is the so-called p-i-n- stacking (<b>intrinsic</b> <b>emitter</b> layer and blocking layers sandwiched between doped p- and n-type transport layers). Although OLED-on-CMOS micro-displays are on the market already, those devices have not yet been shown with p-i-n technology, i. e. with low operating voltage at high brightness. Red, orange, white, green and blue OLED-stacks with doped charge transport layers were prepared on various CMOS test substrates. The different devices were compared with respect to their performance (current, luminance, voltage, luminance dependence on viewing angle, optical outcoupling etc.). Low operating voltages of 2. 4 V at 100 cd/m² for the red p-i-n type phosphorescent emitting OLED stack, 2. 5 V at 100 cd/m² (3. 3 V@ 1000 cd/m²) for the orange phosphorescent emitting OLED stack and 3. 2 V at 100 cd/m² (4. 7 V@ 1000 cd/m²) for the white fluorescent emitting OLED have been achieved. By monolithically combining OLED with CMOS circuitry in a single device, specific OLED advantages (efficiency, low voltage, high brightness, spectral characteristics (VIS/NIR) allow to address several new and alternative applications, going far beyond the current major application in small and medium displays. This is especially based on CMOS capabilities for implementation of various sensing devices (e. g., photodetectors). By OLED-on-CMOS technology, it becomes possible to supplement integrated optical sensors by an efficient and stable light source inside the silicon, both driven, read-out and controlled by embedded CMOS circuitry. Moreover, the light emitter is placed above the CMOS electronics, therefore saving expensive chip area without requiring additional space. That combination allows advanced devices and applications, e. g., OLED microdisplays with embedded image detector (camera), or optoelectronic sensors with embedded light source. Applications address mainly two areas: advanced microdisplays (e. g., head-mounted display with integrated eye-tracking), and optical sensors (e. g., light barriers, lab-on-chip, optocouplers) ...|$|R

40|$|We present {{adaptive}} optics JHKs imaging observations of three main-sequence late B-type stars {{listed in the}} Lindroos Catalogue: HD 123445, HD 127971 and HD 129791. Given their spectral types, these stars should not be X-ray emitters. However, they have been detected by ROSAT and their X-ray emission {{has been attributed to}} possible unresolved late-type companions. We have carried out near-IR observations with ADONIS at the ESO 3. 6 m but have not detected any late-type companions close to HD 127971 and HD 129791. This result leads us to conclude that either (i) they are spectroscopic binaries with unresolved low-mass companions, or (ii) they are <b>intrinsic</b> X-ray <b>emitters.</b> While the former case would be consistent with the reported high multiplicity of early-type (A and B) stars, the latter would yield a revision of stellar activity theories which do not predict X-ray emission from these stars. On the other hand, HD 123445 does indeed show visual companions, namely an apparent subarcsecond faint (Ks= 10 mag) binary system at a projected separation of 5 " from the late-B type star. The JHKs magnitudes and colors of the components are consistent with a pair of Pre Main Sequence (PMS) K-type stars at 140 pc, i. e. possible members of the Upper Centaurus Lupus association.

40|$|The {{importance}} of considering near-field effects on photon recycling and spontaneous emission in a thermophotovoltaic device is investigated. Fluctuational electrodynamics {{is used to}} calculate external luminescence from a photovoltaic cell as a function of emitter type, vacuum gap thickness between emitter and cell, and cell thickness. The observed changes in external luminescence suggest strong modifications of photon recycling caused by the presence of the emitter. Photon recycling for propagating modes is affected by reflection at the vacuum-emitter interface and is substantially decreased by the leakage towards the emitter through tunneling of frustrated modes. In addition, spontaneous emission by the cell can be strongly enhanced by the presence of an emitter supporting surface polariton modes. It follows that using a radiative recombination model with a spatially uniform radiative lifetime, even corrected by a photon recycling factor, is inappropriate. Applying the principles of detailed balance, and accounting for non-radiative recombination mechanisms, the impact of external luminescence enhancement in the near field on thermophotovoltaic performance is investigated. It is shown that unlike isolated cells, the external luminescence efficiency is not solely dependent on cell quality, but significantly increases as the vacuum gap thickness decreases below 400 nm for the case of an <b>intrinsic</b> silicon <b>emitter.</b> In turn, the open-circuit voltage and power density benefit from this enhanced external luminescence toward the emitter. This benefit is larger as cell quality, characterized by the contribution of non-radiative recombination, decreases. Comment: 44 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, 4 supplemental figure...|$|R
