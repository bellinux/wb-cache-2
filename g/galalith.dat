25|$|<b>Galalith</b> is {{an early}} plastic derived from milk products.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, the Hanover, Germany mass {{printing}} press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned {{to develop an}} alternative to blackboards. The resultant horn-like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed {{in cooperation with the}} Austrian chemist (Friedrich) Adolph Spitteler (1846–1940). The final result was unsuitable for the original purpose. In 1893, French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde, producing material marketed as <b>galalith.</b>|$|E

50|$|One {{limitation}} on {{the uses of}} <b>Galalith</b> was that when made into items above a certain size it tended to splinter or warp.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Galalith</b> {{could produce}} {{gemstone}} imitations that looked strikingly real. In 1926 Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel published {{a picture of}} a short, simple black dress in Vogue. It was calf-length, straight, and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. Vogue called it [...] "Chanel’s Ford,” as like the Model T, the little black dress was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. To accessorize the little black dress, Chanel revamped her designs, thus facilitating the breakthrough and mass popularity of costume jewelry. <b>Galalith</b> was used for striking Art Deco jewelry designs by artists such as Jacob Bengel and Auguste Bonaz, as well as for hair combs and accessories. By the 1930s, <b>Galalith</b> was also used for pens, umbrella handles, white piano keys (replacing natural ivory), and electrical goods, with world production at that time reaching 10,000 tons. Knitting needles were another common use.|$|E
50|$|This new plastic was {{presented}} at Paris Universal Exhibition in 1900. In France, <b>Galalith</b> was distributed by the Compagnie Française de Galalithe located near Paris in Levallois-Perret. As a result, the Jura area became {{the first one to}} use the material.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galalith</b> (Erinoid in the United Kingdom) is a {{synthetic}} plastic material manufactured by {{the interaction of}} casein and formaldehyde. Given a commercial name derived from the Greek words gala (milk) and lithos (stone), it is odourless, insoluble in water, biodegradable, antiallergenic, antistatic and virtually nonflammable.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>Galalith</b> was {{historically}} cheap, {{the fact}} {{it could not be}} moulded led to its demise by commercial end users. Production slowed as the restrictions of World War II led to a need for milk as a food, and niched due to new oil-derived wartime plastic developments. Production continued in Brazil until the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|It {{was during}} the Bauhaus and Art Deco period that {{designers}} were looking to obtain new materials and inspiration to produce costume jewelry. Inspired by French Avant-Garde and other fashion trendsetters such as Coco Chanel, Bengel started to produce experimental jewelry. The pieces, catalogued 1924-1939, combined brass and chrome with geometric shapes of colored <b>galalith.</b>|$|E
50|$|Marketed in {{the form}} of boards, pipes and rods, in 1913 thirty million litres (eight million US gallons) of milk were used to produce <b>Galalith</b> in Germany alone. In 1914, Syrolit Ltd gained the license for {{manufacture}} in the United Kingdom. Renaming itself Erinoid Ltd, it started manufacture in the Lightpill former woollen mill in Dudbridge, Stroud, Gloucestershire.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} plastics were based on casein. In particular, <b>galalith</b> was well known for use in buttons. Fiber {{can be made from}} extruded casein. Lanital, a fabric made from casein fiber (known as Aralac in the United States), was particularly popular in Italy during the 1930s. Recent innovations such as QMilch are offering a more refined use of the fiber for modern fabrics.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, the Hanover, Germany mass {{printing}} press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned {{to develop an}} alternative to blackboards.

50|$|In the 1930s, {{the company}} enjoyed its most {{magnificent}} phase. It {{was a period}} when the fountain pen became widespread and {{the products of the}} house of Bassano met the taste of the public with their sober design, the variety of their colours and materials (among the first to use celluloid and <b>galalith),</b> the perfect operation of their technical solutions, and the originality and precision of their manufacturing techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Li and {{the factory}} {{engineers}} developed and patented equipment for producing soymilk and beancurd, including the world’s first soymilk patents. Shurtleff and Aoyagi comment that their 1912 patent was [...] "packed with original ideas, including various French-style cheeses and the world’s first industrial soy protein isolate, called Sojalithe, after its counterpart, <b>Galalith,</b> made from milk protein." [...] Li claimed that Sojalithe {{could also be}} used as a substitute for ivory.|$|E
50|$|Although {{it could}} not be moulded once set, and was hence {{produced}} in sheets, it was inexpensive to produce due to its simple manufacture. <b>Galalith</b> could be cut, drilled, embossed and dyed without difficulty, and its structure manipulated to create a series of effects. No other plastic at the time could compete on price, and with ivory, horn and bone products becoming far more expensive, it found a natural home in the fashion industry.|$|E
50|$|In 1918 the U.S. Government made an {{extensive}} {{survey of the}} international button market, which listed buttons made of vegetable ivory, metal, glass, <b>galalith,</b> silk, linen, cotton-covered crochet, lead, snap fasteners, glass, enamel, rubber, buckhorn, wood, horn, bone, leather, paper, pressed cardboard, mother-of-pearl, celluloid, porcelain, composition, tin, zinc, xylonite, stone, cloth-covered wooden forms, and papier-mâché. Vegetable ivory {{was said to be}} the most popular for suits and shirts, and papier-mâché far and away the commonest sort of shoe button.|$|E
50|$|Keller was {{employed}} at the Museum für Naturkunde (Museum of Natural History) in Berlin, Germany from 1930 {{until his death}} in 1955, and his sculptures can still be found there. He worked with papier-mâché and several other materials such as celluloid and <b>galalith</b> to create models of insects including a flea (1930, 100:1 scale), a housefly (1932, 50:1 scale), a mosquito in flight (1937, 60:1 scale), a Colorado potato beetle (1940, 50:1 scale), and a ball bearer leafhopper (Bocydium globulare, 1953, 180:1 scale), among others. The housefly, typical of the painstaking attention to detail shown in Keller's sculptures, includes 2,653 bristles. Each model took about a year to complete.|$|E
40|$|Casein {{formaldehyde}} was manufactured between 1904 and 1982 in Western Europe both by International <b>Galalith</b> Gesellschaft (IGG) and Erinoid Ltd. (amongst others). Charles Rennie Mackintosh {{used it in}} his {{designs for}} furniture commissioned by Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke. Casein formaldehyde may be identified through a range of simple and analytical methods available to most conservators in private and public practice. We can control the loss of colour and protect the surface finish by minimising light exposure. Material, aged and distorted, may be reversed if the correct conservation procedures are observed and implemented...|$|E
