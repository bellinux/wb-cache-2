Often referred to as middleware, these components are designed to provide core infrastructure services, and facilitate interoperability of products to provide a consistent infrastructure model. The directory service backbone of middleware has excelled at providing an abstraction layer for applications to lookup information, authenticate, and authorize users while sharing information for wide-scale distributed deployment and information sharing for scientific applications. However, the lack of integration of middleware technologies into the network infrastructures that host these applications has been limiting, if not detrimental, to {{the capabilities of the}} <b>information</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>system</b> as a whole. The capabilities of the traditional data network and networked devices are expanding as IP telephony, mobility, and wireless technologies are introduced to the network. Although these devices have more advanced capabilities and are network attached, the integration and management of existing infrastructure and the new devices is difficult.

Within this framework we distinguish between three modeling levels: the problem domain, human network, and information system level.

40|$|Abstract. The fastest {{developing}} city in China is Shanghai; {{its annual}} growth rate (GDP) exceeded 11. 9 % average in every year from 1992 and GDP per person in 2003 reached 4909 USD. Economists, industries and the government have been considering how to keep Shanghai developing in a sustainable manner. In 1994, the Shanghai Municipal Government put forward the concept of “information harbor ” and set the goal of establishing a series of <b>information</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in the following five years. The Shanghai city informatization project started in 1999, {{and by the end}} of 2001 it had spread across Shanghai.

TCP works well in the terrestrial fiber networks but does not work well in satellite hybrid (satellite-terrestrial) networks. In this paper we analyze the problems that cause this dramatically degradedperformance. Based on the observation that it difficult for an end-to-end solution to solve these problems in this kind of hybrid networks, we propose a connection splitting based solution. A rate-based protocol is designed for the satellite connections and a flow control scheme at the satellite gateways (SGW) used to couple the two split connections together. Our simulation results shows that our scheme can maintain high utilization of the satellite link and improve fairness among the competing connections...|$|R

A proposed {{solution to this}} problem is to create a global SVE surveillance system to monitor and assess SVE in conflict settings.

While the solution to design the SVE surveillance system has been initiated, {{little is known about the}} existing <b>information</b> <b>infrastructure</b> that these groups currently use.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new approach for supporting the improvement of information management and the overall <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In particular, the paper discusses the application of lean thinking to information management; where information management can be considered to involve adding value to information by virtue of how it is organised, visualised and represented; and enabling information (value) to flow to the end-user (customer) through the processes of exchange, sharing and collaboration. The potential benefits of lean thinking are discussed and the fundamental barriers for its application to information management are highlighted. These include the need to characterise the nature of waste and establish the five principles of, value, value streams, flow, pull and continuous improvement in the context of information management. It follows that the core contribution of this paper is the development of an understanding of these critical elements and the creation of a conceptual framework for a set of lean principles within the context of information management. This framework offers a unique and arguably generic approach for supporting the retrospective improvement of information management systems and the overall <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|R

The research is based on an intensive case study of a mobile network operator that tries to turn its subscribers into an advertising audience.
