2500|$|The {{leaders of}} the first {{generation}} of the Anglo-Catholic revival or Oxford Movement (e.g. Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey, and John Keble) had been primarily concerned with theological and ecclesiological questions and had little concern with questions of ritual. They championed the view that the fundamental identity of the Church of England was Catholic rather than Protestant. [...] They had argued that Anglicans were bound by obedience {{to the use of the}} Book of Common Prayer. [...] "Tract 3" [...] of the Tracts for the Times series had strenuously argued against any revision of the Book of Common Prayer, viewing its use as a matter <b>of</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation.</b> Even Tract 90, which analysed the 39 Articles, was more concerned with the theological dimension of the issue. It gave little attention to the question of altering current liturgical practice in the Church of England.|$|R
40|$|Jean-Francois Lyotard’s {{inquiry into}} the logic of obligation, {{culminating}} {{in his discussion of}} ethical phrases in “Le Differend”, is deeply indebted to Emmanuel Levinas’s reading of that logic and his articulation of a radically new modality of ethics. Both thinkers deploy a strategy of argumentation and a rhetoric of phrases whose performative contradictions are deliberate and affirmed. Levinas {{is one of the major}} figures in the twentieth century European philosophical tradition to have produced a substantive reconfiguration of ethics based upon the idea of an asymmetrical human relation rather than upon mutual obligation. The resulting ethics, outlined in texts such as “Totality and Infinity” and “Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence”, is one of hyperbolic responsibility beyond norms and duty and outside formal rules and pragmatics. In this paper I will analyse Lyotard’s arguments concerning the logic <b>of</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> – the ‘phrases of pure prescription’ - through a detailed reading of his relatively unknown essay on Levinas entitled “Levinas’s Logic”. Lyotard’s short commentary demonstrates considerable interpretative insight and originality in its attempt to identify the different levels of language and meta-language operative, but often unstated, in Levinas’s texts. However, as Lyotard himself recognises, such analysis risks doing considerable violence to Levinas by betraying the ethical signification of his thematization. His careful analysis of Levinas’s rhetorical strategy of deliberate logical contradiction represents a sophisticated response to Jacques Derrida’s early influential commentary ‘Violence and Metaphysics’. Derrida’s commentary is marked by its critical claims regarding Levinas’s efforts to articulate a philosophical ethics in a purified rhetoric beyond the speculative reach of the Hegelian dialectic. As I demonstrate in this paper, central to Lyotard’s own interpretative efforts is an urgent recovery of Levinas’s ethics from such an allegedly reductive reading...|$|R

60|$|Is, then, the {{difference}} between the Just and the Expedient a merely imaginary distinction? Have mankind been under a delusion in thinking that justice is a more sacred thing than policy, and that the latter ought only to be listened to after the former has been satisfied? By no means. The exposition we have given of the nature and origin of the sentiment, recognises a real distinction; and no one of those who profess the most sublime contempt for the consequences of actions as an element in their morality, attaches more importance to the distinction than I do. While I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up an imaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility, I account the justice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part, and incomparably the most sacred and binding part, of all morality. Justice is a name for certain classes of moral rules, which concern the essentials of human well-being more nearly, and are therefore <b>of</b> more <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation,</b> than any other rules for the guidance of life; and the notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of justice, that of a right residing in an individual, implies and testifies to this more binding obligation.|$|R

Applbaum rejects competing views of legitimacy, in particular legitimacy as a claim-right to have the law obeyed, for mistakenly invoking substantive moral argument in the conceptual analysis, and concludes that “at the core of the concept—what legitimacy is” is only a Hohfeldian moral power. In this article, I contend that: (1) Applbaum’s view of legitimacy, when fully unfolded, refers to more than a mere moral power and should therefore be rejected even by his own standards; (2) Applbaum’s rejection of competing views of legitimacy ultimately relies on a claim that he does not successfully defend, namely, the claim that moral <b>duties</b> are <b>of</b> <b>absolute</b> rather than prima facie force...|$|R

50|$|After {{this the}} Archbishop seldom {{appeared}} at the Council, chiefly {{on account of his}} infirmities. In 1625 he attended the King constantly, however, in his last illness, and performed the ceremony of the coronation of King Charles I as king of England. His refusal to license the assize sermon preached by Dr Robert Sibthorp at Northampton on 22 February 1627, in which cheerful obedience was urged to the king's demand for a general loan, and the <b>duty</b> proclaimed <b>of</b> <b>absolute</b> non-resistance even to the most arbitrary royal commands, led Charles to deprive him of his functions as primate, putting them in commission. The need of summoning parliament, however, soon brought about a nominal restoration of the Archbishop's powers. His presence being unwelcome at court, he lived from that time in retirement, leaving Laud and his party in undisputed ascendancy.He died at Croydon on 5 August 1633, and was buried at Guildford, his native place, where he had endowed a hospital with lands to the value of £300 a year.|$|R
50|$|Ross gives a list {{of seven}} prima facie duties, which he does not claim is all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; non-maleficence; justice; beneficence; and self-improvement. In any given situation, any number of these prima facie duties may apply. In the case of ethical dilemmas, they may even {{contradict}} one another. Someone could have a prima facie <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> reparation, say, a duty {{to help people who}} helped you move house, move house themselves, and a prima facie <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> fidelity, such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict.

40|$|Most {{people would}} {{acknowledge}} the importance <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, {{but the same}} is not true <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Historically, the corporate law <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care has been underenforced at best, and arguably unenforced entirely. Some scholars do not consider the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care to be a fiduciary duty at all, {{and there are those}} who would do away with it entirely. In this paper, I intend to provide a comprehensive defense of the corporate law fiduciary <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. I hope to show that the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care is not simply an ill-fitting appendage to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, but rather an essential aspect of the singular fiduciary concept that also encompasses the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. Simply put, a fiduciary has the duty to act {{in the interests of the}} beneficiary in all relevant respects. Once the breadth of this singular fiduciary concept is properly understood, it is revealed to be much more than any <b>of</b> the individual <b>duties</b> that it comprises. Far from being streamlined or focused, fiduciary law would be impoverished if it were limited to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. However, I do not intend to argue for a more robust <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Rather, I will defend the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care as it currently exists in corporate law (more or less) — deliberately and advisedly underenforced, but not entirely unenforced.
