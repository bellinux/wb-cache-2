50|$|There are {{generally}} two main types of reed stops: chorus reeds (such as the Trumpet, Clairon and Bombarde), whose main {{function is to}} blend with the <b>flue</b> <b>stops</b> and reinforce the full organ; and solo reeds or orchestral reeds (such as the Clarinet, the Oboe, and the Cor Anglais), which often (but not always) imitate orchestral instruments, and are used for quieter, solo passages (similar to woodwinds in an orchestra).|$|E
5000|$|The organ's main console is {{the biggest}} in the world. It has 1,235 stop tabs {{controlling}} 587 <b>flue</b> <b>stops,</b> 265 reed stops, 35 melodic percussions, 46 non-melodic percussions, 164 couplers, 18 tremolos, 120 swell pedal selectors for the 6 swell pedals controlling 15 swell boxes, and a stop crescendo pedal. The console is also {{the only one in}} the world with 7 manuals. The lowest two (Choir and Great) have a range of seven octaves, and the next lowest (Swell) has a range of six octaves, while the rest have a normal five octave range. [...] The bottom five keys on the Swell manual (GGG to BBB,) are in place mainly for cosmetic reasons, as there are no pipes, in most ranks, for those notes. The manuals from top to bottom are: ...|$|E
5000|$|It is he Cavaillé-Collwho {{conceived}} the diverse wind pressures, the divided windchests, the pedal {{systems and the}} combination registers; he who applied {{for the first time}} Barker's pneumatic motors, created the family of harmonic stops, reformed and perfected the mechanics to such a point that each pipe—low or high, loud or soft—instantly obeys the touch of the finger… From this result: the possibility of confining an entire division in a sonorous prison—opened or closed at will—the freedom of mixing timbres, the means of intensifying them or gradually tempering them, the freedom of tempos, the sureness of attacks, the balance of contrasts, and, finally, a whole blossoming of wonderful colors—a rich palette of the most diverse shades: harmonic flutes, gambas, bassoons, English horns, trumpets, celestes, <b>flue</b> <b>stops</b> and reed stops of a quality and variety unknown before.

5000|$|The {{desire to}} bring the organ under the {{complete}} and easy control of the organist was coupled with Skinner's lifelong interest and obsession with [...] "orchestral" [...] tonal colors and their application to the pipe organ. The first of his new stops, the [...] "Erzähler", appeared in 1904, and was soon joined by other exotic tonal colors which Skinner worked to perfect between 1908 and 1924, including an Orchestral Oboe, English Horn, Corno di Bassetto, Flügel Horn and [...] "Heckelphone" [...] that were all very true to their orchestral counterparts. In addition to his orchestral color reeds, Skinner developed and perfected numerous string and hybrid <b>flue</b> <b>stops,</b> many with matching celestes of uncommon beauty. Among these were the usual Salicional/Voix Celeste and Dulciana/Unda Maris present in the Swell and Choir divisions of many American organs of the era, but also his ethereal Flauto Dolce/Flute Celeste, his Dulcet (a pair of very narrow scaled string ranks tuned with a fast beat to heighten the intensity), a pair of inverted-flare Gambas found in the solo divisions {{of many of his}} larger organs that allowed a rich, 'cello-like timbre for solo lines in the tenor range, the [...] "Kleine Erzähler", a softer, brighter version of his earlier Erzähler (which creates the effect of string players playing very softly), as well as his Pedal Violones at 32' and 16' pitches which he defined as [...] "subtle, soft string stops". Yet with all these developments, Skinner is still best known for his highly imitative French Horn stop, which is his only sonic creation that he actually patented.|$|E
