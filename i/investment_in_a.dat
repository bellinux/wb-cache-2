5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large number of sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Greenland Home Rule Government in 1979 led to <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regional network of true airports, with short take-off and landing (STOL) airfields constructed in Nuuk, Ilulissat (1984), and Kulusuk. (These early airports were built without de-icing equipment, a situation which has proven problematic during Greenland's winters and continues to cause delays and losses for the airline.) The decade also saw the company train and hire its first native Kalaallit pilots.|$|E
30|$|In consequence, we {{confirm the}} {{relationships}} among the variables as formulated in our four hypotheses: First, the lower a firm’s overage costs, the higher is c.p. its <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inventory of skilled workers, i.e., the more apprentices it trains. Second, the lower a firm’s underage costs, the lower is c.p. its <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inventory of skilled workers, i.e., the less apprentices it trains. Third, given an identical cost structure, the higher a firm’s expected future demand for skilled workers, the higher is its <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inventory of skilled workers, i.e., the more apprentices it trains. And fourth, the relation between a high expected demand and the <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inventory of skilled workers is even larger for a high critical ratio, i.e., for high underage costs compared to overage costs.|$|R

5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A. Young to assert that inducement to invest is limited {{by the size of the}} market. The original idea behind this was put forward by Adam Smith, who stated that division of labour (as against inducement to invest) is limited by the extent of the market.|$|E
5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption and <b>investment.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E

5|$|Dolman joined Howard and Lucas at Skywalker Ranch for {{a series}} of lengthy story conferences, and wrote seven drafts of his script between the spring and fall of 1986. Pre-production began in late 1986. Various major film studios turned down the chance to {{distribute}} and co-finance it with Lucasfilm because they believed the fantasy genre was unsuccessful. This was largely due to films such as Krull, Legend, Dragonslayer, and Labyrinth. Lucas took it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which was headed by Alan Ladd, Jr. Ladd and Lucas shared a relationship {{as far back as the}} mid-1970s, when Ladd, running 20th Century Fox, greenlighted Lucas' idea for Star Wars. However, in 1986, MGM was facing financial troubles, and major <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fantasy film was perceived as a risk. Ladd advanced half the $35 million budget for it in return for theatrical and television rights, leaving Lucasfilm with home video and pay television rights to offer in exchange for the other half.|$|E
25|$|McCarron's {{relationship}} with Tutor {{was not without}} controversy. In 1993, the carpenters' pension fund made a large <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> company which held televised boxing matches at a Palm Springs, California, hotel owned by the fund, and a $40 million <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> company that supplied nearly all the concrete for one of Tutor's construction companies.

25|$|In 1868, {{the case}} of Watson v. Muirhead was heard by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

25|$|However, the {{selection}} of investments {{may be subject to}} budget constraints, or they may be mutually exclusive competing projects, such as a choice between or the capacity or ability to manage more projects may be practically limited.

25|$|In {{some states}} of the United States, much of the <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> home-mounted system may be lost if the home-owner moves and the buyer puts less value on the system than the seller. The city of Berkeley {{developed}} an innovative financing method to remove this limitation, by adding a tax assessment that is transferred with the home {{to pay for the}} solar panels. Now known as PACE, Property Assessed Clean Energy, 30 U.S. states have duplicated this solution.|$|E
25|$|Corporations use IRR {{in capital}} {{budgeting}} {{to compare the}} profitability of capital projects {{in terms of the}} rate of return. For example, a corporation will compare an <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new plant versus an extension of an existing plant based on the IRR of each project. To maximize returns, the higher a project's IRR, the more desirable it is to undertake the project. If all projects require the same amount of up-front investment, the project with the highest IRR would be considered the best and undertaken first.|$|E
