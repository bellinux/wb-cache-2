40|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that resistance training is accompanied by changes within the nervous system that {{play an important role}} in the development of strength. Many elements of the nervous system exhibit the potential for adaptation in response to resistance training, including supraspinal centres, <b>descending</b> <b>neural</b> <b>tracts,</b> spinal circuitry and the motor end plate connections between motoneurons and muscle fibres. Yet the specific sites of adaptation along the neuraxis have seldom been identified experimentally, and much of the evidence for neural adaptations following resistance training remains indirect. As a consequence of this current lack of knowledge, there exists uncertainty regarding the manner in which resistance training impacts upon the control and execution of functional movements. We aim to demonstrate that resistance training is likely to cause adaptations to many neural elements that are involved in the control of movement, and is therefore likely to affect movement execution during a wide range of tasks. We review a small number of experiments that provide evidence that resistance training affects the way in which muscles that have been engaged during training are recruited during related movement tasks. The concepts addressed in this article represent an important new approach to research on the effects of resistance training. They are also of considerable practical importance, since most individuals perform resistance training in the expectation that it will enhance their performance in-related functional tasks...|$|R

40|$|Aphasia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and devastating {{sequelae}} of stroke. The arcuate fasciculus (AF), an important <b>neural</b> <b>tract</b> for language function, connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. In thisreview article, previous DTI studies on the AF in stroke patients were reviewed with regard to the usefulness for diagnosis (seven studies), prediction of prognosis (two studies), and recovery of aphasia (three studies). Although scant studies on this topic have been conducted in stroke patients, DTI for the AF appears to provide useful information on the presence or severity of injury of the AF, prognosis prediction of aphasia, and recovery mechanisms of aphasia in stroke patients. Therefore, further DTI studies on these topics should be encouraged, especially studies on prognosis prediction and recovery mechanisms of aphasia. In addition, research on other <b>neural</b> <b>tracts</b> known to be involved in aphasia as well as the AF in both hemispheres should be encouraged...|$|R

While the {{consensus}} {{suggests that the}} functional neural communication between distinct brain sources leads to synchronous activity in those regions (possibly connected by <b>neural</b> <b>tracts,</b> in either direct or indirect way), an alternative explanation emphasises on single focal oscillations that occure at single brain sources that eventually appear connected or synchronous in different scalp or brain source regions.|$|R

Over a 15 year period, these techniques &#x 2013; MR Neurography and Diffusion Tensor Imaging &#x 2013; were then deployed in the clinical and research community and applied to about 50, 000 patients.

50|$|Postmortem {{examination}} of the nine patients’ brains reported by Plum and Swanson, revealed necrosis of the central pons {{in five of the}} nine patients, and indirect compression of the pons in one additional patient. Their initial findings suggested that lesions in the medial pontine tegmentum leads to a disruption of cortical inhibitory effects of medullar respiratory center. Plum and Swanson suggested that failure to inhibit the activity of this particular region of the brain results in continuous stimulation of the respiratory center by the lateral pontile reticular formulation and laterally located <b>descending</b> <b>neural</b> pathway. The destruction of this required negative feedback mechanism causes the uncontrollable hyperventilation associated with CNH.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cerebellum}} {{is important}} for the integration of sensory perception and motor control, but its structure has mostly been studied in mammals. Here, we describe the cell types and <b>neural</b> <b>tracts</b> of the adult zebrafish cerebellum using molecular markers and transgenic lines. Cerebellar neurons are categorized to two major groups: GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. The Purkinje cells, which are GABAergic neurons, express parvalbumin 7, carbonic anhydrase 8, and aldolase C like (zebrin II). The glutamatergic neurons are vglut 1 + granule cells and vglut 2 high cells, which receive Purkinje cell inputs; some vglut 2 high cells are eurydendroid cells, which are equivalent to the mammalian deep cerebellar nuclei. We found olig 2 + neurons in the adult cerebellum and ascertained {{that at least some of}} them are eurydendroid cells. We identified markers for climbing and mossy afferent fibers, efferent fibers, and parallel fibers from granule cells. Furthermore, we found that the cerebellum-like structures in the optic tectum and antero-dorsal hindbrain show similar Parvalbumin 7 and Vglut 1 expression profiles as the cerebellum. The differentiation of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons begins 3  days post-fertilization (dpf), and layers are first detectable 5  dpf. Using anti-Parvalbumin 7 and Vglut 1 antibodies to label Purkinje cells and granule cell axons, respectively, we screened for mutations affecting cerebellar neuronal development and the formation of <b>neural</b> <b>tracts.</b> Our data provide a platform for future studies of zebrafish cerebellar development...|$|R

From the diffusion tensor, diffusion anisotropy measures such as the fractional anisotropy (FA), can be computed. Moreover, the principal direction of the diffusion tensor {{can be used to}} infer the white-matter connectivity of the brain (i.e. tractography; trying to see which part of the brain is connected to which other part).|$|R

[...] The vestibular nuclei receive information through the vestibulocochlear nerve about changes in the orientation of the head. The nuclei relay motor commands through the vestibulospinal tract.

The fibers derived from the DTI were compared with those segmented from the histology in order to evaluate the performance of DTI fiber tracing. While there was generally good agreement between the two methods, our results reveal certain limitations of DTI tractography, particularly at regions of fiber tract crossing or bifurcation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We propose visual {{embedding}} as a {{model for}} automatically generating and evaluating visualizations. A visual embedding is a function from data points to a space of visual primitives that measurably preserves structures in the data (domain) within the mapped perceptual space (range). Visual embedding can serve as both a generative and an evaluative model. We demonstrate its use with three examples: coloring of <b>neural</b> <b>tracts,</b> scatter plots with icons, and evaluation of alternative diffusion tensor glyphs. We discuss several techniques for generating visual embedding functions, including probabilistic graphical models for embedding within discrete visual spaces. We also describe two complementary approaches [...] crowdsourcing and visual product spaces [...] for building visual spaces with associated perceptual distance measures. Finally, we present future research directions for further developing the visual embedding model. ...|$|R
40|$|Here we show {{a method}} of {{directing}} {{the edges of the}} connectomes, prepared from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets from the human brain. Before the present work, no high-definition directed braingraphs (or connectomes) were published, because the tractography methods in use are not capable of assigning directions to the <b>neural</b> <b>tracts</b> discovered. Previous work on the functional connectomes applied low-resolution functional MRI-detected statistical causality for the assignment of directions of connectomes of typically several dozens of vertices. Our method is based on the phenomenon of the "Consensus Connectome Dynamics" (CCD), described earlier by our research group. In this contribution, we apply the method to the 423 braingraphs, each with 1015 vertices, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and we also made the directed connectomes publicly available at the site ...|$|R

50|$|In DTI, each voxel has {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} parameters: a rate of {{diffusion}} and a preferred direction of diffusion - {{described in terms of}} three-dimensional space - for which that parameter is valid. The properties of each voxel of a single DTI image is usually calculated by vector or tensor math from six or more different diffusion weighted acquisitions, each obtained with a different orientation of the diffusion sensitizing gradients. In some methods, hundreds of measurements - each making up a complete image - are made to generate a single resulting calculated image data set. The higher information content of a DTI voxel makes it extremely sensitive to subtle pathology in the brain. In addition the directional information can be exploited at a higher level of structure to select and follow <b>neural</b> <b>tracts</b> through the brain - a process called tractography.|$|R
50|$|The {{neurotoxic}} lesion {{technique has}} proven to be essential for studying the neural basis of behavior and memory in animals. Neurotoxins can be used to selectively damage very specific nerve tracts in the brain. Pertaining to the study of memory, areas of interest include the hippocampus, the rhinal cortex, the pre-frontal cortex, and the frontal cortex. The neurotoxic lesion technique uses neurotoxins such as ibotenic acid to selectively disrupt or kill specific <b>neural</b> <b>tracts</b> in any of the areas described above. The animal is anaesthetized and immobilized so that stereotaxic instruments can be used to drill holes in specific locations of the skull. Scientists can then carefully administer microinjections of neurotoxins to damage only the neurons in specific brain areas. This technique allows for the selective lesioning of areas of interest and leaves surrounding supportive tissue unaffected.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{mammalian}} auditory system contains <b>descending</b> <b>neural</b> pathways, some {{of which}} project onto the cochlea via the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system. The function of this efferent auditory system is not entirely clear. Behavioral studies in animals with OC lesions suggest that the MOC serves to facilitate sound localization in noise. In the current work, noise-induced OC activity (the “OC reflex”) and sound-localization performance in noise were measured in normal-hearing humans. Consistent with earlier studies, both measures were found to vary substantially across individuals. Importantly, significant correlations were observed between OC reflex strength {{and the effect of}} noise on sound-localization performance; the stronger the OC reflex, the less marked the effect of noise. These results suggest that MOC activation by noise helps to counteract the detrimental effects of background noise on neural representations of direction-dependent spectral features, which are especially important for accurate localization in the up/down and front/back dimensions...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an image {{segmentation}} technique based on augmenting the conformal (or geodesic) active contour framework with directional information. In the isotropic case, the Euclidean metric is locally multiplied by a scalar conformal factor based on image information {{such that the}} weighted length of curves lying on points of interest (typically edges) is small. The conformal factor which is chosen depends only upon position and is in this sense isotropic. While directional information has been studied previously for other segmentation frameworks, here we show that if one desires to add directionality in the conformal active contour framework, then one gets a well-defined minimization problem in {{the case that the}} factor defines a Finsler metric. Optimal curves may be obtained using the calculus of variations or dynamic programming based schemes. Finally we demonstrate the technique by extracting roads from aerial imagery, blood vessels from medical angiograms, and <b>neural</b> <b>tracts</b> from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imagery...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigated structural brain changes {{associated with}} long-term professional ballet dance training. The primary measure used was fractional anisotropy (FA), a diffusion tensor (DTI) derived index of water molecule diffusion, which putatively quantifies main <b>neural</b> <b>tract</b> efficiency. Dancers had higher FA (p =. 062, FWE corrected), which ostensibly reflects greater axonal ability to communicate. Dancers also had differing FA lateralization (p =. 038, FWE corrected). Large percentages (30 % to 55 %) of variability in these metrics were shared {{by years of}} dance training, implicating a substantive impact of dance training on brain structure. Other DTI-derived indices where used to help characterize FA (i. e. axial diffusion, radial diffusion, and mean diffusion), and the results implicate enhanced conduction from altered tract properties, perhaps increased myelination.

40|$|Recent {{anatomical}} and neurochemical {{studies suggest}} that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of the brainstem is composed of several subdivisions that have different afferent and efferent connections and are different neurochemically. In the present study, DRN subdivisions projecting to visual system structures were studied in a highly visual rodent, the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). ^ In one group of gerbils, the fluorescent <b>neural</b> <b>tract</b> tracer Fluoro-Gold was injected into the superior colliculus (SC), and brain sections also were double-labeled for serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT). In another group of gerbils, the <b>neural</b> <b>tract</b> tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the SC, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), or primary visual cortex (V 1). The location of retrogradely labeled cells in the DRN was analyzed at five rostro-caudal levels to determine DRN subdivisions projecting to these visual structures. At the three most rostral coronal levels, virtually all cells projecting to the SC occurred in the lateral DRN; most of these cells were serotonergic. At these rostral levels, virtually all cells projecting to the LGN also were observed in the lateral DRN. At the two most caudal levels, retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the ventromedial and interfascicular DRN following tracer injections into the SC or LGN. Following CTB injections into the primary visual cortex, virtually all retrogradely labeled cells occurred in the ventromedial DRN at all rostro-caudal levels. Therefore, the ventral caudal region of the DRN appeared to be the only DRN region projecting to all three visual areas (SC, LGN, and V 1). ^ In order to determine whether functional differences might exist among DRN subdivisions, the expression of c-fos, an immediate-early gene, was analyzed in all DRN subdivisions throughout the light-dark cycle. In all subdivisions, the highest c-Fos expression was observed one hour after the onset of the dark period. However, ANOVA analysis revealed that the diurnal variation in c-Fos expression was statistically significant only in the caudal ventral region of the DRN, and gradually became less prominent in the caudal-to-rostral and ventral-to-dorsal directions. ^ A portion of this Dissertation has been previously published in the Journal of Comparative Neurology (Janušonis et al., 1999). ...|$|R
