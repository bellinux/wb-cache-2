40|$|One {{feature of}} {{economic}} recessions is {{the appearance of}} aggregate liquidity shortages that can exacerbate the economic downturn. We develop a model in which the demand for liquidity arises suddenly in response to continued funding needs of partially completed investment projects whose outcomes are subject to idiosyncratic shocks and moral hazard. When the economy experiences an adverse aggregate productivity shock, incentive constraints that underlie equity contracts may bind, provided the shock is severe enough. In this case, credit-rationing appears, and the heightened demand for liquidity coincides with a greater reluctance to take on equity positions or <b>deepen</b> <b>investments</b> in on-going investment projects. The consequence is a reduction in new investment and termination of on-going projects {{due to a lack}} of liquidity, thereby worsening the economic slowdown.

40|$|The inland {{waterway}} transportation {{system of the}} United States (U. S.) handles 11. 7 billion tons of freight annually and connects the heartland of the U. S. {{with the rest of}} the world by providing a fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. This dissertation aims to create decision support tools for maritime stakeholders to measure the economic impacts of the {{inland waterway}} transportation systems under real world scenarios including disruptions, demand changes, port expansion decisions, and channel <b>deepening</b> <b>investments.</b> Monte Carlo simulation, system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, and multiregional input-output modeling techniques are utilized to analyze the complex relationships between inland waterway transportation system components and regional economic impact factors. The first research contribution illustrates that the expected duration of a disruption determines whether decision makers are better off waiting for the waterway system to reopen or switching to an alternative mode of transportation. Moreover, total disruption cost can be reduced by increasing estimation accuracy of disruption duration. The second research contribution shows that without future investment in inland waterway infrastructure, a sustainable system and associate economic impacts cannot be generated in the long-term. The third research contribution illustrates that investing in bottleneck system components results in higher economic impact than investing in non-bottleneck components. The developed models can be adapted to any inland waterway transportation system in the U. S. by utilizing data obtained by publically available sources to measure the economic impacts under various scenarios to inform capital investment decisions and support an economically sustainable inland waterway transportation system...|$|R

The findings suggest that the formalization of property rights, contracting, and competition institutions is positively related to an increase in the level of credit to the private sector. This result remains robust when controlling for the effect of financial policy. The effect of institutional characteristics on banks' lending capacity and investment is mixed.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} pulp investment model, {{with its}} pressure on land, has created conflict and caused major disagreements and open hostility amongst the social movement and NGO networks, state actors, and the {{pulp and paper}} companies in Brazil. In this article, Ethical Analysis was applied {{in the assessment of}} the dynamics and possibilities of conflict resolution related to the expansion of pulpwood plantations in Brazil's Bahia State, particularly near Veracel Celulose. Ethical Analysis as a tool identifies the complex dynamics of contention through identifying bridges and rifts in the social, ecological and economic viewpoints of the main actors. The analysis was based on field research, interviews, and a review of existing literature. The results indicated that the conflict is marked by politics of power, and as long as this stage continues, the politics of cooperation and conflict resolution would be hard to achieve. The key actors have diverging interests, values and principles, and different ways of presenting their viewpoints. The current investment context is economically and institutionally peripheral and socially weak. Without a radical rethinking and emphasis on ethical and structural reworking of the investment model, the conflict will likely continue to <b>deepen,</b> aggravating <b>investment</b> risk for large-scale business and industrial forestry...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the dynamic relationships between economic growth and macroeconomic variables, namely financial <b>deepening,</b> exports and <b>investment</b> for the cases of Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. The vector error-correction model (VECM) is employed to distinguish between short-run and long-run causal effects in examining the three led-growth determinants. The out-of-sample dynamics of the system are also picked up through variance decomposition analysis. The empirical results suggest that financial deepening leads to economic growth in South Korea, Singapore and Thailand. In terms of exports, the findings demonstrate that export-led growth hypothesis is supported for all four Asian economies, namely Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Apart from export promotion strategies and financial liberalisation, the evidence also shows that economic growth in these four Asian economies is found to be generated by capital formation or investmen...|$|R

40|$|This thesis asserts {{a visual}} {{ontology}} {{as a way}} of understanding religious practice online. W. J. T Mitchell argues twenty-first century humanities are shifting away from text and towards an interest in the meaning of images. However, he denies digital images a place within this pictorial turn, judging them banal. Mitchell’s theorization of new media is a postmodern rereading of Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”. I argue that Mitchell’s utilization of Benjamin’s aura in his constructions of the human relationship to new media misinterprets the role of these technologies in relating the image to the object, and that digital images should be rethought in terms of a visual ontology. The study of religion online has flourished as a subfield parallel to the increasing utilization of visual-digital media. Cross-disciplinary study of religion online reflects vast but methodologically shallow scholarship. Recent publications make an effort to <b>deepen</b> these theoretical <b>investments,</b> as the accumulated scholarship becomes self-reflexive.

40|$|The slow {{progress}} and modest achievements of regional integration in South Asia have generated {{a huge amount}} of skepticism about its role as an effective strategy of growth. The present study, however, argues that there is need to forge deeper integration within the region. It examines the prospects and problems of serious fiscal consolidation within the area. Essentially, it looks at the effect of <b>deepened</b> regionalism on <b>investment</b> flows. It argues that regional integration has the potential to promote intra and extra regional FDI flows and economic development in individual countries of the region. This will pave the way for the most efficient use of the region's resources through additional economies of scale, value addition, employment and diffusion of technology. A number of challenges remain. Structural weaknesses, institutional bottlenecks, political movements, narrow nationalism and mutual mistrust are some of the factors that explain the failure of the region to exploit possibilities. Paradoxically, the problems themselves provide strong motivation for strengthening cooperation. It is only through more intensive collaboration that these complexities can be addressed and resolved.

40|$|Abstract: At the {{beginning}} of the XXI century the dynamic development of the processes of internationalization of economic life has overcome entire countries and regions of the world and results in the investigation of rapprochement and convergence of the national tax systems. As world experience testifies, the modern tax systems that were formed in different countries of the world have become the result of difficult co-operation of economical, political and sociological factors. But {{at the same time the}} obvious differences of the mentioned factors create the necessity in the development and introduction of compatible mechanisms of the fiscal adjusting, that will <b>deepen</b> the international <b>investment</b> co-operation. That’s why it should be noticed that without the maintenance of formal tax sovereignty of all the countries of the world as a subject of international economic relations, co-ordination of tax policy, that was started in the middle of the XIX century, it is impossible to develop global economics in future. The purpose of this article is the analyses of the types of the national tax systems in the conditions of globalization, their description and determination. In this connection it should be noted that the processes of harmonization of the tax systems purchased the strongest embodiment within the limits of regional integration, where the level of economic co-operation and interdependence of countries is the biggest, and consequently the subsequent development of regional integration becomes impossible without intergovernmental convergence of the tax systems of countries...|$|R
40|$|Since {{normalising}} {{diplomatic relations}} in 1972, successive Australian and Chinese governments {{have focused on}} <b>deepening</b> trade and <b>investment</b> links {{to such an extent}} that China now looms as one of the most critical countries on Australia's twenty-first century horizon. For their part, Chinese elites have welcomed closer ties with Australia and have been particularly keen to accelerate China's direct investment in the Australian mining and energy sectors. Since the early 2000 s, a number of commentators have argued that Australia has been gradually drifting towards China's sphere of influence in the Asia-Pacific. This trend, they argue, has been reinforced following the election in 2007 of the Labor party government, which has terminated Australia's involvement in quadrilateral talks with the US, India, and Japan; stepped back from commitments to export uranium to China's long-standing rival, India; and intensified Australia's public criticism of Japanese whaling practices. Meanwhile, in 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a point of paying a high profile visit to China during his first major overseas journey, but not matching it with a visit to Japan. Is Australia drifting towards China's strategic orbit in Asia? The article examines this question through the prism of three key indicators of realignment and concludes that, while there is some evidence of Australia accommodating Chinese strategic preferences in Asia, there is no indication that it is realigning itself strategically towards China and away from its long-standing ally, the US.

40|$|Facing {{the problem}} of {{variation}} and chaotic behavior of customers, the lack of sufficient information {{is a challenge to}} many business organizations. Human analysts lacking an understanding of the hidden patterns in business data, thus, can miss corporate business opportunities. In order to embrace all business opportunities, enhance the competitiveness, discovery of hidden knowledge, unexpected patterns and useful rules from large databases have provided a feasible solution for several decades. While there is a wide range of financial analysis products existing in the financial market, how to customize the investment portfolio for the customer is still a challenge to many financial institutions. This paper aims at developing an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) for extracting customer behavior in the financial industry, so as to increase the availability of decision support data and hence increase customer satisfaction. The proposed financial model first clusters the customers into several sectors, and then finds the correlation among these sectors. It is noted that better customer segmentation can increase the ability to identify targeted customers, therefore extracting useful rules for specific clusters can provide an insight into customers' buying behavior and marketing implications. To validate the feasibility of the proposed model, a simple dataset is collected from a financial company in Hong Kong. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method not only can improve the workflow of a financial company, but also <b>deepen</b> understanding of <b>investment</b> behavior. Thus, a corporation is able to customize the most suitable products and services for customers {{on the basis of the}} rules extracted.
