Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were often}} {{the subject of}} careful negotiations, {{particularly}} higher in society. Marriage lost its sacramental status at the Reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout the period. Women managed the household and might work beside their husbands and, although obedience to husbands was stressed, {{this may have been}} limited in practice. Divorce developed after the Reformation and was available for a wider range of causes and accessed by a much larger section of society than in England. Because of high mortality rates widowhood was a relatively common state, and some women acquired independence and status, but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common. The elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for the dead that dominated in late Medieval Scotland were removed at the Reformation and simpler services adopted. Burial inside the church was discouraged. As a result separate aisles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> graveyards with stone markers for the majority became common.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring tax cuts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian {{crossings}} in the UK and US require {{people to}} walk at 1. 2 m/s {{to cross the}} road in time; however {{a large proportion of}} older people do not walk this fast, potentially discouraging walking or putting older people at risk of injury. We use longitudinal data to investigate changes in walking speed, and ability to cross the road in time, at older ages. 31, 015 walking speed measurements were taken from 10, 249 men and women aged 60 + years in waves 1 – 7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2002 – 2014). Growth curve analyses were used to model how walking speed changes with increasing age, and predicted probabilities of being able to cross the road in time were estimated. 10 % of measured walking speeds were fast enough to cross the road in time. Walking speed declined with age (− 5. 7 × 10 − 3 m/s/yr (95 % CI − 7. 6 × 10 − 3, − 3. 9 × 10 − 3)), and the decline accelerated with increasing age (− 0. 3 × 10 − 3 m/s/yr (− 0. 4 × 10 − 3, − 0. 3 × 10 − 3)). Female, less wealthy and less healthy older people had slower walking speeds. For instance, predicted probability of crossing the road in time at age 60 was 14. 8 % (10. 1, 18. 5) and 2. 7 % (1. 5, 3. 8) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> <b>and</b> poorest men and 8. 4 % (6. 0, 1. 1) and 1. 5 % (0. 9, 2. 2) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> <b>and</b> poorest women, and at age 80 they were 7. 1 % (3. 6, 10. 5) and 1. 0 % (0. 3, 1. 7) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> <b>and</b> poorest men and 3. 7 % (1. 6, 5. 9) and 0. 5 % (0. 1, 0. 9) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> <b>and</b> poorest women. Most older people do not walk fast enough to cross the road in time. Even the majority of the wealthiest and healthiest people aged 60 years and older do not walk fast enough to cross pedestrian crossings in the allocated time. Crossing times should be increased to allow for older peoples’ slower walking speeds or other policies considered to improve walkability, and to help avoid injuries and social isolation...|$|R

The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the community of goods for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).|$|E

Elsa was raised in San Francisco, where her father sold insurance and did freelance writing for the New York Dramatic Mirror. Maxwell never completed grammar school because her father {{did not believe in}} formal education; as a result, he tutored his daughter at home.

Critics contend that it does not serve any of the townships of Gauteng where the transport problem is severe and where the majority of the people live. However, supporters maintain that the train was never meant to be an alternative to mass public transport; instead, it was intended to reduce pressure on Johannesburg's overloaded highway system. Figures released by the Gauteng provincial government in 2003 indicated that the project would do little to relieve traffic on the over-used Ben Schoeman Highway (one of the major motivations for the project), as traffic volumes would be higher when the Gautrain was completed and operating at full capacity in 2010. Leftist political groupings like the SACP and labour movements like COSATU branded the Gautrain as a train <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> called on government not to proceed with the project. A national parliamentary oversight body, the Transport Portfolio Committee, held public hearings in November 2005 and subsequently advised Cabinet to scrap or postpone the project.

Lakewood's promoters claimed that its winter temperature was usually about ten degrees warmer {{than that of}} New York City and were warmer than points located further south, but this claim is not substantiated by official records of the United States Weather Bureau. During the 1890s, Lakewood was a resort <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> famous, and The New York Times devoted a weekly column to the activities of Lakewood society.

George Jay Gould I acquired an estate at Lakewood in 1896, which is now Georgian Court University. John D. Rockefeller bought a property in 1902 which later became Ocean County Park.

He claimed farm income in Indiana had doubled since 1932, and highlighted the passage of the Old Age Pension laws. His support for conscription and military preparedness for the coming war proved unpopular with voters and cost him considerable support, but according to historian William Radcliff it was Willkie's favorite son status, which led many Hoosiers to vote Republican, that proved to be the election's deciding factor.

Brother Justin introduces her to the world of religion, but several signs suggest the preacher is not the good man Sofie thought.
