40|$|To {{investigate}} {{quantum confinement}} effects on silicon (Si) light source electroluminescence (EL) properties like quantum efficiency, external power efficiency and spectral emission, thin Si finger junctions with nanometre-scale dimensions were designed and manufactured in a fully customized silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor production technology. Since commonly available photolithography is unusable to consistently define and align nanometre-scale line-widths accurately and electron-beam lithography (EBL) {{by itself is}} too time-expensive to expose complete wafers, the wafer manufacturing process employed a selective combination of photolithography and EBL. The SOI wafers were manufactured in the clean-rooms of both the Carl and Emily Fuchs Institute for Microelectronics (CEFIM) at the University of Pretoria (UP) and the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Microelectronic Research Centre (MiRC), which made a JEOL JBX- 9300 FS <b>electron-beam</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> (EPG) available. As far as is known {{this was the first}} project in South Africa (and possibly at the MiRC) that employed EBL to define functional nanometre-scale semiconductor devices. Since no standard process recipe could be employed, the complete design and manufacturing process was based on self-obtained equipment characterization data and material properties. The manufacturing process was unprecedented in both the CEFIM and MiRC clean-rooms. The manufacture of nanometre-scale Si finger junctions not only approached the manufacturing limits of the employed processing machinery, but also had to overcome undesirable physical effects that in larger-scale semiconductor manufacture usually are negligible. The device design, mask layout and manufacturing process therefore had to incorporate various material, equipment limitation and physical phenomena like impurity redistribution occurring during the physical manufacturing process. Although the complicated manufacturing process allowed many unexpected problems to occur, it was expected that at least the simple junction breakdown devices be functional and capable of delivering data regarding quantum confinement effects. Although due to design and processing oversights only 29 out of 505 measured SOI light sources were useful light emitters, the design and manufacture of the SOI light sources was successful in the sense that enough SOI light sources were available to conduct useful optical characterization measurements. In {{spite of the fact that}} the functional light sources did not achieve the desired horizontal (width) confinement, measured optical spectra of certain devices indicate that vertical (thickness) confinement had been achieved. All spectrometer-measured thickness-confined SOI light sources displayed a pronounced optical power for 600 nm < λ < 1 μm. The SOI light source with the highest optical power output emitted about 8 times more optical power around λ = 850 nm than a 0. 35 μm bulk-CMOS avalanche light-source operating at the same current. Possible explanations for this effect are given. It was shown that the buried oxide (BOX) layer in a SOI process could be used to reflect about 25 % of the light that would usually be lost to downward radiation back up, thereby increasing the external power efficiency of SOI light sources. This document elaborates on the technical objectives, approach, chip and process design, physical wafer manufacture, production process control and measurement of the nanometre-scale SOI light sources.

40|$|The central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> for {{swimming}} Xenopus embryo is organized as two half-centres linked by reciprocal inhibition. Microelectrode recordings suggest that Xenopus neurons are poorly excitable, necessitating {{a key role}} for postinhibitory rebound {{in the operation of}} the central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> However the Xenopus central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> seems unusual in that the component neurons apparently have no intrinsic or conditional rhythmogenic properties. We have re-examined the firing properties of Xenopus embryo spinal neurons by making patch-clamp recordings in situ from intact spinal cord. Recordings made from 99 neurons were divided into three groups. Central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> neurons overwhelmingly (44 / 51) fired trains of action potentials in response to current injection. Just over half of the sensory interneurons (13 / 22) also fired trains of action potentials. Neurons that received no synaptic inputs during swimming mostly fired just one or two action potentials (22 / 26). Thirty-four neurons were identified morphologically. Commissural (8 / 12) and descending (6 / 6) interneurons, key components of the spinal central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator,</b> fired repetitive trains of action potentials during current injection. Neurons that were not part of the central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> did not demonstrate this preponderance for repetitive firing. Analysis of the interspike intervals during current injection revealed that the majority of central <b>pattern</b> <b>generators,</b> descending and commissural interneurons, could readily fire at frequencies up to twice that of swimming. We suggest that Xenopus neurons can be considered as conditional oscillators: in the presence of unpatterned excitation they exhibit an ability to fire rhythmically. This property makes the Xenopus embryonic central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> more similar to other model central <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> than has hitherto been appreciated...|$|R

The purpose of this thesis is to understand the neural control of respiration through mathematical models of the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> and phrenic motor neurons. ^ We first designed and validated a Hodgkin-Huxley type model that mimics the behavior of phrenic motor neurons under a wide range of electrical and pharmacological perturbations. This model was constrained physiological data from the literature. Next, we designed and validated a model of the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> by connecting four Hodgkin-Huxley type models of medullary respiratory neurons in a mutually inhibitory network. This network was in turn driven by a simple model of an endogenously bursting neuron, which acted as the pacemaker for the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> Finally, the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> and phrenic motor neuron models were connected and their interactions studied. ^ Our study of the models has provided a number of insights into the behavior of the respiratory central <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> and phrenic motor neurons.

SLING can synthesize linear test <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> that satisfy constraints on area, speed, internal fanout, and randomness properties and outperform existing linear test <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> designs including linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) and cellular automatons (CAs). SLING is a constraint-driven synthesis procedure that takes as input {{a set of}} constraints and then synthesizes a test <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> that satisfies those constraints. SLING uses a set of linear transformations that it applies iteratively to evolve a linear test <b>pattern</b> <b>generator.</b> Because {{of the way the}} transformations are chosen and constraints are set, a high degree of phase shift is maintained between every pair of linear sequences generated at different bit positions of the generator and cross and auto correlations are highly minimized.

5000|$|A digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> is a {{piece of}} {{electronic}} test equipment or software used to generate digital electronics stimuli. Digital electronics stimuli are a specific kind of electrical waveform varying between two conventional voltages that correspond to two logic states ("low state" [...] and [...] "high state", [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1"). The main purpose of a digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device. For that reason, the voltage levels generated by a digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generator</b> are often compatible with digital electronics I/O standards - TTL, LVTTL, LVCMOS and LVDS, for instance. Digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> are sometimes referred to as [...] "pulse generator" [...] or [...] "pulse pattern generator" [...] which may be able to function as digital <b>pattern</b> <b>generators</b> as well. Hence, the distinction between the two types of equipment may not be clear.
