25|$|Could I <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{event in}} St. Peter's Square {{took place on}} the day and at the hour when the first {{appearance}} of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything that happened to me on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, {{which turned out to be}} stronger than the deadly bullet.|$|E
25|$|According to Michel Christol though, this {{interpretation}} overly restricts {{the meaning of}} the word libertas. In Christol’s view, it is important not to <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emperor’s decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the spectre of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed “concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbours”. This would explain the honour that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, protector of the pagus) '.|$|E
500|$|Le Million never lets us <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{acoustic}} {{component is}} as much a construction as the whitewashed sets. [...] replaced dialogue with actors singing and talking in rhyming couplets. Clair created teasing confusions between on- and off-screen sound. He also experimented with asynchronous audio tricks, as in the famous scene in which a chase after a coat is synched to the cheers of an invisible football (or rugby) crowd.|$|E
60|$|However, {{the king}} derived great {{happiness}} from his beloved Christina. It {{must have been}} a pleasant sight to see the powerful monarch of Sweden playing in some magnificent hall of the palace with his merry little girl. Then he <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> weight of a kingdom rested upon his shoulders. He <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wise Chancellor Oxenstiern was waiting to consult with him how to render Sweden the greatest nation of Europe. He <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Emperor of Germany and the King of France were plotting together how they might pull him down from his throne.|$|R

500|$|With Poquita Ropa, Arjona {{wanted to}} {{drastically}} change his musical style. He {{tried to use}} as few instruments as possible, resulting in a production {{that sounds like a}} capella performances. Arjona said about the album, [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them." ...|$|E
500|$|For a broad {{public in}} Germany {{and even more}} {{throughout}} the rest of the world, [...] has become the embodiment of that which all of us were clearly, intentionally and wrongly burdened in Nuremberg.... We have not forgotten what Jochen Peiper wrote to us from Landsberg Prison in 1952: [...] "Don't <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first Europeans killed in action were in the units of the Waffen-SS, that the one beaten to death during the post war period mostly were men from our ranks. They had become fair game because of their belief in the indivisibility of Western Europe. Remember these martyrs".|$|E
500|$|Poquita Ropa {{is similar}} in style to Arjona's work on Galería Caribe (2000). With the album, Arjona wanted to {{drastically}} change his musical style. He tried to use as few instruments as possible, resulting in a production {{that sounds like a}} cappella performances. Arjona talking about the album, stated that [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Arjona {{wanted to}} change his musical style; after experimenting with using as few {{instruments}} as possible, he obtained a sound similar to an a capella performance (simplifying his sound) and introduced {{what he called a}} [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort" [...] to his music. This was heard on his twelfth studio album, Poquita Ropa. Arjona produced the album with Dan Warner, who has worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. When promoting the album Arjona said, [...] " [...] are like women; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them". Poquita Ropa became the first album since Adentro which Arjona recorded without Torres.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Bloomberg {{strongly}} supported {{the war in}} Iraq and the rationale for going in. He stated, [...] "Don't <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war started not very many blocks from here," [...] alluding to Ground Zero. In regard to the global War on Terrorism including Iraq he said, [...] "It's not only to protect Americans. It's America's responsibility to protect {{people around the world}} who want to be free." [...] During the 2004 presidential election campaign, New York City hosted the Republican National Convention at which Bloomberg endorsed President George W. Bush for President of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Catt {{published}} {{another letter}} from German women's rights activist Clara Zetkin, one that expressed {{the desire for}} all women not to let [...] "the thunder of guns and the shouts of the jingoes" [...] make them <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rise of civilisation amongst the European countries held much in common. Zetkin wrote that {{the women of the}} world should guard their children against the [...] "hollow din" [...] of [...] "cheap racial pride" [...] which filled the streets, and that [...] "the blood of dead and wounded must not become a stream to divide what present need and future hope unite." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Circassophilia {{already was}} a fad in the West, {{it took a}} {{suddenly}} different form during the Crimean War, when the alliance with the Circassians of Britain led to a more understanding, even sympathetic view of them: rather than a simple obsession with their physical characteristics; expressions of solidarity with the [...] "beautiful, honorable Circassians" [...] became a sort of war rally. Britain glumly observed the Muhajirs (Caucasian exiles) miserably, only to <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Circassians ever existed decades later once their country had been absorbed by Russia. This {{had a profound effect}} on modern nationalism, as noted by Charles King.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{extension}} of his ideas on industriousness, Carp also advised Romanians to reject the PNL's economic antisemitism, insisting that the solution to all real economic problems was the capitalist work ethic. He witnessed with concern how antisemitism damaged Western attitudes about Romania. In the early 1870s, when Bismarck implied that Romania's Jews risked being stoned by their Christian neighbors, he replied (probably tongue-in-cheek): [...] "Your Excellency should not <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Romanian has barely emerged out of the Stone Age." [...] His unpopular ideas on the Jewish issue only had one prominent Romanian disciple, the Junimist philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who used them in denouncing the antisemitic Democratic Nationalist Party.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff VanderMeer has {{described}} The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman as [...] "the finest surrealist {{novel of the}} past 30 years. It perfectly captures the ideas and ideals of surrealist beauty". In the New York Times, William Hjortsberg recommended Carter's novel, noting its attention to detail and maintaining that while reading [...] "We soon <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> terrain she observes with such care is the interior of her own imagination, for the world she describes becomes as real as any naturalist's report." [...] However, he criticised Carter's wordiness and her overuse of abstraction, simile, and metaphors. While she was successful in her early career, this later novel failed to achieve commercial success.|$|E
2500|$|Farage is {{critical}} of Britain's involvement in the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and cited their financial and human expenses and poor outcomes as reasons for Britain to not become involved militarily in Syria. He has expressed fears that rebel forces in Syria may be Islamic extremists. He said about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that [...] "Nobody should <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most devastating direct consequences of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been suffered {{by the likes of}} Mr Blair, but by the civilian populations of these countries and of course by our own brave service personnel". Farage stated that migrant exodus from Libya had been caused by NATO military intervention, approved by David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy, in the civil war in Libya.|$|E

2500|$|The Austrian field marshal's {{anxiousness}} is best {{explained by}} {{a letter he}} received from Emperor Francis I of Austria on 29 January. Francis wrote, [...] "We must not <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemy can, from the South of France, move against our left, where the allies have few men, {{and that it is}} very necessary to hold strongly the road [...] which, in case of a check, would serve for retreat". Napoleon wanted Augereau to advance toward Chalon-sur-Saône to carry out the threat that Francis feared. On 21 February, Napoleon sent Augereau a letter urging the marshal to, [...] "pull on his boots of 1793". The emperor wrote, [...] "Count Bubna has no more than 10,000 miserable troops with which to oppose you, which will disappear like a fog before the sun".|$|E
2500|$|His {{personal}} {{passion and}} extreme comfort around politicians gave him credibility that others ... would lack. Mr Valenti was a consummate salesman, who like all great salesmen ... worked himself up into believing {{the truth of}} his clients' message. Those privileged to see Mr Valenti offstage – talking openly with his clients about what could or could not be achieved, and what artifice would or would not work – are aware that Mr Valenti's clients frequently disagreed with his advice and directed him to deliver a different message through a different artifice.

2500|$|In the Narnian year 1998, Narnia was {{invaded by}} {{people from the}} West called the Telmarines, {{descendants}} of pirates from Earth, and so began the Telmarine Age of Narnia. Led by Caspian I, they left their land in the West to escape a great famine and reached Narnia by crossing a pass in the mountains. After years of Telmarine rule, the native [...] "Old Narnians" [...] decreased in number and went into hiding. Humans became the dominant species. By {{the time of the}} birth of Caspian X (a direct descendent of Caspian I), the old days of Narnia were widely regarded as legendary and knowledge of the Old Narnians was actively suppressed by the Telmarine kings. People began to fear the woods and the sea, and to <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old creatures had once lived there.|$|E
