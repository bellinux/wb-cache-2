5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the more developed <b>flanged</b> males. The transformation from unflanged to <b>flanged</b> can occur very quickly. Unflanged and <b>flanged</b> males have two different mating strategies. <b>Flanged</b> males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with <b>flanged</b> males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This biomechanical study {{examined}} difference in cement pressures generated by <b>flanged</b> and unflanged acetabular cups in hip arthroplasty. Method Using a model acetabulum, cement was inserted and pressurised followed by cup insertion and pressurisation. Pressures were recorded using transducers in the acetabulum. We compared Charnley Ogee (<b>flanged),</b> Exeter contemporary (<b>flanged)</b> and Exeter low profile (unflanged) cups using Simplex and CMW 1 cements in turn. Results Using Simplex, Charnley Ogee cup generated highest initial peak pressure and overall mean pressure. Exeter unflanged cup generated higher initial and mean pressures compared to Exeter <b>flanged</b> cup. With CMW, {{there was no}} significant difference between the pressures generated by the cups. Conclusions Our experiment suggests that <b>flanged</b> cups do not consistently generate significantly higher cement pressures compared to unflanged cups. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Flanged</b> {{sections}} {{are often}} used for long-span concrete beams to maximize their structural efficiency. However, although for the same sectional area a <b>flanged</b> section could render a higher flexural strength, it would also lead to a lower flexural ductility, especially when heavily reinforced. Thus, when evaluating the flexural performance of a beam section, both the flexural strength and ductility need to be considered. In this study, the post-peak flexural behaviour of <b>flanged</b> sections is evaluated {{by means of an}} analytical method that uses the actual stress-strain curves of the materials and takes into account strain reversal of the tension reinforcement. From the numerical results, the flexural strength-ductility performance of <b>flanged</b> sections is investigated by plotting the strength and ductility that could be simultaneously achieved in the form of design graphs. It is found that (1) at the same overall dimensions and with the same amount of reinforcement provided, a <b>flanged</b> section has lower flexural ductility than a rectangular section; (2) at the same overall dimensions, a <b>flanged</b> section has inferior strength-ductility performance compared to a rectangular section; and (3) at the same sectional area, a <b>flanged</b> section has better strength-ductility performance compared to a rectangular section.

500|$|... "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] is 2 minutes 51 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of B major. The track begins with an intro with a lead guitar melody, which plays twice, {{accompanied}} by drums, bass, distorted rhythm guitar and saxophone. The first verse begins on 14 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines [...] "Fe gawsom ni, ysbeidiau heulog, ysbeidiau heulog" [...] with a vocoder being used on the second [...] "ysbeidiau heulog". This entire phrase is then repeated, with Rhys accompanied by harmony backing vocals. Throughout this first part of the verse the only instrumentation is a distorted bass guitar and drums. The second half of the verse begins at 28 seconds with rhythm guitar, playing the chords B, B, A and E twice with little sustain, joining the drums and bass, which is no longer distorted. The track breaks down for the first chorus with Rhys singing [...] "ysbeidiau heulog" [...] four times backed by harmony vocals and occasional keyboard noises with the band rejoining on the last [...] "heulog", the rhythm guitar playing an A chord on each of the word's two syllables which are emphasised by cymbal crashes. After a drum fill an instrumental passage begins at 53 seconds. This follows the same arrangement as the intro although the lead guitar plays a melody line just once {{during the second half of}} the section, simply feedingback for the first half. The second verse starts at 1 minute 8 seconds leading into the second chorus which this time features drums fills and rhythm guitar alongside Rhys' vocals. A short bridge plays at the end of the chorus with Rhys singing [...] "Oedd ein cariad ni, heulog tan ddaeth glaw yn llif". Instrumentation is sparse with a guitar, featuring <b>flanging,</b> playing several licks alongside bass and drums, which are heavily affected by <b>flanging.</b> The bridge leads into the third and last chorus, which follows the arrangement of the second chorus although this time the drums feature <b>flanging.</b> The track ends with an instrumental outro similar to the intro. The outro begins at 2 minutes 16 seconds and features a second lead guitar with a wah-wah effect playing licks alongside the main lead guitar and saxophone. After the guitar melody has played twice the main lead guitar stops playing and the track begins to fade out.|$|E

500|$|The Notorious Byrd Brothers is {{the fifth}} album by the American rock band the Byrds and was {{released}} in January 1968 on Columbia Records (see 1968 in music).

Of these disparate styles, the subtle country and western influences evident on a number of tracks pointed towards the full-blown country rock direction that the band would pursue on their next album. In addition, The Notorious Byrd Brothers saw the band and record producer Gary Usher making extensive use of a number of studio effects and production techniques, including phasing, <b>flanging,</b> and spatial panning.

40|$|In microforming, {{handling}} and transporting of meso/micro-sized intermediate preforms are difficult {{due to the}} influence of adhesive force on preform surfaces. In this research, the fabrication of meso-scaled bulk cylindrical and <b>flanged</b> parts by directly using sheet metal is investigated. The cylinder is made with a single stroke by shearing, while the <b>flanged</b> part is formed progressively via multi-stage shearing and extrusion. In forming of the <b>flanged</b> part, an intermediate preform is fabricated with sheet metal and a pre-pierced hole for positioning. The final part is blanked out from the sheet metal in the last operation. In such a way, the transporting, positioning and ejecting of the <b>flanged</b> part are facilitated. Furthermore, the characteristics of the developed meso-scaled forming process are extensively investigated. The shearing and fractured surfaces on both the cylindrical and <b>flanged</b> parts are found. The surface grains of the blanked cylinder have undergone severe deformation and been hardened, which increases the flow stress of the blanked cylinder. In addition, the longer cylinder and <b>flanged</b> part are obtained with fine-grained material. This implies that a larger amount of material flow to the lateral side of the workpiece in the case of coarse-grained material. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} effect of flange {{thickness}} on nonlinear behavior of <b>flanged</b> shear walls. Four T shape <b>flanged</b> shear walls are studied and analyzed using finite element method. The total volume of each model is similar, such that when thickness decreases in the model, the length of wing increases. The results indicate that {{in the presence of}} lateral loads, the thickness has a significant effect on the shear absorption, ductility, displacement and crack pattern of the <b>flanged</b> shear walls. Numerical results show that shear walls with thick flanges behave more efficient than walls with thin flanges. For instance, lateral strength resisted by shear walls with thin flanges is 1250 kN which is 14 percent decrease compared with thick <b>flanged</b> wall. Moreover, nonlinear behavior of <b>flanged</b> shear wall with thick flanges shows that strength and ductility are equivalent. Finally, the analyses indicate that while flange is in pressure, the global behavior is much more improved compared with condition which is in tension...|$|R

500|$|... "Old John Robertson", {{which had}} already been issued some six months earlier as the B-side of the [...] "Lady Friend" [...] single, was another country-tinged song that {{looked forward to the}} band's future country rock experimentation. The song was {{inspired}} by a retired film director who lived in the small town near San Diego where Hillman grew up. John S. Robertson was something of an eccentric figure around the town, regularly wearing a Stetson hat and sporting a white handlebar moustache, which gave him the appearance of a character out of the old American West. In the song, Hillman recalls the children of the town and their cruel laughter at this colorful figure, as well as the combination of awe and fear that he elicited in the townsfolk. During the recording of the song, Crosby switched instruments with Hillman to play bass instead of his usual rhythm guitar. The track also makes liberal use of the studio effects known as phasing and <b>flanging,</b> particularly during the song's orchestral middle section and subsequent verse. The version of [...] "Old John Robertson" [...] found on the B-side of the [...] "Lady Friend" [...] single is a substantially different mix from the version that appears on The Notorious Byrd Brothers album.|$|E
500|$|... "A Forest" [...] is {{performed}} in the key of A minor. Initially only the synth, guitar and drums are heard, followed {{by the introduction of}} the bass guitar and a second guitar part. The song initially follows an Am–C–F–Dm progression. Later on the track, its bridge contains a B–C–F#m–C–B–C sequence, which ends with a chromatic movement to the F chord before returning to Am. Following the echoing repetition of the word [...] "again", a guitar solo appears which avoids string bends and moving in a pentatonic manner. The single version of the song fades out at around four minutes, while on the longer (album) version the instruments exit one by one, concluding with the sound of the bass guitar at 4.46". The sound of Smith's guitar was a departure from that prevalent in the 1970s. Mike Hedges favored the use of <b>flanging</b> at the time, and he estimated that there were seven flanger devices used on [...] "A Forest". Rikki Rooksby said that the slow phase effect heard on the guitar in [...] "A Forest" [...] "almost became a Smith trademark for a while".

The song breaks down at 25 seconds for the first verse with just bass, drums, acoustic guitar and occasional synthesizer accompanying Gruff Rhys's vocals which are fed through a vocoder. The first chorus begins at 47 seconds with the strings and harp re-entering while Rhys sings the words [...] "You've got to tolerate all those people that you hate, I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against you" [...] twice without the use of a vocoder. The song breaks down again for the second verse after which the second chorus enters at 1 minute 33 seconds. The outro begins at 1 minute 58 seconds with Rhys singing [...] "Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed, just suppose I'm juxtaposed with you" [...] supported by harmony backing vocals. The rest of the band continue singing these words while Rhys begins singing the chorus lyrics, starting at 2 minutes 43 seconds. The track ends with Rhys singing the words [...] "Let's get juxtaposed" [...] backed only by harmony vocals.|$|E
