5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for <b>her</b> <b>comments</b> about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments.
