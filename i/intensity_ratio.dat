As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the <b>intensity</b> <b>ratio</b> of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E

25|$|The optical {{absorption}} spectrum of pyridine in hexane contains three bands at the wavelengths of 195nm (π→π* transition, molar absorptivity ε=7500L·mol−1·cm−1), 251nm (π→π* transition, ε=2000L·mol−1·cm−1) and 270nm (n→π* transition, ε=450L·mol−1·cm−1). The 1H {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectrum of pyridine contains three signals with the integral <b>intensity</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2:1:2 that correspond to the three chemically different protons in the molecule. These signals originate from the α-protons (positions 2 and 6, chemical shift 8.5ppm), γ-proton (position 4, 7.5ppm) and β-protons (positions 3 and 5, 7.1ppm). The carbon analog of pyridine, benzene, has only one proton signal at 7.27ppm. The larger chemical shifts of the α- and γ-protons in comparison to benzene result from the lower electron density in the α- and γ-positions, which {{can be derived from}} the resonance structures. The situation is rather similar for the 13CNMR spectra of pyridine and benzene: pyridine shows a triplet at δ(α-C)=150ppm, δ(β-C)=124ppm and δ(γ-C)=136ppm, whereas benzene has a single line at 129ppm. All shifts are quoted for the solvent-free substances. Pyridine is conventionally detected by the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry methods.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} parametric x-radiation (PXR) {{generated by}} Silicon and Lithium Fluoride monochromators, {{including the first}} observation of PXR from Lithium Fluoride. Parametric x-radiation may {{be described as the}} Bragg scattering of virtual photons associated with relativistic electrons as they pass through single crystal monochromators. As the photons interact with the crystal lattice they produce x-rays which meet the Bragg condition lambda = 2 dsintheta sub B, where theta sub B is the angle between the electron beam and the crystal plane. PXR data were collected from Silicon and Lithium Fluoride crystals using a SiLi detector. The locations of the energy peaks are compared to the locations predicted by theory and the <b>intensity</b> <b>ratios</b> between the peaks are also compared to the theoretical ratios. The PXR energy observed was as predicted by theory for Silicon and Lithium Fluoride monochromators. The observed peak <b>intensity</b> <b>ratios</b> for Silicon were not in agreement with <b>intensity</b> <b>ratios</b> predicted by theory. <b>Intensity</b> <b>ratios</b> observed from Lithium Fluoride were in agreement with the predicted value. jg p 2 NANAU.

The purpose of this project was to determine whether the use of <b>intensity</b> <b>ratios</b> in key regions of the brain might better detect regions of injured brain and thus improve the correlation of imaging findings with 12 -month neurode-velopmental outcome. METHODS: Prospectively acquired MR studies of 53 asphyxiated neonates were reviewed retrospectively. Signal intensities from standard T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images of seven major brain regions that are affected in asphyxia were measured. <b>Intensity</b> <b>ratios</b> were calculated by dividing the signal intensity of each brain region by the signal intensity of the ocular vitreous. The <b>intensity</b> <b>ratios</b> were then correlated with 12 -month neurodevelopmental outcome. These results were compared with correlations determined by a qualitative scoring system.

25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real <b>intensity</b> <b>ratio,</b> the {{diameter}} of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E
