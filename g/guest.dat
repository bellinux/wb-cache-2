40|$|This study {{assessed}} ambient {{elements in}} the physical hotel lobby environment: cleanliness, style, color, layout, furnishings, lighting, temperature, scent, sound level, music, and employee service at three San Francisco boutique hotels.

The analysis of <b>guests</b> and employees found that <b>guests</b> perceived cleanliness, style, well-maintained furnishings, and scent created a more positive impression than the employee perceived in creating an efficient work environment. Based on <b>guests???</b> gender, female <b>guests</b> believed color, temperature, and music to be more impressive than males, and male <b>guests</b> perceived impact of a lobby to be more prominent than females.

40|$|Ninety-two 7 - to 9 -year-old {{children}} (47 girls) {{were observed}} {{while attempting to}} join two relatively unfamiliar same- or opposite-sex peers who were playing a board game. Female <b>guests</b> were less obtrusive than male <b>guests</b> in their entry approaches, whereas male <b>guests</b> were more active and assertive. <b>Guests</b> were less behaviorally constrained when approaching same- than opposite-sex hosts. Female hosts were more socially attentive to the <b>guests</b> than male hosts, who tended to ignore the newcomers. Entry outcomes were best predicted by the joint contributions of the <b>guests</b> 2 ̆ 7 and hosts 2 ̆ 7 gender and behavior. Successful <b>guests</b> performed activity-related behavior, received initiations from the hosts, and responded contingently to host initiations. Since female hosts initiated more behavior to the <b>guests</b> than male hosts, and female <b>guests</b> were more contingently responsive than male <b>guests,</b> girls entering female groups were the most successful. These findings support the thesis that peer group entry is an interactional phenomenon affected by the personal characteristics and contexts of both the entering children and their hosts...|$|R
