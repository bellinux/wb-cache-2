5|$|The {{culture of}} the islands has been {{affected}} by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Most of the Hebrides <b>have</b> <b>names</b> with Scots Gaelic derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend to be derived from the Viking names.

5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake <b>have</b> <b>names</b> reflecting what once was there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must <b>have</b> <b>names,</b> the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent names, {{rather than}} {{continuing}} the airy spirits theme (only Puck and Mab continued the trend), {{have focused on}} Herschel's source material. In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer Gerard Kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare's plays and The Rape of the Lock (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda <b>have</b> <b>names</b> drawn from the latter; all the rest are from Shakespeare). At first, the outermost moons were all named after characters from one play, The Tempest; but with Margaret being named from Much Ado About Nothing that trend has ended.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements {{to the west of}} the dyke that <b>have</b> <b>names</b> that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it may be that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that must have gone into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great {{construction of}} the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Saturn are {{numerous}} and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer {{across to the}} enormous Titan, which {{is larger than the}} planet Mercury. Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which <b>have</b> <b>names</b> and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers, as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to be ellipsoidal in shape, though only two of those, Titan and Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon (after Jupiter's Ganymede) in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system; and Enceladus since its chemical composition {{is similar to that of}} comets. In particular, Enceladus emits jets of gas and dust which could indicate presence of liquid water under its south pole region and could potentially harbor a global ocean under its surface.|$|E
5|$|After invading Britain in 43AD the Romans {{crossed the}} Humber Estuary in 71AD {{to invade the}} Northumbrian {{territory}} of the Parisi tribe. From their bridgehead at Petuaria they travelled northwards and built roads along the Wolds to Derventio, present day Malton, and then westwards to the River Ouse where they built the fort of Eboracum. There is evidence of extensive use of the light soils of the Wolds for grain farming in the Roman era. Several Roman villas which were the centres of large agricultural estates have been identified around Langton and Rudston. In the low-lying lands {{on either side of}} the Wolds there was an increase in the number of settlements between 500BC and 500AD as the land became drier and more accessible due to a fall in sea level. The lower-lying land was used for stock breeding. During the last years of Roman occupation Anglo-Saxon raiders were troubling the area and, by the second half of the 5thcentury, settlement by Anglian invaders was taking place in east Yorkshire. Village names containing the elements -ing, -ingham or -ham are Anglian settlement names. As Christianity became established in the area from the 7thcentury onwards, several cemeteries like the one at Garton on the Wolds show evidence of the abandonment of pagan burial practices. In 867AD the Great Danish Army captured the Anglian town of York, and the remnants of the army settled in Yorkshire from 876AD when their leader Halfdan shared out the land among them. Scandinavian settlements <b>have</b> <b>names</b> including the elements -by and -thorpe. Scandinavian rule in the area came to an end in 954AD with the death of their ruler Eric Bloodaxe.|$|E
