25|$|An {{electric}} blanket is a blanket with an integrated electrical <b>heating</b> <b>device</b> usually placed above the top bed sheet. The first {{electric blanket}} {{was invented in}} 1912 by American physician Sidney I. Russell.

25|$|An {{oil burner}} is a <b>heating</b> <b>device</b> which burns fuel oil. The oil is {{directed}} under pressure through a nozzle {{to produce a}} fine spray, which is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through by an electric fan. In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the oil burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{illustration}} is {{the interior}} of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the <b>heating</b> <b>device</b> and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). Due to the variety of possible voltages and currents available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.|$|E

40|$|The {{cryogenic}} refrigerator thermal design calculations establish design approach and basic sizing of the machine's elements. After the basic design is defined, effort concentrates on matching the thermodynamic design {{with that of}} the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>devices</b> (<b>heat</b> exchangers and regenerators). Typically, the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>device</b> configurations and volumes are adjusted to improve their heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics. These adjustments imply that changes be made to the active displaced volumes, compensating for the influence of the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>devices</b> on the thermodynamic processes of the working fluid. Then, once the active volumes are changed, the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>devices</b> require adjustment to account for the variations in flows, pressure levels, and heat loads. This iterative process is continued until the thermodynamic cycle parameters match the design of the <b>heat</b> transfer <b>devices.</b> By examing several matched designs, a near-optimum refrigerator is selected...|$|R

25|$|Diamond is an {{extremely}} effective thermal conductor and usually an electrical insulator. The former property is widely exploited {{in the use of}} an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a <b>heating</b> <b>device</b> while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. As most simulants are thermal insulators, the thermistor's heat will not be conducted. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. The only possible exception is moissanite, which has a thermal conductivity similar to diamond: older probes can be fooled by moissanite, but newer Thermal and Electrical Conductivity testers are sophisticated enough to differentiate the two materials.|$|E

The latter was supplied from a provisioner, Stephen Goldner, who was awarded the contract on 1 April 1845, a mere seven weeks before Franklin set sail. Goldner worked frantically on the large and hasty order of 8,000tins.

50|$|Thermal {{fracturing}} {{in glass}} occurs when sufficient temperature differential is created within glass.As a warmed area expands or a cooled area contracts, stress forces develop potentially leading to fracture. A temperature differential may {{be created in}} many ways including solar <b>heating,</b> space <b>heating</b> <b>devices,</b> fire, hot and cold liquids. Sloping glass surfaces are subject to greater solar radiation than vertical surfaces and so {{are more prone to}} solar thermal fracture. In framed window glass the edges are relatively cooler than the exposed areas so space <b>heating</b> <b>devices</b> in very close proximity may cause thermal fracture.|$|R
