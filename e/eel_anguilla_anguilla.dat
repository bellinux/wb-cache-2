25|$|Nearly every {{freshwater}} fish species of France {{can be found}} in the Loire river basin, that is, about 57 species from 20 families. Many of them are migratory, with 11 species ascending the river for spawning. The most common species are the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta), shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). The European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla)</b> is common in the upper streams, whereas the flounder (Platichtys flesus) and flathead mullet (Mugil spp.) tend to stay near the river mouth. The tributaries host brown trout (Salmo trutta), European bullhead (Cottus gobio), European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), zander (Sander lucioperca), nase (Chondrostoma nasus and C. toxostoma) and wels catfish (Siluris glanis). The endangered species include grayling (Thymallus thymallus), burbot (Lota lota) and bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus) and the non-native species are represented by the rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris).|$|E

5000|$|The European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla)</b> was {{historically}} the {{one most}} familiar to Western scientists, beginning with Aristotle, who wrote the earliest known inquiry into {{the natural history of}} eels.

Many centuries passed before scientists were able to demonstrate that such spontaneous generation does not occur in nature.|$|E
50|$|These opossum shrimps are {{frequently}} found {{in large numbers}} and filter small food particles out of the water, occasionally consuming larger prey. The diet consists largely of detritus, but water fleas and copepods are also consumed. Opossum shrimps themselves often fall prey to fish. In the Frisian Lakes these include the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), the European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), the ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua), young pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) and sometimes the European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla).</b> The females have a brood pouch under their thorax in which eggs and young develop.|$|E
50|$|Anguillicoloides crassus is a {{parasitic}} nematode worm {{that lives}} in the swimbladders of eels (Anguilla spp.) and appears to spread easily among eel populations after introduction to a body of water. It {{is considered to be}} one of the threats to the sustainability of populations of European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla).</b> It was introduced to the European continent in the 1980s, where it was reported independently from Germany and Italy in 1982, having probably been introduced from Taiwan. It is thought to have reached England in 1987 from continental Europe. It is a natural parasite of the Japanese eel in its native range.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} at aquaculture of longfin eels. The first were in the 1970s, and did not remain operational for long, with the last farm closing in 1982. The most common reasons for these failures were economic (the high cost of production vs low price for the eels), variable recruitment of glass eels, and the high mortality (death) rates in the farms. Since the early 2000s, there has been renewed interest in the aquaculture of longfins due to the increasing knowledge of their biology and the diminishing stocks of European <b>eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla),</b> but no farms have been built.|$|R
40|$|An {{update of}} length–weight and length–age {{relationships}} for yellow, silver and mixed population of European <b>eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla</b> L.) of the Comacchio Lagoon, Italy, {{is provided in}} this study using data obtained in 2011. This historically important eel stock has undergone 99 % feminization, {{probably due to the}} significant density reduction over the past three decades. The results show that these conditions did not affect the length–weight relationships, which approximate those of the late 1970 s, but they do affect the length–age relationships, leading to faster maturation rates. These conditions lead to younger, longer and heavier silver eels before their migration to the Sargasso Sea...|$|R
40|$|Diel and {{seasonal}} {{shifts in the}} feeding activity and intensity of a riverine stock of European <b>eels,</b> <b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla</b> (L.), were assessed in the Río LLorín, a right-side tributary of the Río Esva drainage (northwestern Spain). No consistent diel cycles were detected in either season (eels feed with similar intensity {{in the day and}} at night), but increased feeding activity was evidenced during the warmer months relative to weaker but still significant activity in winter. Heterogeneity in both feeding activity and intensity may stem from the high rates of secondary production in the form of benthic food available for eels, and mild temperatures all year round...|$|R
50|$|Fresh water {{creates a}} {{hypotonic}} environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney. Although most aquatic organisms {{have a limited}} ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish {{have the ability to}} migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla)</b> uses the hormone prolactin, while in salmon (Salmo salar) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.|$|E
50|$|As {{a highly}} {{opportunistic}} predator, the Eurasian eagle-owl will hunt almost any appropriately sized prey they encounter.

Eurasian eagle-owls do take rare or endangered species as well. Among the species considered at least vulnerable (up to critically endangered as in the mink and eel, both heavily overexploited by humans) to extinction known to be hunted by Eurasian eagle-owls are Russian desman (Desmana moschata) Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus), barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus), European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus), southwestern water vole (Arvicola sapidus), European mink (Mustela lutreola), marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna), lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythrops), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), saker falcon (Falco cherrug), houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), great bustard (Otis tarda), spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>anguilla)</b> and lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus).|$|E
