5|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> {{the records}} of the Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> my book, {{you find}} a certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

I think what Doyle is hinting at is that Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sat in Baker Street and said, 'Right, we're {{going to have to go}} and kill him, aren't we? That's the only way we can do this.' So they break in, kill him, and then Dr. Watson writes up a version of the story that puts the murder [...]|$|E

500|$|I'm {{not sure}} how that will play out. The geneticists, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> their papers, have long been using code words. They sort of dropped the term [...] "race" [...] about 1980 or earlier, and instead you see code words like [...] "population" [...] or [...] "population structure." [...] Now that they're able to define race in genetic terms they tend to use other words, like [...] "continental groups" [...] or [...] "continent of origin," [...] which does, indeed, {{correspond}} to the everyday conception of race. When I'm writing I prefer {{to use the word}} race because that's the word that everyone understands. It's a word with baggage, but it's not necessarily a malign word.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, {{speaking}} at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket.

[...] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E
2500|$|Alvin Rosenfeld {{was highly}} {{critical}} of The New York Times coverage, alleging that the article on the whole was misleading and incorrectly framed his argument, the admitted mischaracterization of the AJC was just one example. The mischaracterization, according to Rosenfeld, even includes {{the title of the}} article, which describes the targets of his critical essay as 'Liberal Jews' when, Rosenfeld wrote, [...] "I never referred to liberal Jews, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> my piece carefully you simply won't find the phrase." [...] Gershom Gorenberg concurs with this criticism writing that the [...] "essay itself refers to 'progressives', a group that overlaps with liberals but is not synonymous". The misleading coverage, Rosenfeld wrote, [...] "reduced my argument to a kind of Left-Right, Conservative-Liberal face off" [...] and led to many people misreading the essay.|$|E

2500|$|The word robotics, used to {{describe}} this field of study, was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov created the [...] "Three Laws of Robotics" [...] which are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction. (The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created {{has the ability to}} understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. [...] "People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical," [...] said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On the Road {{has been}} the object of {{critical}} study since its publication. [...] David Brooks of The New York Times compiled several opinions and summarized them in an Op-Ed from October 2, 2007. Whereas Millstein {{saw it as a}} story in which the heroes took pleasure in everything, George Mouratidis, an editor of a new edition, claimed [...] "above all else, the story is about loss." [...] "It's a book about death and the search for something meaningful to hold on to—the famous search for 'IT,' a truth larger than the self, which, of course, is never found," [...] wrote Meghan O'Rourke in Slate. [...] "Kerouac was this deep, lonely, melancholy man," [...] Hilary Holladay of the University of Massachusetts Lowell told The Philadelphia Inquirer. [...] "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the book closely, you see that sense of loss and sorrow swelling on every page." [...] "In truth, 'On the Road' is a book of broken dreams and failed plans," [...] wrote Ted Gioia in The Weekly Standard.|$|E
2500|$|Sackveille-West's novel Challenge also bears {{witness to}} her affair with Trefusis: Sackville-West and Trefusis had started {{writing this book}} as a {{collaborative}} endeavour, and the male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. Challenge is a roman à clef with the character of Julian being only a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Trefusis. Notably, Sackville-West in Challenge defends Trefusis against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Trefussis a [...] "swine" [...] and a [...] "pig", and in the book Julian goes {{out of his way}} to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig. In the book, Julian says that [...] "Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine". Reflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an [...] "insinuating femininity" [...] that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence. [...] Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: [...] "Don't please dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did". When Challenge was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: [...] "This book is yours, honored witch. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it, you will find your tormented soul changed and free". Throughout their relationship, Trefusis was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue. As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown. The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Trefusis. Her mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son Nigel Nicolson (1973, p.194) praises his mother: [...] "She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything… How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?" ...|$|E
