5000|$|Hands are {{generally}} placed akimbo and <b>feet</b> <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> {{in a neutral}} position. The following moves {{take place on the}} beat of the drum during the song.|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} {{starts with}} the <b>feet</b> <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> The leg is lifted from the ground, with the knee bent, and the foot curled in toward the buttocks. The leg is returned {{to the starting position}} and the exercise performed on the other side. One or two hands may be rested on a chair or other stable surface for support.|$|E
5000|$|Mumblety-peg is {{generally}} played {{between two people}} {{with the aid of}} a pocket knife. In one version of the game, two opponents stand opposite one another with their <b>feet</b> <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> The first player then takes the knife and throws it to [...] "stick" [...] in the ground as near his own foot as possible. The second player then repeats the process. Whichever player [...] "sticks" [...] the knife closest to his own foot wins the game.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{stance of}} naihanchi {{is a slight}} variant from the Isshin Ryu stance [...] "kiba-dachi", in which both <b>feet</b> are <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> facing forward. [...] "Naihanchi-dachi," [...] as it's called, takes kiba-dachi and turns the balls of the feet (area of foot just behind the toes) and turns them inward and accentuates the {{continuous}} bend at the knees Isshin Ryu Karateka are taught from initiation.|$|R
5000|$|To shoot an arrow, an archer first {{assumes the}} correct stance. The body {{should be at}} or nearly {{perpendicular}} to the target and the shooting line, with the <b>feet</b> placed <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the [...] "open stance" [...] or the [...] "closed stance" [...] may be used, although many choose to stick with a [...] "neutral stance". Each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.|$|R
50|$|As in all Indian martial arts, {{training}} {{begins with}} stepping patterns and then basic sword strikes. The main sword stance is the lion posture, {{in which the}} body leans forward with one leg stretched back and the other bent forward. The <b>feet</b> are about <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> and form a 45 degree angle. This stance emphasises phidup or a coil, enabling a springing action. At higher levels, exponents slice pieces of watermelons on a person's body without causing any injury. This is eventually done blindfolded.|$|R
3000|$|The {{subjects}} {{of both groups}} were measured while standing without shoes in a relaxed position with their <b>feet</b> <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> In response to an auditory imperative stimulus (S [...]...|$|E
40|$|Subjective visual {{vertical}} (SVV) {{judgment and}} standing stability were separately investigated among patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Although, one study has investigated the central mechanism of stability {{control in the}} AIS population, the relationships between SVV, decreased standing stability, and AIS have never been investigated. Through event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study examined the effect of postural control demands (PDs) on AIS central mechanisms related to SVV judgment and standing stability to elucidate the time-serial stability control process. Thirteen AIS subjects (AIS group) and 13 age-matched adolescents (control group) aged 12 – 18 years were recruited. Each subject had to complete an SVV task (i. e., the modified rod-and-frame [mRAF] test) as a stimulus, with online electroencephalogram recording being performed in the following three standing postures: <b>feet</b> <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> standing, feet together standing, and tandem standing. The behavioral performance in terms of postural stability (center of pressure excursion), SVV (accuracy and reaction time), and mRAF-locked ERPs (mean amplitude and peak latency of the P 1, N 1, and P 2 components) was then compared between the AIS and control groups. In the behavioral domain, the results revealed that only the AIS group demonstrated a significantly accelerated SVV reaction time as the PDs increased. In the cerebral domain, significantly larger P 2 mean amplitudes were observed during both feet shoulder-width-apart standing and feet together standing postures compared with during tandem standing. No group differences were noted in the cerebral domain. The results indicated that (1) during the dual-task paradigm, a differential behavioral strategy of accelerated SVV reaction time was observed in the AIS group only when the PDs increased and (2) the decrease in P 2 mean amplitudes {{with the increase in}} the PD levels might be direct evidence of the competition for central processing attentional resources under the dual-task postural control paradigm...|$|E
5000|$|Ma Bu, {{known as}} [...] "horse stance" [...] or [...] "horse-riding stance," [...] is a {{fundamental}} stance found in nearly all styles of wushu. In actual attack and defense, Ma Bu is sometimes viewed as a transitional stance, from which a practitioner may quickly switch to other stances. The stance typically begins with the <b>feet</b> a <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> The <b>feet</b> are parallel, straight forward, and the knees are bent at 90 degrees. The torso sinks down as if following a plum line and the sacrum curves forward and in or arches. Equal weighting (50-50) is given to each foot, making for a very stable stance. Ma Bu is frequently used for conditioning and building up knee strength. Many kung fu masters required students {{to be able to}} hold Ma Bu for at least five minutes before learning the forms of a style.|$|R
50|$|The Sumo deadlift is a {{variation}} where one will approach {{the bar with}} the <b>feet</b> wider than <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> and grip the bar with a close grip inside of one's legs and proceed with correct form. Compared to conventional deadlifts, the Sumo deadlift puts more emphasis on the glutes, hamstrings, hips, quads, and traps with less of an impact on spinal erectors and the posterior chain. Weightlifters {{with a history of}} back injuries may find that sumo deadlifts are a viable alternative. If allowed in competition, many lifters favor the Sumo deadlift due to shorter bar travel from floor to lockout.|$|R
2500|$|Golfers {{start with}} the non-dominant {{side of the body}} facing the target (for a right-hander, the target is to their left). At address, the player's body and the {{centerline}} of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel, with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward. The <b>feet</b> are commonly <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> for middle irons and putters, narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods. The ball is typically positioned more to the [...] "front" [...] of the player's stance (closer to the leading foot) for lower-lofted clubs, with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot. The ball is placed further [...] "back" [...] in the player's stance (toward the trailing foot) as the loft of the club to be used increases. Most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance, while a few mid- and short-iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between the ball and clubface, so the ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf.|$|R
50|$|Straight {{arms with}} hands {{placed on the}} ground {{approximately}} <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Military Press is {{performed}} {{in a similar manner}} to the Chinese Push Up, but the hands are placed <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{platform}} stance the feet are kept about <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> throughout the serve, providing stable support and easy weight transfer {{from the back}} to the front foot. The hips rotate, and sometimes the back foot swings forward to complete the hip rotation.|$|R
5000|$|Side burpee : The athlete bends at {{waist and}} places hand <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> {{to the side}} of right or left foot. Jump both legs out to side and land on the outer and inner sides of your feet. Jump back in, jump up, and repeat on {{opposite}} side.|$|R
50|$|A handstand is {{the act of}} {{supporting}} the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> There are many variations of handstands, but in all cases a handstand performer must possess adequate balance and upper body strength.|$|R
50|$|Air quotes, {{also called}} finger quotes, are virtual {{quotation}} marks {{formed in the}} air with one's fingers when speaking. This is typically done with hands held <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> and at the eye level of the speaker, with the index and middle fingers on each hand flexing {{at the beginning and end}} of the phrase being quoted. The air-quoted phrase is—in the most common usage—very short, at most a few words. Air quotes are often used to express satire, sarcasm, irony or euphemism, among others, and are analogous to scare quotes in print.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} starts by grasping a stable, waist-level surface {{such as a}} couch, railing, {{table or}} a horizontal bar. The surface is grasped with an overhand grip, hands <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> The <b>feet</b> are placed back slightly further than a standard push up position. The body is kept straight, while the arms are bent and the body lowered until the head is below the hands. The body is then raised by pushing up with the arms until the arms are locked out straight. The elbows should be kept pointed straight down throughout the movement.|$|R
5000|$|This {{advanced}} form of crossover {{involves the}} ball handler bouncing the ball {{off of the}} floor behind his feet and catching it with the other hand, usually while his feet {{are no more than}} <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> If there are no defensive players around the ball handler except one directly facing him, and that defender does not expect this type of dribble, it can be an even safer way of crossing over compared to a between-the-legs. In all other cases, it is generally a dangerous move that can result in the ball bouncing off of the dribbler's feet or a steal.|$|R
5000|$|Goaltending in box {{lacrosse}} {{tends to}} be more like goaltending in ice hockey than field lacrosse. [...] The box goalie's stance is similar to an ice hockey goalie. The goalie crouched, but with his knees spread, not pinched like in ice hockey. Heels <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart,</b> toes generally pointed on an outward angle to allow for stepping into the shot. One hand sits on top of the thigh, holding the goal stick in a position to cover the five-hole (the area between the legs) and the other hand is resting or propped out in the vicinity between the waistline and the outside of the upper thigh. The elbow is propped out, ready to swing out towards a high shot.|$|R
5000|$|The modern boxing stance differs in {{many ways}} from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. A {{right-handed}} boxer stands with the legs <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> with the right foot a half-step behind the left foot. The left (lead) fist is held vertically about six inches {{in front of the}} face at eye level. The right (rear) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs. Southpaw boxers use the same stance, but with the right and left reversed. Modern boxers are taught to [...] "push off" [...] with their feet in order to move effectively.|$|R
30|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that athletes benefit from {{information in the}} process of acquiring motor skills by directing the attention to movements (Beilock et al., 2002). Similarly, in ACL injury prevention, instructions direct the athlete’s attention to various aspects of movements. In the motor learning domain, this type of attentional focus is termed “internal focus” (Wulf et al., 1998). Instructions are directed towards the execution of the movements itself such as “keep the knee over the toe”; “land with a flexed knee”; “raise the knee {{to the level of the}} hip” or “land with your <b>feet</b> <b>shoulder-width</b> apart” (Risberg and Holm 2009, Wilk et al., 2012). Unfortunately, encouraging athletes to improve awareness and knee control during balance, cutting, jumping, and landing (Holm et al., 2004) requires attentional capacity. In turn, this limits the available capacity for fast and complex motor skills that are needed for quick responses to an opponent’s action.|$|R
30|$|Each subject had {{to perform}} the {{following}} tests to exhaustion: SUT, PUT, and ST. Each test has been performed in a different day, within a period of 7  days. The random sequence was balanced as follow: each participant was {{randomly assigned to one}} of the three groups we created (Group A: ST, PUT, SUT; Group B: PUT, ST, SUT; Group C: SUT, ST, PUT). Two interval days were planned for each group A, B, C. The same operator administered each test, supervising the correct execution, and inviting participants to perform till exhaustion. In particular, the PUT could be considered correctly executed if the following criteria are guaranteed: The exercise was performed on a flat, stable surface, hands placed slightly wider than <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart,</b> and fingers pointed forward. Participants were instructed to maintain a neutral spine and feet together position throughout the entire movement. Once again, in order for the repetition to be recorded the correct depth needed to be met. Participants were instructed to lower the body until the chest was within 2 inch from the floor (Snarr and Esco 2013). The ST execution referrers to: place feet a little wider than <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> Extend the arms out straight. Initiate movement by inhaling and unlocking the hips, slightly bringing them back. Keep sending hips backward as the knees begin to flex. Bring hips parallel to ground. Return to standing position (Swinton et al. 2012). The correct SUT execution is provided by: The subject lay supine on the floor with 90 ° flexion in the knee joints, hands at the side of their head, and with elbows pointing straight forward. To do a correct sit-up execution the elbows should touch the knees and then go back so the shoulders touch the floor (Blomqvist et al. 2013). The number of repetitions performed was recorded to quantify the grade of endurance in each test. The condition of exhaustion (i.e., execution till failure) consisted to the inability to perform another repetition. In all tests, the participants were asked to constantly exercise through the concentric and eccentric phase of movements without any rest between the upper and lower grade of movements. The cadence of movements was controlled by a beep sounds coming from the Apps Runtastic Fitness© GmbH 2015.|$|R
50|$|Like most South Asian martial arts, gatka {{begins with}} {{footwork}} and tactical body positioning (pentra). The {{foundation of the}} art is a movement methodology {{for the use of}} the feet, body, arms and weapons in unison. In the first and most basic stance, the feet are spaced about <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> with the weight divided evenly between them. While walking from this position, the exponent spills their centre of gravity as they initiate any movement. This is done by stepping forward just before the front knee locks out, never hyper-extending the leg at any point. This gait is meant to be applied to daily life so that it becomes natural in battle where it allows one to quickly change direction. Gatka favors rhythmic movement, without hesitation, doubt or anxiety. The attacking and defense methods are based upon the positions of the hands, feet and weapon(s) during the dexterity regimen. Chanting of holy verses may accompany these exercises, and the three-beat-per-cycle played by a drummer adds to the coordination during practice.|$|R
2500|$|In a fully upright stance, {{the boxer}} stands with the legs <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> and the rear foot a {{half-step}} {{in front of}} the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches {{in front of the}} face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the [...] "textbook" [...] stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{invitation}} of Ed Parker, Lee appeared in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups (using the thumb and the index finger of one hand) with feet at approximately a <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart.</b> In the same Long Beach event he also performed the [...] "One inch punch." [...] Lee stood upright, his right foot forward with knees bent slightly, {{in front of a}} standing, stationary partner. Lee's right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately 1 in away from the partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture, sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind the partner to prevent injury, though his partner's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor. His volunteer was Bob Baker of Stockton, California. [...] "I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again", Baker recalled. [...] "When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable".|$|R

50|$|The fencing {{stance and}} {{movements}} may appear artificial, {{but they have}} evolved over centuries {{of trial and error}} to afford optimal protection and mobility. Fencers tend to stand somewhat side-on to the principal direction of movement (the fencing line), leading with the weapon side (right for a right-hander, left for a left-hander). In this fencing stance the <b>feet</b> are a <b>shoulder-width</b> or more <b>apart</b> with the leading foot forward and the trailing foot at right angles to it. Finally, the knees are well bent and the center of gravity is kept midway between the heels. The fencer is now in a position where he/she is well balanced, able to use his/her leg muscles to generate rapid bursts of speed and change directions with comparative ease. In foil and épée, particularly, this stance decreases the vulnerable target area. Further, and more importantly, it maintains balance and ease of movement both forward and backward.|$|R
50|$|Stick-fighting or danda-yuddha employs {{either the}} single or double stick. The stick or danda is {{generally}} {{the length of}} three handspans and made of Indian ebony. They are often capped with steel on one end. Sticks are used as an implement of instruction for small weapons such as axes (kuhara), but were also used during war to beat down armoured opponents. The danda is traditionally worn {{on the right side}} and drawn from underneath the belt, in contrast to swords which are worn on the opposite side and drawn from above. Stick fighters generally employ a single-hand grip but the double grip is also commonly used for certain techniques. When attacking, the fighter hits their opponent with only the rim of the danda's tip, thereby focusing all the power into a small point. One stance is the angaraksha or bodyguard position in which the feet are placed slightly more than <b>shoulder-width</b> <b>apart</b> and the arms are placed across the chest, as if crossed, while the danda is held in the right hand. This stance was once used by armed guards who relied on their peripheral vision to watch for attackers. Modern exponents still use this form of training to develop surti or awareness so that they can anticipate an attack from behind or from the side without having to look directly at the attacker.|$|R
