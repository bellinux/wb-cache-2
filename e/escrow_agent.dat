This paper proposes a mechanism that provides cryptographic fetters on the mining of personal data, enabling efficient mining of previously-negotiated properties, but preventing any other uses of the protected personal data. Our approach does not rely on complete trust in the analysts to use the data appropriately, nor does it rely on incorruptible <b>escrow</b> <b>agents.</b> Instead, we propose conditional data escrow where the data generators, not the analysts, hold {{the keys to the}} data, but analysts can verify that the prenegotiated queries are enabled. Our solution relies on verifiable, anonymous, and deterministic commitments which play the role of tags that mark encrypted entries in the analyst's database. The database owner cannot learn anything from the encrypted entries, or even verify his guess of the plaintext on which these entries are based. On the other hand, the verifiable and deterministic property ensures that the entries are marked with consistent tags, so that the database manager learns when the number of entries required to enable some query reaches the pre-negotiated threshold...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Decisions. As we {{move through}} our {{everyday}} activities, we make decisions. Many are routine, {{do not involve}} risk or focus on a single issue. We know what to expect. Some decisions, however, entail risk and uncertain outcomes. Such decisions {{are referred to as}} "high stakes" This dissertation determined how time pressure and emotion influence people's information behavior when engaging in high stakes decision-making within the home buying domain. Additionally, the study tested Chatman's Theory of Normative Behavior (Chatman, 2000) and ascertained the helpfulness of deciders' Information Grounds (Fisher, Durrance, & Hinton, 2004). By examining these phenomena, I expand the information behavior knowledge base. Employing an exploratory approach, I performed a deep, reflective ersatz home buying experience, conducted 33 semi-structured interviews using a timeline strategy and carried out eight observations with participants from the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area. Participants included homebuyers and home buying stakeholders such as real estate <b>agents,</b> lenders and <b>escrow</b> <b>agents.</b> Data were collected from April 2012 through March 2013. Findings revealed that "information use" induce emotion and a sense of time pressure, whereas all other "non-information use" behaviors are propelled by emotion and time pressure. The study also identified the emergent theme "information use by proxy" phenomenon wherein emotions prompt people to forgo information responsibility and enlist trusted surrogates to use information on their behalf. Further, findings show that emotion and time pressure have the ability to alter one's routine information behavior, which can result in shared dyadic information behavior between couples. Moreover, the behavior has implications for such relationships as found in the business world, academia, artistic endeavors and other collaborations (Papadopoulou, Lee, Fisher, 2013). From theory testing, the study found that Chatman's Theory of Normative Behavior explains high stakes deciders' information behavior, but demonstrates limitations regarding the "information behavior" aspect of the theory. As a result, I propose a new, holistic information behavior definition to buttress Chatman's theoretical framework. The study also ascertained that Fisher's Information Grounds provide helpful information for most, but not all high stakes decision makers since sharing information with strangers went against one's nature, information was not relevant or trustworthy or people had insufficient time to socialize. Social information used for light conversation, however, was considered valuable to home buying stakeholders as such information helps to build and maintain relationships, which is viewed as a vital component of successful businesses in the competitive field of residential real estate. Lastly, study findings demonstrate relevance to other fields like medicine, emergency and disaster management or social and political science as issues of emotion and time pressure are likely to present in myriad and unanticipated ways...|$|R

40|$|As {{the fourth}} {{contribution}} in the 'Land' section, this paper forms a research 'diptych' {{with the next}} paper by Levy. Whereas she focuses on the notarial institution in midnineteenth century Mexico, this contribution examines it in a contemporary context. The notary {{is one of the}} chief components of property rights protection in civil-law systems, performing various public functions such as writing deeds for real estate property. Yet notaries are considered an 'inefficient' institution by many, due to the perception of rent-seeking behavior enabled by their near-monopoly over validating property rights claims. This study examines notaries in Mexico to unpack the apparent contradiction in the role of notaries in economic development. I use a combination of interviews with notaries and clients, and data on notarial practice and bureaucratic outcomes across the country, to examine notaries' social function. The theoretical lens of endogenous development and institutional functionalism reveals an alternate explanation for their seemingly high-cost services, as well as their role in economic development. Mexican notaries have a dual social function: public representative and private service provider. They perform diverse and essential activities, which in other countries are performed by multiple actors such as real estate <b>agents,</b> <b>escrow</b> offices and title insurance companies. Thus, what is perceived as inefficiency by some can be interpreted as an efficient response to the context in which they operate, and their semi-privatized nature can overcome problems found in other bureaucratic arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{subjective}} Bayesianism only {{allows us}} to distinguish between agents whose credences are perfectly probabilistically coherent and agents whose credences are incoherent. It is desirable to develop a measure of degrees of incoherence. One way of measuring degrees of incoherence is by ascertaining how much money an incoherent person {{can be made to}} lose in a Dutch book. I will compare two Dutch book measures, one proposed by Schervish, Seidenfeld & Kadane, and my own, and argue that only my method works as a plausible measure of incoherence. I. SS&K’s method for measuring degrees of incoherence in a nutshell 1. Start with a partition of propositions on which the agent is incoherent. 2. Set up a Dutch book against the agent in the normal way, and calculate the guaranteed loss for the agent. 3. Calculate the degree of incoherence for the agent for that partition in one of three ways: a) Rate of loss for the agent: Calculate the sum of all the amounts the agent needs to cover her part of the individual bets in the Dutch book (called the agent’s “escrow”). Divide the guaranteed loss the agent faces by that sum. So: guaranteed loss divided by <b>agent’s</b> <b>escrow</b> = rate of loss for the agent. b) Rate of gain for the bookie: Calculate the sum of all the amounts the bookie needs to cover her part of the individual bets in the Dutch book (called the bookie’s “escrow”). Divide the guaranteed loss the agent faces by that sum. So: guaranteed loss divided by bookie’s escrow = rate of gain for the bookie. c) Neutral/sum normalization: Divide the guaranteed loss by the sum of the stakes for all the bets in the Dutch book...|$|R

50|$|Source code escrow agents hold {{source code}} of {{software}} in escrow just as other escrow companies hold cash. Normally {{you do not}} own or have any rights to the software (including source code) that you are accessing, {{under the terms of}} a regular SaaS or desktop software agreement. This does not usually become an issue until technical problems start to arise, i.e. unexpected service interruptions, downtime, loss of application functionality and loss of data. This can add significant costs to your business and you remain reliant upon the software supplier to resolve these issues, unless you have an escrow agreement in place. Escrow is when the software source code is held by a third party - an <b>escrow</b> <b>agent</b> - on behalf of the customer and the supplier. Information escrow agents, such as the International Creative Registry, hold in escrow intellectual property and other information. Examples include song music and lyrics, manufacturing designs and laboratory notebooks, and television and movie treatments and scripts. This is done to establish legal ownership rights, with the independent escrow agents attesting to the information's ownership, contents, and creation date.|$|E
5000|$|The role of {{stakeholder}} is {{a concept}} in law. A stakeholder was originally a person who temporarily holds money or other property while its owner is being determined.

After the event occurs, the stakeholder distributes the stakes to {{one or both of the}} original (or other) parties according to the outcome of the event and according to the previously decided conditions. Courts sometimes act as stakeholders, holding property while litigation between the possible owners resolves the issue in which one is entitled to the property. Trustees also often act as stakeholders, holding property until beneficiaries come of age, for example. An [...] "escrow agent" [...] is one kind of trustee who is a stakeholder, usually in a situation where part of the purchase price of property is being held until some condition is satisfied.

5000|$|Escrow {{generally}} {{refers to}} money {{held by a}} third-party on behalf of transacting parties. It is mostly used regarding the purchase of shares of a company. It is best known in the United States {{in the context of}} real estate (specifically in mortgages where the mortgage company establishes an escrow account to pay property tax and insurance during the term of the mortgage). Escrow is an account separate from the mortgage account where deposit of funds occurs for payment of certain conditions that apply to the mortgage, usually property taxes and insurance. The <b>escrow</b> <b>agent</b> has the duty to properly account for the escrow funds and ensure that usage of funds is explicitly for the purpose intended. Since a mortgage lender is not willing to take the risk that a homeowner will not pay property tax, escrow is usually required under the mortgage terms. Escrow companies are also commonly used in the transfer of high value personal and business property, like websites and businesses, and in the completion of person-to-person remote auctions (such as eBay), although the advent of new low cost online escrow services has meant that even low cost transactions are now starting to benefit from use of escrow. In the UK, escrow accounts are often used during private property transactions to hold solicitors' clients' money, such as the deposit, until such time as the transaction completes.
