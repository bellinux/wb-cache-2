40|$|In {{the paper}} two {{aluminium}} alloys, i. e. 6082 and 7075, which were cold <b>hardened</b> <b>by</b> shot <b>peening</b> under different conditions, are treated. Surface hardening {{was carried out}} with S 170 steel shot of the same diameter, particle hardness being 56 HRC. Other conditions were the operating pressure, mass flow, which provide different Almen intensities. The hardened layer was described by surface integrity. Macroscopic and microscopic analyses consisted in analyses of hardened profiles of hardness, and residual stresses in the thin surface layer. Research results indicated that {{there were significant differences}} among the characteristics chosen to describe surface integrity and that they had an important influence on the final condition of the surface layer. With too severe settings of the peening parameters, the surface properties got worse because of damages, which resulted in crack initiation and growth of the existing cracks...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide the results of own {{researches}} into free short fatigue crack initiation and growth in residual stress field induced <b>by</b> surface laser <b>hardening</b> or <b>by</b> shot <b>peening.</b> Comparable study was carried out primary for non-treated medium carbon steel specimens in air and at room temperature. The high cycle fatigue tests were conducted under fully reversed torsion for smooth both non-treated and treated specimens. The paper consists of two parts: first part presents the experimental results of these studies whereas the second one derives the proposition of short crack growth de-scription in the aspect of probabilistic approach...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of cavitation erosion tests performed on two types of samples. The materials of the samples are frequently used for manufacturing and repairs of the hydro turbines components submitted to cavitation. The first sample was made by welding of an austenitic stainless steel on austenito-feritic base material. The second sample was made similarly with the first but with a martensitic base material. After the welding processes, on both samples was applied a <b>hardening</b> treatment <b>by</b> surface <b>peening.</b> The cavitation erosion tests were performed on vibratory equipment using the indirect method with stationary specimen. The results show a good cavitation erosion resistance on both samples...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHelical gears are {{subjected}} to contact fatigue loads, which may result in the damage of the gear teeth, for example by pitting-type failure. Microstructural features, mechanical properties and residual stresses have strong influence on the pitting resistance of the material. Case <b>hardening,</b> followed <b>by</b> shot <b>peening</b> processes, are usually carried out to produce a wear-resistant surface with compressive residual stresses established in the gear tooth surface region. This work aims to evaluate, by finite element analyses, the stress distribution through the gear teeth during the gear coupling. The results allow {{the evaluation of the}} stress components that may lead to the pitting failure, indicating the design variables that are important to improve the reliability of the gear...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Stepwise S-N curves were {{obtained}} under rotating bending fatigue tests at elevated temperatures for an 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo low alloy steel, {{as well as}} fatigue tests {{at room temperature for}} surface <b>hardened</b> specimens <b>by</b> shot <b>peening</b> or carburizing treatment. In the high cycle region, internal fracture with fish-eye pattern was dominant. Why internal fracture does occur at elevated temperatures for specimens of the low alloy steel without any surface hardening treatments? It has been pointed out that the existence of oxidized surface layer plays an important role to prevent cracks from initiating at the specimen surface. But any evidence verifying the effect of oxidized surface layer on fatigue behavior has not been obtained. The steel used was hardened remarkably under cyclic stressing at intermediate temperatures due to dynamic strain aging. It is considered to be difficult for Stage crack to initiate at specimen surface, because the slip bands hardens gradually during fatigue test at elevated temperature. This process has to bring the same effect as surface hardening treatments of shot peening and carburizing on fatigue fracture behavior...|$|R

40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steel cannot be <b>hardened</b> <b>by</b> {{any form of}} heat treatment, in fact, quenching from 10000 C merely softens them. They are usually cold worked to increase the hardness. Shot peening is a cold working process that changes micro-structure as well as residual stress in the surface layer. In the present work, the compressive residual stress and fatigue strength of AISI 304 austenitic {{stainless steel}} have been evaluated at various shot peening conditions. The improvement in various mechanical properties such as hardness, damping factors and fatigue strength was noticed. Compressive residual stress induced <b>by</b> shot <b>peening</b> varies with cyclic loading due to relaxation of compressive residual stress field. The consideration of relaxed compressive residual stress field instead of original compressive residual stress field provides reliable fatigue design of components. In this paper, the exact reductions in weight and control of mechanical properties due to shot peening process are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{portable}} pneumatic needle-peening (PPP) on the bending fatigue limit of a low-carbon steel SM 490 A welded joint containing a semi-circular slit on the weld toe were in-vestigated. PPP {{was applied to the}} specimens with a semi-circular slit with depths of a = 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2, and 1. 6 mm. Then, three-point bending fatigue tests were carried out under R = 0. 05. The fa-tigue limits of low-carbon steel welded specimens containing a semi-circular slit were increased for peened specimens compared with non-peened specimens. Peened specimens having a semi-circular slit with a depth of a = 1. 2 mm had high fatigue limits, almost equal to those of the non-slit peened specimens. It was concluded that a semi-circular slit with a depth of less than a = 1. 2 mm can be rendered harmless <b>by</b> <b>peening.</b> Then, the fatigue improvement <b>by</b> <b>peening</b> was predicted.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{a study of the}} effects of cold work induced by surface {{enhancement}} treatment on conductivity profiles in nickel-base superalloys, as part of the on-going efforts aimed at evaluating the feasibility of characterizing near-surface residual stress profiles in peened engine components using a swept frequency eddy current (SFEC) technique. The approach is based on the empirical piezoresistivity effect that correlates conductivity changes with residual stress, but recent studies have shown that conductivity changes induced <b>by</b> <b>peening</b> processes are also influenced by metallurgical factors such as cold work. In this study, conductivity deviation profiles were obtained by model-based inversion of SFEC signals from a set of aged Inconel 718 samples, which were either shot peened or laser shock peened to produce different residual stress and cold work profiles. The laser shock peened samples exhibit a larger increase in surface conductivity and deeper conductivity profiles, which are attributed to a smaller amount of surface cold work and deeper residual stress profiles created <b>by</b> laser shock <b>peening</b> than <b>by</b> shot <b>peening...</b>|$|R
