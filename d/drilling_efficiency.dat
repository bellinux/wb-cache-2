These boreholes can be enormously long, and it is often necessary to send a tethered robot into the hole in order to gather information. If these robots remain stationary for too long, however, their tethering cables can become stuck in the mud cake lining the walls. The recovery or replacement of these robots is time consuming and expensive, so it is desirable to understand {{how and why the}} cables sink. In this analysis, the mud cake is modeled as a Newtonian fluid. The surface of the cable is approximated as being either parabolic or circular, and it is shown that the sinking is governed by exactly two dimensionless parameters in both cases.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that the next significant challenge in planetary exploration {{is to be able}} to drill deeply (two meters seems the most scientifically valuable and the most technologically reasonable) into the surface of solar system bodies for chemical or physical data. Major limitation of using conventional rotary drills in low gravity environments (such as Mars, asteroids, comet, etc) is the need for high axial force, which suffers from big overhead mass, buckling problem, and power hungriness. Though drills using percussive motion may operate in low mass and power, the drilling rate is generally slow. Drawing inspiration from nature for a lightweight and energy efficient solution, we propose a novel drilling method based on the working mechanism of wood wasp ovipositors. The bio-inspired drill requires no reactive external force by applying two-valve-reciprocating motion. The proposed bio-inspired system indicates enhanced utility that is critical for space missions where premium is placed on mass, volume and power. Biological systems are similarly constrained making biomimetic technology uniquely suited and advantageous as a model of miniaturized systems. As a result of the European Space Agency (ESA) project on bionics and space system design [Ellery, 2005], this paper presents a conceptual design of the bio-inspired drill.

The system considered {{consists of}} a long, straight, cylindrical and linearly elastic rod which is impacted axially at one end, and which has a body attached {{by means of a}} friction joint at the opposite end. The conditions are such that the wave propagation is 1 -D in the rod and can be neglected in the attached body. Slip and energy dissipation due to an impact load are determined. The theoretical results of the impact-loaded conical friction joints exhibit phenomena which sometimes have spectacular appearance. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results is fair. The influence of blow frequency and thrust on the performance of a percussive rock drill is studied theoretically. The drill considered consists of hammer, adapter, rod and bit. Two different rock drills are studied. The first is a simple drill with constant characteristic impedance throughout the drill.

40|$|Systems to {{increase}} efficiency during drilling is desirable {{in order to have}} more costeffective well operations. This master s thesis studies the possibility to present new information real-time regarding the actual <b>drilling</b> <b>efficiency,</b> based on already existing data commonly available during most operations. Said data should not only help increase efficiency, but also help identify insufficiencies, and be used when evaluating if re-modelling of the drillstring is profitable to improve efficiency. Based on the concept of Mechanical Specific Energy presented by Teale (1965), an attempt has been made to adjust and improve this method to present the actual <b>drilling</b> <b>efficiency</b> down-hole in a better way. During work with this method, three main insufficiencies were identified. The original method does not include hydraulic energy, does not estimate actual energy loss, and does not account for formation hardness. These three problems were the cause of the largest alterations. To test the new method, and to make it compatible with the data usually available, a mathematical agent was modelled in Matlab. The method has so far been tested on drilling data from three sections of a well located in the North Sea. Due to a limited amount of available drilling data, no real conclusions could be made. Nevertheless, some patterns were identified. Results show, that the current method identifies most of the work used for drilling progress as rotational energy. By more accurately evaluating the actual energy reaching the formation, the actual <b>drilling</b> <b>efficiency</b> will be of more use for the driller. Evaluation of hydraulic energy showed that while these extensions make the method more complicated, hydraulic energy contribution is too large to be considered negligible. Data regarding how the formation hardness affects the <b>drilling</b> <b>efficiency</b> was proven difficult to achieve, as the correlation between the method chosen to specify energy input and formation hardness were considered too large to be a reliable source of information.

40|$|Summary. This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} describe the nonlinear dynamics of a drillstring in horizontal configuration, which is intended to correctly predict the three-dimensional dynamics of this complex structure.

The position of back sliding wheel relative to the mast of rotary drilling rig is adjusted, together with the position of pulley yoke, to obtain the minimum deformation of the mast of rotary drilling rig, which improves the stability of the mast of rotary <b>drilling</b> rig. Optimization <b>efficiency</b> and computational accuracy are demonstrated numerically...|$|R
