40|$|This {{paper is}} an early draft of the {{introductory}} chapter of my forthcoming dissertation (cur-rent working title: “Essays in Economics of Knowledge”). The attempt is to {{provide an overview of}} the earlier research in the field, discuss some central issues within it and show how the individual chapters in the dissertation connect and contribute to the earlier research. As such, the paper is a bit longer than usual research papers. However, I am primarily looking <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>feedback</b> on section 2 : Have I covered the re-levant literature? Are there ways to improve the narrative of the survey? In addition, I would like to hear your thoughts about how to later revise the paper {{in order to make it}} an inde-pendent, publishable research paper. By request, I will be more than happy to email any pa-pers of mine to which I refer here. 21 THE ECONOMICS OF KNOWLEDGE AS AN ORIG-INAL DISCIPLINE The economics of knowledge studies the “role of knowledge in social systems, both as a product of the past and as a determinant of the future”, wrote Kenneth Boulding (1966, 1), who was apparently the first to use the name of this sub-discipline of economics.

40|$|First {{we review}} the {{definition}} of a negative point mass singularity. Then we examine the gravitational lensing effects of these singularities in isolation and with shear and convergence from continuous matter. We review the Inverse Mean Curvature Flow and use this flow to prove some new results about the mass of a singularity, the ADM mass of the manifold, and the capacity of the singularity. We describe some particular examples of these singularities that exhibit additional symmetries. iv Acknowledgements I want to thank my thesis advisor, Professor Hubert Bray.

40|$|Thank you {{in advance}} <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>feedback!</b> This paper {{includes}} material that I expect will be expanded {{into a few}} chapters of my dissertation. I welcome feedback on any aspect of the paper, but I did {{want to point out}} a few areas where feedback/suggestions would be really helpful for this paper and the larger project. I do have funds to return to Kenya to do further iterations of this experiment, and so I welcome any suggestions on ways to change it, improve it, or make it more convincing. Suggestions for different sorts of tests, experimental or otherwise, would also be much appreciated. I would like to do more to support my claim that a lot of vote buying cannot be understood as a form of clientelism. I don’t think there is one piece of information that I can bring to bear on this that would be conclusive, so my strategy is to make as many points as possible that support the claim.

40|$|Flight {{tests of}} new or {{modified}} aircraft are {{a necessary part}} of the design process and provide the final validation of the full scale aircraft design. Flight testing for certification is a critical phase as all trials proving compliance, with respect to specifications and regulations must be completed in the shortest possible time, while maintaining high standards in the certification process. Usually significant instrumentation is installed to validate the predicted behaviour of the aircraft and also to detect unforeseen problems so that, if necessary, fast modifications can be done. Optical measurement techniques can minimize the installation effort and reduce the testing time as they are able to capture a large number of parameters within a short time. The EU funded research project "AIM -Advanced ln-flight Measurement Techniques" (contract ASTS-CT- 2006 - 030827 funded within the 6 th Framework Programme) and the follow on project "AIM 2 -Advanced ln-flight Measurement Techniques 2 " (contract 266107 funded within the 7 th European Programme), proved the principal feasibility to apply modern optical measurement techniques from industrial wind tunnels to flight testing and started to further develop those methods. AIM 2 primarily focused on developing reliable and easy to use, dedicated measurement systems and on defining design and application rules for these new in-flight measurement techniques. The prime objective was to enable aerospace industries to use such measurement systems in future tests to reduce testing time and costs. This special issue focusses on the work completed in AIM 2 and presents a total of eight papers. The papers present an overview on optical methods for in-flight flow and structural measurements as weil as state-of-the-art methods. In the work presented, the optical measurement techniques are continuously developed throughout the project. These techniques include the structural shape and deformation measurement method IPCT ("Image Pattern Correlation Technique"), the flow field measurement techniques PIV ("Particle Image Velocimetry"), IRT ("lnfraRed Thermography") and LIDAR ("Light Detection And Ranging"), as weil as the method of "lnterferometric Laser lmaging for Droplet Sizing" (ILIDS) and pressure and strain sensors based on optical fibre sensor technology. Therefore we hope you will enjoy reading these papers and would encourage you to directly contact the authors of the papers and the editors <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>feedback</b> and to get information about the latest developments. lt has been our pleasure tobe part of the outstanding AIM and AIM 2 projects and finally be the Guest Editors of this special issue. We would like to thank all project partners and the authors of the papers for their excellent contributions.

40|$|Acknowledgements My Ph. D. {{has been}} a three year journey. I have endured short periods of {{frustration}} that made me question whether it was worthwhile, but mainly happiness that made me realise of course it was. I took this journey on my own, but some people deserve a special mention for their guidance and support along the way. Firstly, my supervisors Joemon Jose, Ian Ruthven and Keith van Rijsbergen. Joemon, {{thank you for being}} a great supervisor, for having enough faith in my abilities to give me this chance and <b>for</b> all <b>your</b> efforts on my behalf. Ian, thank you, you are an inspiration; <b>your</b> <b>feedback,</b> support and advice surpassed any requirements of a second supervisor.

40|$|The Bureau of Reclamation has {{commissioned}} Cramer Fish Sciences {{to conduct}} a life-cycle analysis of coho in the Klamath Basin downstream of Iron Gate Dam. The analysis includes a peer reviewed report describing coho life-history in the Pacific Northwest and California and a life-cycle model capable of predicting coho production under differing flow regimes in the Klamath River. Reclamation intends to keep key parties informed of the project’s progress and solicit <b>your</b> <b>feedback</b> while the model is being developed. The forum by which the information will be disseminated and feedback solicited includes a series of eight technical memorandums. This is the second in that series of memorandums. The topic of this memorandum is simulation of fall redistribution and overwinter survival of coho within the Klamath Basin. If you choose to provide feedback you have until December 15, 2006 to do so. Timeliness in this respect is greatly appreciated. Comments received after the review deadlines may not give researchers adequate time to consider <b>your</b> <b>feedback.</b> Please be advised {{that we will not}} be providing a formal response to all comments. However, we will produce a summary of comments and an abridged response. This document will be available following the review process. The following is the list of memos that have been or will be mailed out <b>for</b> <b>your</b> consideratio...|$|R
