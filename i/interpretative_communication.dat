According the lawyers, and validated in a court case, this is illegal, and thus the EMC Directive is applicable for military equipment too, except when an exemption for a clearly defined case has been granted. The European Commission confirmed this conclusion in an <b>interpretative</b> <b>communication.</b> The EMC Directive only gives essential requirements. The default route, giving presumption of conformity, is making use of harmonized standards. The alternative route is the use of standards which have not been harmonised. Military standards are not harmonised, and are already in use as the reference in contracts between supplier and customer/user. Using the (test) evidence based on the military standards can therefore be used to prove compliance with the essential requirements of the EMC Directive, making additional testing superfluous. This paper describes the routes to compliance for military equipment...|$|E
40|$|Is public {{procurement}} {{of research and}} development (‘R&D’) services the key to European Union (‘EU’) ’s sustainable welfare? Is it being regulated in accordance with economic prescripts for effectiveness? Is the regulatory and policy setting clear and comprehensive in order to stimulate a widespread use of this instrument by EU public authorities? In 2007, the EU released an <b>Interpretative</b> <b>Communication,</b> explaining how to purchase R&D services in compliance with the EU {{public procurement}} and State aid rules. The prescribed procedure was named ‘pre-commercial procurement’ (‘PCP’). The motivation advanced for adopting this Communication was the need to clarify the applicable law, in order to encourage public authorities throughout the EU to engage in R&D services procurement. The EU policy makers aimed to help the public sector become a sophisticated customer, capable of steering the development of cutting-edge technologies towards the resolution of public needs. This would yield solutions to serious problems such as climate change, pressure on the health system due to an ageing population, security threats etc. In addition, it would strengthen the competitive advantages of European private innovators on global markets. Eventually this would strengthen EU’s economy and would increase the welfare of its citizen...|$|E
50|$|Narrative {{theory has}} been widely applied {{within the field of}} communication, {{although}} not specifically. Those who have used narrative theory within their research refer to it as a general way of looking at communication. The Narrative Paradigm is generally considered to be an <b>interpretative</b> theory of <b>communication.</b> It is an especially useful theory to teach qualitative research methods.|$|R
40|$|Genetically digital, hyper-medial in {{behavior}} is the expression that best synthesizes {{of the portrait}} of post-modern generations, often in opposition compared to the enthusiasm {{of a lot of}} recent scientific literature oriented towards the deepening of the relationship between youth and digital media. Indicators of generational identification change and even the <b>interpretative</b> paradigms of <b>communication</b> sociological scholars have to change. The cultural habits of young people suggest to us to ask about the cultural value of the media for teens, the new trends of behavioral individualism, that give us new concepts on the relationship between youth and media: is it possible to speak about new forms of ego-technologies? This book describes the complex picture that renders the problematic perspective of analysis and research for those who are interested in this topic. Specifically, the book is a range of macro-analyses on the individualization of new interpretative theories: from hardware to software. It is almost as an inversion of focus, to those more inserted into the critical map, as the delicate question of digital competences are often too imbalanced on types of aesthetic citizenship because they are oriented towards skills while completely lacking in ethical responsibility and critical analysis. On Air. The European Project on Media Education has been an effective research input that has allowed us to take hold of the scientific discussion on the relationship between digital media and teens in the perspective of citizenship education, both from a methodological and thematic point of view, and in order to launch new stimuli of cultural investigations and closer examinations. On the other hand, the book seeks to investigate the role of cultural mediation, as redemption from the philosophy of excess, evident in both cultural behavior and the acquisition of competences and, finally, in the socialization pendulum which is too unbalanced to the ego. The depth of cultural capital in the behaviors of digital consumption is at the basis of the new frontiers of digital citizenship...|$|R
