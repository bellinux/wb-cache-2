50|$|From 1996 to 1998 {{a series}} of {{upgrades}} {{were made to the}} reactor, in order to conduct preliminary research for the design work on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor or ITER. One of the upgrades converted the tokamak to a D-shape divertor design with a major plasma radius of 1.5m. ITER will also use superconducting magnets. The nuclear predecessors before such as the T-10 were capable of reaching 30 million degrees Fahrenheit.

50|$|For heavier ion production, for example, an <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> (<b>ECR)</b> source can be used. Figure 4 shows a {{schematic}} diagram of an ECR. At the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, neutral atoms have their electrons removed using an ECR ion source. ECR works by ionizing the vapor of a desired element such as chlorine and iodine. Further, utilizing this technique metals (Au, Ag, etc.) {{can also be}} ionized using a small oven to achieve a vapor phase. The vapor is maintained within a magnetic field {{long enough for the}} atoms to be ionized by collisions with electrons. Microwaves are applied to the chamber as to keep the electrons in motion.|$|E
50|$|Heavy ions can be {{generated}} with an electron cyclotron resonance ion source. The use of <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> (<b>ECR)</b> ion sources {{for the production of}} intense beams of highly charged ions has immensely grown over the last decade. ECR ion sources are used as injectors into linear accelerators, Van-de-Graaff generators or cyclotrons in nuclear and elementary particle physics. In atomic and surface physics ECR ion sources deliver intense beams of highly charged ions for collision experiments or for the investigation of surfaces. For the highest charge states, however, Electron beam ion sources (EBIS) are needed. They can generate even bare ions of mid-heavy elements. The Electron beam ion trap (EBIT), based on the same principle, can produce up to bare uranium ions and can be used as an ion source as well.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The goal of {{this thesis}} study is to develop an {{activated}} reactive evaporation (ARE) system and to demonstrate its utility by fabricating-alternating current thin-film electroluminescent (ACTFEL) oxide phosphor devices. ARE entails evaporation in an activated gas. The main ARE system components are three thermal evaporation sources, a microwave power supply, an <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> plasma (<b>ECR)</b> source, a substrate heater/controller, a film thickness monitor, and a leak valve for gas flow control. Ga₂ 0 ₃:Eu ACTFEL devices are fabricated using the ARE system. The maximum Ga₂O: deposition rate is approximately 2 nm/s. As-deposited films are transparent, insulating, and amorphous with an index of refraction of 1. 68 and an optical bandgap of 4. 25 - 4. 9 eV. Ga₂O₃ films are typically amorphous until annealed above 1000 °C in a furnace or by rapid thermal annealing. However, when hydrothermal annealing is employed, Ga₂O₃ films crystalize at temperatures as low as 450 °C. Electrical and optical characterization indicates that the Ga₂O₃:Eu ACTFEL devices have very little charge transfer and emit very dim, orange-red electroluminescence with an emission peak of about 615 nm...|$|R
50|$|The HiPEP {{thruster}} {{differs from}} earlier ion thrusters because the xenon ions are produced {{using a combination}} of microwave and magnetic fields. The ionization is achieved through a process called <b>Electron</b> <b>Cyclotron</b> <b>Resonance</b> (<b>ECR).</b> In ECR, the small number of free electrons present in the neutral gas gyrate around the static magnetic field lines. The injected microwaves' frequency is set to match this gyrofrequency and a resonance is established. Energy is transferred from the right-hand polarized portion of the microwave to the electrons. This energy is then transferred to the bulk gas/plasma via the rare - yet important - collisions between electrons and neutrals. During these collisions, electrons can be knocked free from the neutrals, forming ion-electron pairs. The process is a highly efficient means of creating a plasma in low density gases. Previously the electrons required were provided by a hollow cathode.|$|E

30|$|In this article, Si-ncs {{formed in}} SRSN films {{deposited}} with varied compositions using three different {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD)-based systems are compared and discussed: plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), inductively coupled plasma CVD (ICP CVD), and <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> PECVD (<b>ECR</b> PECVD). Results from these studies have been previously reported in two conference proceedings [18, 19]. Most studies to date have employed isochronal annealing steps after deposition to induce diffusion of excess silicon to nucleation sites. Conventionally, this has been done using a quartz tube furnace with an ambient gas of N 2 or N 2 + 5 % H 2 (i.e. forming gas) over 60 min. For consistency, this approach has been taken to provide a good comparison amongst the three deposition systems studied. However, whilst this provides for good comparison amongst the results of various studies, to date {{there has not been}} an in-depth isothermal study wherein the annealing is performed over a large time scale ranging from seconds to hours. To address this gap in reported data, in this study, SRSN thin films have been annealed for times ranging from 2 s to 2 h using rapid thermal annealing to provide a basis for investigating the growth process and thermal evolution of these films as well as determining the flexibility of the processing conditions over which such a film could be incorporated into a larger device design.|$|R
