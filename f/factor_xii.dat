40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{induction}} of acute thrombocytopenia in the dog, {{based on the}} adhesiveness of the blood platelets on glass beads, is described. A femoral artery is catheterized and the arterial blood is propelled by a Sigmamotor pump through a column of glass beads of 1 mm. in diameter. The blood returns to the femoral vein in a closed circuit. A sharp decrease of the platelets is already observed after the first half hour; they remain thereafter at very low levels (generally 5 per cent of the initial number) until completion of the procedure, which lasts 3 hours. Platelet depression persists for 2 or 3 days and {{is followed by a}} temporary thrombocytosis, normal levels of platelets being reached by the seventh or eighth day. Leukocytes as well as <b>factors</b> <b>XII</b> and XI decrease during the procedure, and a slight hemolysis is observed.

2500|$|Hereditary {{angioedema}} (HAE) {{exists in}} three forms, {{all of which}} are caused by a genetic mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant form. They are distinguished by the underlying genetic abnormality. Types I and II are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, which result in either diminished levels of the C1-inhibitor protein (type I HAE) or dysfunctional forms of the same protein (type II HAE). Type III HAE has been linked with mutations in the F12 gene, which encodes the coagulation protein <b>factor</b> <b>XII.</b> All forms of HAE lead to abnormal activation of the complement system, and all forms can cause swelling elsewhere in the body, such as the digestive tract. If HAE involves the larynx, it can cause life-threatening asphyxiation. The pathogenesis of this disorder is suspected to be related to unopposed activation of the contact pathway by the initial generation of kallikrein and/or clotting <b>factor</b> <b>XII</b> by damaged endothelial cells.

Moreover, administration of exogenous RNA provoked a significant procoagulant response in rabbits. In mice that underwent an arterial thrombosis model, extracellular RNA was found associated with fibrin-rich thrombi, and pretreatment with RNase (but not DNase) significantly delayed occlusive thrombus formation. Thus, extracellular RNA derived from damaged or necrotic cells particularly under pathological conditions or severe tissue damage represents the long sought natural “foreign surface” and provides a procoagulant cofactor template for the factors XII/XI-induced contact activation/amplification of blood coagulation.

A number of pathological conditions, including multiple endocrine disorders modulate the balance between pro- and anticoagulation factors and establish conditions of hyper- or hypocoagulability. Endocrine effects of thymus gland on blood coagulation are not completely elucidated, and data existing on the theme are relatively scarce and partially controversial.

Materials and methods: Plasma clotting factor activities and aPTT were studied on 52 male Wistar intact rats after 3 day s. c. application of the thymic peptides envisaged using routine kinetic coagulometry. Results of the study indicate a significant reduction of FXII activity by thymulin and thymosin alpha 1, and FXI and FIX activity by thymulin and thymosin beta 4.

40|$|Microfluidic systems allow precise {{control of}} the anticoagulation/pharmacology protocols, defined {{reactive}} surfaces, hemodynamic flow and optical imaging routines, and thus are ideal for studies of platelet function and coagulation response. This thesis describes {{the use of a}} microfluidic approach to investigate the role of the contact pathway <b>factors</b> <b>XII</b> and XI, platelet-derived polyphosphate, and thiol isomerases in thrombus growth and to evaluate their potential as safer antithrombotic drug targets. The use of low level of corn trypsin inhibitor allowed the study of the contact pathway on collagen/kaolin surfaces with minimally disturbed whole blood sample and we demonstrated the sensitivity of this assay to antithrombotic drugs. On collagen/tissue factor surfaces, we found the relative contributions of the extrinsic pathway, the contact pathway, and the thrombin feedback pathway vary with tissue factor surface concentration. Platelet-derived polyphosphate potentiated the thrombin feedback pathway at low tissue factor level but enhanced fibrin fiber structure regardless of tissue factor level. At locations with low tissue factor level, thrombosis may be druggable by contact pathway and polyphosphate inhibition, although thrombolytic susceptibility may benefit from polyphosphate antagonism regardless of tissue factor level. We developed a peptide-based platelet-targeting thiol reduction sensor to visualize thrombus-incorporated thiol reductase activity. Although distribution of thiol reductase activity was shown to be correlated with the level of platelet activation, protein disulfide isomerase inhibition showed a limited effect on platelet aggregation in microfluidic thrombosis assay. We also used the microfluidic system to explore the injury patch size limit for triggering clotting. We observed a full clotting response of platelet deposition, thrombin generation and fibrin polymerization on one of the smallest biological units of a single collagen fiber presenting tissue factor and von Willebrand factor suggesting the lack of physiological injury patch size limit. Finally, we made the first estimation of thrombin flux from growing thrombus under flow using the microfluidic thrombosis assay in combination with enzyme-linked immunosorbent measurement of thrombin-antithrombin complex. We found thrombin is robustly generated within clots by the extrinsic pathway, followed by late-stage factor XIa contributions, with fibrin localizing thrombin via its antithrombin activity as a self-limiting hemostatic mechanism. ...|$|R

Solvent/detergent plasma (S/D Plasma) has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to curtail such complications. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of S/D Plasma in OLT patients by comparing it to FFP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-three OLT patients were randomized into two groups depending on whether they were transfused with FFP or S/D plasma. A thromboelastography-based protocol aimed at achieving and maintaining predetermined coagulation goals was used to guide plasma transfusions. At {{the beginning and the end}} of surgery, standard laboratory coagulation tests were performed together with the assessment of the VII, VIII, V, <b>XII</b> <b>factors</b> and S protein blood levels. RESULTS: The two study groups equally achieved the thromboelastography goals but with a reduced amount of transfusions in the S/D plasma group (P < 0 · 0001). At the end of surgery, <b>factors</b> V and <b>XII</b> and S protein blood levels were lower in the S/D plasma patients who also showed lower INR, aPTT and antithrombin III levels. CONCLUSION: In cirrhotic patients undergoing OLT, the use of S plasma associated with thromboelastography allows the same clinical results but with a significant reduction in the amount of plasma transfusions. © 2013 International Society of Blood Transfusion...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate phenotypic characteristics, PTPN 11 gene mutations, and hematological and coagulation parameters in 30 clinically diagnosed cases of NS. One of the NS patients had a history of easy bruising; however, his hematological and coagulation tests were normal. None of the other patients had clinical coagulation problems. In the NS group, values for platelet count, activity of <b>factors</b> XI, <b>XII,</b> and protein C were significantly lower than the corresponding means for the control group. However, the results of coagulation tests in the NS group were diagnostically inconclusive and only one patient had clinical signs of coagulopathy. Interestingly, two NS patients had low protein C activity. One of these children had an A 1517 C mutation and transient myelodysplasia. The other patient had a C 1528 G mutation in exon 13 that has not been reported previously. Neither of these individuals experienced a thrombotic event or any complication during approximately 3 years of follow-up. For all patients clinically diagnosed with NS, a thorough history of coagulation issues should be taken and first-line coagulation testing should be done to evaluate for bleeding diathesis. However, if these assessments reveal nothing abnormal, complications related to coagulation are unlikely and extensive testing is unnecessary. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. status: publishe...|$|R
