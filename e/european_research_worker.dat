40|$|Our {{purpose in}} the present study is to compare {{personality}} structure of women from four occupational groups (teachers, <b>research</b> <b>workers,</b> actresses and business women). Personality structure was measured using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory based on five-factor model of personality. Five-factor model illustrates that personality consists of five relatively independent dimensions (Neuroticism,Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), which provide a meaningful taxonomy for studying individual differences. We supposed that personality structure of women from various occupational groups would differ. We found following statistically significant differences between women. Businesswomen scored significantly lower on Neuroticism and higher on Extraversion in comparsion with <b>research</b> <b>workers,</b> actresses, and teachers. Teachers scored significantly higher on Extraversion in comparsion with <b>research</b> <b>workers.</b> Teachers scored significantly lower on Openness to experience in comparsion with actreses and <b>research</b> <b>workers.</b> No significant differences on Agreeableness were found between groups of women.
