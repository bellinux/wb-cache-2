Experiment was arranged in split split plot based on randomized complete block design with three replicates. Main plots were three levels of green manure (consisting of control, berseem clover and barley) and sub plots were different levels of green manure residuals (including full and <b>half</b> <b>clipping</b> and no-clipping). Different levels of integrated fertilizers (including, 1 - control; 2 - recommended NPK as 250, 150 and 100 kg urea, superphosphate triple and potassium sulphat ha- 1, respectively; 3 - 50 % NPK 4 - 15 Mg farmyard manure (FM) + 50 % NPK ha- 1; 5 - biofertilizer (BF) + 50 % NPK; 6 - 15 Mg FM + BF ha- 1; 7 - 15 Mg FM + 50 %NPK ha- 1 + BF, were the sub sub plots. Results indicated that green manures (both clover and barley) significantly increased soil nitrogen up to 23 percent. Leaves and seed nitrogen however, increased in clover treated plots (15 and 12 %, respectively) compared with barley treated plots. Also farmyard manure + 50 % NPK, biofertilizer + 50 % NPK, and integration of farmyard manure + biofertilizer + 50 % NPK, showed the best performance in (up to 32. 9 %) terms of nitrogen dynamics compared to recommended NPK...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and physical properties {{of a series}} of molecular clips derived from the concave molecule propanediurea. These molecular clips are cavity-containing receptors that can bind a variety of aromatic guests. This binding is a result of hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking interactions. Previous work on molecular clips has been limited to compounds derived from substituted glycoluril. Propanediurea, the compound on which the clips described in this thesis are based, is a molecule that is slightly more concave than glycoluril. A literature survey is presented on the synthesis of glycoluril derivatives and analogues, with special focus on propanediurea derivatives. Subsequently, synthetic efforts to prepare a variety of propanediurea derivatives are described, as well as the synthesis of a variety of molecular <b>clips</b> and <b>half</b> <b>clips</b> from the newly prepared propanediurea derivatives. The binding properties of these propanediurea-derived clips are investigated. It is shown that higher flexibility of the side walls increases the affinity for guests. A comparison is made between clips derived from propanediurea and clips derived from glycoluril. The former clips have a much higher affinity for resorcinol than the latter ones. It is shown that this difference is due to the slightly smaller distance between the carbonyl binding sites in the propanediurea-derived clips. Finally, a number of functionalizations of the propanediurea-derived clip molecules are treated, with the ultimate goal of using their exceptional binding properties in the construction of large supramolecular aggregates. Clips functionalized with porphyrin residues as well as studies on their complexation behavior are descibed. Resorcinol-functionalized polystyrene is used to form a columnar aggregate by self-assocation with clips functionalized at their convex sides with large aliphatic tails. In addition, a clip functionalized at its convex side with resorcinol residues is presented. This molecule can self-associate to form hyperbranched or dendrimer-like structure...|$|R

40|$|Finding the sparset {{solution}} of an underdetermined system of linear equations $y=Ax$ has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Among {{a large number}} of algorithms, iterative thresholding algorithms are {{recognized as one of the}} most efficient and important classes of algorithms. This is mainly due to their low computational complexities, especially for large scale applications. The aim of this paper is to provide guarantees on the global convergence of a wide class of iterative thresholding algorithms. Since the thresholds of the considered algorithms are set adaptively at each iteration, we call them adaptively iterative thresholding (AIT) algorithms. As the main result, we show that as long as $A$ satisfies a certain coherence property, AIT algorithms can find the correct support set within finite iterations, and then converge to the original sparse solution exponentially fast once the correct support set has been identified. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that AIT algorithms are robust to the algorithmic parameters. In addition, it should be pointed out that most of the existing iterative thresholding algorithms such as hard, soft, <b>half</b> and smoothly <b>clipped</b> absolute deviation (SCAD) algorithms are included in the class of AIT algorithms studied in this paper.

Individuals can detect the emotional state of people shown in image sequences. Additionally, firearms are known to elicit certain emotional states in their bearers.

30|$|In IM/DD optical {{wireless}} systems, {{the information}} data stream is modulated into {{the intensity of}} optical carriers. Thus, only real and non-negative values {{can be used to}} realize the intensity modulation. In order to obtain a real signal, we apply an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to convert blocks of Hermitian symmetry complex symbols. For the non-negative requirement of the transmitted optical signals, two mainstream approaches are extensively adopted, adding a DC bias and clipping. In DCO-OFDM, a DC bias is added to eliminate the negative values in the transmitted signal. However, the performance of DCO-OFDM strongly depends on the DC bias level [12]. If the added DC bias cannot exceed the negative peak, the remaining negative values must be clipped to zero, then all subcarriers will be affected by the clipping noise. If the DC bias is larger than the negative peak, it makes the DCO-OFDM inefficient in terms of optical power. The advantage of DCO-OFDM is bandwidth efficiency because both odd and even subcarriers are used to carry data. In ACO-OFDM, all the negative values are clipped to zero, leaving the positives. In [13], we found that the clipping approach reduces the amplitude of the original symbols by <b>half,</b> and the <b>clipping</b> noise falls onto the even subcarriers without distorting the data on the odd subcarriers. Thus, only odd subcarriers are used to carry data in ACO-OFDM. Compared to DCO-OFDM, ACO-OFDM is more optical power efficient, but its bandwidth is as twice that of DCO-OFDM.|$|R
40|$|Grassland {{productivity}} {{in response to}} climate change and land use is a global concern. In order to explore the {{effects of climate change}} and land use on net primary productivity (NPP), NPP partitioning [f(BNPP), defined as the fraction of belowground NPP (BNPP) to NPP], and rain-use efficiency (RUE) of NPP, we conducted a field experiment with warming (+ 3 degrees C), altered precipitation (double and <b>half),</b> and annual <b>clipping</b> in a mixed-grass prairie in Oklahoma, USA since July, 2009. Across the years, warming significantly increased BNPP, f(BNPP), and RUEBNPP by an average of 11. 6 %, 2. 8 %, and 6. 6 %, respectively. This indicates that BNPP was more sensitive to warming than aboveground NPP (ANPP) since warming did not change ANPP and RUEANPP much. Double precipitation stimulated ANPP, BNPP, and NPP but suppressed RUEANPP, RUEBNPP, and RUENPP while half precipitation decreased ANPP, BNPP, and NPP but increased RUEANPP, RUEBNPP, and RUENPP. Clipping interacted with altered precipitation in impacting RUEANPP, RUEBNPP, and RUENPP, suggesting land use could confound the effects of precipitation changes on ecosystem processes. Soil moisture was found to be a main factor in regulating variation in ANPP, BNPP, and NPP while soil temperature was the dominant factor influencing f(BNPP). These findings suggest that BNPP is critical point to future research. Additionally, results from single-factor manipulative experiments should be treated with caution due to the non-additive interactive effects of warming with altered precipitation and land use (clipping) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{comprehension}} of dynamic naturalistic events poses {{at least two}} challenges to the cognitive system: filtering relevant information with attention and dealing with information that was missing or missed. With four experiments, we studied the completion of missing information despite full attention. Participants watched short soccer video clips and we informed participants that we removed a critical moment of ball contact in <b>half</b> of the <b>clips.</b> We asked participants to detect whether these moments of ball contact were present or absent. In Experiment 1, participants gave their detection responses either directly during an event or delayed after an event. Although participants directed their full attention toward the critical contact moment, {{they were more likely}} to indicate seeing the missing ball contact if it was followed by a causally matching scene than if it was followed by an unrelated scene, both for the immediate and delayed responses. Thus, event completion occurs quickly. In Experiment 2, only a causally matching scene but neither a white mask nor an irrelevant scene caused the completion of missing information. This indicates that the completion of missing information is caused by backward inferences rather than predictive perception. In Experiment 3, we showed that event completion occurs directly during a trial and does not depend on expectations built up after seeing the same causality condition multiple times. In Experiment 4, we linked our findings to event cognition by asking participants to perform a natural segmentation task. We conclude that observers complete missing information during coherent events based on a fast backward inference mechanism even when directing their attention toward the missing information.|$|R
