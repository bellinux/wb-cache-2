5|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an {{unlikely}} candidate {{on account of}} his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|Goldstein {{appeared}} as himself in several television series, contributed mixes to and portrayed a playable {{character in the}} video game DJ Hero, and filmed a cameo appearance for Iron Man 2. Goldstein hosted the 2009 MTV drug intervention series Gone Too Far, and <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> struggling with his addiction during filming. On August 28, 2009, he {{was found dead in}} his New York City apartment from a drug overdose. The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory by his sister, and Iron Man 2, which was released in 2010, was dedicated to him.|$|E

5|$|In March 1923, Lenin {{suffered}} a third stroke {{and lost his}} ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis on his right side and began exhibiting sensory aphasia. By May, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Moscow Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki mansion {{on the day of}} his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{completed}} A Short History of the Confederate States of America in October 1889. On November 6, he left Beauvoir {{to visit}} his plantation at Brierfield. While in New Orleans, he {{was caught in a}} sleety rain, and on the steamboat trip upriver, he had a severe cold; on November 13 he left Brierfield to return to New Orleans. Varina Davis, who had taken another boat to Brierfield, met him on the river, and he finally received some medical care; two doctors came aboard further south and found he had acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. They arrived in New Orleans three days later, and he was taken to the home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, an Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Davis remained in bed but was stable for the next two weeks; however, he took {{a turn for the worse}} in early December. Just when <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and with his hand in Varina's.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Asashōryū {{posted a}} 14–1 record, his fourth {{straight}} championship since returning from injury, {{and became the}} fifth man to win twenty career championships. In March, he dropped his first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13–2 score. However, this {{was not enough to}} win the title—he lost a playoff {{for the first time in}} his career, to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō. In May he turned in a below par 10–5 record, losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki (although <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carrying an injury). Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards. Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history. In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts, taking his 21st title with a 14–1 record. He was suspended by the Sumo Association from the next two tournaments (see below).|$|E
