50|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study in vivo the over-all fatty acid specificity of the mechanisms involved in chylomicron cholesterol ester and triglyceride formation during fat absorption in the rat. Mixtures containing similar amounts of two, three, or four C14-labeled fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids), but with varying ratios of unlabeled fatty acids, were given by <b>gastric</b> <b>intubation</b> to rats with cannulated thoracic ducts. The chyle or chylomicron lipid so obtained was chromatographed on silicic acid columns to separate cholesterol esters and glycerides (the latter being 98.2% triglycerides). After assaying each lipid class for total radioactivity, gas-liquid chromatography was employed to measure the total mass {{and the distribution of}} mass and of radioactivity in the individual fatty acid components of each lipid fraction. The specific radioactivity of each fatty acid in each fraction could then be calculated. The data provided quantitative information on the relative specificity of incorporation of each fatty acid into each chylomicron lipid class and on the relative extent to which each fatty acid in each lipid fraction was diluted with endogenous fatty acid. With the exception of a slight discrimination against stearic acid, the processes of fatty acid absorption and chylomicron triglyceride formation displayed no specificity for one fatty acid relative to another. In contrast, chylomicron cholesterol ester formation showed marked specificity for oleic acid, relative to the other three fatty acids. This specificity was not significantly altered by varying the composition of the test meal, by including cholesterol in the test meal, or by feeding the animal a high-cholesterol diet for several weeks preceding the study. Considerable dilution of the dietary fatty acids with endogenous fatty acids was observed. In one experiment, 43% of the chylomicron triglyceride fatty acids was of endogenous origin. Relatively more (54%) of the cholesterol ester fatty acids was of endogenous origin.|$|E

40|$|Summary. -Mammary tumours were induced in 3 {{groups of}} male Long-Evans rats {{by a series}} of 6 {{fortnightly}} <b>gastric</b> <b>intubations</b> of 7, 12 -dimethylbenzanthracene. Two weeks before the initial carcinogen treatment one group of rats was grafted with 3 pituitary homografts underneath the kidney capsule of each recipient (hyper-prolactinaemia). A second group, 2 weeks before the initial carcinogen treatment and {{for the duration of the}} study (35 weeks), were injected 4 x weekly with 2 -Br-oa-ergocryptine (CB- 154) (hypoprolactinaemia). A third group of rats served as controls. A significant increase in the incidence of mammary tumours and a reduced latency period of tumour appearance in the hyperprolactinaemia group, when compared with the controls, were observed in this study. Mammary tumour incidence and latency period of tumour appearance in the hypoprolactinaemia group, however, did not differ significantly from controls. Thus, an increased secretion of pituitary prolactin in rats appears to be an important enhancing endocrinic condition in carcinogenesis of the male mammary gland. THE ADMINISTRATION of 7, 12 -dimethyl-benzanthracene (DMBA) has been a standard procedure for over a decade for the rapid production of mammary carci-nomata in laboratory rats (Huggins, 1965), an experimental model which in certain respects resembles human breast cancer (Dao, 1964; Middleton, 1965). In the female rat, this procedure results in mam-mary carcinomata of high yield that are hormone responsive. The hormonal dependency of these carcinomata has been studied intensely and it appears that the major influential hormones in this process are oestrogen and prolactin (Daniel an...|$|R

The control group treated with 5 % Nigella sativa and Antox drug (3 mg/mouse/day) either alone or in combination for 15 days. Another control group was treated with the same antioxidants and subjected to 1 Gy of - irradiation x 5 times day after day. In kidney tissue the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were estimated. Also, the histopathological changes were recorded. Results: 5 % Nigella sativa revealed a little decrease in MDA level and a highly significant decrease in GSH in kidney tissue while the exposure to fractionated dose of - irradiation predicted a highly significant decrease in MDA and a highly significant increase in GSH level. <b>Gastric</b> <b>intubations</b> of Antox drug showed a highly significant increase in MDA and GSH levels in kidney tissue either alone or in addition to fractionated radiation exposure.

A gastric pH of 2. 5 or less and a volume of 25 ml (0. 4 ml/kg body weight) or more in average adult patients are considered critical factors for the development of pulmonary damage in adults. Materials and Methods: This study compared the efficacy of a single oral dose of erythromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) with oral pantoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) on pre-operative gastric fluid volume and pH in a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled fashion in 80 adult patients (of ASA physical status I and II) planned for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were divided into two groups of 40 patients each.

Nicotine (6 mg/kg/day) was dissolve in milk-formula and delivered during three feedings daily from postnatal day (P) 1 to P 7. Nicotine immediately and significantly [P < 0. 05] decreased weight gain per day (WGD) by 13. 5 % (T) 1 day after onset of treatment in both genders and throughout the treatment period. This resulted in significantly lower body weight at P 4 and P 5 in male and female pups, respectively.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} acyclovir (ACV) and 9 -(1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl) guanine (DHPG) on murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) replication in lung and salivary gland tissues, the evolution of interstitial pneumonitis in vivo, and MCMV replication in mouse embryo cells in vitro. As measured by plaque reduction, ACV was more active than DHPG in vitro. In vivo, whether administered orally by <b>gastric</b> <b>intubation</b> or in the drinking water, or subcutaneously, DHPG was more effective than ACV in reducing MCMV titers in lung or salivary gland tissues. This was true in both normal and cyclophosphamide-treated mice. Neither drug was able to prevent MCMV interstitial pneumonitis, despite substantial reductions in virus titer, but both drugs reduced {{the severity of the}} pneumonitis...|$|E
40|$|The single {{intravenous}} administration of purified T- 2 toxin to rabbits to 0. 5 mg per kg body weight produced {{a decrease in}} hematocrit, while blood cell count, and serum alkaline phosphatase activity. The plasma clotting time, {{as measured by the}} activated partial thromboplastin time assay, was prolonged after intravenous T- 2 toxin administration. In contrast, the administration of T- 2 toxin to rabbits at 2. 0 mg per kg body weight by <b>gastric</b> <b>intubation</b> produced oral lesions, diarrhea and anorexia in the animals but did not cause significant alteration in hematological and biochemical parameters. The results suggest that the rabbit may be a suitable model for further examination of the biochemical mechanisms involved in the cytotoxic action of T- 2 toxin...|$|E
40|$|Quarts powder was {{injected}} intratracheally into rabbits {{to induce}} experimental pneumoconiosis. Simultaneous intravenous injections of chloroquine diphosphate or <b>gastric</b> <b>intubation</b> of tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) were given. This {{was done with}} the expectation of preventing or delaying pulmonary fibrosis. As a result, though silicotic changes {{similar to those of the}} control group were found in the THQ-treated group, no such changes occured in chloroquine diphosphate-treated group. Silicotic changes in the THQ-treated and control groups were as follows: The lungs showed proliferation of septal macrophages, thickening of the alveolar wall, scattered quartz powder, and foreign body giant cells. These silicotic changes were seldom seen in chloroquine diphosphate-treated lungs. It appeared that chloroquine diphosphate was inhibitory to early silicotic changes and acted to prevent the dvelopment of silicosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding {{ovalbumin}} was studied in CBA, C 3 H, SWR/J and A inbred strains of mice. In non-immune animals differences {{were observed in}} their abilities to absorb intact antigen and eliminate it from their circulation. Following oral immunization, C 3 H mice were able to absorb significantly less ovalbumin than controls, however no evidence for immune exclusion {{was found in the}} other strains. Oral tolerance could be induced in all strains tested but in CBA and SWR/J mice oral immunization had to be continual, via the drinking rather than a single daily <b>gastric</b> <b>intubation.</b> The results suggest that genetic differences exist in the handling of antigen by the gut. If similar differences exist in man they may underly differences in susceptibility to food allergy...|$|E
