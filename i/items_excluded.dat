Several aspects of TMD {{among the elderly}} are still controversial in the literature. The aim {{of this paper is}} to verify the prevalence of TMD among the elderly in Taubaté – Brazil, and its possible association with other co-morbidities. Material and Methods: Sixty-eight elderly individuals, presenting an average age of 69. 5 years (SD 8. 5), participated in this study, 37 of which were female. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Dysfunction (RDC/TMD) was used to verify TMD and its possible association with other co-morbidities. Results: The studied sample presented a low prevalence of TMD according to RDC/TMD (10. 3 %). Women presented more non-specific physical symptoms than men (pain items included, p= 0. 016, x 2 test). Depression and non-specific physical symptoms (pain <b>items</b> <b>excluded)</b> did not correlate with patients’ gender. Associations were found among depression and characteristic pain intensity (p= 0. 027, ANOVA), non-specific physical symptoms (pain items included, p< 0. 001), non-specific physical symptoms (pain <b>items</b> <b>excluded,</b> p= 0. 001) and chronic pain grade (p= 0. 004), whereas the more depressed the patients were, the higher were their pain scores. Conclusions: One can conclude that psychological factors, such as depression, were associated with TMD prevalence, thus reinforcing the need for a multidisciplinary approach for TMD treatment.

40|$|The Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) was {{devised to}} assess how an {{individual}} conceptualizes the biological mechanisms that underpin his or her pain. Despite its widespread use, its psychometric properties have not been comprehensively interrogated. Rasch analysis was undertaken on NPQ data from {{a convenience sample of}} 300 spinal pain patients, and test-retest reliability was assessed in a sample of 45 low back pain patients. The NPQ effectively targeted the ability of the sample and had acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. However, some items functioned erratically for persons of differing abilities or were psychometrically redundant. The NPQ was reanalyzed with 7 questionable <b>items</b> <b>excluded,</b> and superior psychometric properties were observed. These findings suggest that the NPQ could be improved, but future prospective studies including qualitative measures are needed. In summary, the NPQ is a useful tool for assessing a patient's conceptualization of the biological mechanisms that underpin his or her pain and for evaluating the effects of cognitive interventions in clinical practice and research. These findings suggest that it has adequate psychometric properties for use with chronic spinal pain patients. ...|$|E

30|$|We further {{performed}} a {{content analysis of}} the included and excluded items. On the anxiety-withdrawal subscale, items related to facial expressions, inaction and retraction for social interactions are present both in the included and in the excluded items. On the anger-aggression subscale, items referring to aggression, anger, frustration and opposition are both in the included and the excluded items. The three excluded items, however, deal with children aggressively confronting adult. This behaviour is not captured by the included items. Nevertheless we consider that the exclusion of these items {{has no effect on}} the construct representation since these behaviours can be also measured by the included items; that is, if children are angry when interrupted, they will likely show reactions when teacher interrupts them (usually teachers interrupt children in the classroom setting), if children shout or speak with bad manners, they will usually do that also with the teacher or other adults. Finally, on the social competence subscale, items included have a broader formulation, i.e., they refer to cooperation, help, work in groups, consolation. <b>Items</b> <b>excluded</b> refer to more specific behaviours (“Negotiates solutions”) or are culturally inappropriate. For example, “Helps younger children” is not applicable to children in Portugal because most preschool centres in Portugal do not put younger children and older children together in the same classroom.|$|E

40|$|In {{a sample}} of 543 adult National Health Service (NHS) {{patients}} referred to a Psychological Therapies Service, {{the responses to the}} Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) self-report questionnaire were examined using conventional principal components analysis (PCA) and a unique application of Mokken Scaling Procedure (MSP). Following the theoretical views of G. A. Foulds, it was suggested that some items more properly belong to the universe of attitudes and traits rather than that of symptoms and states. Accordingly, the analyses were carried out both with and without the CORE-OM Risk domain items. Both PCAs produced a very large first component of Psychological distress, while the small second component differs. With all items included, the second component was of Risk. With the risk <b>items</b> <b>excluded,</b> the second component was now Functioning. The MSP results, respectively, were of a five-item scale of Functioning (impaired by depression) and on the second analysis, a five-item Functioning scale (impaired by anxiety). There was discussion on the criteria for item selection, the time scale specified in questionnaire instructions and the optimum number of items required for a symptom scale. It was concluded that the CORE-OM item pool did not conform to its purported face validity domains and subdomains, but predominantly constitutes a large Psychological distress scale with considerable item redundancy.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the factors influencing an individual's intention to utilize OOP health checkups. Methods: A cross-sectional research method was adopted in this study. Based on the theory of planned behavior, a questionnaire was developed and used to survey purposively sampled residents (n = 940) from 12 randomly selected townships in Taichung County, Taiwan, from August to September 2006. Descriptive statics and linear regression were conducted to analyze the collected data. Results: Our results showed that result evaluation (β = 0. 092), behavioral beliefs (β = 0. 088), behavioral norms of people with experience in utilizing OOP health checkups (β = 0. 116), perceived convenience (β = 0. 273), and worry about illness and perceived health (β = 0. 110) were important factors influencing the intention to utilize OOP health checkups. Age, education and acceptable health checkup charges were also related. Conclusion: Reinforcing disease- and health checkup-related knowledge may positively influence an individual's intention to utilize OOP health checkups. In addition, improving perceived convenience and reducing disease-screening barriers can intensify the individual's intention to use OOP health checkups. The influence of age, education level and OOP checkup charges should also be taken into consideration when related policies are formulated...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the factor structure, internal consistency, and discriminatory {{validity of the}} World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) version used in the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD). In total 8796 adults were assessed using the ESEMeD WHODAS (22 severity and 8 frequency items). An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with promax rotation was done with a random 50 %. The other half was used for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) comparing models (a) suggested by EFA; (b) hypothesized a priori; and (c) reduced with four items. A CFA model with covariates was conducted in the whole sample to assess invariance across Mediterranean (Spain, France and Italy) and non-Mediterranean (Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands) countries. Cronbach's alphas and discriminatory validity were also examined. EFA identified seven factors (explained variance: 80 %). The reduced model (six factors, four frequency <b>items</b> <b>excluded)</b> presented the best fit [Confirmatory Fit Index (CFI) = 0. 992, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0. 996, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0. 024]. The second-order factor structure also fitted well (CFI = 0. 987, TLI = 0. 991, RMSEA = 0. 036). Measurement non-invariance was found for Embarrassment. Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0. 84 for Participation to 0. 93 for Mobility. Preliminary data suggest acceptable discriminatory validity. Thus, the ESEMeD WHODAS {{may well be a}} valuable shortened version of the WHODAS-II, but future users should reconsider the filter questions. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
