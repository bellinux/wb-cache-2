At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the Governor. The Maryland Constitution of 1851 lengthened the Governor's term of office from three to four years, which brought <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> Governor in line with <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> Federal offices that occur only in even years.

5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E
