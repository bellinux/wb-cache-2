The 351-2V engines and the 400-2V had a power and torque increase, and the 460-4V had a power decrease. In an attempt to help improve fuel economy, the standard rear axle ratio for all models was now 2.75:1.|$|E
2500|$|A revised egg-crate grille above a new federally {{mandated}} [...] {{front bumper}} and revised taillights {{were among the}} most noticeable changes for the 1973 Electra 225. All engines now featured EGR valves to meet increasingly stringent 1973 emission standards (the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> was featured on Buick engines for California cars in 1972).|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, a Chrysler MPI fuel {{injection}} system replaced the RENIX system, and the intake ports were raised approximately [...] for a better entry radius. Chrysler also enlarged the throttle body and redesigned the intake and exhaust manifolds for more efficiency, and the fuel injectors were replaced with higher flow units. Camshaft timing was also changed. The net result was an engine that made [...] and [...] Badging on most Jeeps equipped with this engine read [...] "4.0 Litre HIGH OUTPUT." [...] The new cam profile combined with altered computer programming eliminated {{the need for an}} <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> and knock sensor, but made the engine more sensitive to alterations, especially where emissions are concerned. The OEM fuel injectors used with the Mopar MPI system (manufactured by Siemens) have been known to leak fuel especially with OBDII where plugged catalytic converters are common which usually throws a P0420 code.|$|E

50|$|Inspection (and replacement, if necessary) of the MAP sensor, and its {{accompanying}} vacuum hose, {{is often}} a solution to many driveability problems. This sensor largely controls the engine's driveability. Stuck <b>EGR</b> <b>valves</b> are also very common on the Tech IV.|$|R
50|$|Since the EGR system recirculates {{a portion}} of exhaust gases, over time the valve can become clogged with carbon {{deposits}} that prevent it from operating properly. Clogged <b>EGR</b> <b>valves</b> can sometimes be cleaned, but replacement is necessary if the valve is faulty.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the event}} the {{takeover}} of the Rover Group by BMW, who brought their own range of diesel engines, made the Storm engine largely redundant. Only the 5-cylinder version made it to production as the powerplant for the Defender and the new Discovery Series II as the 'Td5' in 1998. Offering more power and greater refinement than the 300Tdi the Td5 greatly improved {{the appeal of the}} Discovery but caused concern amongst many operators of the Defender due to its electronic engine management systems which were considered to be less reliable and more difficult to repair 'in the field' than the mechanical injection systems used on previous Land Rover diesel engines. In deference to these concerns (including those voiced by the British Army) Land Rover kept the 300Tdi in production for fitment to special-order vehicles (see above). It transpired that the Td5's electronics were highly reliable. Early engines suffered two isolated mechanical failures—sudden and complete failure of the oil pump drive and 'cylinder head shuffle' caused by weak retaining studs. Both these faults were fixed within 2 years of the engine starting production and the Td5 is now considered highly reliable. In 2002 the engine was improved to reach Euro 3 antipollution stage, and an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> system was introduced. Electronics were also updated to improve the low-speed throttle response which had been prone to producing [...] a jerky power delivery in off-road or towing situations.|$|E
2500|$|For 1970, the Valiant {{was carried}} over with detail changes, {{including}} a new black plastic grille sculptured differently from 1969's metal item. The central portion protruded flush with the forward edge of the hood, while {{the remainder of the}} grille was set back from the front plane. The two-door sedan was dropped, replaced by the new Duster coupe. For all except export Valiants, the base 170 engine was replaced by a new [...] version of the Slant-6. The 198 gave better performance than the 170, and was less costly to make, since it used the same cylinder block as the 225. The Valiant was virtually unchanged for 1971; small revisions included removal of the center grille emblem and a new kind of finish treatment on the grille surround. It now had a blacked-out look instead of the previous argent silver treatment. For the 1970 and 1971 models, exterior and interior trim were slightly revised, and there were engineering changes for better driveability, improved soundproofing and decreased emissions, the latter in compliance with regulations mandated by the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implementing new devices such as an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> and an activated charcoal evaporative emissions system. The 1971 Valiant eventually set sales records with 256,930 calendar year deliveries, so there was little motivation to change it for 1972. Only details of the taillights and grille were altered for the 1972 Valiants. New surface-mount sidemarker lamp-reflector units replaced the more costly previous flush-mount items.|$|E

50|$|Tell-tale {{signs of}} such {{eventual}} related damage are a white foam that {{appears on the}} inside of the oil filler cap and the gradually increasing loss of antifreeze coolant (due to seepage into the intake passages which will lead to engine lock up failure in such cases). External seepage is also found near the valley edge of the lower intake manifold. These engines are also known for problematic <b>EGR</b> <b>Valves</b> in which carbon build-up occurs very rapidly, therefore reducing gas mileage drastically, however without affecting the reliability of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, <b>EGR</b> <b>valves,</b> <b>EGR</b> coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|R
50|$|With OBD II standards, vehicle {{manufacturers}} {{were required to}} test the exhaust gas recirculation (<b>EGR)</b> <b>valve</b> for functionality during driving. Some manufacturers use the MaP sensor to accomplish this. In these vehicles, they have a MAF sensor for their primary load sensor. The MaP sensor is then used for rationality checks and to test the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve.</b> The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold (i.e., a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air) the powertrain control module (PCM) will open the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> and then monitor the MaP sensor's values. If the EGR is functioning properly, the manifold absolute pressure will increase as exhaust gases enter.|$|E

25|$|Both the 350 and 455 V8s {{were carried}} over from 1971 with {{horsepower}} ratings switched the new SAE net figures {{based on an}} engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a dynamometer rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving <b>EGR</b> <b>valves,</b> which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a frequency-domain methodology for robust systemcontrol design, and its application in airpath {{control of a}} real turbocharged Diesel engine with intake throttle and exhaust gas re-circulation system. The objective {{is to find a}} robust control-system which reduces pollutant emission. The three inputs (throttle, wastegate and <b>EGR</b> <b>valves)</b> and two outputs (airflow and boost pressure) of the airpath make the system complex. AMulti InputMulti Output (MIMO) fractional order approach called CRONE (French abbreviation which means robust control of a non integer order) is used to design a non-square control-system for this non-linear plant. Firstly, a multisine signal is used for the system-identification, the airpath inputs are excited around all operating points in order to find a linear model of the plant. Then, the frequency responses of a defined nominal plant and experimental plant are taken into account to design the MIMO control-system using the CRONE shaping approach which permits to maintain performance and robust stability around a wide set of operating points. Finally, pollutant emission results from a driving cycle in test-bench show the relevance of the proposed approach...|$|R
50|$|The {{company is}} best known for the Quadrajet carburetor, which was {{originally}} designed in the 1960s and remained in production, with modifications to meet progressively tightening exhaust emission limits, into the 1980s. The Quadrajet became computer controlled in 1980 in California and in 1981 {{in the rest of the}} states; its last application was on the 1990 Cadillac Brougham and 1990 full size GM station wagons with the Olds 307 engine. RPD was a pioneer in fuel injection systems in road cars in the 1980s. In addition to carburetors, Rochester also made various emissions control equipment such as charcoal canisters and <b>EGR</b> <b>valves,</b> which found use in GM vehicles as well as those from other makes. Other products made at this plant were locks and keys as well as steel tubing for both vehicular and non-vehicular applications. The last major carburetor design by Rochester was the Varajet II, essentially a Quadrajet halved lengthwise, and was one of the few successful progressive 2-barrel carburetors. It was installed on 4- and 6-cylinder engines from 1979 to 1986.|$|R
50|$|For 1994, {{in order}} to meet more {{stringent}} emission requirements, a secondary air injection system, and an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> were added to the C25XE and became the X25XE.|$|E
5000|$|The first EGR {{systems were}} crude; some were {{as simple as}} an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which {{admitted}} exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running. Difficult starting, rough idling, and reduced performance and fuel economy resulted. By 1973, an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions. Control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience; Chrysler's [...] "Coolant Controlled Exhaust Gas Recirculation" [...] system of 1973 exemplified this evolution: a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> until the engine reached normal operating temperature. This prevented driveability problems due to unnecessary exhaust induction; NOx forms under elevated temperature conditions generally not present with a cold engine. Moreover, the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> was controlled, in part, by vacuum drawn from the carburetor's venturi, which allowed more precise constraint of EGR flow to only those engine load conditions under which NOx is likely to form. Later, backpressure transducers {{were added to the}} <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> control to further tailor EGR flow to engine load conditions. Most modern engines now need exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. However, recent innovations have {{led to the development of}} engines that do not require them. The 3.6 Chrysler Pentastar engine is one example that does not require EGR.|$|E
50|$|Fitting a {{catch tank}} (can) {{will reduce the}} amount of oil vapor {{reaching}} the intake tract and combustion chamber. Without the oil vapor the soot from the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> will not congeal so much on the intake which will keep the intake from becoming clogged.|$|E
50|$|To meet US federal regulations, {{large black}} plastic bumpers {{were added to}} the front and rear and the ride height was {{increased}}. The increased ride height affected handling, and an anti-roll bar was added to help with higher centre of gravity. The A-Series engine was replaced by the 1493 cc unit from the Triumph Spitfire, coupled to a modified Morris Marina gearbox with synchromesh on all four gears. The increased displacement of the new engine was better able to cope with the increasing emission regulations. Although the horsepower ratings were similar (65 bhp - home market) the 1493 cc engine produced more torque. The increased output combined with taller gear ratios resulted in faster acceleration (12 seconds 0-60 compared to 13 for the 1275 cc version) and top speed of just over 100 mph. In the US market British Leyland struggled to keep engine power at acceptable levels, as the engines were loaded with air pumps, <b>EGR</b> <b>valves</b> and catalytic converters to keep up with new US and California exhaust emission control regulations. The home market's dual SU HS4 carbs were swapped for a single Zenith-Stromberg 150 CD4 unit, and the power fell to 50 bhp at 5000 RPM and 67 lb-ft of torque at 2500 RPM. The round rear-wheel arches were now square again, to increase the body strength. The last car was made on 7 December 1979, after 73,899 of the last version had been made. The last 500 home-market cars were painted black. A least number of MG Midgets were titled in 1980, and appear as 1980 models.|$|R
50|$|With skyrocketing oil and {{gas prices}} (the price {{of oil in the}} US had more than quadrupled) due to the OPEC oil embargo in late 1973, the much smaller, far more {{efficient}} Japanese and European cars (which utilized four-cylinder engines, unibody construction, and, most, front-wheel drive) dramatically increased in popularity. American automakers' attempts at compensating were relatively poorly received, as the offered vehicles (including its homegrown compacts e.g. Chevrolet Nova, Ford Maverick and subcompacts (Pinto, Vega)) were still much heavier and less efficient. This included detuning the powertrain to meet emission standards (from the use of <b>EGR</b> <b>valves,</b> smog air pumps, and the early catalytic converter designs with a restrictive catalyst brick (unlike the modern day variant using a monolithic brick). Detuned engines later gained electronic carburetors (used with an early variant of a powertrain control module which pre-dated OBDII) until the advent of electronic fuel injection by the mid-1980s (first with the musclecar survivors and later extended to full and mid-size automobiles). Additionally, import automakers introduced North America only models that were somewhat larger (though not as large as most American brand models) to appeal to existing preferences - the larger sized imports (usually Asian marques especially the Japanese makes where the larger sized car was subjected to higher vehicle taxation in its own home market - usually a car model which is designed for the North American (USA/Canada) market e.g. a USDM Honda Accord or Nissan Altima) were considered acceptable by North American consumers when mass-market Asian automakers established their transplant assembly plants in the United States, Canada, and Mexico once the 1981 Voluntary Export Restraints was passed by the U.S. Congress.|$|R

50|$|By {{retarding}} the cams at idle or {{very low}} engine loads, you achieve a smoother, easier idle. From idle through medium engine loads, AVCS advances the intake valves to begin opening {{during the last}} part of the exhaust stroke, when the exhaust valves are still slightly open. Some of the pressure created during the exhaust stroke flows into the intake manifold, having the effect of exhaust gas recirculation (<b>EGR).</b> The intake <b>valves</b> also close earlier during the intake stroke. This helps with engine efficiency and fuel economy.|$|R

40|$|A precise {{estimation}} of the recirculated exhaust gas rate and oxygen concentration {{as well as a}} predictive evaluation of the possible EGR unbalance among cylinders are of paramount importance, especially if non-conventional combustion modes, which require high EGR flow-rates, are implemented. In the present paper, starting from the equation related to convergent nozzles, the EGR mass flow-rate is modeled considering the pressure and the temperature upstream of the <b>EGR</b> control <b>valve,</b> as well as the pressure downstream of it. The restricted flow-area at the valve-seat passage and the discharge coefficient are carefully assessed as functions of the valve lift. Other models were fitted using parameters describing the engine working conditions as inputs, following a semi-physical and a purely statistical approach. The resulting models are then applied to estimate EGR rates to both conventional and non-conventional combustion conditions. In a following step, a correlation was proposed between EGR rate and combustion metrics. This function was then applied to check the possibility of estimating the EGR unbalance, which can negatively affect combustion stability, in particular at high EGR rates. EGR unbalance was also evaluated considering the measurements of the temperature of the charge entering each cylinder. These two methods to evaluate EGR unbalance were then compared to CFD calculations...|$|R

40|$|Exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR) is extensively employed in diesel combustion engines to achieve nitrogen oxides emission targets. The EGR is often cooled {{in order to}} increase the effectiveness of the strategy, even though this leads to a further undesired impact on particulate matter and hydrocarbons. Experimental tests were carried out on a diesel engine at a dynamometer rig under steady-state speed and load working conditions that were considered relevant for the New European Driving Cycle. Two different shell and tube-type EGR coolers were compared, in terms of the pressure and temperature of the exhaust and intake lines, to evaluate thermal effectiveness and induced pumping losses. All the relevant engine parameters were acquired along EGR trade-off curves, in order to perform a detailed comparison of the two coolers. The effect of intake throttling operation on increasing the EGR ratio was also investigated. A purposely designed aging procedure was run in order to characterize the deterioration of the thermal effectiveness and verify whether clogging of the EGR cooler occurred. The EGR mass flow-rate dependence on the pressure and temperature upstream of the turbine as well as the pressure downstream of the <b>EGR</b> control <b>valve</b> was modeled by means of the expression for convergent nozzles.

40|$|AbstractCombustion {{control is}} {{assuming}} {{a crucial role}} in reducing engine tailpipe emissions while maximizing performance. The effort in the calibration of control parameters affecting the combustion development can be very demanding. One of the most effective factors influencing performance and efficiency is the combustion phasing: in Spark Ignition (SI) engines it is affected by factors such as Spark Advance (SA), Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (<b>EGR),</b> Variable <b>Valve</b> Timing (VVT). SA optimal values are usually determined by means of calibration procedures carried out in steady state conditions on the test bench by changing SA values while monitoring performance indicators, such as Brake and Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP, IMEP), Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and pollutant emissions. The effect of SA on combustion is stochastic, due to the cycle-to-cycle variation: the analysis of mean values requires many engine cycles to be significant of the performance obtained with the given control setting. Moreover, often the effect of SA on engine performance must be investigated for different settings of other control parameters (EGR, VVT, AFR). The calibration process is time consuming involving exhaustive tests followed by off-line data analysis. This paper presents the application of a dynamic calibration methodology, with the objective of reducing the calibration duration. The proposed approach is based on transient tests, coupled with a statistical investigation, allowing reliable performance analysis even with a low number of engine cycles. The methodology has been developed and tested off-line, then it has been implemented in Real-Time. The combustion analysis system has been integrated with the ECU management software and the test bench controller, in order to perform a fully automatic calibration...|$|R
