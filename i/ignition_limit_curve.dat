The coals varied in rank from sub-bituminous to bituminous and were tested in varying concentrations from the <b>ignition</b> <b>limit</b> to 400 g/m 3. Following each successful test the combustion residue was collected, weighed and analysed within a thermogravimetric analyser, allowing Q factors to be estimated. The <b>ignition</b> <b>limit</b> varied slightly in air, but was mostly around the 200 g/m 3 level. With the exception of Coal C, which was much harder to ignite, it correlated roughly with coal rank. The <b>ignition</b> <b>limit</b> changed significantly with O 2 concentration when in mixed O 2 /CO 2 gases. Only a few high volatile coals ignited in 21 % O 2 /CO 2 v/v, and then only with a 2500 J, rather than a 1000 J, igniter. An increase in O 2 /CO 2 levels to 30 or 35 % gave ignition patterns similar to those carried out in air with a further increase to 40 % having little additional effect.

In this case, the limit-state material model simulates and captures the RC column response to detect the possibility of shear failure. To this end, the shear <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> is defined according to both the column shear and the total displacement or drift ratio (Fig.Â  8). In case the columns are vulnerable to shear failure after flexural yielding, then the drift capacity model proposed by Elwood and Moehle (2005) can be utilized to define the accurate <b>limit</b> <b>curve.</b> Other shear failure criterion such as plastic rotation at the two ends of the column is also proposed by LeBorgne (2012).|$|R

To this end, a model material consisting of a homogeneous zone and a zone that has voids (material inhomogeneity) is proposed and used to simulate necking under plane strain and uni-axial stress load paths. Results of the in-plane loading computations are used to construct a strain-based formability <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> for the model material.

40|$|Abstract â Just by {{adjusting}} the control points iteratively, progressive iterative approximation (PIA) presents an intuitive and straightforward scheme such that the resulting <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (surface) can interpolate the original data points. In order to obtain more flexibility, adjusting only {{a subset of the}} control points, a new method called local progressive iterative approximation (LPIA) has also been proposed. But to this day, there are two problems about PIA and LPIA: (1) Only an approximation process is discussed, but the accurate convergence curves (surfaces) are not given. (2) In order to obtain an interpolating curve (surface) with high accuracy, recursion computations are needed time after time, which result in a large workload. To overcome these limitations, this paper gives an explicit matrix expression of the control points of the <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (surface) by the PIA or LPIA method, and proves that the column vector consisting of the control points of the PIAâs <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (or surface) can be obtained by multiplying the column vector consisting of the original data points on the left by the inverse matrix of the collocation matrix (or the Kronecker product of the collocation matrices in two direction) of the blending basis at the parametric values chosen by the original data points. Analogously, the control points of the LPIAâs <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (or surface) can also be calculated by one-step. Furthermore, the G 1 joining conditions between two adjacent <b>limit</b> <b>curves</b> obtained from two neighboring data points sets are derived.
