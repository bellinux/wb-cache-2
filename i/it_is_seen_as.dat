5|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in loam construction has revived {{in the developed}} world. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, during manufacture, {{and to create a}} comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{name for}} the town was 'Aberbrothock', {{a reference to the}} Brothock Burn which runs through the town, the prefix 'Aber' coming either from the Gaelic 'Obair', or the earlier Brythonic term 'Aber' for 'confluence' or 'river mouth'. The name 'Aberbrothock' can be found in numerous spelling variations. In the earliest manuscripts available, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> 'Abirbrothoke' (in the letter to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward I) and 'Aberbrothok' (in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriage). In the Declaration of Arbroath, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> 'Abirbrothoc'. Early maps show a number of variants including Aberbrothock, Aberbrothik, Aberbrothick, and Aberbrothwick.|$|E

5|$|The Protocol of Corfu {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by Northern Epirote {{and human rights}} organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is scarcely mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' disregard for the national integrity of Albania.|$|E
5|$|Unhalfbricking is {{the third}} album by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and their second album {{released}} in 1969. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, What We Did on Our Holidays and arguably reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege & Lief, released later the same year.|$|E
5|$|Mt. St. Peter Parish has {{a branch}} of the Saint Vincent De Paul Society. The goal of this branch of the society, like all other branches, is to help the poor, the sick, and the suffering. Members of this group work to help people locally by {{collecting}} food and delivering it to food banks in and around New Kensington. Within the church, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a great honor {{to be part of this}} society and the members believe that the best help lies in the people they are more than in the caring acts they perform. They all work together to help others and they continually strive to become better Catholics.|$|E

5|$|Mutukumbo {{festival is}} the major festival celebrated in the {{province}} in Luapala Valley. It is held annually during July and attracts around 20,000 people, including the President of Zambia. The event involves enacting the migration of Luba Lunda and conquest of the valley by the chiefs of the tribe during historic times. Kwanga festival is held in the October by the Njumba tribe in Samfya. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a cultural reunion of the tribe to preserve their rituals and traditions. Other festivals celebrated in the province are the Malaila Ceremony, the festival of death of evil lion, the Musubilwa Mpemba Ceremony, and the Ubwilile traditional ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
5|$|Southcote {{forms an}} electoral {{ward of the}} Reading West constituency, and has three seats on Reading Borough Council. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a safe seat for the Labour Party; the Conservative Party last won a council seat in Southcote in 1987. The current three councillors are Debs Edwards, John Ellis and Matt Lawrence. The most recent {{election}} was held in 2016, which saw Edwards re-elected. The ward has seen three by-elections: in 2006, in 2014 when Lawrence was elected following Pete Ruhemann's death, and in 2016 when Lawrence resigned from councillorship. The seat, which was contested by candidates from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and the Conservatives, was held by the Labour party who gained 63.7% of votes.|$|E

5|$|The college's {{undergraduate}} gossip sheet {{is entitled}} The Sheepshagger in allusion to an offensive joke about Welsh people's supposed penchant for sheep. Furthermore, the Welshness of the College is self-perpetuating, as Welsh students will often apply to Jesus because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the Welsh college. Old members recall the college having {{a majority of}} Welsh members {{until well into the}} 20th century; today, however, around 15% of undergraduates come from Wales. For comparison, residents of Wales comprise just under 5% of the United Kingdom population (2.9million {{out of a total of}} 58.8million at the time of the 2001 Census).|$|E
5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a high caliber venue for its music audiences, the theater is regarded as less than ideal for jazz groups {{because it is more}} expensive and larger than most places where jazz is performed. The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on this painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his own face for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{important}} because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the first UK internet libel case that represented two individuals {{rather than one}} party being an Internet Service Provider, {{and was the first}} British case involving a successful prosecution of an individual poster within a chat room.

5|$|The {{design of}} a federally-supported {{residential}} school system relied on the expert advice of several prominent Canadian and British statesmen. Sir Peregrine Maitland, a British soldier and colonial administrator, first proposed boarding schools in 1820, believing that civilizing Indigenous children, rather than adults, {{was the best way}} to influence cultural change. Residential schools focused on imparting industry and knowledge were proposed again in 1845 in a report that had been commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, entitled Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada. Referred to as the Bagot Report, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the foundational document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada.|$|E

25|$|The Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge is a High Impact Project (HIP) {{launched}} {{under the}} Ninth Malaysia Plan.
