40|$|Rinderpest virus (RPV), {{a member}} of genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae, causes an acute and often fatal disease in cattle and other large ruminants. A subunit {{rinderpest}} vaccine consisting of an <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complex</b> (ISCOM) incorporating the RPV haemaggulutinin (H) protein, was examined {{for its ability to}} induce protective immunity in cattle, the natural host of RPV. All of four cattle vaccinated with the ISCOM vaccine survived challenge with virulent virus. Three were solidly protected, showing no clinical signs of infection, while the fourth animal developed only mild and transient symptoms. Virus neutralizing antibodies were produced at a significant level in all vaccinated cattle. These results indicate that this ISCOM vaccine is effective in producing protective immunity in cattle and should be a suitable means of delivering glycoprotein antigens from other morbilliviruse...|$|E

In addition, the effect of equilibration time (1 month at 4 degreesC) on the structures formed by the various combinations of the three components was investigated. Depending on the ratio of Quil A, cholesterol and phospholipid, different colloidal particles, including ISCOM matrices, liposomes and ring-like micelles, were found irrespective of the preparation method used. In contrast, worm-like micelles were only observed in systems prepared by lipid-film hydration. For samples prepared by dialysis, ISCOM matrices were predominantly found near the Quil A apex of the pseudo-ternary diagram (> 50 % Quil A). On the other hand, for samples prepared by lipid-film hydration, ISCOM matrices were predominantly found near the phospholipid apex of the pseudo-ternary diagram (> 50 % phospholipid). The regions in the pseudo-ternary diagrams in which ISCOM matrices were observed increased following an extended equilibration time, particularly for samples prepared by lipid-film hydration. Differences were also observed between pseudoternary diagrams prepared using either PE or PC as phospholipids...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRI) in infants and children worldwide and causes significant LRI in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients. The goal of RSV vaccination is to prevent serious RSV-associated LRI. There are several obstacles to the development of successful RSV vaccines, including the need to immunize very young infants, who may respond inadequately to vaccination; the existence of two antigenically distinct RSV groups, A and B; and the history of disease enhancement following administration of a formalin-inactivated vaccine. It is likely that more than one type of vaccine will be needed to prevent RSV LRI in the various populations at risk. Although vector delivery systems, synthetic peptide, and <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complex</b> vaccines have been evaluated in animal models, only the purified F protein (PFP) subunit vaccines and live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in recent clinical trials. PFP- 2 appears to be a promising vaccine for the elderly and for RSV-seropositive children with underlying pulmonary disease, whereas live cold-passaged (cp), temperature-sensitive (ts) RSV vaccines (denoted cpts vaccines) would most probably be useful in young infants.

The HSV-I antigen preparation i corporated into iscoms elicited significantly greater antibody responses in mice than the same preparation administered together with aluminium hydroxide gel, and provided complete protection against HSV- 1 or HSV- 2 lethal, systemic hallenge infection in animals given a single dose containing 5 ~tg of protein. The HSV- 1 iscom preparation also provided significant protection i mice against local reactions following challenge with HSV- 1 by skin scarification. The use of <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (iscoms) {{as an effective}} means of presenting viral antigens to the immune system was first described in 1984 and consists of a formulation of viral antigens, usually the surface glycoproteins, linked with a lipid adjuvant, Quil A, through hydrophobic interactions producing stable antigen-lipid complexes of about 35 to 40 nm in diameter readily visualized by electron microscopy (Morein et al., 1984).

40|$|International audienceIn the horse, {{conventional}} inactivated or subunit vaccines against {{equine influenza}} virus (EIV) induce a short-lived antibody-based immunity to infection. Alternative strategies of vaccination have been subsequently developed {{to mimic the}} long-term protection induced by natural infection with the virus. One of these approaches {{is the use of}} <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complex</b> (ISCOM) -based vaccines. ISCOM vaccines induce a strong antibody response and protection against influenza in horses, humans, and a mouse model. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) has been demonstrated in humans and mice after ISCOM vaccination, but rarely investigated in the horse. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate EIV-specific immune responses after intra-muscular vaccination with an ISCOM-EIV vaccine (EQUIP F) containing both equine influenza H 7 N 7 (A/eq/Newmarket/ 77) and H 3 N 8 (A/eq/Borlänge/ 91 and A/eq/Kentucky/ 98) strains. The antibody response was measured by single radial haemolysis (SRH) assay using different H 3 N 8 EIV strains. Stimulation of type- 1 immunity was evaluated with a recently developed method that measures EIV-specific IFNγ synthesis by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The protective efficacy of this ISCOM-based vaccine against challenge infection with a recent equine influenza (H 3 N 8; A/eq/South Africa/ 4 / 03) strain was also evaluated. Vaccinated ponies developed elevated levels of EIV-specific SRH antibody and increased percentage of EIV-specific IFNγ^+ PBL, whereas these responses were only detected after challenge infection in unvaccinated control ponies. Vaccinates showed minimal signs of disease and did not shed virus when challenged shortly after the second immunisation. In conclusion, evidence of type- 1 immunity induced by an ISCOM-based vaccine is described for the first time in horses...|$|E
40|$|The {{cholera toxin}} A 1 (CTA 1) -DD/QuilA-containing, <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complex</b> (ISCOM) vector is a rationally {{designed}} mucosal adjuvant that greatly potentiates humoral and cellular immune responses. It {{was developed to}} incorporate the distinctive properties of either adjuvant alone in a combination that exerted additive enhancing effects on mucosal immune responses. In this study we demonstrate that CTA 1 -DD and an unrelated Ag can be incorporated together into the ISCOM, resulting in greatly augmented immunogenicity of the Ag. To demonstrate its relevance for protection against infectious diseases, we tested the vector incorporating PR 8 Ag from the influenza virus. After intranasal immunization {{we found that the}} immunogenicity of the PR 8 proteins were significantly augmented by a mechanism that was enzyme dependent, because the presence of the enzymatically inactive CTA 1 R 7 K-DD mutant largely failed to enhance the response over that seen with ISCOMs alone. The combined vector was a highly effective enhancer of a broad range of immune responses, including specific serum Abs and balanced Th 1 and Th 2 CD 4 (+) T cell priming as well as a strong mucosal IgA response. Unlike unmodified ISCOMs, Ag incorporated into the combined vector could be presented by B cells in vitro and in vivo as well as by dendritic cells; it also accumulated in B cell follicles of draining lymph nodes when given s. c. and stimulated much enhanced germinal center reactions. Strikingly, the enhanced adjuvant activity of the combined vector was absent in B cell-deficient mice, supporting the idea that B cells are important for the adjuvant effects of the combined CTA 1 -DD/ISCOM vector...|$|E

Immunization of BALB/c mice with a single dose of hepatitis B iscoms in saline resulted in a high titre antibody response to HBsAg. In contrast, the original HBsAg preparation required an adjuvant to produce equivalent amounts of antibody. Analysis of sera from mice immunized with hepatitis B iscoms revealed antibodies directed against the major a determinants of HBsAg.

40|$|The {{potential}} of <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (iscoms), a novel form of antigenic presentation, for the induction of protective immunity against morbillivirus infection was shown by immunizing dogs with {{canine distemper virus}} (CDV) iscoms, which contained the fusion (F) protein and a minor amount of the haemagglutinin of the virus. The immunized dogs developed CDV-neutralizing antibodies but, in contrast to non-immunized dogs, did not develop viraemia or clinical signs of infection upon intranasal challenge with the virulent Snyder Hill strain of CDV. Immunization of dogs with measles virus (MV) iscoms, prepared either from affinity-purified MV F protein or from purified whole virus, resulted in partial protection against challenge with CDV.

40|$|Induction of {{all forms}} of {{protective}} immunity by oral immunization with subunit vaccines is an ideal goal for the development of novel vaccines, but creates several theoretical problems {{from the point of view}} of antigen processing mechanisms. We show here that incorporation of the protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in lipophilic <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMS) induces very strong primary immune responses in mice and requires very small amounts of antigen. OVA ISCOMS were particularly efficient at stimulating T-cell-mediated immunity in vivo, including delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and potent class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted cytotoxic T-cell responses. Furthermore, unlike native protein, OVA in ISCOMS was immunogenic when given orally. Thus, ISCOMS seem to allow protein to enter both the endogenous and exogenous pathways of antigen processing and overcome the usual induction of tolerance after feeding antigen. ISCOMS could provide potentially useful adjuvants for the development of oral subunit vaccines...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that DNA vaccination {{was able to}} elicit cellular immune responses and partial protection against Chlamydia trachomatis infection. However, DNA immunization alone did not generate immune responses or protection as great as that induced by using live organisms.

Substantially better protection to challenge infection was observed in mice given combinational vaccination compared with mice given MOMP ISCOM immunization alone, and the protection approximated that induced by live organisms. Enhanced protection was correlated with stronger delayed-type hypersensitivity, higher levels of gamma interferon production, and increased immunoglobulin A antibody responses in lung homogenates. The results indicate that DNA priming followed by ISCOM protein boosting {{may be useful in}} designing a fully protective chlamydial vaccine...|$|R
30|$|<b>Immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMs) were {{documented}} as both {{a delivery}} system and an immunostimulant for the vaccine development. ISCOMs are 40 nm nano-vectors of open cage structure and comprise cholesterol, phospholipids and mixture of saponins extracted from Quillaja saponaria Molina (Sanders et al., 2005; Skene and Sutton, 2006; Sun et al., 2009 b). Vaccines of ISCOMs induced systemic and mucosal immune responses upon intranasal administration, incorporating protein antigens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) envelope proteins (Hu et al., 1998), Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (MmmSC) prtoein (Abusugra and Morein, 1999), and recombinant HBsAg (Pandey and Dixit, 2010). Initially only hydrophobic antigens like membrane proteins were incorporated in the ISCOMs (Morein et al., 1984), but later ISCOMATRIX was developed to mix with antigens to circumvent the incorporation dependence on antigen properties. ISCOM and ISCOMATRIX can induce humoral and CTL responses (controversial for ISCOMATRIX) (Scheerlinck and Greenwood, 2008). Although the immunity potentiating mechanism is presently unclear, ISCOMs have been suggested as a potential intranasal and oral vaccine delivery system for protein antigens (Mowat et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2001).|$|R

Encapsulation of gD 2 into PLG microparticles, incorporation of gD 2 into iscoms and co-administration of gD 2 with LT-K 63 induced mucosal IgA antibody responses (nasal wash, saliva and vaginal wash) which were greater than those induced by intramuscular administration of gD 2 with MF 59.

The bacterium causing this disease, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is also considered a bioterrorism agent, and as {{yet there is}} no licensed vaccine for preventing B. pseudomallei infection. In this study, we evaluated selected proteins (LolC, PotF, and OppA) of the ATP-binding cassette systems of B. pseudomallei as candidate vaccine antigens. Nonmembrane regions of the B. pseudomallei proteins were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and then evaluated as vaccine candidates in an established mouse model of B. pseudomallei infection. When delivered with the monophosphoryl lipid A-trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant, the proteins stimulated antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Immunization with LolC or PotF protein domains afforded significant protection against a subsequent challenge with B. pseudomallei. The most promising vaccine candidate, LolC, provided a greater level of protection when it was administered with <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> complexed with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 10103.

This system provides an animal model for assessing the efficacy of vaccine protection against the virus which is intended to {{reduce the incidence of}} human tumours associated with EB virus infection, namely endemic Burkitt's lymphoma nd undifferentiated nasopharyngeal c rcinoma. Cottontop tamarins have been vaccinated with the major envelope glycoprotein of EB virus, gp 340, incorporated into <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (iscoms) and were thereby protected against a 100 ~ lymphomagenic dose of virus. The gp 340 iscoms are highly immunogenic, requiring only a few micrograms of immunogen to induce protective immunity and thus would be a strong candidate for further development as an EB virus vaccine for use in man. Epstein-Barr (EB) virus is strongly implicated as one of the causative agents in the chain of events that leads to the development of two important human malignancies, undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Shanmugaratnam, 1971) and endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (Burkitt, 1963).

40|$|Orally active {{synthetic}} vaccines containing purified antigens {{would have}} many benefits for immunizing against systemic and mucosal diseases. However, several factors have limited {{the development of}} such vaccines, including the poor immunogenicity of purified proteins and their usual ability to induce tolerance when given orally. Here, we show that incorporation of ovalbumin (OVA) into <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMS) containing saponin prevents the induction of oral tolerance in mice. In parallel, the spleen and mesenteric lymph node of mice fed OVA ISCOMS are primed for class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted cytotoxic T-cell activity which recognizes physiologically processed epitopes on OVA. Oral immunization with OVA ISCOMS also stimulates high secretory IgA antibody responses in the intestine itself, as well as serum IgG antibodies. None of these active immune responses are detectable in mice fed OVA alone. Despite the potent priming of mucosal priming by OVA ISCOMS, re-exposure to antigen does not induce the intestinal immunopathology found in other systems after the breakdown of oral tolerance. Thus, ISCOMS have several unique properties as vectors for oral immunization and could {{provide a basis for}} future mucosal vaccines...|$|R

Immunization of monkeys with the F iscom preparation induced biologically active anti-F protein antibodies as was shown in haemolysis inhibition and cell-cell fusion inhibition tests. A whole MV iscom preparation, which also contained the haemagglutinin protein, induced not only haemolysis-inhibiting antibodies, but, in contrast to the F iscom preparation, also haemagglutination-inhibiting and virus-neutralizing antibodies. In addition the F iscom preparation was shown to activate measles virus-specific T cells in mice. This was demonstrated by the generation of an MV-specific delayed type hypersensitivity response in F iscom-immunized animals and by the isolation of T cell clones specific for MV F protein with the T helper phenotype. Vaccination of mice with MV iscom or F iscom protected them from MV-induced fatal encephalopathy.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} non-living {{adjuvant}} vectors that will allow a full range of local and systemic immune responses to orally administered purified antigens. Here we describe our experience with lipophilic <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMs) containing the saponin adjuvant Quil A. When given orally, ISCOMs containing the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) induce a wide range of systemic immune responses, including Th 1 and Th 2 CD 4 -dependent activity, serum IgG antibodies and class I MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cell responses. In addition, there is local production of secretory IgA antibodies in the intestine itself, as well as priming of CD 4 and CD 8 T cell responses in the draining lymphoid tissues. Preliminary results indicate that the mucosal adjuvant properties of ISCOMs may reflect their ability to deliver antigen combined with the pro-inflammatory properties of Quil A in a particulate form. Of the many inflammatory mediators induced, interleukin- 12, derived from dendritic cells and/or macrophages, appears to be of central importance.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that uptake of oligomeric cognate antigen (OVA-hen egg lysozyme, OVA-HEL) alone or incorporated in <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMS) facilitates presentation and simultaneous cross-presentation of OVA by HEL-specific B cells in vitro. HEL-specific B cells stimulated CD 8 + T cell responses in vitro {{to the same}} extent as bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Cross-presentation by specific B cells required endosomal acidification, proteasomal processing and classical MHC class I/peptide transport. Specific B cells also acquired both antigens rapidly in vivo and presented them to CD 4 + T cells. However, only HEL-specific B cells from OVA-HEL ISCOMS-immunised mice could cross-present OVA to naive OVA-specific CD 8 + T cells. Antigen-specific B cells were also activated selectively by OVA-HEL ISCOMS in vitro and importantly, the presence of HEL-specific B cells promoted the persistence of clonal expansion of OVA-specific CD 8 + T cells after in vivo immunisation with OVA-HEL ISCOMS. These results demonstrate preferential MHC class I and class II processing of cognate antigen incorporated in ISCOMS by specific B cells in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the ability of ISCOMS to target B cells and offering novel insights into the role of B cells in cross-presentation to CD 8 + T cells...|$|R

In this comparative study between cholera toxin (CT) and <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOM) we found that, contrary to CT, ovalbumin (OVA) -ISCOM were poor inducers of mucosal anti-OVA IgA responses, but induced similar or better systemic immunity following oral immunizations. The addition of CT to the oral OVA-ISCOM protocol did not stimulate local anti-OVA IgA immunity, {{nor did it}} change the quality or magnitude of the systemic responses. Both vectors recruited strong innate immunity, but only OVA-ISCOM could directly induce IL- 12, demonstrable at the protein and mRNA levels. CT had no inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide/IFN-γ-induced IL- 12 mRNA expression or IL- 12 production. Furthermore, adjuvanticity of CT was unaffected in IL- 12 -deficient mice, while OVA-ISCOM showed partly impaired adjuvant effects {{by the lack of}} IL- 12. CT abrogated the induction of oral tolerance stimulated by antigen feeding in these mice. In addition, CT did not alter TGF-β levels, suggesting that the immunomodulating effect of CT was independent of IL- 12 as well as TGF-β production. Taken together, these findings indicate that mucosal adjuvanticity of CT and ISCOM are differently dependent on IL- 12, suggesting that separate and distinct antigen-processing pathways are involved...|$|R

Although all immunized cats developed antibodies against the envelope protein, only the cats vaccinated with the rVV-expressed envelope glycoproteins developed antibodies which neutralized FIV infection of Crandell feline kidney cells.

Two weeks after challenge the cell-associated viral load proved to be significantly higher in the cats immunized with vGR 657 and vGR 657 x 15 than in the other cats. The cats immunized with vGR 657 and vGR 657 x 15 also developed antibodies against the Gag proteins more rapidly than the cats immunized with beta-Galactosidase-Env or the control cats.

To test the safety and efficacy of adjuvants in neonatal mice, we injected hRSV surface proteins combined with <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMs) prepared from fractions A, C or A + C of Quillaja saponins. All were well tolerated in adults, but A + C ISCOMS proved lethal in neonates; A or C fractions alone were well tolerated by neonates up to the adult dose. hRSV-ISCOM A induced antibody responses similar to combined fractions, and potent in vitro cytotoxic T cell responses. Adult-like in vitro cytotoxicity against hRSV-infected targets and precursor cytotoxic T cell frequencies were observed within one week of neonatal priming and hRSV-ISCOM A-primed neonates showed virtually complete protection against subsequent viral challenge. hRSV challenge was associated with some pulmonary eosinophilia in both age groups, with higher IL- 4 production by lung CD 4 + T cells in mice primed as neonates. This was, however, accompanied by only minor (approximately 10 %) and transient illness and weight loss.

Splenic macrophages were removed by intravenous injection with clodronate liposomes. beta-propiolacton inactivated rabies virus (RV-BPL) and <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (iscom) containing these antigens were given to macrophage-depleted and control mice. In the absence of phagocytic cells in the spleen, antigen is still trapped in the red pulp {{and to a lesser}} extent in the peri-arteriolar lymphocyte sheaths (PALS) for both antigen formulations. The localization pattern in the main area of immune response induction, namely the follicles, was unaltered after macrophage depletion. Functionally, the depletion of splenic and liver macrophages had no influence on the induction of specific antibody responses in both RV-BPL or RV-iscom immunized mice, even though the latter presentation form was clearly associated with specific localization in the marginal metallophillic macrophages. In RV-BPL immunized mice, macrophage depletion had no influence on proliferative T-cell responses. However, macrophage-depleted mice that were immunized with RV-iscom showed a significant decrease in proliferative T-cell responses. These results confirm existing ideas on the spleen as a physical filter rather than an induction site for humoral responses and shed new light on the efficient role of iscoms as antigen-presenting moieties in relation to their specific in vivo localization patterns and partial macrophage dependency...|$|R

However, their mode of action is unclear and to define better the cellular interactions involved we have studied the ability of ISCOMS containing ovalbumin (OVA) to prime TCR transgenic CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cells in vivo. Immunization with OVA ISCOMS caused activation and clonal expansion of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells in the T cell areas of the draining lymph nodes, followed by the migration of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells into the B cell follicle. The T cells were primed to proliferate and secrete IFN‐γ after re‐stimulation in vitro with the appropriate OVA peptide and CD 8 + T cell priming occurred in the absence of CD 4 + T cells. Increasing the number of dendritic cells (DC) in vivo with flt 3 ligand augmented the expansion and activation of the OVA‐specific T cells, particularly CD 8 + T cells.

The adjuvants and saline were combined with three weak immunogens (a synthetic peptide, a self antigen and a particulate antigen) and given by three different routes (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and dorsal in the foot). The evaluation was based on clinical observations, behavioural studies, pathological lesions and capacity to support immunological responses to weak immunogens. Lesions were most severe after injection of antigen combined with Freund's adjuvant or Quil A, mild to moderate with Specol and minimal with Lactobacillus, iscom conjugates or saline. Despite pathological changes, no signs of prolonged pain or distress could be demonstrated based on clinical observations and behavioural studies. Minimal immunological responses were found after injection of antigen in combination with saline or Lactobacillus. T-cell activation and high antibody responses were found after injection of antigen-iscom conjugates or antigen in Freund's adjuvant emulsions. After Specol/antigen immunisations T-cell activation was demonstrated and high antibody titres were found except for Specol/self antigen immunisations.

Responses {{were seen in}} B cells directly after preparation (5 – 8 % of cells responding) but were enhanced if the cells were cultured overnight {{in the presence of}} interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) before testing (10 – 12 % of cells responding). Checkerboard filter assays suggested that the response to OVA was chemotactic. The response was antigen specific since cells from OVA-immunized mice did not respond to bovine serum albumin (BSA), and cells from BSA-immunized mice responded to BSA but not to OVA. The response to OVA was inhibited by preincubation of OVA with anti-OVA but not with anti-BSA. Many of the cells that polarized in response to antigen were larger than any B cells found in control populations suggesting that the responsive cells are those that had been stimulated to enter cell cycle following immunization...|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} {{of effective}} cellular and humoral immune responses against protein antigens is of major importance in vaccination strategies against infectious diseases and cancer. Immunization with protein alone in general does {{not result in}} efficient induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and antibody responses. Numerous other immunization strategies have been explored. In this review we will discuss a number of lipid-based antigen delivery systems suitable for the induction of CTL responses. These systems comprise reconstituted virus envelopes (virosomes), liposomes, and <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMs). We will concentrate on delivery of the protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) since extensive studies with this antigen have been performed {{for all of the}} systems discussed, allowing direct comparison of antigen delivery efficiency. Stimulation of CTL activity requires processing of the antigen in the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and presentation of antigenic peptides on surface major histocompatibility class I complexes (MHC class I). In vitro, the ability of antigen delivery systems to induce MHC class I presentation indeed correlates with their capacity to deliver antigen to the cytosol of cells. This capacity appears to be less important for the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vivo. Instead, other properties of the antigen delivery system like activation of APCs and induction of T helper cells play a more prominent role. Fusion-active virosomes appear to be a very potent system for induction of CTL activity, most likely since virosomes combine efficient delivery of antigen with general stimulation of the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Natural human {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) {{infection is}} characterized by a strain-specific neutralizing antibody response. This is particularly relevant in clinical settings such as transplantation and pregnancy where reinfection with heterologous strains occurs and the immune system does not mount an effective response against the infecting strain due to underlying immunosuppression. There is an emerging argument that a CMV vaccine that induces high titres of cross-neutralizing antibodies will be more effective in protecting individuals from infection with antigenically different CMV strains. In addition, induction of cell-mediated immunity offers the additional advantage of targeting virus-infected cells. This study presents a novel formulation of a CMV vaccine that, by combining recombinant soluble gB protein with a Toll-like receptor 9 agonist (CpG ODN 1826) and <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (AbISCO 100), was able to elicit strong polyfunctional CMV-specific cellular and cross-neutralizing humoral immune responses. These data demonstrated that prime-boost immunization of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A 2 mice with gB protein in combination with CpG ODN 1826 and AbISCO 100 induced long-lasting CMV-specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell and humoral responses. Furthermore, these responses neutralized infection with multiple strains of CMV expressing different gB genotypes and afforded protection against challenge with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the gB protein. These observations argue that this novel vaccine strategy, if applied to humans, should facilitate the generation of a robust, pluripotent immune response, which may be more effective in preventing infection with multiple strains of CMV.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} novel kind of <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMs) on human skin penetration of model compounds in vitro to evaluate their potential as a delivery system, ultimately for transcutaneous vaccination. Special focus was on elucidating the mechanisms of penetration. Preparation of ISCOMs was done by dialysis and subsequent purification in a sucrose density gradient. The penetration pathways of acridine-labeled ISCOMs were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the ultrastructural changes in the skin after application of the ISCOMs with or without hydration. Transcutaneous permeation of the model compound, methyl nicotinate, was evaluated in diffusion cells. The prepared ISCOMs were 42 – 52  nm in diameter as evaluated by dynamic light scattering with zeta potentials of − 33 to − 26. 1  mV. TEM investigations verified the presence of ISCOM structures. Penetration of acridine into skin was greatly increased by incorporation into ISCOMs as visualized by CLSM. Permeation of methyl nicotinate was enhanced in the presence of ISCOMs. Ultrastructural changes of the intercellular space in the stratum corneum after exposure of ISCOMs were observed on micrographs, especially for hydrated skin. In conclusion, cutaneous application of ISCOMs leads to increased penetration of hydrophobic model compounds through human stratum corneum and thus shows potential as a transcutaneous delivery system. The increased penetration seems to be reflected by a change in the intercellular space between the corneocytes, and the effect is most likely caused by the components of the ISCOMs rather than intact ISCOMs...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of subunit vaccines requires {{the use of}} adjuvants that act by stimulating components of the innate immune response. <b>Immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMS) containing the saponin adjuvant Quil A are potential vaccine vectors that induce a wide range of Ag-specific responses in vivo encompassing both humoral and CD 4 and CD 8 cell-mediated immune responses. ISCOMS are active by both parenteral and mucosal routes, but the basis for their adjuvant properties is unknown. Here we have investigated the ability of ISCOMS to recruit and activate innate immune responses as measured in peritoneal exudate cells. The i. p. injection of ISCOMS induced intense local inflammation, with early recruitment of neutrophils and mast cells followed by macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. Many of the recruited cells had phenotypic evidence of activation and secreted a number of inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide, reactive oxygen intermediates, IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 12, and IFN-γ. Of the factors that we investigated further only IL- 12 appeared to be essential for the immunogenicity of ISCOMS, as IL- 6 - and inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout (KO) mice developed normal immune responses to OVA in ISCOMS, whereas these responses were markedly reduced in IL- 12 KO mice. The recruitment of peritoneal exudate cells following an injection of ISCOMS was impaired in IL- 12 KO mice, indicating a role for IL- 12 in establishing the proinflammatory cascade. Thus, ISCOMS prime Ag-specific immune responses at least in part by activating IL- 12 -dependent aspects of the innate immune system...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of each of the}} two surface glycoproteins of measles virus in active and passive immunization was examined in mice. Infected-cell lysates were depleted of either the hemagglutinin (H) or fusion (F) glycoprotein by using multiple cycles of immunoaffinity chromatography. The products were used to prepare <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (iscoms) containing either F or H glycoprotein. Such complexes are highly immunogenic, possibly as a result of effective presentation of viral proteins to the immune system [B. Morein, B. Sundquist, S. Höglund, K. Dalsgaard, and A. Osterhaus, Nature (London) 308 : 457 - 460, 1984]. Groups of 3 -week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with the iscom preparations. All animals developed hemolysis-inhibiting antibodies, whereas only sera of animals immunized with the iscoms containing the H glycoprotein had hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies. Sera from animals immunized with the H or F preparation only precipitated the homologous glycoprotein in radioimmune precipitation assays. The immunized animals were challenged with a lethal dose of the hamster neurotropic variant of measles virus. Of the 7 -week-old animals in the nonimmunized control group, 50 % died within 10 days after challenge. No animals in the immunized groups showed symptoms of disease throughout the observation period of 3 months. Passive administration of anti-H monoclonal antibodies gave full protection against the 100 % lethal acute infection with the hamster neurotropic variant of measles virus in newborn mice, whereas anti-F monoclonal antibodies failed to protect the animals. This study emphasizes that both H and F glycoproteins need to be considered in the development of measles virus subunit vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of T-helper immune responses {{generated in}} 16 mature outbred rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) within a 10 -month period by three different {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) vaccine strategies were compared. Immune responses to monomeric recombinant gp 120 SF 2 (rgp 120) when the protein was expressed in vivo by DNA immunization or when it was delivered as a subunit protein vaccine formulated either with the MF 59 adjuvant or by incorporation into <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> (ISCOMs) were compared. Virus-neutralizing antibodies (NA) against HIV- 1 SF 2 reached similar titers in the two rgp 120 SF 2 protein-immunized groups, but the responses showed different kinetics, while NA were delayed and their levels were low in the DNA-immunized animals. Antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ) T-helper (type 1 -like) responses were detected in the DNA-immunized group, but only after the fourth immunization, and the rgp 120 /MF 59 group generated both IFN-γ and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) (type 2 -like) responses that appeared after the third immunization. In contrast, rgp 120 /ISCOM-immunized animals rapidly developed marked IL- 2, IFN-γ (type 1 -like), and IL- 4 responses that peaked after the second immunization. To determine which type of immune responses correlated with protection from infection, all animals were challenged intravenously with 50 50 % infective doses of a rhesus cell-propagated, in vivo-titrated stock of a chimeric simian immunodeficiency virus-HIVSF 13 construct. Protection was observed {{in the two groups}} receiving the rgp 120 subunit vaccines. Half of the animals in the ISCOM group were completely protected from infection. In other subunit vaccinees there was evidence by multiple assays that virus detected at 2 weeks postchallenge was effectively cleared. Early induction of potent type 1 - as well as type 2 -like T-helper responses induced the most-effective immunity...|$|R
40|$|Vier typen {{adjuvant}}ia zijn geevalueerd als alternatief voor het gebruik van Freund's compleet adjuvant in muizen. De volgende adjuvantia zijn geevalueerd: een water-in-olie emulsie (Specol), een micro-organisme (Lactobacillus), een immuunstimulerend complex met ingebouwd glycoproteine van {{rabies virus}} (RV-iscoms) en een saponine. Quil A. De adjuvantia en controle groepen (fysiologisch zout) zijn gecombineerd met drie zwak immunogene antigenen (een synthetisch antigeen, een autoantigeen en een deeltjes antigeen) en ingespoten via drie routes (intraperitoniaal, subcutaan en op de dorsale zijde van de achterpoot. De evaluatie is gebaseerd op klinische oobservaties, gedragsstudies, pathologische bevindingen en immunostimulatie. Lesies zijn het ernstigst na inspuiten van antigeen in Freund's adjuvant of Quil A, gering tot matig in combinatie met Specol en minimaal na Lactobacillus, RV-iscoms of fysiologisch zout. Ondanks de ernstige pathologische veranderingen, konden geen signalen van blijvende pijn of ongerief bij de dieren worden aangetoond aan de hand van klinische bevindingen en gedragsstudies. De immuunresponsen zijn zeer laag na inspuiten van antigeen in combinatie met fysiologisch zout of Lactobacillus. T-cel activatie en hoge antilichaam responsen zijn gevonden na inspuiten van antigeen/RV-iscoms conjugaten en na inspuiten van antigeen/Freund's adjuvant emulsies. T-cel activatie is aangetoond na inspuiten van antigeen/Specol emulsies en antilichaam responsen zijn hoog behalve na inspuiten van Specol in combinatie met autoantigeen. de gevonden resultaten suggereren dat Specol een mogelijk alternatief is voor Freund's compleet adjuvant voor de inductie van een immuunrespons tegen zwak immunogene antigenen behalve tegen autoantigenen, hiervoor lijkt RV-iscom een geschikt alternatief adjuvant. Four types of adjuvants were evaluated as {{alternative to the}} use of Freund's complete adjuvant in mice. The evaluation was based on clinical observations, behavioural and physiological state, gross and histo-pathological lesions and capacity to support immunological responses to weak immunogens. The adjuvants included water-in-oil emulsion containing Mycobacteria (Freund's complete adjuvant; substituted for Freund's incomplete adjuvant in booster immunization), a water-in-oil emulsion (Specol), a micro-organism (Lactobacillus), preformed <b>immune-stimulating</b> <b>complexes</b> containing rabies virus glycoprotein and a saponin, Quil A. The adjuvants were combined with three types of weak immunogens including: a synthetic peptide, an 'auto'antigen (myelin basic protein) and a particulate antigen (inactivated Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Each adjuvant/antigen preparation was injected (primary and booster) either intraperitoneally (i. p.), subcutaneously in the neck or groin (s. c.) or subcutaneously at the dorsal side of the hind feet. The injection of adjuvant/antigen preparations resulted in most severe pathological lesions, including granulomatous peritonitis and tissue necrosis, after administration of Freund's adjuvant/antigen or Quil A/antigen mixtures. Injection of Specol/antigen had mild to moderate inflammatory effects, while injection of Lactobacillus/antigen or antigen-iscom conjugates caused minimal side effects. Lesions were most frequently seen after injection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae preparations where i. p. injection resulted in relatively severe pathological changes as compared to s. c. injection. Despite these pathological changes, no signs of prolonged pain or distress could be demonstrated based on clinical observations and physiological and behavioural parameters. Minimal antibody responses and T-cell activation were found after injection of antigen in combination with saline or Lactobacillus. T-cell activation and high antibody responses were found after injection of antigen-iscom conjugates or antigen in Freund's adjuvant emulsions. T-cell activation was demonstrated after Specol/antigen immunizations and high antibody titers were found except for Specol/'auto'antigen immunizations. In studying adjuvant activity the influence of type of antigen, on side effects and immune response, should be taken into account. Despite severe inflammatory lesions found at necropsy after injection of Freund's adjuvant/antigen no prolonged signs of pain and distress could be detected. Presented data suggest that Specol is a possible alternative to Freund's complete adjuvant for the induction of an immune response against weak immunogens except possibly autoantigens, for which preformed iscoms seem very well suitable...|$|R
