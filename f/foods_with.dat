Other major employers include Bell Helicopter Textron, Owens-Corning, and ASARCO.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part {{as a means to}} make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible. People that worked away from home for significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other <b>foods</b> <b>with</b> them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E
50|$|Rodents {{share common}} species-typical feeding {{behaviors}} (also known as order-typical, since all these creatures {{are members of}} the same order, rodentia. For example, certain types of beavers, squirrels, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and prairie dogs all locate food by sniffing for it, grasp for <b>food</b> <b>with</b> their mouths, sit on their hindquarters to eat, and grasp/manipulate the <b>food</b> <b>with</b> their hands. But they each also have more unique feeding behaviors. For example, beavers do grasp for <b>food</b> <b>with</b> their mouths, but sometimes they use a single paw instead. And many of the rodents manipulate the <b>food</b> <b>with</b> their digits in unique ways.|$|R

5|$|Adequate {{potassium}} intake {{is achieved}} by eating a variety of foods. Potassium is present in all fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. <b>Foods</b> <b>with</b> high potassium concentrations include yam, parsley, dried apricots, milk, chocolate, all nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), potatoes, bamboo shoots, bananas, avocados, coconut water, soybeans, and bran. Dried apricots have the highest concentration of potassium by weight of any food. Many processed foods contain no potassium.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make <b>foods</b> <b>with</b> desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, <b>foods</b> <b>with</b> an abundance of chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from <b>foods</b> <b>with</b> chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into {{the structure of a}} tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate adolescents' tendency to associate healthy <b>food</b> <b>with</b> family and junk <b>food</b> <b>with</b> friends, at both an explicit and implicit level. Study 2 also explored whether family and peer influences on food attitudes and consumption can be exerted through these mere associations, testing the moderating effect of social identity. Overall, results confirmed that our participants tended to associate healthy <b>food</b> <b>with</b> family and junk <b>food</b> <b>with</b> friends, both deliberatively (at the explicit level) and automatically (at the implicit level). In addition, these mere associations predicted food consumption frequency, either directly (fruit-family) or indirectly through attitude (snacks-friends), for participants highly identified with the corresponding reference group. The present research contributes to {{a deeper understanding of}} the social meaning of food by focusing on the associations of different <b>food</b> types <b>with</b> different social contexts and provides suggestions for improving health education and prevention programs...|$|R

5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing <b>foods</b> <b>with</b> ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included seafood, chicken, root vegetable, berries, and corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E

5|$|In modern medicine, {{around a}} quarter of the drugs {{prescribed}} to patients are derived from medicinal plants, and they are rigorously tested. In other systems of medicine, medicinal plants may constitute the majority of what are often informal attempted treatments, not tested scientifically. Medicinal plant use ranges from the mainstream, where some of the drugs used are derived from plants, to traditional medicine where plants form the bulk of the substances administered. The World Health Organization estimates, without reliable data, that some 80 percent of the world's population depends mainly on traditional medicine (including but not limited to plants); perhaps some two billion people are largely reliant on medicinal plants. The use of plant-based materials including herbal remedies and so-called nutraceuticals, <b>foods</b> <b>with</b> supposed health benefits, is increasing quickly in developed countries. This brings attendant risks of toxicity and other effects on human health, despite the safe image of herbal remedies. Herbal medicines have been in use since long before modern medicine existed; there was and often still is little or no knowledge of the pharmacological basis of their actions, if any, or of their safety. The World Health Organization formulated a policy on traditional medicine in 1991, and since then has published guidelines for them, with a series of monographs on widely used herbal medicines.|$|E
