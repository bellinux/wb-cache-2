Indeed, despite numerous Treaty reforms and several enlargements, this control is still governed by the same principles. First, I have tried to analyse the different mechanisms to control this application: <b>ex-ante</b> <b>mechanism</b> such as the notification Directive (98 / 34 /EC), ex-post mechanism such as infringement actions and hybrid mechanism such as Solvit. Second, I have proposed several ideas {{in order to improve}} the current situation. One of the main arguments is to suggest a new mechanism able to deal with the lack of transposition of Directives. Furthermore other aspects are explored such as the necessity to include the European Parliament in the control of the application of European law. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a voting}} model where (i) {{there is no}} conflict of interest among the voters, and (ii) information acquisition is costly and unobservable. The optimal mechanism is shown to be sequential. The social planner asks, at random, one voter {{at a time to}} invest in information and to report the resulting signal. Voters are informed of neither their position in the sequence nor the reports of previous voters. Obeying the planner by investing and reporting truthfully is optimal for voters. The ex-ante optimal voting scheme among the ex-post efficient ones is characterized. In this scheme, the social planner stops aggregating information and makes a decision when the precision of his posterior exceeds a cut-off which decreases with each additional report.

40|$|I {{examine a}} {{situation}} where a firm chooses to locate a new factory in one of several jurisdictions.

This competition may take the form of expenditures already incurred on infrastructure, commitments to spend on infrastructure, tax incentives or even cash payments. The model combines two elements that are usually considered separately; competition is desirable because we want the factory to be located in the jurisdiction that values it the most, but competition in itself is wasteful. I show that the expected total amount paid to the firm under a large family of arrangements is the same. Moreover, I show that the <b>ex-ante</b> optimal <b>mechanism</b> - that is, the mechanism that guarantees that the firm chooses the jurisdiction with the highest value for the factory, minimizes the total expected payment to the firm, and balances the budget in an ex-ante sense - can be implemented by running a standard auction and subsidizing participation. ...|$|R

40|$|O artigo examina o papel dos grupos de interesse dos empresários e dos trabalhadores na formação da posição oficial brasileira para a III Conferência Ministerial da OMC, em Seattle, em 1999. Argumenta-se que esse desempenho deve ser explicado considerando-se a influência de dois fatores: a internacionalização da economia a partir da década de 90 - que tornou a sociedade mais permeável ao ambiente externo - e as estruturas domésticas - que filtraram as preferências das organizações representativas do setor privado. Por um lado, a liberalização econômica e o desenvolvimento de um sistema de regulação internacional do comércio mais interventor desencadearam a mobilização dos grupos de interesse; por outro, a formulação do posicionamento do país esteve concentrada no Executivo, onde vínculos entre o setor empresarial e a burocracia governamental constituíram-se, contribuindo para a convergência de suas preferências. As centrais sindicais, por sua vez, agiram via alianças transnacionais, e suas preferências - divergentes das do empresariado e do governo - não estiveram presentes na posição negociadora do país. Estes resultados indicam que as estruturas domésticas para as negociações multilaterais de comércio na OMC não foram inclusivas. O artigo conclui ressaltando que a participação maior do Congresso nesse processo, por meio de mecanismos ex-ante, poderá contribuir para aumentar a representatividade da posição brasileira bem como a sua credibilidade externa. The article {{shows the}} role that {{business}} interest group and worker unions had in building up the Brazilian position for the Third Ministerial Summit of WTO, in Seattle, 1999. It argues that that role should be explained by considering two factors: the internationalization of Brazilian economy since the 90 's - making the society {{more sensitive to the}} events developing in the external environment - and the domestic political structures - filtering the preferences of the representative organizations of the private sector. On one hand, the economic liberalization {{and the development of a}} more interventionist system of international trade regulation prompted the mobilization of the interest groups; on the other hand, the formulation of Brazilian position was concentrated in the Executive branch where ties between the business sector and the governmental bureaucracy were set up helping for the convergence of their preferences. The worker unions acted through transnational coalitions and their preferences were not included in the country negotiation position. These findings point out that the domestic structures for multilateral trade negotiations were not inclusive.

40|$|In this thesis, I study {{mechanism}} design {{problems in}} environments where the information {{necessary to make}} decisions {{is affected by the}} actions of principal or agents. ^ The first chapter considers the problem of a principal who must allocate a good among a finite number of agents, each of whom values the good. Each agent has private information about the principal 2 ̆ 7 s payoff if he receives the good. There are no monetary transfers. The principal can inspect agents 2 ̆ 7 reports at a cost and punish them, but punishments are limited because verification is imperfect or information arrives only after the good has been allocated for a while. I characterize an optimal mechanism featuring two thresholds. Agents whose values are below the lower threshold and above the upper threshold are pooled, respectively. If the number of agents is small, then the pooling area at the top of value distribution disappears. If the number of agents is large, then the two pooling areas meet and the optimal mechanism can be implemented via a shortlisting procedure. The fact that the optimal mechanism depends on the number of agents implies that small and large organizations should behave differently. ^ The second chapter considers the problem of a principal who wishes to distribute an indivisible good to a population of budget-constrained agents. Both valuation and budget are an agent 2 ̆ 7 s private information. The principal can inspect an agent 2 ̆ 7 s budget through a costly verification process and punish an agent who makes a false statement. I characterize the direct surplus-maximizing mechanism. This direct mechanism can be implemented by a two-stage mechanism in which agents only report their budgets. Specifically, all agents report their budgets in the first stage. The principal then provides budget-dependent cash subsidies to agents and assigns the goods randomly (with uniform probability) at budget-dependent prices. In the second stage, a resale market opens, but is regulated with budget-dependent sales taxes. Agents who report low budgets receive more subsidies in their initial purchases (the first stage), face higher taxes in the resale market (the second stage) and are inspected randomly. This implementation exhibits some of the features of some welfare programs, such as Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s housing and development board. ^ The third chapter studies the design of <b>ex-ante</b> efficient <b>mechanisms</b> in situations where a single item is for sale, and agents have positively interdependent values and can covertly acquire information at a cost before participating in a mechanism. I find that when interdependency is low or the number of agents is large, the ex-post efficient <b>mechanism</b> is also <b>ex-ante</b> efficient. In cases of high interdependency or a small number of agents, <b>ex-ante</b> efficient <b>mechanisms</b> discourage agents from acquiring excessive information by introducing randomization to the ex-post efficient allocation rule in areas where the information 2 ̆ 7 s precision increases most rapidly. ...|$|R

However, we do find evidence that ganyu is used as an ex-post coping strategy in the event of shocks, and as an <b>ex-ante</b> social insurance <b>mechanism.</b> Moreover, we generally find a positive reaction of ganyu supply to an increase in the ganyu wages, and no evidence of any backward bending segment of the supply curve for households close to the subsistence level. While ganyu does not appear to drive poor households into further destitution, these households do seem to suffer the most when they face demand side constraints in times of greatest needs.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze various effects of informational constraints. In {{chapters}} 1 and 2 we consider a robust model of bilateral trade where traders have private reservation values and utility functions are common knowledge. In chapter 1 we study direct-revelation mechanisms. Under incentive and participation constraints, we define the notion of ex-post constrained efficiency, which {{does not depend on}} the distribution of types. Given ex-post incentive and participation constraints, a sufficient condition for constrained efficiency is simplicity: the outcome is a lottery between trade at one type-contingent price and no trade. For constant-relative-risk-aversion environments, we characterize simple mechanisms. Under risk neutrality they are equivalent to probability distributions over posted prices. Generically, simple mechanisms converge to full efficiency as agents' risk aversion goes to infinity. Under risk neutrality, <b>ex-ante</b> optimal <b>mechanisms</b> are deterministic, and under risk aversion, they are not. In chapter 2 we address indirect implementation. We define Mediated Bargaining Game-a continuous-time double auction with a hidden order book. It is the optimal bargaining game in the sense that its ex-post Nash equilibria in weakly undominated strategies constitute the Pareto-optimal frontier of the set of all ex-post Nash equilibria of all bargaining games. In Mediated Bargaining Game, type-monotone Bayesian equilibria coincide with ex-post Nash equilibria. The inefficiency due to incomplete information is manifested through delay. In contrast with the direct revelation mechanisms, in Mediated Bargaining Game the mechanism designer does not need to know the agents' risk attitudes. Informational constraints may also be a result of agents' subjective knowledge of the economic situation. In chapter 3 we study normal-form games, where each player may be aware of a subset of the set of possible actions, and has a set of possible awareness architectures. Awareness architecture is given by agents' perceptions, and an infinite regress of conjectures about others. Awareness equilibrium is a steady state where neither actions nor awareness architectures can change. We provide conditions under which awareness equilibria exists and study a parametrization of the set of possible awareness architectures...|$|R
40|$|The US deposit {{insurance}} system (managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – FDIC) {{has been established}} in 1933 {{to ensure the safety of}} deposited money and the overall stability of the banking sector. Although over decades the system proved to be successful in accomplishing those goals, there were some discussions and efforts in the 2000 s to reform it further. And indeed, it was reformed twice – in 2005 - 2007 and 2008 - 2009. But there was a fundamental difference between those reforms: the former had been carried out at a time of very good economic and financial conditions (strong economic growth, wealthy banking system, etc.) while the latter was prompted by a serious crisis situation (similarly like the reforms following the 1920 - 30 s and 1980 - 90 s crises). The paper is mostly related to the United States. It first outlines the main features of the US {{deposit insurance}} system prior to the recent reforms. Then, the paper presents the reasons and results of the 2005 - 2007 reform of the deposit insurance system in the United States. The results are relating to merging the former insurance funds into a new one, providing the FDIC with greater flexibility in managing the fund and in setting risk-based premiums, maintaining the standard coverage limit at $ 100, 000 but increasing the coverage limit for retirement accounts to $ 250, 000, and indexing both to inflation, etc. Next, the paper presents the 2008 - 2009 reform that was prompted by the aggravation of the current financial crisis (which had been started by the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2007). It discusses two main elements of this reform, i. e. temporary increasing the standard coverage limit to $ 250, 000 and the restoration plan in order to restore the fund’s reserve ratio to the required level. Moreover, the paper discusses some potential changes to the US deposit insurance system that could be implemented in the future – suggesting that, even after the recent reforms, there is still some room for further reforming the system. Finally, there is also a chapter relating to the European Union. In 2005 - 2006, the EU conducted the review of the directive on deposit guarantee schemes (adopted in 1994), but it concluded that there was no need to amend it. The financial turmoil, which started in the US and had serious impact in Europe in 2007 and 2008, caused much more urgency to reforming the EU deposit guarantee schemes. Thus, the paper presents the recent amendments to the directive (proposed in October 2008 and finally adopted in March 2009) that had been prompted by the aggravation of the current global financial crisis (in September 2008), as well as some potential changes to be discussed in the near future. It discusses the following issues: increasing coverage levels to € 50, 000 and € 100, 000, abandoning co-insurance, speeding up payouts, risk-based premiums, funding mechanisms, a pan-EU deposit guarantee scheme, potential roles of deposit insurers in early intervention and bank resolution, depositor awareness and literacy, etc. The paper includes some recommendations for the EU (e. g. € 100, 000, € 200, 000, and € 500, 000 as fixed harmonized levels for standard deposits, retirement accounts, and temporary high balances respectively) based on the recent reforms of the US deposit insurance system (as well as some solutions adopted or proposed recently in the UK).

40|$|Exogenous shocks {{resulting}} from the death of household members, changing agroclimatic conditions and financial loss can have both short-term as well as lingering effects on households. Many poor households in developing countries cope with these shocks through the out-migration of family members. Migration and remittances can serve to smooth consumption for households affected by adverse shocks as well as overcome liquidity constraints in order to finance long-term human and physical capital investments. The inflow of remittances from international (external) migration and their potential development impacts has {{captured the attention of}} researchers for some time. This {{is due in part to}} the sheer magnitude of these financial flows, which has dwarfed official development assistance in many cases (Maimbo and Ratha, 2005). While domestic (internal) seasonal migration is also an important livelihood strategy, the short and long-term impact of remittance flows from this channel has received less attention in recent research, particularly in Africa. Several recent studies have investigated the determinants and effects of migration and remittances (M&R) in Africa (Azam and Gubert, 2005; Gubert, 2002; Dillon et al., 2010). Harrower and Hoddinot (2005) use data from northern Mali to test both the responsiveness of self-reported household coping mechanisms (including migration) to idiosyncratic shocks as well as the full-insurance hypothesis put forth by Townsend (1995). In this context, full insurance implies that household-level consumption should be perfectly correlated with aggregate consumption in the village (or other co-insurance group) but uncorrelated with household-level fluctuations in income. These studies conclude that the decisions to migrate and remit are indeed responsive to household risk and shocks. Azam and Gubert (2005) use household-level data from Western Mali, with a long history international migration to Europe, to test for moral hazard on the part of households “left behind”. They find that the more households are insured by migrants’ remittances, the less incentive those households have to work. This study uses six periods of panel survey data spanning a decade (1996 - 1998 and 2005 - 2006) on approximately 250 households in the arid Zone Lacustre (ZL) of Northern Mali. Households in the ZL rely primarily on rain-fed cereal production for their livelihood. Our objective is to evaluate both the short-run and persistent effects of migration and remittances— which are hypothesized to contribute to both inter-temporal consumption smoothing and human and physical capital investment. This study expands upon the previous studies outlined above, but makes several important distinctions that help to improve our understanding of the impacts of M&R in Africa. First, M&R decisions are both <b>ex-ante</b> and ex-post <b>mechanisms</b> to cope with observable and unobservable household shocks and therefore endogenous within the context of Townsend’s (1995) full-insurance hypothesis test. We therefore pay close attention to the identification strategy of the parameters associated with these two key variables using an instrumental variable approach. Second, we recognize that households have different motivations for choosing seasonal versus long-term out-migration, and we estimate the different impacts of each. Third, there are several reasons why we might expect to find that M&R result in diminished consumption smoothing across time. For example, remittances may lead to increases in overall income (and expenditures) or changes in the basket of food and non-food items consumed through increased direct or indirect exposure to alternative consumption habits. Either of these are avenues through which households may shift away from their village co-insurance group. Thanks to the structure of our data, we are able to analyze on the one hand whether consumption-smoothing trends for several categories of goods (non-food, food, and cereals) are comparable both prior to and following migration. We are likewise interested in the potential explanations for diverging trends and go on to examine the effect of past migration on the level of consumption for those same categories of goods. This study uses three approaches to evaluate the effects of remittances on households in Northern Mali. First, in order to establish whether or not remittances are indeed responsive to household shocks, we first use both a linear and non-linear estimators to evaluate the responsiveness of remittances to current and lagged exogenous shocks (e. g. crop and livestock losses, household morbidity and mortality). Second, following Jalan and Ravallion (1998) we test the full-insurance hypothesis within a first-differenced framework. However, several of our key variables are endogenous to such a model potentially resulting in biased parameter estimates. We therefore adopt and an instrumental variable approach to identify the parameters associated with those key variables, with current and lagged environmental shocks, household size, seasonal rainfall variation and migrant network intensity as instruments for income, household size and migration duration respectively (deBrauw and Giles, 2008; Dillon et al., 2010; Munshi, 2003; Yang and Choi, 2007). The third component of the analysis uses a similar IV approach to investigate on the one hand whether there are diverging trends in consumption smoothing b and consumption levels, more generally, before and after migration. Preliminary econometric results suggest that the probability of migrants remitting increases for female-headed households as well as for households experiencing health and income (crop) shocks. The level of remittances received is higher for female-headed households, for households experiencing the death of a family member and with livestock losses during the hungry season. Once we control for the endogeneity of the key variables in consumption smoothing equation, migrant-sending households are more able to self-insure than those without migrants. Households with long-term migrants are able to self-insure to the greatest degree. These findings are reversed when we ignore the potential endogeneity of income, household composition and migration patterns. This is likely because these variables are correlated with unobservable factors such as ability on the one hand and households’ ability to modify their size and composition by sending members away during periods of distress. We find that the patterns of consumption smoothing as well as the levels of consumption before and following migration vary considerable across goods. This provides some evidence that the role of village-level insurance mechanisms vary for a given household depending on whether they participate in seasonal or long-term out-migration or not. The role of internal migration in the process of economic development in West Africa has received limited attention. In parts of Mali (namely the Kayes region) international out-migration is not just an important livelihood strategy, but in many cases, it is the livelihood strategy— thereby undermining the development of the local economy. This research demonstrates that remittances sent through internal migration (which constitutes the bulk of out-migration from the Zone Lacustre) are indeed responsive to exogenous household-level shocks. In addition, we find that M&R play a role in short-run smoothing consumption but that the persistent effects of these activities on both consumption smoothing and consumption levels are more important, particularly for households with low purchasing power.
