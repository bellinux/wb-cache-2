5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E

Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E
40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>radicals</b> {{have been}} {{suspected}} {{to play an}} important role in the pathogenicity of chronic pancreatitis.

After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded <b>Free</b> <b>Radical</b> Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios.|$|E
5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Free</b> <b>radicals</b> {{can cause}} tissue damage. In normal {{physiology}} the endogenous <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> {{produced in the}} body are neutralised by endogenous antioxidants. In inflammatory disease like RA <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> may perpetuate tissue damage. The review disscuss the possible role of antioxidants {{in the treatment of}} R...|$|R
5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> production during this time.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
40|$|Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) is a {{well-known}} spectroscopic and imaging technique that can detect <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> both in vitro and non-invasively in vivo, with high sensitivity. In food, <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> can be generated by several commonly used industrial processes, such as radiosterilization or heat treatment. EPR spectroscopy has been widely used to detect radioinduced <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> in food, but {{is limited to the}} measurement of the global response of a sample. EPR imaging (EPRI) allows the spin density distribution of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> to be mapped within objects. We investigated the possibility of acquiring 2 D and 3 D EPR images of the distribution of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> in various foodstuffs with naturally Occurring or induced <b>free</b> <b>radicals,</b> including frogs' legs, tea leaves, coffee beans, and sunflower seeds. Our results demonstrated that the <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> contained in foodstuffs give EPR signals with characteristics compatible with the acquisition of high-quality images. Small-size structures (e. g., frog bones, 1. 0 - 1. 5 nm width) Could be delineated with accuracy. The strongest signals came from irradiated samples, but. low-intensity signals from naturally occurring <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> Could also be imaged. EPRI is likely to be used When additional information is needed about the spatial distribution of impaired electrons. The method offers the unique ability to monitor the fate of these <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> in biological samples and in vivo...|$|R
25|$|Compounds {{known as}} <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> form when food is irradiated. Most {{of these are}} oxidizers (i.e., accept electrons) and some react very strongly. According to the free-radical theory of aging {{excessive}} amounts of these <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> can lead to cell injury and cell death, which may contribute to many diseases. However, this generally relates to the <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> generated in the body, not the <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> consumed by the individual, as much of these are destroyed in the digestive process.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFree {{radicals}} {{are essential for}} the vasopressin (AVP) response to plasmatic hyperosmolarity. Noradrenergic afferents are the major projections on the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus and stimulate the expression of AVP via a nitric oxide (NO) pathway. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms linking <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> and noradrenaline (NA) -induced regulation of AVP. Analysis of Tg 8 transgenic mice, invalidated for the monoamine oxidase-A gene and with consequently high levels of brain monoamines and AVP in the SON, showed that <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> are more abundant in their SON than in that of wild-type mice (WT). Antioxidant superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 and catalase enzyme activities were also higher in these mice than in WT. This may explain the observed absence of cytotoxicity {{that would otherwise be}} associated with such high level of <b>free</b> <b>radicals.</b> Treatment of Tg 8 mice with alpha-MPT, a blocking agent for NA synthesis, decreased both the production of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> and the AVP levels in the SON. Furthermore, incubation of ex vivo slices including the SON with NA increased the production of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> and AVP levels in wild-type mice. When NA was associated with alpha-lipoic acid, an antioxidant blocking the production of <b>free</b> <b>radicals,</b> AVP remained at its control level, indicating that <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> are required for the effect of NA on the expression of AVP. In slices incubated with SNP, a producer of NO, <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> and AVP levels increased. When NA was associated with L-NAME (a NO synthase blocker), the levels of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> and AVP were the same as in controls. Thus, the noradrenaline-NO pathway, which stimulates the expression of vasopressin, involves <b>free</b> <b>radicals.</b> This study provides further evidence of the physiological importance of <b>free</b> <b>radicals,</b> which should no longer be considered solely as cytotoxic factors...|$|R
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|After GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare began {{development}} of a spiritual successor titled Perfect Dark. Using an upgraded version of the GoldenEye 007 game engine, Perfect Dark was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. Although the game features a setting and storyline unrelated to James Bond, it shares many gameplay features, including a similar control scheme, mission objectives that vary with the difficulty setting, and cheat options unlockable through quick level completions. While Perfect Dark was still in development, Martin Hollis left Rare {{to work as a}} consultant {{on the development of the}} GameCube at Nintendo of America.

5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent}} of chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
30|$|<b>Free</b> <b>radicals</b> can {{be defined}} as the atoms, molecules, or ions with {{unpaired}} electrons in an open shell configuration. Sometimes, these <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> may bear some charge, either positive, negative, or zero.

Development of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> in the body is believed to involve in the development of various degenerative diseases; huge generation of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> particularly reactive oxygen species and their high activity may lead to progression of a number of pathological disturbances such as inflammation, atherosclerosis, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. This phenomenon of excessive production of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> is termed as oxidative stress. This oxidative stress has also been found to be implicated in many ailments such as heart disease and some age-related diseases. Thus, in a concise way, it can be said that excessive production of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> is harmful for the body.|$|R

5|$|As {{only one}} of the {{electrons}} can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone <b>free</b> <b>radical.</b> The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.|$|E

5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E
40|$|Enzymes which {{catalyze}} {{the formation}} of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> in vitro will catalyze similar reactions in vivo.
