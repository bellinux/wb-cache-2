Johnathan Thurston has scored the winning points on four occasions, more {{than anyone in the}} NRL. Clinton Schifcofske, Chris Sandow, Trent Hodkinson, Cooper Cronk, Josh Reynolds and Daly Cherry-Evans have each scored the winning points on three occasions. Todd Carney, Jarrod Sammut, Luke Burt, Luke Walsh, Darren Lockyer, Stacey Jones and Mitchell Pearce have also achieved the feat more than once.

5|$|Auburn Tigers – The Yellow Jackets <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Auburn University Tigers {{more than}} 90 times in {{football}}, and {{the series of}} football games {{between the two is}} the second-oldest in the Southeast. Auburn Univ. or A.P.I. is by far Georgia Tech's second-most-often played opponent in football. The rivalry is also intense in basketball, baseball, etc.|$|E
5|$|Outside Germany, they <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> most {{games in}} Faro, Portugal (10matches), and Guangzhou, China (six matches), the host {{cities of the}} annual Algarve Cup and the Four Nations Tournament respectively.

5|$|Although other {{recurring}} {{characters in}} the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the actors, the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven actors playing the role. Only two actors <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> part twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play the part in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey {{in one of the}} non-Eon films, Never Say Never Again.|$|E
5|$|Another former West End standby, Ashleigh Gray, {{took over}} as Elphaba for the tour's second {{contract}} run, making her the second actress after Davis-Jones to <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> role in both the West End and the UK touring production. Originally, Davis-Jones was due to leave in order {{to return to the}} London company and lead its cast, however, it was later announced that, towards the end of her run in August 2014 she had withdrawn from the tour and subsequently would not be appearing in the West End.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people too young to <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> games experience them; his son was only {{old enough to know}} the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, {{whose wife}} would <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> leading role, but {{her death in}} childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the NHL all require venues {{to perform}} both the Canadian and American {{national}} anthems at games that involve teams from both countries, with the away team's anthem being performed first, {{followed by the}} host country. Major League Baseball teams <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> song at games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the former Montreal Expos, and National Basketball Association teams do so for games involving the Toronto Raptors, and previously, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Major League Soccer has the anthem performed at matches involving Toronto FC, Montreal Impact, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC.|$|E
5|$|Since 1912 {{the teams}} <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> {{game at the}} Cotton Bowl stadium in Dallas, Texas, amid the {{atmosphere}} of the adjacent Texas State Fair. This is unusual because most college football games alternate between the opponents home stadiums. Dallas was chosen as the neutral site because it is approximately halfway between the two schools. The stadium is divided down the 50-yard line, with half of the stadium predominantly clad in the crimson and cream colors of Oklahoma, and the other half mostly wearing the burnt orange and white of Texas.|$|E
50|$|Becker died of {{a stroke}} in California {{at the end of}} 1968. His interment (and his wife's) was in Lone Tree Cemetery in Fairview, near Hayward. Some {{controversy}} emerged in 1984 when obituaries for the actor Prince Denis stated that he <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Mayor of Munchkinland. In reality, Denis <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Sergeant-at-Arms.|$|R

He <b>has</b> <b>played</b> harmonium with Pandit Ram Marathe, Pandit Suresh Haldankar, Pandit Kumar Gandharv.|$|R
50|$|Lon Chaney Jr. <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Wolf Man in {{all three}} of Universal's {{previous}} films about the character, and Glenn Strange <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Monster once before, in House of Frankenstein. John Carradine <b>had</b> also <b>played</b> Count Dracula once before, also in House of Frankenstein, {{and went on to}} <b>play</b> <b>the</b> part three more times, in Billy the Kid Versus Dracula (1966), Las vampiras (1969), and Nocturna (1979).|$|R
5|$|Some Schubert {{performers}} tend to {{play the}} entire trilogy of the last sonatas in a single recital, thereby stressing their interrelatedness, and suggesting that they form a single, complete cycle. However, since each of these sonatas is rather long (as compared, for instance, with most of Mozart's or Beethoven's sonatas), such a program may prove exhausting to some listeners. One of the solutions to this problem is to shorten the program by omitting repeats, mainly those of the opening movements' expositions (however, this practice is highly disputed, as noted above). The pioneers of the Schubert sonata performance, Schnabel and Erdmann, are known to <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> entire trilogy in one evening; more recently, so did Alfred Brendel, Maurizio Pollini, Mitsuko Uchida, and Paul Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise to a broader audience. They assumed most players would not <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> original Syndicate games. The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. Turning it into a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players.|$|E
5|$|They have a 77% {{winning record}} in test match rugby, {{and are the}} only {{international}} side with a winning record against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have lost to only six of the 19 nations they have played in test matches. Since {{the introduction of the}} World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. The All Blacks are statistically the best side to <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> game, and jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier one ranked nation.|$|E

5|$|Kenya gained ODI {{status in}} its own right {{following}} a strong performance in the 1996 World Cup, a competition they qualified for by gaining a second-placed finish in the 1994 ICC Trophy. The team's first ODI came against India in the 1996 World Cup, a competition for which Kenya was given temporary ODI status, with the team then playing four further matches in the competition. Kenya's first ODI win came in their fourth World Cup match against the West Indies. The Kenyans won the game by 73 runs but ultimately finished last in group A. Kenya have since qualified for four more Cricket World Cups. They reached the group stage in the 1999 competition, the 2007 competition and the 2011 competition. At the 2003 Cricket World Cup, partly hosted in Kenya, the Kenyan team finished second in their group and in doing so qualified for the Super Sixes stage. Kenya finished third in the Super Sixes stage and qualified for the semi-finals where they lost to India by 91 runs. The Kenyan team have played 154 ODI games with the most recent coming in 2014. Thomas Odoyo and Steve Tikolo <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> most ODIs for Kenya with 131 each. Tikolo has scored the most runs with 3369 for the team while Odoyo has taken the most wickets with 141.|$|E
5|$|Test cricket is {{the longest}} version of the sport of cricket. Test matches are played between {{international}} teams of eleven players each over four innings; each team bats twice. In the women's variant, the game is scheduled to last four days of play. The Women's Cricket Association was formed in England in 1926, and the first women's Test was played between England and Australia in 1934. The English team were {{on a tour of}} Australia and New Zealand, arranged by the WCA. The International Women's Cricket Council was formed in 1958 as the governing body for women's cricket. In 2005, women's cricket was brought under the International Cricket Council along with men's cricket; at that time 89 of the council's 104 members had started developing women's cricket. As of January 2016, a total of ten teams have played a total of 138 women's Test matches and 2 matches were abandoned. England <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> most matches (93) while Sri Lanka, Ireland and the Netherlands have played only one Test each.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people too young to <b>have</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> games experience them, as his son was only {{old enough to know}} the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E
