50|$|In 1986—whilst {{working for}} Monotype, Carpenter {{designed}} and developed his best known font, Calisto MT an old style serif. The Calisto face {{is intended to}} function as both a text and <b>display</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
50|$|Koch's first non-blackletter {{typeface}} was {{the delicate}} roman Koch-Antiqua, a <b>display</b> <b>face</b> {{with a low}} x-height. Its oblique features inline capitals in the larger sizes, an idea inspired by the traditions of blackletter capitals.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Monotype Modern, {{a nineteenth-century}} text face, next to Haas Clarendon Bold, a <b>display</b> <b>face.</b> Both fonts show classic nineteenth-century design features, for {{instance}} on the ‘Q’, ‘R’, ‘r’, ‘a’ and ‘c’. However, the Clarendon is much wider {{with a higher}} x-height, and contrast between thick and thin strokes has been reduced.|$|E
50|$|The Calisto face is {{intended}} to function as both a text and <b>display</b> <b>face.</b> Stroke contrast is minimal and maintenance of even color, especially in smaller point sizes, contributes to high legibility. Roman and italic characters are animated by serifs and terminals cut on an angle to the baseline, and a concave indent at the terminals reminiscent of Belwe and Palatino types. Minuscule characters have a somewhat large x-height.|$|E
5000|$|Griffith {{worked closely}} with the {{designers}} William Addison Dwiggins and Rudolph Ruzicka, whom he solicited to create typefaces for Mergenthaler. He developed the typeface Excelsior in 1931 and it was widely adopted as a text and <b>display</b> <b>face</b> for newspapers across the United States. While Griffith was head of typographic development, Linotype issued revivals of Baskerville, Granjon, and Janson. In 1938, Griffith designed the typeface Bell Gothic for the Bell Telephone Company's directories.|$|E

50|$|The Family {{category}} {{is replaced by}} Class and Genre, where Class indicates a font's language and character set, where Genre indicates text <b>faces,</b> <b>display</b> <b>faces,</b> symbol faces, and so on. PANOSE matching software is designed to match fonts with different Class, but same Genre. The same Genre can have different meaning in different Class, so the matching heuristic decides the closeness of fonts based on adjusted values based on Class, rather than raw PANOSE values within the fonts themselves.|$|R

5000|$|Broadway is a {{decorative}} typeface, perhaps the archetypal Art Deco typeface. The original face {{was designed by}} Morris Fuller Benton in 1927 for ATF as a capitals only <b>display</b> <b>face.</b> It had a long initial run of popularity, before being discontinued by ATF in 1954. It was re-discovered in the Cold Type Era and has ever since been used to evoke {{the feeling of the}} twenties and thirties. Several variants were made: ...|$|E
5000|$|Historically, it {{was normal}} for all Latin-alphabet serif fonts to have true italics, {{but in the}} late nineteenth century some [...] "sloped romans" [...] were created by European and American foundries, {{particularly}} for display type and headings. Notable typefaces in this style include Bookman Old Style in metal type (although not many recent versions), Linn Boyd Benton's [...] "self-spacing" [...] type and the Central Type Foundry's [...] "De Vinne" [...] wedge-serif <b>display</b> <b>face.</b> European examples included Genzsch Antiqua from Genzsch & Heyse.|$|E
5000|$|Berthold Block is a {{sans-serif}} typeface {{released by}} H. Berthold and intended for display use. Block has a chunky design suitable for headings, with short descenders allowing tight linespacing and rounded corners. It is sometimes simply called [...] "Block". Font design expert Stephen Coles {{describes it as}} [...] "a soft but substantial <b>display</b> <b>face</b> with compact dimensions and an organic appearance…it isn’t meant for body copy." [...] The Block design has been credited by the Klingspor Museum to Hermann Hoffmann, who managed type design for Berthold.|$|E

50|$|The Coat of Arms {{consisted}} of ten bars, five of azure {{and five of}} argent, representing the former ten counties (județe) of Greater Romania (71 in total in 1938) included in it, charged with or eagle wings <b>displayed</b> <b>facing</b> dexter with an or Latin cross in the beak (elements taken from Wallachia's historical coat of arms) standing over five peaks argent representing the Bucegi Mountains.|$|R
50|$|Early American and German radars {{used the}} J-scope, which resembled a {{circular}} {{version of the}} A-scope. These display range as an angle around the <b>display</b> <b>face,</b> {{as opposed to the}} linear distance along it. This arrangement allows greater accuracy in reading the range with the same sized display as an A-scope because the trace uses the full circumference rather than just the horizontal distance (so the time base is π times longer). An electro-mechanical version of the J-scope display remained common on consumer boating depth meters until recently.|$|E
50|$|If an LCD is {{subjected}} to physical shock, this could cause one or more TAB connections to fail inside the display. This failure is often caused by horizontally flexing the chassis (e.g., while wall-mounting or transporting a <b>display</b> <b>face</b> up/down) or simple failure of the adhesive holding the TAB against the glass. TAB faults require replacement of the LCD module itself. If these connections were to fail, the effect would be that an entire row or column of pixels would fail to activate. This causes a horizontal or vertical black line {{to appear on the}} display {{while the rest of the}} display would appear normal. The horizontal failure runs from edge-to-edge; the vertical failure runs from top-to-bottom.|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} serif fonts have true italic designs. In {{the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries, a number of type {{foundries}} such as American Type Founders and Genzsch & Heyse offered serif typefaces with oblique rather than italic designs, especially display typefaces but these designs (such as Genzsch Antiqua) have mostly disappeared. An exception is American Type Founders' Bookman, offered in some releases with the oblique of its metal type version. An unusual example of an oblique font from the inter-war period is the <b>display</b> <b>face</b> Koch Antiqua. With a partly-oblique lower case, it also makes the italic capitals inline in the style of blackletter capitals in the larger sizes of the metal type. It was developed by Rudolph Koch, a type designer who had previously specialised in to blackletter font design (which does not use italics); Walter Tracy described his design as [...] "uninhibited by the traditions of roman and italic".|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} with The Worlds scenery, real-world sequences are minimalist in their presentation. They <b>display</b> <b>faces</b> frequently obscured by shadows or hidden by extreme angles. The dialogue is not heard, but shown through title cards: when someone speaks the screen blacks {{out and a}} line of red or blue text appears with the dialogue. The combination of visual and acoustic noise makes reality appear as [...] "some kind of less authentic, alternate channel".|$|R

50|$|The King {{is sitting}} at Wellington's right as the Duke proposes a toast. The idea of {{choosing}} this moment is not by chance. Salter had a problem of composition as he had to deliver a good likeness of over eighty people. As a banquet usually would result in {{half of the people}} facing away from a viewer he chose this moment so that the celebrants could more naturally be <b>displayed</b> <b>facing</b> to the side as they sat in conversational groups.|$|R
5000|$|Slab serif typefaces {{had become}} popular in British {{lettering}} and printing {{over the previous}} thirty-five years before the original Clarendon’s release, both for display use on signage, architectural lettering and posters and for emphasis within a block of text. The Clarendon design was immediately very popular and was rapidly copied by other foundries to become in effect an entire genre of type design. Clarendon fonts proved extremely popular {{in many parts of}} the world, in particular for display applications such as posters printed with wood type. They are therefore commonly associated with wanted posters and the American Old West. A revival of interest took place in the post-war period: Jonathan Hoefler comments that [...] "some of the best and most significant Clarendons are twentieth century designs" [...] and highlights the Haas and Stempel foundry's bold, wide Clarendon <b>display</b> <b>face</b> as [...] "a classic that for many people is the epitome of the Clarendon style." ...|$|E
5000|$|The label [...] "Ionic", {{originally}} {{also used}} for display faces, has become associated with typefaces with some Clarendon/slab-serif features but intended for body text, following the success of several faces with this name from first Miller & Richard (intended to be slightly bolder than contemporary expectations for body text proportions) and then Linotype (its 1922 release Ionic No. 5, extremely successful in newspaper printing). Millington notes that [...] "Ionic became a distinct design in its own right" [...] while Hoefler comments {{that it is now}} [...] "chiefly associated with bracketed faces of the Century model". A decline of interest in Clarendons for display use did, however, take place in the early twentieth century: by 1923, American Type Founders, which specialised in creating demand for new designs of <b>display</b> <b>face,</b> could argue [...] "Who remembers the Clarendons?" [...] in its specimen book, and did not show them (aside from a few numerals) in its 1,148 pages. In addition, the market of slab serifs was disrupted by the arrival of new [...] "geometric" [...] slab-serifs inspired by the sans-serifs of the period, such as Karnak and Beton. However, revivals did appear after the war both in America and Europe.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether faces {{can produce}} a 'pop-out' effect in visual search tasks. In the first experiment, subjects' eye movements and search latencies were measured while they viewed a display containing a target face amidst distractors. Targets were upright or inverted faces presented with seven others of the opposite polarity as an 'around-the-clock' <b>display.</b> <b>Face</b> images were either photographic or 'feature only', with the outline removed. Naive subjects were poor at locating an upright face from an array of inverted faces, but performance improved with practice. In the second experiment, we investigated systematically how training improved performance. Prior to testing, subjects were practised on locating either upright or inverted faces. Allsubjects benefited from training. Subjects practised on upright faces were faster and more accurate at locating upright target faces than inverted. Subjects practised on inverted faces showed no difference between upright and inverted targets. In the third experiment, faces with 'jumbled' features were used as distractors, and this resulted in {{the same pattern of}} findings. We conclude that there is no direct rapid 'pop-out' effect for faces. However, the findings demonstrate that, in peripheral vision, upright faces show a processing advantage over inverted faces...|$|E
