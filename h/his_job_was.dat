5|$|Having {{graduated}} from the LSE in 1952, Levin worked briefly as a tour guide, and then joined the BBC's North American Service. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to read all the newspapers and weekly magazines, selecting articles that might be useful for broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> {{to appease the}} massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E
5|$|From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on {{assignment}} in the Caribbean and South America. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> {{to monitor the}} health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, {{and they wanted to}} be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{request for}} proposals for a heavy escort fighter (Tyazholyy Istrebitel' Soprovozhdeniya) was received at the Polikarpov OKB in November 1938, but the press of work with the I-180 and SPB prototypes prevented any significant design work until {{the third quarter of}} 1940. Mikhail Yangel was appointed head designer, but <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> complicated by multiple changes {{in the role of the}} aircraft from escort fighter to interceptor, dive bomber, and eventually reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> {{to dispel the}} mythic stature the case had taken on {{over the years by}} clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{joined the}} Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923; his Party number was 14,303. As {{a member of}} Röhm's {{paramilitary}} unit, Himmler {{was involved in the}} Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> <b>was</b> unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> {{to prepare}} staff studies on {{upcoming}} potential operations. While {{he did do}} naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect and become an operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff study revealed that it would be too time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three teams would work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E
5|$|At 13:45, Chain Home radar {{picked up}} the German raids. No. 11 Group {{scrambled}} one Spitfire from RAF Hawkinge on the channel coast. Flown by No. 92 Squadron Pilot Officer Alan Wright, <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to climb {{as quickly as possible}} over the sea and act as a spotter. He was to report on the direction, height, composition and strength of the German formation. The radar operators assessed the strengths of the three largest formations at 30, 50, and 60 plus. Five smaller formations added up to 85 plus. In fact, the British estimate of 225 aircraft proved too small. The German force was 475 aircraft strong. Shortly before 14:00, the German formation left the French coast. Park ordered his forces to repeat the earlier interception tactic. Four pairs of squadrons were ordered to patrol Sheerness, Chelmsford, Hornchurch and RAF Kenley.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{realized}} that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> {{then on the}} line, and he pulled out all stops to capture the culprits. In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the Chicago office, received a tip on Dillinger's whereabouts that paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed, and killed by Bureau agents outside the Biograph Theater.|$|E

As such he was annoyed when during the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, he was not involved.|$|E
25|$|In 1670, France regained {{control of}} Acadia and {{appointed}} Mathieu de Goutin as the Civil and Criminal Lieutenant (lieutenant civil et criminel) of Acadia. Simultaneously, the Governor of Acadia {{was set up}} and <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> primarily the defense of Acadia from English invasion. The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant was essentially supervised by the Governor, who held superior judicial authority over the Lieutenant, {{but for most of}} the time would let the Lieutenant mediate and decide legal affairs.|$|E
25|$|The Wildcats {{were under}} siege when they slumped {{to the bottom}} of the ladder at Christmas. They then {{travelled}} to Wollongong for a must-win game against Illawarra on New Year's Eve without injured captain Damian Martin or a third import (after sacking Johnson). Amid the turmoil, Wildcats managing director Nick Marvin assured Gleeson <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> safe, with some calling for Gleeson to be sacked himself. Then, against the odds, the Wildcats beat the Hawks, signed Bryce Cotton and their season changed.|$|E

25|$|The McCains' {{marriage}} {{began to}} falter {{due to his}} extramarital affairs. John McCain's next assignment was to the Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. The McCains separated briefly, then rejoined. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> aided by the social life the couple conducted, entertaining Navy, government, and other people three to four nights a week at their Alexandria, Virginia home. During this time she worked for Congressman John H. Rousselot. By 1979, the McCains were still living together.|$|E
25|$|Justice Lam, {{knowing that}} {{whatever}} decision he made would be controversial, {{took time to}} emphasise during the court proceedings that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to rule {{on the content of}} the law, not to take into account political or social factors, which would be the job of the legislature. Migrants from the Philippines and Indonesia called on their respective governments to discuss the situation with the Hong Kong government {{and find a way to}} allay the Hong Kong public's concerns over the ruling.|$|E
25|$|Andrew {{began working}} for BBC Hereford & Worcester in 1999, {{following}} a work experience placement. Initially <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> putting guests on-air, whether {{this would be}} for his home station or {{for the likes of}} BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5 Live, Newsbeat and the BBC World Service. During a visit to the Worcester studios, Andrew was asked if he'd like to be trained as a broadcast assistant – and three weeks later, without the training, Andrew was looking after the general day-to-day running of the Hereford office.|$|E

25|$|González {{explained}} in detail how Roxana Baldetti's front companies worked, a version that remained unaltered across the lengthy questioning {{of lawyers and}} procesutors: González was hired to manage seven companies. Other companies controlled by Víctor Hugo Hernández, Juan Carlos Monzón's trusted employee. González explained that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> {{to make sure that}} all these front companies had offices that reflected the capital that they allegedly had and the services that they were supposed to offer; he also looked for mock stockholders and board members that fit the profile for the supposed type of companies.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Modi {{established}} Modi Entertainment Networks (MEN), using {{money from}} a family trust. MEN started as a 10-year joint venture with Walt Disney Pictures, to broadcast some of Disney's content in India, including Fashion TV. In 1994, MEN became the pan-India distributor of ESPN on a ten-year contract worth $975 million. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to collect money from the cable companies in India in exchange for them broadcasting ESPN. ESPN did not renew its contract with Modi, alleging that he underreported revenues. MEN also lost a contract with Fashion TV, after Modi fell out with its founder Michel Adam Lisowski. Most of Modi's businesses in Mumbai were not profitable, and he lived on a maintenance allowance from his father's company.|$|E
25|$|Since {{his first}} {{involvement}} with Yorkshire in 1948, Trueman {{had been working}} a winter job at Maltby Main in the tally office (contrary {{to one of the}} urban myths about him, he was never actually a miner). Yorkshire had encouraged him to work for the National Coal Board so that he would be in a reserved occupation and so avoid national service. But in the winter of 1950–51, he learned that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to be declassified and that he would be liable for call-up at some stage. He decided to volunteer after the 1951 season and, at the same time, take advantage of a new Yorkshire committee ruling that any capped players who were called up would be paid £5 a week, which was a good wage at the time.|$|E
