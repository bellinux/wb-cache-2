In the past, <b>data</b> <b>warehousing</b> and analytical processing (OLAP) have produced fundamental and important technologies for the design, management, and use of information systems for decision support. Indeed, many industrial and administrative organizations have successfully used <b>data</b> <b>warehouses</b> to collect essential indicators that help them improve their business processes and their decision making efforts. Recent developments like column stores instead of row stores at the physical level, real-time <b>data</b> <b>warehousing</b> and Business Intelligence applications at the conceptual level, and decision support for new emerging applications have raised new research questions. This seminar {{has focused on the}} following five main topics: (i) Real-Time <b>Data</b> <b>Warehouses</b> and Business Intelligence, (ii) Spatio-Temporal <b>Data</b> <b>Warehousing,</b> (iii) Situational Business Intelligence, (iv) Query Processing in <b>Data</b> <b>Warehouses,</b> and (v) Knowledge Extraction and Management in <b>Data</b> <b>Warehouses.</b> These topics were discussed in parallel groups and each group identified open research issues and new challenges...|$|R
