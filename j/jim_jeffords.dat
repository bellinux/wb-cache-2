25|$|In 1968 Kaplan Engineering (Ron Kaplan and <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords)</b> {{had been}} {{contracted}} by AMC to run two AMC Javelins in the SCCA’s Trans-Am series. For 1968, three cars were actually constructed: two for racing {{and one for}} shows and demonstrations. In 1969, Jeffords left the team and Kaplan was contracted to run the program. Using his developmental work from the prior year, Kaplan built three more cars, two for AMC and one for himself using his own finances.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{incumbent}} Republican Congressman <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> {{decided to}} run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing Vermont's at-large congressional district. Former Lieutenant Governor Peter P. Smith (R) won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic State Representative Paul N. Poirier placed third with 19% of the vote. Two years later, Sanders ran for the seat again and defeated the incumbent Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.|$|E
25|$|After the 2000 {{elections}} {{produced a}} 50–50 partisan {{split in the}} Senate, Vice President Al Gore's tie-breaking vote gave the Democrats the majority from January 3 to January 20, 2001, when George W. Bush took office and Vice President Dick Cheney's tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the majority once again. Later in 2001, he became Senate Minority Leader again after Vermont senator <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> became an independent and caucused with the Democrats, allowing them to regain the majority. He was due to become majority leader again in early 2003 after Republican gains in the November 2002 elections.|$|E
25|$|During the 1996 United States Presidential {{election}} Warner {{served as}} a Senate teller (along with Democrat Wendell H. Ford) of electoral votes. Warner was among ten GOP Senators {{who voted against the}} charge of perjury during Clinton's impeachment (the others were Richard Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Olympia Snowe of Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> of Vermont, Slade Gorton of Washington and Fred Thompson of Tennessee). Warner and others who voted against the article angered many Republicans by their position. However, unlike Snowe, Collins, Specter, Jeffords and Chafee, the rest of the Republicans voted guilty on the second article.|$|E
25|$|As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd {{served as}} President pro tempore four times when his party {{was in the}} majority: from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and {{outgoing}} Vice President Al Gore broke the tie {{in favor of the}} Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, {{as a result of the}} 2006 Senate elections. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
25|$|When the 107th Congress {{commenced}} on January 3, 2001, the Senate was evenly divided—that is, {{there were}} 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans. Outgoing Vice President Al Gore acted in his constitutional capacity as ex officio President of the Senate, {{and used his}} tie-breaking vote to give the Democrats the majority in that chamber. For the next two weeks, Daschle served as Senate Majority Leader. Then, upon the commencement of the Bush administration on January 20, 2001, Dick Cheney became President of the Senate, thereby returning Democrats to the minority in that body; Daschle reverted {{to the position of}} Senate Minority Leader. However, on June 6, 2001, Senator <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> of Vermont announced in that he was leaving the Senate Republican caucus to become an independent and to caucus with Democrats; this once again returned control of the body to the Democrats and Daschle again became Majority Leader.|$|E
25|$|Republican {{conservatives are}} strongest in the South, Mountain West and Midwest, where they draw support from social conservatives. The moderates tend to {{dominate}} the party in New England, and used to be well represented in all states. From the 1940s to the 1970s under such leaders as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford, they usually dominated the presidential wing of the party. Since the 1970s, they have been less powerful, though they are always represented in the cabinets of Republican presidents. In Vermont, <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords,</b> a Republican Senator became an independent in 2001 due to growing disagreement with President Bush and the party leadership. In addition, moderate Republicans have recently held the governorships in several New England States, while Lincoln Chafee, a former moderate Republican senator is an independent-turned-Democrat former governor of Rhode Island. Former Senator Olympia Snowe and current Senator Susan Collins, both of Maine, and former Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts are notable moderate Republicans from New England. Former Senator Mark Kirk {{is another example of}} a moderate Republican from a Democratic stronghold, Illinois, who ironically held the Senate seat once held by President Barack Obama. From 1991 to 2007, moderate Republicans served as governors of Massachusetts. Prominent Republican moderates have included former Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George Bush Sr., as well as former Senate leaders Howard Baker and Bob Dole, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and former New York City Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.|$|E
500|$|McCain began 2001 by {{breaking}} {{with the new}} George W. Bush administration {{on a number of}} matters, including HMO reform, climate change, and gun legislation; McCain–Feingold was opposed by Bush as well. In May 2001, McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts. Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds, there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year's campaign. Later, when a Republican senator, <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords,</b> became an Independent, thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats, McCain defended Jeffords against [...] "self-appointed enforcers of party loyalty". Indeed, there was speculation at the time, and in years since, about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party, but McCain has always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so. Beginning in 2001, McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run, as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members, {{to become one of the}} Senate's most influential members.|$|E

2500|$|All of the Democrats in the Senate {{voted for}} {{acquittal}} {{on both the}} perjury and the obstruction of justice charges. [...] Ten Republicans voted for acquittal for perjury: John Chafee (Rhode Island), Susan Collins (Maine), Slade Gorton (Washington), <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> (Vermont), Richard Shelby (Alabama), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pennsylvania), Ted Stevens (Alaska), Fred Thompson (Tennessee), and John Warner (Virginia). Five Republicans voted for acquittal for obstruction of justice: Chafee, Collins, Jeffords, Snowe, and Specter.|$|E
2500|$|Leahy was {{the first}} non-Republican Senator from Vermont since 1856. As of 2016, {{he is the only}} Democrat ever elected to the Senate from Vermont, and one of only three Democrats to {{represent}} Vermont in either house of Congress {{since the end of the}} Civil War. [...] However, since 2001, two other Vermont Senators have caucused with the Democrats. [...] <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> was elected as a Republican before he switched to become an Independent. [...] His successor, Bernie Sanders was elected as an Independent; he won and then refused the Democratic Party nomination in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Simon {{promoted}} a military response to Somalia during {{the presidency of}} George H.W. Bush. Simon was {{an outspoken critic of}} President Bill Clinton's response to the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. Simon believed that America should have acted faster, and Clinton later said his belated response was the biggest mistake of his presidency. He is, together with <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords,</b> supported by Canadian Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire, Force Commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda from 1993 to 1994, for actively lobbying the Clinton administration into mounting a humanitarian mission to Rwanda during the genocide. According to Dallaire's book Shake Hands with the Devil, he [...] "owe a great debt of gratitude" [...] to both Senators.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders {{entered the}} race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, after Senator <b>Jim</b> <b>Jeffords</b> {{announced}} that he would not seek a fourth term. Chuck Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, endorsed Sanders, a critical move as it meant that no Democrat running against Sanders could expect to receive financial help from the party. Sanders was also endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Democratic National Committee chairman and former Vermont governor Howard Dean. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who [...] "votes with the Democrats 98 percent of the time." [...] Then-Senator Barack Obama also campaigned for Sanders in Vermont in March 2006. Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did.|$|E
