40|$|There the {{non-linear}} deformation {{theory of}} ribbed shells has been offered. The multilayer iterative schemes of solution of boundary problems of mechanics of {{body to be}} deformed with elastic stiffening have been offered and have been studied for optimality. The analogues of theorems about three and five moments for the multisupport shells have been obtained. The alternative and multivariant approaches {{to the analysis of}} reactions and to the optimization of support system have been developed for the support system of autoclave. The specific contact reactions have been analysed, the optimum shapes have been determined for the under-autoclave bed. The skirt transition as the tapered shell of linearly varying thickness has been taken into account, the rational choice of type of cover has been realized for the <b>flange</b> <b>unit.</b> The case of autoclave of oval cross-section has been analysed in account of all temperature-mechanical loads. The set of approximate computation procedures of members of autoclave structure has been offered. The results are used in the design practice to estimate the strength and the longevity of shell-type constructionsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
5000|$|A {{pillow block}} usually {{refers to a}} housing with an {{included}} anti-friction bearing. A pillow block refers to any mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or <b>flange</b> <b>units.</b> A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of rolling element defines the type of pillow block. These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|R
