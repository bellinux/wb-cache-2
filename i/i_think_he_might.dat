500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been a dork, you know, doing their stuff and {{they had their own}} thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|Kyla was {{involved}} in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, {{the first of which}} was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: [...] "She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to look a bit deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator McCarthy. Will counsel [...] for my benefit define – <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be {{an expert}} on that – what a pixie is? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not exactly so, sir. But <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be here tomorrow, {{as he has}} {{not been}} here today.' 'Is he coming up from Oxford?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Will, and God bless you." [...] <b>I</b> almost <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have kissed her, asking himself no {{questions}} as to the light {{in which it was}} done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{brother was}} not my client," [...] the lawyer said slowly. [...] "If his death had not been quite so sudden, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been. As it is, I know very little of his affairs. I am afraid that I can be of very little use to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Joe Strummer's {{impact is}} {{referenced}} by the Hold Steady {{in the song}} [...] "Constructive Summer", a song featured on their 2008 album Stay Positive. In this song the band sings [...] "Raise a toast to Saint Joe Strummer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been our only decent teacher." [...] In November 2009, Tonara, a town in Sardinia, Italy, dedicated a street to Joe Strummer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; no; exactly; and as Mr. Gresham knew I wished it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> as {{well have}} offered it. I suppose {{there can be no}} reason now about money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it only {{tells him}} what o'clock {{it is at}} one hour in the day," [...] said Rollo. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> make it do for all the {{afternoon}} and forenoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be {{sure you}} could," [...] said she; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it one of the}} meanest things he ever did to deprive you of that amusement. There were those nice people at the Isle of Cats (wasn't it?) who wrote and asked you so very kindly to give them an address. <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have let you go to the Isle of Cats." ...|$|R
60|$|Duneka's {{indifference}} {{even more}} than his shunting my precious manuscript into the street brought back my cloud of doubt, for it indicated a loss of faith in me. To him I was a squeezed lemon. Nevertheless I took his hint. Sullivan, I knew and liked, and while I had small hope of interesting him in The Middle Border, <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> buy {{one or two of}} my short stories.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have long}} {{suspected}} that Thomas Hutter {{was not my}} father, though <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been Hetty's, but now we know he {{was the father of}} neither. He acknowledged that much in his dying moments. I am old enough to remember better things than we have seen on this lake, though they are so faintly impressed on my memory that the earlier part of my life seems like a dream." ...|$|R
6000|$|One day, {{seeing a}} very good-looking man {{crossing}} the street, the king called {{his daughter and}} said: 'Come quickly, dear Cannetella, {{and look at this}} man, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> suit you as a husband.' ...|$|E
6000|$|One evening, {{shortly after}} the {{expedition}} to Epsom, while the rest were playing a rubber, Imogene said to him, [...] "I wish you {{to be friends with}} Mr. Vigo; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be of use to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{then after}} the Flood it had all to be begun over again,' said Ivinghoe. 'Let me see, Methuselah lived {{about as long as}} from William the Conqueror till now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have got to steam and electricity.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is up at Clawbonny, just now--you {{know how}} it is with him. No change of {{circumstances}} will ever make him regard his little smoke-house looking church, as anything but a cathedral, and his parish as a diocese. Since the great change in our circumstances, all this is useless, and I often think--you know one wouldn't like to say as much to him--but <b>I</b> often <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> just as well give up preaching, altogether." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although I never {{supposed}} that he (Napoleon) possessed, allowing for some difference of education, the liberality of conduct and political views which were sometimes exhibited by old Hyder Ali, yet <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{have shown the}} same resolved and dogged spirit of resolution which induced Tipu Sahib to die manfully upon the breach of his capital city with his sabre clenched in his hand. Sir Walter Scott, commenting on the abdication of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 ...|$|R
60|$|I hadn't {{expected}} {{dear old}} Freddie {{to sing with}} joy {{when he found out}} what had happened, but <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have shown a little more manly fortitude. He leaped up, glared at the kid, and clutched his head. He didn't speak for a long time, but, on the other hand, when he began he did not leave off for a long time. He was quite emotional, dear old boy. It beat me where he could have picked up such expressions.|$|R
6000|$|... "A log like that, Mr. Medlicot, {{will burn}} for weeks sometimes. I'll tell you fairly what I'm afraid of. There's {{a man with}} you whom I turned out of the shed last shearing, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> put a match down--not by accident." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you leave}} him here until Mr. Menville comes for him," [...] was the quick reply. [...] "Mr. Officer, please {{see to it}} that the bear is not taken away. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> very easily be chained to that hitching-post by the curb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We both loved Blanche. There {{would have}} been room for him in my mother's house. I think the company of poor, simple people would have done his soul a great good. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have learnt from them {{something}} that would be very useful to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw your}} eldest boy yesterday, at Marling’s," [...] {{continued}} the industrious Mr. Vyner. [...] "He is getting on pretty well; Marling {{tells me he}} is steady and quiet. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be a great comfort to you in your old age." ...|$|R
6000|$|He made no remark, however, {{seeming to}} hear it {{as a matter of}} course that Walter would say {{something}} of the kind. After asking if she was certain she had read all, and pointing to a few crossed lines at the head of the first page, to make sure that she had not missed them, he only said, [...] "Then there is not a word about coming. Well, <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> come when <b>he</b> knows that after this time I shall never be able to see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ... So {{you see it}} {{was really}} his fault. The Emperor of Germany {{has no right to}} come and dig holes in our best wicket. Take a {{parallel}} case. Suppose some idiot of a fellow (not that Uncle John's that, of course, but you know what I mean) came and began rooting up your azaleas. Wouldn't you want to say something cutting? I will apologize to Uncle John, if you like; but still, <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have gone somewhere else if he really wanted to dig. So you see, etc., etc.|$|R
60|$|AFTER losing them, he ran on {{four legs}} and went faster, so that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have got away {{altogether}} {{if he had}} not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Hugh," [...] she explained. [...] "He has rung up {{from the}} War Office or somewhere--says he has {{just got back from}} France and wants to see me at once. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have waited till to-morrow morning. I can {{scarcely}} keep my eyes open, I am so sleepy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Pat's {{been telling}} me about it, and I suppose I and Feemy must go down. If Brady chooses to ask the Captain, I've nothing to say; it's {{not for me to}} ask him, and, as he'd only be quizzing at all he saw, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> as well be away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, politenesses and things. Of course his manners are--quite right. That {{only makes}} it worse, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> It shows <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have helped--all that happened. I do all I {{can to make}} him see I don't like him. But none of the others make the {{slightest}} objection to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{go and see}} {{it again}} to-night for the last time," [...] he said; [...] "it'll do me good; it'll make me feel over again what I felt when I'd knocked him down. I felt what poor empty work it was, as soon as I'd done it, before <b>I</b> began to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. According to his lights, {{he means to}} do the best he can for her. And, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> myself that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do worse. She will {{probably}} become Mrs. Newton of Newton Priory if she marries me; and the investment of Neefit's twenty thousand pounds won't be so bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{wish to see}} it any more," [...] {{observed}} Phoebe, {{turning away}} her eyes. [...] "It is certainly very like the old portrait. But my cousin Hepzibah has another picture,--a miniature. If the original {{is still in the}} world, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> defy the sun to make him look stern and hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|Olive smiled. [...] "You {{seem to know}} a {{great deal}} about him," [...] said she, [...] "and I assure you that so far as he himself is concerned, I have no {{objections}} to him, except that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have had the courage to come and tell me the truth this morning, whatever it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is the Dean's brother-in-law. I remember. And {{when he came}} {{what did}} he say? Unless you and he were very {{intimate}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> as well have remained away. There are some stories here not altogether to his credit. I do not know much about his business, {{but he is not}} a delectable acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{call me a}} good sir,' {{retorted}} Anthony, 'and don't {{claim to}} be one yourself. If your daughter was {{what you would have}} me believe, she wouldn't do for Jonas. Being what she is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she will. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> be deceived in a wife. She might run riot, contract debts, and waste his substance. Now when I am dead--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Mrs. Pettifer, 'it's a {{thousand}} pities {{his father and}} sister can't come and live with him, if he isn't to marry. But I wish {{with all my heart}} he could have taken to some nice woman as would have made a comfortable home for him. <b>I</b> used to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> take to Eliza Pratt; she's a good girl, and very pretty; but I see no likelihood of it now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I cannot say. General Romana {{seems to}} me to be a man of greater energy than any Spaniard I have {{hitherto}} met, and I know that he has already sent messages to the priests throughout that part of Galicia urging upon them the necessity of using their influence among the peasantry. He got a force together in a very short time, after the complete defeat and capture of his own command by the French, at the time of Blake's defeat, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> do so again, though whether they would be of any use whatever in the field I cannot say; but should Soult advance into Portugal, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> that bands of this sort might very much harass him." ...|$|R
