5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and <b>is</b> <b>reaching</b> for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E
5|$|Linfield's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} in European competition <b>is</b> <b>reaching</b> the quarter-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup. After beating Aris of Luxembourg and Vålerengen of Norway they faced CSKA Red Flag {{in the last}} eight. This resulted in a 2–2 draw at home and 1–0 defeat away. In the 1984–85 season, after overcoming Shamrock Rovers on away goals (the first and so far only series of meetings between the two Irish superpowers outside all-Ireland tournaments), Linfield faced eventual semi-finalists Panathinaikos in the second round. After a 2–1 defeat in Greece, Linfield raced into a 3–0 lead at half-time in the second leg at Windsor Park. Panathinaikos staged a remarkable comeback {{in the second half}} to level the match at 3-3 and eliminate Linfield 5–4 on aggregate.|$|E

It has also been shown that, in the n-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>is</b> 3n-2.

Below, a goat <b>is</b> <b>reaching</b> for ripened grapes. Behind the goat lies fruit and a table, most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top. On the left side of the table stands a small female figure, whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult's rites. Frédéric de Clarac argued that the statues could very well symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two deities often associated with Dionysus. Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks. To the right, in an apple tree, another mask of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante masks are present on the bottom, in front of the table.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg Ballklub is an {{association}} football club from Trondheim, Norway. The team {{has participated in}} 32 seasons of Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) club competitions, including 21 seasons in the European Cup and Champions League, 16 seasons in the UEFA Cup and Europa League, one season in the Cup Winners' Cup and one season in the Intertoto Cup. Rosenborg has played six times in the UEFA Cup after qualifying via the Champions League and once via the Intertoto Cup. It has played 206 UEFA games, resulting in 81 wins, 39 draws and 86 defeats. The club's first appearance was in the 1965–66 European Cup Winners' Cup, and it subsequently entered tournaments in six seasons until 1974–75. The club's next appearance was in the 1986–87 European Cup, {{and then in the}} 1989–90 European Cup. Since then, Rosenborg has been involved in a UEFA tournament every season except the 2006–07 season. The club's best performance <b>is</b> <b>reaching</b> the quarter-finals of the 1996–97 Champions League, while their only European trophy came when they co-won the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup.|$|E
5|$|The European Champion Clubs' Cup {{was founded}} in 1955 and was renamed the UEFA Champions League in 1992. Malmö FF first entered the {{competition}} in 1964–65, qualifying {{by virtue of their}} position {{at the top of the}} Allsvenskan table midway through the 1964 season. As Allsvenskan is played between April and October of each year, out of step with most European leagues, modern practice sees each season's Allsvenskan champions qualify for the UEFA Champions League competition starting in August the following year. Malmö FF's most notable achievement in this competition, and in all European tournaments, <b>is</b> <b>reaching</b> the final at the end of the 1978–79 season. In the 2014–15 season the side passed the qualifying rounds for the first time since the competition was re–branded. The following is a complete list of matches played by Malmö FF in the European Cup and the UEFA Champions League; it includes the season of the tournament, the stage, the opponent club and its country, the date, the venue and the score.

5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} is {{considered}} to be vulnerable due to habitat destruction, its isolated populations, collection of adults, predation, and a low breeding success rate. Its habitat is being destroyed to create large agricultural fields and cocoa plantations, as well as for logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. Due to the highly specialized requirements for its habitat, its population is very fragmented, and the species is believed to be naturally rare. Competition for its nesting sites is a result of these strict requirements and can lead to infanticide. Its estimated population is between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals, though it is believed that the population is {{at the lower end of}} the estimate. However, due to the inaccessibility of some parts of its range, it is also possible that this species is more common than believed. The population of some of these colonies <b>is</b> <b>reaching</b> the minimum levels needed for long-term viability. It also falls victim to spring traps set for mammals by hunters. However, a more serious threat to its numbers was the widespread collection of rockfowl for display in zoos in the 1950s and 1960s. There is a risk that it will be negatively affected by ecotourism due to disturbances in its daily routine if proper viewing procedures are not followed.|$|E
