In some cases steel {{is used to}} line {{the inside of the}} concrete, which contributes strength from both materials in the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>case</b> that containment becomes highly pressurized. Yet other newer designs call for both a steel and concrete containment - which is in decades long use in the current German PWR-designs - notably the AP1000 and the European Pressurized Reactor plan to use both; which gives missile protection by the outer concrete and pressurizing ability by the inner steel structure. The AP1000 has planned vents {{at the bottom of the}} concrete structure surrounding the steel structure under the logic that it would help move air over the steel structure and cool containment in the event of a major accident (in a similar way to how a cooling tower works).|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics watertight doors. This {{theory suggests}} that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled {{on an even keel}} and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>case</b> that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|E

For the Chief Justice, [...] "the question is whether its action constitutes an exercise of judicial power." [...] Both the hypothetical [...] "Smith wins" [...] statute and §8772 both have the same effect, which is essentially the legislature's [...] "'policy judgment'" [...] that one side in the case wins. He compared the majority's opinion, which found that §8772 left plenty of issues for the District Court to adjudicate, to [...] "a constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented by the simplest maneuver of taking away every defense against Smith's victory, without saying 'Smith wins.'" [...] Section8772 only required the courts to make two decisions—that Bank Markazi had an equitable interest in the assets and no one else did—that were both already clear before §8772 was enacted. By the majority's view of [...] "plenty", [...] the Chief Justice contended that, in the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>case</b> Smith v.

Strongly criticizing the majority, the Chief Justice, quoting Federalist No. 48, concluded that the majority's [...] "failure to enforce [...] in a case as clear as this reduces Article III to a mere 'parchment barrier against the encroaching spirit' of legislative power." ...|$|E

2500|$|One 1999 case, Re [...] "J" [...] (child's {{religious}} upbringing and circumcision) {{said that}} circumcision in Britain required {{the consent of}} all those with parental responsibility, or {{the permission of the}} court, acting for {{the best interests of the}} child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing Muslim father and non-practicing Christian mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without medical necessity; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>case</b> of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father for no good reason, refuses his agreement.

Supreme Court justices pose <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cases,</b> often adapting precedents, to evaluate if a proposed rule for deciding a problem needs to be adapted. This paper describes a diagrammatic representation of adaptive reasoning with <b>hypothetical</b> <b>cases</b> based on a process model. Since the diagrams are interpretations of argument texts, there is no one “correct ” diagram, and reliability could be a challenge. An experiment assessed the reliability of expert grading of diagrams prepared by students reconstructing {{examples of}} hypothetical reasoning. Preliminary results indicate significant areas of agreement, including with respect to the ways tests are modified in response to hypotheticals, but slight agreement as to the role and import of hypotheticals. These results suggest that the diagrammatic representation will support studying and modeling the examples of case-based adaptation, but that the diagramming support needs to make certain features more explicit...|$|R
