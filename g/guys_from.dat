25|$|Schlitt and Hartman, after {{arranging}} worship music {{together for}} a youth retreat, reunited for an independently released praise-and-worship CD in 2007, calling themselves II <b>Guys</b> <b>from</b> Petra and titling their album Vertical Expressions. The songs featured contemporary praise songs in a raw-sounding, electric rock format, and included two bonus tracks from Petra's recorded farewell performance {{that had not been}} included on the Farewell CD. Studio musicians played drums and bass, and former Petra keyboardist Jim Cooper teamed with Hartman on production. Hartman and Schlitt have since performed several shows together, playing acoustic renditions of Petra and II Guys songs as recently as early 2010.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with people like that. Not everyone talks like that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from. We made it thick... for humor's sake, but then again, not really. There are folks with seriously heavy accents there, and they are proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Buchanan {{described}} the song {{during an interview}} that was published on the group's official website, saying: [...] "Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song – it’s the most sexy song we’ve ever done. It came about when Orson had {{an idea for a}} song. [...] They played it to us – it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love." [...] She elaborated in a separate interview: [...] "When we started working with the <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Orson the sound just blew us away – it's completely fresh sounding {{but at the same time}} has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!" ...|$|E
500|$|Continuing his {{services}} from the prior season, Dana Gonzales oversaw {{production of the}} show's second season. The cinematographer took cues from William Eggleston to develop a retro visual palette. To achieve this quality, Gonzales relied on vintage practical lighting technology, and captured scenes with an Arri ALEXA camera, retrofitted with vintage Cooke lenses. In one section of Calgary where they were filming, production staff replaced each sodium-lamp street light with tungsten light bulbs, creating an ambience that [...] "pulls the audience into the world when the story takes place". Also, once Hawley analyzed the 1968 thriller film The Boston Strangler, split screen effects were employed to help streamline the narrative during transitions. Gonzales said: [...] "We felt that split-screen would be an incredible way to track all these characters and locations within the episode: Where's the Gerhardt family? Where are the <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Kansas City? Where's Peggy? Where's Ed?" ...|$|E

500|$|Bentley's {{early career}} was spent with several senior teams {{throughout}} Saskatchewan. [...] He first played {{in his hometown}} of Delisle for the Tigers hockey team in 1932–33 before playing a year in Saskatoon, then another in Regina before settling in Moose Jaw for three seasons beginning in 1935–36. He led the South-Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League in scoring in 1936–37 with 37 points and added another 14 in the playoffs, also leading the league. In 1937, Bentley, along with future Hall of Famer Elmer Lach attended the Toronto Maple Leafs training camp; both were rejected as too small for the National Hockey League. According to Lach, Conn Smythe, manager of the Leafs, saw Bentley and Lach and said “They were sending me big <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> the West, but instead they’ve sent me peanuts.” He moved to Alberta with brother Reg, and joined elder brothers Max, Wyatt and Roy with the Drumheller Miners of the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL) for the 1938–39 season. [...] When not playing hockey, Doug helped run a gas station that the family purchased in Drumheller.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for Fall Out Boy's [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{directed}} by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson. [...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What {{we decided to do}} was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take on one of the <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video.|$|E
500|$|Garrett {{initially}} wrote [...] "Soldier" [...] {{in a taxi}} while {{going to}} the studio where the band worked on Destiny Fulfilled; he sang the hook to the members afterwards and they liked it. Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, [...] "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood {{from the perspective of}} having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into." [...] During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with [...] "Soldier" [...] each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance. Beyoncé stated that as the song had a [...] "Southern feel" [...] and beat, they wanted to collaborate with Lil Wayne and T.I. who according to her added [...] "rawness, realness and edge to the song". During an interview in 2014, Lil Wayne discussed his contribution in the song, [...] "That set me off. Them little eight bars right there, that got me there boy. If you ask me why, it was Beyoncé. That shit was big." [...] "Soldier" [...] was included on the group's compilation albums #1's (2005) and [...] (2012).|$|E

500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 2006 FIFA World Cup Final {{match in}} Germany, in which Italy {{defeated}} France 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out, Camoranesi had teammate Massimo Oddo chop off {{a large chunk of}} his long hair {{as the rest of the}} squad danced around them in a circle.

2500|$|In Two <b>Guys</b> <b>from</b> Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v.

2500|$|On 16 December 1964, the [...] "Adobe Dick" [...] {{episode of}} the cartoon The Flintstones (episode 129) paid a humorous homage to Cpt. Bligh and his ship.

2500|$|The Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls {{played a}} game in the late-1980s that Strom officiated.

2500|$|The band's first album, Tender Years, {{became a}} major hit, but {{recording}} their next album, A Season in Hell, {{turns out to be}} a nightmare.

Eddie wants to be great, but bassist Sal replies, [...] "We ain't great. We're just some <b>guys</b> <b>from</b> Jersey." [...] Eddie makes this clear that if the band cannot be great, there is no reason to ever play music again. A Season in Hell is ultimately rejected by Satin Records on the grounds that it is [...] "dark and strange". In the early morning hours, Eddie's car crashes through the railing and over the Stainton Memorial Causeway. Eddie vanishes without a trace, his body never found.|$|E
