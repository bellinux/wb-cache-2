5|$|As the proton {{concentration}} {{increases in}} the intermembrane space, a strong electrochemical gradient is established across the inner membrane. The protons can return to the matrix through the ATP synthase complex, and their potential energy is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is called chemiosmosis, and was first described by Peter Mitchell who was awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work. Later, part of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Paul D. Boyer and <b>John</b> <b>E.</b> Walker for their clarification of the working mechanism of ATP synthase.|$|E

5|$|Hastert lost a 1980 Republican primary for the Illinois House of Representatives, but {{showed a}} talent for campaigning, and after the election, volunteered for an {{influential}} state senator, <b>John</b> <b>E.</b> Grotberg.

The first round of balloting resulted in a tie, but Hastert was chosen after Grotberg interceded on Hastert's behalf.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker <b>John</b> <b>E.</b> Sanford, and in what historian James Hess describes as a probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.|$|E
