5|$|A massive {{influx of}} Palestinian {{refugees}} swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population {{had grown to}} about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 515,556 in 2012, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City {{has one of the}} highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km² (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km² – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km² – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN often takes {{a leading role}} in {{co-ordinating}} emergency relief. The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works {{to protect the rights of}} refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's {{food prices}} rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, {{households}} spent {{an average of}} 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According {{to a report by}} OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.|$|E
30|$|<b>Food</b> <b>aids</b> through PSNP {{participation}} modalities in Ethiopia {{are free}} distribution (FD) and food-for-work (FFW). According to Quisumbing (2003), FFW targets asset-poor households while FD {{does not depend}} on wealth though, most of the time, the recipients are less wealthy.|$|R

5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
5|$|The farm invasions {{severely}} impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe {{had produced}} over two {{million tons of}} maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By October 2003, Human Rights Watch reported {{that half of the}} country's population were food insecure, lacking enough food to meet basic needs. By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US $7.4 billion; by 2005 this had declined to US $3.4 billion. Inflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.|$|E
5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the first plane, a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E

5|$|On 2November, the Canadian International Development Agency contributed C$150,000 (US$203,964) to the International Federation of the Red Cross {{to aid the}} {{recovery}} effort; Canada eventually doubled their contributions through the Canadian Lutheran World Relief and CARE. The European Commission channeled €2million (US$2.1million) through the European Community Humanitarian Office for use by various relief organizations. Contributions to aid agencies were also made by the British Department for International Development (DFID), with initial contributions made to Christian Aid and CARE totaling £330,000 (US$540,837). DFID's initial emergency assistance was later increased to £3million (US$4.9million) and supplemented by a £25million ($40.9million) contribution {{over the course of}} six months. The Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit allocated CHF 800,000 (US$779,666) to five Swiss relief organizations operating in India. <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> worth A$300,000 (US$191,700) was sent by the Australian Government and delivered to approximately 1million people through the World Food Program. Other countries sent aid through their respective International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies branch. Following an initial disaster declaration by United States Ambassador to India Dick Celeste, the United States Agency for International Development contributed US$7,482,000 through Food for Peace and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to complement recovery efforts. The United Nations Children's Fund allocated more than US$100,000to help supply basic health and shelter needs, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made a similar allocation through an emergency grant and with reserves from an earlier grant from Norway.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to state-sponsored violence, {{other means of}} crushing the Isaaq uprising included the government's continuation of its policy of political repression and harsh economic measures, this included withholding international <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> donations to the Isaaq. This was especially harsh as <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> accounted for {{nearly half of all}} food consumption in Somalia in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Studies of the {{mammalian}} brain {{have discovered}} that the excess of cerebral neurons is a phenomenon of mainly animals which had to seek and capture food. [...] These neurons have become {{a large part of}} the olfactory system throughout evolution to allow higher mammals such as primates to have a better chance for survival through more advanced methods of hunting and finding food. For example, the vulture has a large part of its brain committed to olfactory senses. This allows for it to be able to detect food at long ranges without being able to see it. Having memory for various types of <b>food</b> <b>aids</b> in survival by allowing the animals to remember which scent is edible and which is not.|$|R

25|$|Total food import bills rose by an {{estimated}} 25% {{for developing countries}} in 2007. Researchers from the Overseas Development Institute have suggested this problem will be worsened by a likely fall in <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> As <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is programmed by budget rather than volume, rising food prices mean that the World Food Programme (WFP) needs an extra $500million just to sustain the current operations.|$|E

25|$|South Korea (before the Lee Myung-bak government) and China {{remained}} the largest donors of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> to North Korea. The U.S. objects to this manner of donating food {{due to the}} North Korean state's refusal to allow donor representatives to supervise the distribution of their aid inside North Korea. Such supervision would ensure that aid does not get seized and sold by well-connected elites or diverted to feed North Korea's large military. In 2005, South Korea and China together provided almost 1 million tons of <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> each contributing half.|$|E
