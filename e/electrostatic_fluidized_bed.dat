A full factorial experimental design was developed in order to study the influence of several operative variables {{on the effectiveness of}} the coating process and on the coating thickness and uniformity. The operative variables included exposure time, air flow, the applied voltage, attitude, and the radial and vertical location of the work-piece in the fluid bed. After the experimentation, several process maps were developed as a support to identify the best way to lead the coating process. Finally, by using a statistical approach, the reliability and repeatability of the coating process was also established. Experimental trends were consistent with theoretical expectation. A significant growth in achievable coating thickness was obtained by increasing voltage and air flow. Furthermore, at higher values of exposure time and applied voltage, relevant back ionization phenomena occurred, which simultaneously caused a top limit in coating thickness and a worsening of surface finishing. Process characteristics, leading mechanisms, and some practical aspects are also discussed in detail. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

This eco-friendly process is profitably used to coat components of particularly complex shapes.

With a design of experiment (DOE) approach, the experimental investigation, that is the base for the model, quantifies the coating thickness {{as a function of the}} main process parameters namely coating time, applied voltage, and gas flow rate fed into the fluidized bed. This study addresses the effect of the inherent uncertainties on the predicted coating thickness caused by the approximation in the model parameters. In particular, a fuzzy-logic based approach is used to describe the model uncertainties and the transformation method is used to propagate their effect on the thickness.

In particular, systematic {{analysis of}} the influence of the operative variables on coating and process variability in the field of low film thickness (below 100 μm), was carried out, which for electrostatic fluidized beds has previously not been considered feasible.

In particular, exposure time, applied corona voltage, and airflow rate were found to influence the performance of the coating process significantly. Experimental results produced coating thickness trends consistent with theoretic expectations. In particular, effects on the coating process of both electric and aerodynamic forces, which in turn affect the powder particles drawn up to the work-piece surface could largely be predicted by examining experimental data.

40|$|There {{are many}} and good reasons why powder coating {{is a popular}} coating process {{for a lot of}} {{industrial}} products: the wide range of design possibilities; robust surface finish; and the total avoidance of polluting solvents, to name but three. In conventional powder coating installations spray guns are used for powder application on the workpieces. This requires voluminous spray booths and powder recovery systems. Thus conventional powder coating technique causes high consumption of compressed air and of energy for the exhaust air as well as high costs for maintenance. In view of this, the Fraunhofer IPA has designed the "TransApp"-powder coating technique, which operates without spray guns and therefore is very compact, highly energy-efficient, and has low operating costs.

Attention has been particularly focused on the relationship between baking time and temperature of EFB coated substrates and the morphological characteristics of the resulting polymeric films. First, thermal behaviour of PPA 571 H polymeric powders was characterized by using standard calorimetric techniques. Accordingly, PPA 571 H melting kinetic was experimentally deduced. Based upon experimental findings, predictive analytical model was also developed and employed to trace 'iso-conversion' curves out. Second. metal substrates, made from low carbon steel (AISI 1040), were EFB coated and baked at several baking time and temperatures. Combined analyses of scanning electron and confocal microscopes were led to measure the evolution of the films surface morphology under different baking conditions. Accordingly, a relationship between film morphologies and melting degree was sought. Consistent trends of roughness parameters versus baking parameters were found, with smoother finishes of the polymeric films being achieved for higher degrees of melting, that is, for higher baking temperature and time. Full maps and related analytical models of the finishing levels according to baking parameters were also built up, hence providing first useful indications to powder coaters on how to best deal with their settings.

Two different experimental scenarios were investigated: the conventional hot dipping fluidized bed (CHDFB) process and the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> (EFB) coating process. The preliminary experimental plan was scheduled employing design of experiment (DOE) technique. Three experimental factors and operative ranges large enough for practical purposes were considered in both of the examined scenarios. In particular, coating time and airflow rate were chosen as experimental factors in both CHDFB and EFB. The third factor was the preheating temperature of metal substrates in CHDFB and the applied voltage in EFB. A general linear model based upon analysis of variance (ANOVA) {{was used to evaluate}} the significance on coating processes of each experimental factor. Main effect plots (MEPs) and interaction plots (IPs) of coating thickness were drawn. Trends consistent with the settings of the operative parameters were displayed. The experimental trends were first modelled by numerical regression of the experimental data and, subsequently, by using artificial neural network. The reliability of the neural network solution and of the built ad hoc regression models was comparatively evaluated. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained with back propagation (BP) algorithm was found to be the most valuable in fitting the coating thicknesses trends for both the coating processes. Examining the developed models outside the operative ranges they were designed for, the good generalization capability and high flexibility of the neural network solution was definitely stated.

Ilmenite concentrate {{is the second}} most abundant resource from the vanadium-bearing titaniferous magnetite in Panzhihua, comprising about 90 % of the titanium resources in China. In order to fully utilize Panzhihua titanium resources, a new process was proposed in this work. In the process, Panzhihua ilmenite concentrate was first reduced in a rotated hearth furnace to produce iron and titanium-enriched material, then the latter was chloridized in a new combined <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> to produce TiCl 4.
