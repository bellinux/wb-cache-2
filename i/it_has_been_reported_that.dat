Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels; Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> during the series these fictional languages have been heard by more people than the Welsh, Irish, and Scots Gaelic languages combined.|$|E
5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, {{largely due to the}} presence of Trintignant and Kinski. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> during a screening of the film in Sicily, one audience member fired a gun at the screen in anger over the film's ending.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> the {{construction}} of Ithai Barrage has altered the Loktak Lake and its ecosystem. Siltation has reduced the water holding capacity and has consequently had {{a negative impact on}} the power generation capacity at the Loktak Hydro Electric Power Project. Thinning of the phumdi in the Keibul Lamjao area has affected the habitat of the sangai, and other aquafauna, avifauna and flora are on the decline; the 35 species (5 mammals, 3 birds, 9 reptiles, 3 amphibians, 12 fishes, 2 molluscs and 1 annelid) are reported to be disappearing gradually.|$|E

5|$|On January 12, 2010, Haiti {{was struck}} by a magnitude-7.0 {{earthquake}}, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> the lack of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E

5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines {{have been able to}} travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, the M1A1 Arbrams tanks will {{be split}} across each the three {{armoured}} cavalry regiments assigned to the Army's multirole combat brigades located in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> this plan may require the acquisition of an additional 10–12 M1A1 Abrams and six M88A2 Hercules ARVs {{in order to allow}} the formation of three tank squadrons. Obstacle breaching and bridgelaying variants may also be acquired at a later date. One of the 1st Armoured Regiment's squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment in late 2015, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|E

The castle {{was reported to have}} been damaged in July 2013 by an airstrike during the Siege of Homs, and once more on 18 August 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown. The Syrian Arab Army recaptured the castle and the village of al-Hosn from rebel forces on March 20, 2014, although the extent of damage from earlier mortar hits remained unclear.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of fertiliser subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs on the open markets that remained.|$|E
5|$|The general's {{stance on}} human rights issues has also been quite controversial. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> he was behind the Army's refusal to provide any {{information}} on the 1984 massacre at the village of Putis. Requests issued on June 2008 by prosecutor Rubén López for a detailed report on the military personnel deployed there at that time were answered the following month by the Defense Ministry stating that the Army {{did not have any}} information on the subject in its archives. Donayre also joined a campaign to raise funds to defend armed forces personnel accused of committing human rights abuses during the internal conflict in Peru.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that,</b> in 12 workers exposed {{for two or}} {{more years}} to acetic acid {{airborne}} average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm has been reported. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
