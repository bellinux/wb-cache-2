5000|$|The <b>diversity</b> <b>factor</b> {{is almost}} always greater than 1 since all {{components}} {{would have to be}} on simultaneously at full load for it to be one. The aggregate load [...] is time dependent as well as being dependent upon equipment characteristics. The <b>diversity</b> <b>factor</b> recognizes that the whole load does not equal {{the sum of its parts}} due to this time interdependence (i.e. diverseness). For example, we might have ten air conditioning units that are 20 tons each at a facility. In Florida we typically assume that the average full load equivalent operating hours for the units are 2000 hours per year. However, since the units are each thermostatically controlled, we do not know exactly when each unit turns on. If the ten units are substantially bigger than the facility's actual peak A/C load, then fewer than all ten units will likely come on at once. Thus, even though each unit runs a total of 2000 hours a year, they do not all come on at the same time to affect the facility's peak load. The <b>diversity</b> <b>factor</b> gives us a correction factor to use, which results in a lower total kW load for the ten A/C units. If the energy balance we do for this facility comes out within reason, but the demand balance shows far too many kW for the peak load, then we can use the <b>diversity</b> <b>factor</b> to bring the kW into line with the facility's true peak load. The <b>diversity</b> <b>factor</b> does not affect the kWh; it only affects the kW.|$|E

Occupants’ locations within a building vary throughout the day and this distribution can be valuable information when evaluating demand control strategies. Occupancy <b>diversity</b> <b>factors</b> have not been studied as extensively as for example lighting and plug loads <b>diversity</b> <b>factors.</b> Some reasons for fewer studies of occupancy is limitations accessing existing occupancy datasets and challenges interpreting the data. In a research building at UC Berkeley, we were able to add sets of passive infrared (PIR) or motion sensing for occupancy and carbon dioxide sensors in 67 private offices and 2 conference rooms, as well as in multiple open offices. In this work we study deterministic and stochastic building occupancy models based on data from the deployed sets of sensors. Data is analyzed to show major variations of occupancy <b>diversity</b> <b>factors</b> in private offices and conference rooms for time of day, day of the week, holidays, and month of the year. The impact on the building electrical load is highlighted: people usually operate electric lights, computers, and other common office devices when in a space, and this equipment is often turned off or in sleep mode when the space is not occupied. The <b>diversity</b> <b>factors</b> presented in this study can differ as much as 40 % from those published in the literature or in the latest ASHRAE energy cost method guidelines, a document commonly used by energy modelers for building simulations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{professional}} use {{and implementation of}} social media or social media related applications are booming. Solutions like business internal communities promise to connect employees in a more flexible way than old-fashioned mailing lists or static network drives ever could. New solutions are perceived to support communication independent from time and space and in allow a more flexible way of communicating direct as well as indirect through the offer of different communication media (chat, voice over IP, mail, blog, etc.). But in contrast to remarkably good application scenarios, reality is not keeping up. Therefore more investigations of usage conditions and acceptance parameters are needed {{to find out which}} showstoppers interfere with a successful implementation. Due to the fact that acceptance by future users is one core condition for a successful implementation of software within operational structures and processes, this paper presents a study with focus on motivational issues to use business communities depending on <b>diversity</b> <b>factors.</b> In this study the focus is set on the <b>diversity</b> <b>factors</b> age, gender, social media expertise, achievement motivation, and perceived locus of control over technology (ploc). First results revealed that the classical user diversity variables age and gender do not influence the motives to use business communities. In contrast technology related <b>diversity</b> <b>factors</b> and achievement motivation revealed correlations with usage motives (r >. 3).

The factory specification of transformers for the optimization of load losses versus no-load losses is dependent directly on the characteristics of the load profile that the transformer is expected to be subjected to.

50|$|Dynamic Demand: Advance {{or delay}} {{appliance}} operating cycles {{by a few}} seconds to increase the <b>diversity</b> <b>factor</b> of the set of loads. The concept is that by monitoring the power factor of the power grid, as well as their own control parameters, individual, intermittent loads would switch on or off at optimal moments to balance the overall system load with generation, reducing critical power mismatches. As this switching would only advance or delay the appliance operating cycle by a few seconds, it would be unnoticeable to the end user. In the United States, in 1982, a (now-lapsed) patent for this idea was issued to power systems engineer Fred Schweppe. This type of dynamic demand control is frequently used for air-conditioners. One example of this is through the SmartAC program in California.|$|E
