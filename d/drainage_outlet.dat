25|$|The Salt Lake {{community}} is {{built in the}} larger and easternmost of three overlapping, low profile, tuff cones or volcanic craters: Makalapa, Āliamanu and Āliapa‘akai. A lake, at one time 1.5km across (20 ha) but very shallow, formed {{in the bowl of}} Āliapa‘akai fed by freshwater springs or possibly seawater seepages (Alexander, 1926 in Maciolek, 1982). Because the lake had no outlet, water loss was largely by evaporation, concentrating salts. Up until 1910, the lake was regularly so salty that salt deposits formed around the shore. In that year, an artesian well was dug to bring the water level higher (and salt content lower) for use as a mullet pond; a tunnel, dug through the southeast rim of the crater, controlled water level and provided an outlet (Macdonald, Abbott, and Peterson. 1983). This act and later construction of a larger <b>drainage</b> <b>outlet,</b> eventually removed the salt from Salt Lake.|$|E

Nine permanent lakes are found in the park and it is dissected by a network of rivers and streams. The larger rivers are the Luwombwa, Mulembo, Kasanka, Mulaushi and the swampy Musola River.

2500|$|Portlethen Moss is {{considered}} a raised bog, because its general situation is on higher ground, {{at the edge of}} the Mounth, a coastal mountain spur of the Grampian Mountains overlooking the North Sea. [...] There are rock outcrops and strewn boulders relict from the glacial age at this site. [...] Elevations within the Portlethen Moss range from approximately 35 to 60 metres above sea level. [...] Formation of this moss has occurred due to extensive sets of depressions in the underlying rock formations of Old Red Sandstone. [...] The entire water composition of the bog thus has been provided by precipitation with no source of surface runoff, since the topography reduces to lower elevations in every direction. [...] Due to the high winds, moderate precipitation and cool temperatures that generally prevail, conditions are favourable for formation of an acid bog, since water stagnates, but eventually evaporates with ensuing acidity enhancement of decaying organic matter.

40|$|The Midwestern United States is {{dominated}} by agricultural production with high concentrations of swine, leading to application of swine manure onto lands with artificial subsurface drainage. Previous reports have indicated elevated levels of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in surface water and groundwater around confined animal feeding operations which administer antimicrobials. While previous {{studies have examined the}} occurrence of ARGs around confined swine feeding operations, little information is known how their transport from tile-drained fields receiving swine manure application impacts downstream environments. To further our knowledge in this area, water samples were collected from five locations in the agriculturally dominated South Fork Iowa River Watershed with approximately 840, 000 swine present in the 76, 000 ha basin. Samples were collected monthly from three stream sites and two main artificial subsurface <b>drainage</b> <b>outlets.</b> Samples were analyzed for macrolide resistance genes ermB, ermF and 16 S rRNAgene abundance using qPCR. Abundance of erm genes ranged from below limits of quantification to 3 ̆e 107 copies 100 mL− 1 water. Eighty-nine percent of stream water samples contained one of these two ARGs. Results indicate significantly more ermB and ermF in main <b>drainage</b> <b>outlets</b> than stream samples when normalized by 16 S rRNA abundance (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001).

40|$|River {{management}} in agricultural settings has undergone profound changes in recent years, {{particularly in the}} Midwest. A better integration of hydrogeomorphological principles has led to novel approaches with the two-stage channel design for small agricultural streams being among the best examples. The applicability of these innovative techniques in Quebec remains to be tested. We conducted detailed analyses of streams in agricultural areas located in Montérégie (Quebec) to determine the impacts {{of a change in}} the trapezoidal channel profile. A particular emphasis was put on the subsurface <b>drainage</b> <b>outlets</b> which often limit the degree of adjustment of these small streams. These impacts were analyzed by hydrodynamic modeling (HEC-RAS) and a hydraulic geometry approach. Findings confirm the improvement of surface drainage for high magnitude floods, but also identify a potentially endemic problem in Quebec where, due to the rectangular shape of agricultural fields (an inheritance from French settlements), very deep subsurface <b>drainage</b> <b>outlets</b> are in conflict with natural floodplain generation within the straightened channels. Alternative measures to accommodate for natural fluvial adjustments while maintaining drainage efficiency were explored. One potential approach would be to create small pocket wetlands along the streams that would provide increased heterogeneity and limit the need to dredge agricultural streams over long distances. Lastly, crop yields within fluvial corridors were greatly influenced by flood connectivity, with markedly reduced yields in near-stream zones. This indicates that acquisition costs for critical riparian land could be greatly diminished for many of the critical areas needed for hydrogeomorphological processes to operate...|$|R

40|$|We model {{sediment}} isopach grids for {{the southern}} Pacific margin of West Antarctica {{on the basis of}} a compilation of more than 10, 000 km of single-channel and multichannel seismic reflection data and correlations with ocean drilling sites. Following recent seismic stratigraphic models, we differentiate two main sequences, the upper of which alone is defined by seismostratigraphic indications for frequent grounded ice advances to the shelf edge off West Antarctica. The subsequent modeling of sediment thickness grids allows us to compare the pre-glacially dominated and glacially dominated sedimentary development of the study area. On the basis of available age constraints from drilling sites, we assume the onset of accumulation of sediments on the continental rise that were supplied by frequent advances of grounding ice on the continental shelf to have occurred at about 10 Ma. The thickest glacial sediment accumulations occur in front of major glacial <b>drainage</b> <b>outlets,</b> i. e., Marguerite Trough on the western Antarctic Peninsula margin, Belgica Trough in the Bellingshausen Sea, and a depression on the inner and middle shelves off Pine Island Bay in the Amundsen Sea.

40|$|Mathematical {{analyses}} {{were used to}} develop a stochastic model that predicts the influence of some hydraulic and hydrologic parameters on the perennial flooding of {{some parts of the}} Calabar Metropolis. The model was developed based on rainfall data, cross sectional area of drains, artificial drainage density, degree imperviousness and the gradient (slope). Incorrect sizing and spread of drains as well as the existing slopes employed in the generation of the drains’ invert during construction have been seen as some of the key factors that foster flooding in the Metropolis. Malalignment of the drains with the existing outlet does not help the expected discharge of storm runoff to receiving bodies, nor is the density of the existing drains adequate to accommodate the storm runoff generated in the Metropolis. Sequel to these, revisiting the Calabar Master Plan of 1972 with the original design for six <b>drainage</b> <b>outlets</b> is recommended.

The wetlands identified on the cap are man-induced, atypical situation wetlands. These areas have hydrophytic vegetation and wetland hydrology, but the soils do not have hydric characteristics.
