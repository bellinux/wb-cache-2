5|$|From the Lindley Library, Stearn (see 1950 Photograph) {{moved to}} the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, {{and by the time}} he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now {{achieved}} his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications,</b> enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the Museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the Museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the Dicotyledons in the Bentham & Hooker system, i.e. Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the Museum's Flora of Jamaica and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the Flora of Jamaica had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of field work in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on Allium, Lilium and Paeonia. He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the Museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.|$|E

30|$|In the following, {{we relax}} the {{assumption}} of a homogeneous elasticity of substitution between migrants and natives over <b>formal</b> <b>qualification</b> levels. Indeed, {{we are able to}} reject homogeneity: migrants and natives with low <b>formal</b> <b>qualification</b> show—with an inverse elasticity of approximately 0.01 across all tasks, and a significantly higher value only in interactive tasks—higher substitutability than migrants and natives with medium or high <b>formal</b> <b>qualification</b> level. For migrants and natives with medium <b>formal</b> <b>qualification,</b> we find that they are relatively better substitutes in manual tasks and relatively worse substitutes in interactive tasks. This comes hardly at a surprise. Supposedly, formal degrees and certificates are pretty important when carrying out certain manual tasks, e.g. a German high-voltage certificate for an electrician as a prerequisite for insurance protection; a migrant with the German vocational degree has proven these formal requirements. For interactive tasks, (German) language competence and behaviour according to social and cultural norms seem more relevant. Here, natives have a natural advantage. Among the high-qualified, interactive tasks are often bi- or multilingual, dealing with international affairs and teams under various cultural backgrounds; thus, it is not clear if natives have an advantage at this qualification level. Surprisingly, we find relative to the non-routine and interactive tasks, less elastic migrant-native substitution among high-skilled in routine tasks (both, analytical routine and manual routine). A reason for this finding could be that these tasks are of particular importance in highly complex occupations characterised either by strongly limited access (e.g. pharmacists and physicians) or by particular knowledge of German law (jobs in public administrations or related to the court). Overall, we provide evidence that migrants and natives are more or less perfect substitutes in most tasks if we account adequately for <b>formal</b> <b>qualification.</b> Further, they are not far from imperfect substitutability in interactive tasks requiring medium <b>formal</b> <b>qualification,</b> analytical tasks with medium qualification, as well as analytical-routine and manual-routine tasks carried out by employees with college/university degree.|$|R

3000|$|... the {{substitution}} elasticities between {{different groups of}} labour at a certain CES sub-aggregate level—e.g., between migrants and natives in low-skilled employment with manual routine tasks—we employ a strategy similar to Card and Lemieux (2001) and D’Amuri et al. (2010). In the present paper, we modify the overall log-wage equation from D’Amuri et al. (2010) with regard to two aspects. Firstly, we add the task level as an additional intermediate level of disaggregation; here, we test various specifications where {{to put it in}} (whether as a substitute for <b>formal</b> <b>qualification,</b> at a level beyond <b>formal</b> <b>qualification</b> but above experience, or at a level below experience).

Qualification is crucial, indeed, if we consider different task groups: migrants and natives with low <b>formal</b> <b>qualification</b> show higher substitutability than migrants and natives with medium or high <b>formal</b> <b>qualification.</b> With regard to migrants and natives with medium qualification, we find that they are better substitutes in manual tasks and relatively worse substitutes in interactive tasks.
