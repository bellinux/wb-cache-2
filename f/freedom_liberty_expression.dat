2500|$|Human {{rights are}} [...] "basic {{rights and freedoms}} to which all humans are entitled."

50|$|These {{laid down}} two {{distinct}} lines of Enlightenment thought: the moderate variety, following Descartes, Locke and Christian Wolff which sought accommodation between {{reform and the}} traditional systems of power and faith and the radical enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza, advocating democracy, individual <b>liberty,</b> <b>freedom</b> of <b>expression,</b> and eradication of religious authority The moderate variety tended to be deistic whereas the radical tendency separated the basis of morality entirely from theology. Both lines of thought were eventually opposed by a conservative Counter-Enlightenment, which sought a return to faith.|$|R
40|$|For {{a number}} of years now, Belgium has been a country of Muslim immigration, whereas, traditionally, Egypt has been a multi-religious country. Nevertheless, these two {{countries}} have their legal systems of Romano-Germanic origin in common. On the other hand, the attitude of the authorities (including the legal authorities) in dealing with institutions and legal pluralism, and more especially the role of Islamic norms seen as a source of law, cannot be explained in the same fashion. In Belgium, recourse to the protection of basic rights (religious <b>freedom,</b> <b>liberty</b> of <b>expression)</b> enables the tribunals, on a case to case basis, to apply the rules of a form of legislation put forward as Islamic. In Egypt, on the contrary, an internal situation which superimposes Islamic law (shari'a) on positive legislation enables both those brought before the court and the judges to act on different normative levels. We first establish the context within which the role-players (both Belgian and Egyptian) on the legal scene took recourse to the Islamic origins of law. By so doing, we should like to offer a comparative reading {{of the way in which}} the courts and the tribunals in the two countries handled legal adherences and identities. This comparison will be supported by a concrete example taken from recent jurisprudence: the issue of whether headscarves may be worn in state schools...|$|R
40|$|The term {{liberalism}} {{describes a}} set of principles, ideologies, and practices that initially evolved out of distinct cultural and historical circumstances in the Western world in the 16 th and 17 thcs. During this period, the principles upheld and defended by free institutions as they struggled against absolutist and totalitarian states resulted {{in the emergence of}} basic liberal values such as the protection of individual <b>liberty,</b> <b>freedom</b> of <b>expression,</b> rights to private property, rule of law, an unconstrained market economy, and a desire to limit the power of the state. Organizing society according to such values has significant implications for human development across the lifespan. This entry describes the ways in which contemporary manifestation of liberal values has shaped social and institutional structures and discusses the potential impact on human development in childhood and adolescence, adulthood, and older adulthood...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at analizing the {{interdisciplinary}} association between administration and education {{under the assumption}} that <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> are essential to political, social and human development. This association can only exist if managers and educators accept <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> in their daily practices. Such a conclusion has been arrived at by reviewing the literature produced by authors who have emphasized <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> as inerent values to human beings. A model based on <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> was built both for administrators and educators. Data were collected from interviews with students in courses taught by the authors and by department heads in the municipal education agency in Rio de Janeiro. The main conclusion is that the association between administration and education goes beyond simple common missions and objectives. Due to the fact that <b>freedom</b> and <b>liberty</b> are essential to development in both fields, administration and education are really integrated and unassociated...|$|R
