40|$|This paper {{presents}} a coordinated voltage control scheme (CVCS) for {{a cluster of}} offshore wind power plants connected to a voltage-source converter-based <b>high-voltage</b> <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>system.</b> The primary control point of the proposed voltage control scheme is the introduced Pilot bus, which is having the highest short-circuit capacity in the offshore AC grid. The developed CVCS comprehends an optimization algorithm, aiming for minimum active power losses in the offshore grid, to generate voltage reference to the Pilot bus. During the steady-state operation, the Pilot bus voltage is controlled by dispatching reactive power references to each wind turbine (WT) in the wind power plant cluster based on their available reactive power margin and network sensitivity-based participation factors, which are derived from the dV/dQ sensitivity of a WT bus w. r. t. the Pilot bus. This method leads to the minimization {{of the risk of}} undesired effects, particularly overvoltage at the terminals of the WT located far away from the AC collector substation, by dispatching lower reactive power references compared with the ones nearer to the substation. In addition, this paper proposes a control strategy for improved voltage ride through capability of WTs for faults in the offshore grid, thus leading to improved dynamic voltage profile in the offshore AC grid...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel commutation failure (CF) assessment method considering {{the influences of}} voltage magnitude drop, phase shift, and spatial-temporal discreteness of AC system faults. The commutating voltage-time area is employed to analyze the spatial-temporal discreteness of AC system faults causing CF in <b>high-voltage</b> <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>systems,</b> and the influences of fault position and fault time on CF are revealed.

50|$|The {{electrical}} grid, {{which is}} normally three-phase AC, can be severely disrupted {{by the presence}} of a large DC bias. This is caused by strong solar flares hitting the Earth's atmosphere, which in turn creates strong electromagnetic fields. This induces voltages in long-distance electrical lines, which can be strong enough to arc across transformers. (Even pipelines, such as the mostly above-ground Alaska Pipeline, are prone to this, and must be tied to electrical ground with zinc sacrificial anodes.) This is a rare but serious problem, mostly for far northern locations like Canada and Scandinavia, where a strong aurora borealis will cover much lower latitudes than normal during such a situation. Space weather forecasts are used to predict when these geomagnetic storm events might occur. <b>High-voltage</b> <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>systems</b> have their own control gear at conversion stations and can adapt somewhat better to such conditions.

Therefore, this paper considers an emerging hybrid cascaded converter that offers the dc side short circuit proof feature at reduced loss and footprint compared to the existing multilevel and other hybrid converters. Its operating principle, modulation and capacitor voltage balancing strategies are described in detail. Furthermore, hybrid converter scalability to high voltage applications is investigated. The validity of the modulation and capacitor voltage strategy presented are confirmed using simulation and experimentation. The hybrid cascaded converter is extendable to a large number of cells, making it applicable to high voltage applications, and operation is independent of modulation index and power factor.

The MIIF represents the interaction between the rectifiers and inverters, but not for the whole system. In this work, a method to assess the interaction of the whole system was therefore studied. To decide on the location of the new HVDC transmission system at the planning stage, in consideration of the interaction of the existing DC system, the line flow change distribution factor, according to the HVDC-transmission capacity change, was examined. Also, a power system transient -stability analysis was performed with different HVDC system locations, depending on the distribution factor.
