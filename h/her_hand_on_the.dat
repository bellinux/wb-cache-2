5|$|Altgens recovered, and {{his next}} {{photograph}} showed the First Lady with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's trunk lid and Secret Service agent Clint Hill {{standing on the}} bumper behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate. This photograph was quickly reproduced {{on the front pages}} of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E

25|$|The time is 9.20pm. Sir Roger is {{enclosed}} {{in his study}} {{at the back of}} the hall. Dr. Sheppard was with him but Parker told Mrs. Ackroyd that he left earlier and, as far as she knows, Sir Roger is now alone. Flora follows her mother to bed and Raymond and Parker hear Sir Roger's voice coming from the other side of the door as he somewhat stiltedly tells an unknown person that he can give them no money as they require. Blunt enters from the terrace and he and Raymond go to the billiard room. Parker switches off the hall lights and leaves momentarily but re-enters a moment later to see Flora with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study door. She tells the butler that she has said goodnight to her uncle and that he doesn’t want to be disturbed. The two leave.|$|E

500|$|Duane starts Wham!'s [...] "Wham Rap!"; Janet [...] "listens" [...] {{by placing}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> speaker, until Greg quizzes her on lay-offs. Connie takes Duane's phone to text Janet, and Roger returns with shots, which he drinks alone. Janet's text from [...] "Duane" [...] asks her to sing him a song if she likes him. Watched by Janet, Connie tells Greg {{to make a}} choice between her and Fran. Roger starts Rainbow's [...] "Since You Been Gone" [...] and Greg conspires with Connie and Fran to acquire the {{envelope}}. Roger, having danced with Connie, is aroused, but Duane says that all the pills were Tic Tacs. Greg finally reaches the envelope, and Fran's name is circled. Roger reveals that the envelope contains divorce papers; his wife is leaving him. Fran sings [...] "I Know Him So Well" [...] (Elaine Paige and Barbara Dickson), first to Roger and then Greg. She duets with Connie, and, hugging Fran, Greg mouths to Connie that Fran is getting sacked. Connie and Fran, the latter oblivious, sing to each other, as Roger signs his divorce papers. When the song finishes, Greg sombrely talks to Fran.|$|E
500|$|Santiago Fouz-Hernández {{wrote in}} his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna {{throughout}} the video {{to come to the}} correct decision. Fouz-Hernández explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her. When the singer accidentally cuts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dagger, it was described as receiving stigmata by scholar Robert McQueen Grant, who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an important role to play in the narrative. This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hernández, noted that the woman cries out for help when Madonna sings the line [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save. Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a complicity of [...] "White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed for being on the streets at night, Black men are nevertheless thrown in jail." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two brasses. [...] One, in the vestry, shows Ann Kenwellmersh (d. 1633) with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head of her nine-year-old {{grandson}} Menelab Rainsford (d. 1627). [...] The other, in the Parham chapel, is of Thomas Bishop (d. 1559), {{the first}} of the family to lease the rectory. [...] Also in the Parham chapel is a monument to Thomas's grandson Henry Bishop, the Postmaster General. [...] Two memorial tablets inside the church, on the right as you walk through the door from the porch, name the 60 men of the parish who died in the First World War, and the 14 who died in the Second World War.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{before the}} start of the final, a spectator threw a plastic beer bottle at the {{competitors}} in the starting blocks. Though the race was unaffected, he was arrested. The man, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, happened to be sitting next to Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, who promptly struck him with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of his head after the toss. LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: [...] "I'm not suggesting vigilantism but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player". Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court. He was later found guilty.|$|E
2500|$|Utamaro {{achieves}} a strong compositional balance despite the painting's complexity. [...] He distributes 27 figures throughout it amongst several buildings, {{such as a}} teahouse duplexes and a second-storey restaurant-teahouse at the left. [...] The main building {{appears to be a}} two-story restaurant-teahouse; the picture focuses on an atrium with a garden court in the middle surrounded by railings, revealing the snowy outdoors. [...] With the exception of the young boy who reaches out at a cat in the lower left, all the figures are women, though in real life the guests of a pleasure house would be men. [...] Several of the figures pose {{in a manner similar to}} those in the book Seirō Ehon Nenjū Gyōji (1804) that Utamaro illustrated around the time he completed this painting, such as the woman looking behind her in the hallway in the centre, the woman with her arm wrapped around a pillar in the centre, and the woman crouched down near her with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railing, looking to the right behind her.|$|E
