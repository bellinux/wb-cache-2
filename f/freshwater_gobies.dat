Standard method of collection of gobies was done. Interviews with semi-structured questionnaires were used to know the conservation measures of the residents. Ten goby species belonging to three families namely, Family Eleotridae (Belobranchus belobranchus), Giuris margaritacea, and Oxyeleotris lineolata, Family Gobiidae (Awaous melanocephalus), Awaous ocellaris, Glossogobius celebius, Glossogobius giuris, Periophthalmus barbarus and Sicyopterus lagocephalus, and Family Rhyacichthyidae (Rhyacichthys aspro), can be an alternative source of food and livelihood. They were caught by-catch, while employing some destructive fishing methods like cyanide fishing, electric fishing, and use of fine mesh nets. The awareness of the residents to the adverse impacts of water pollution, unregulated human activities, and destructive fishing had strengthened their conservation measures. A multi-stakeholder management approach is created through concerted proactive conservation measures like protection of the goby population, the river-riparian ecosystems, enhanced scientific information, and the legal intervention of the local government...|$|E
40|$|<b>Freshwater</b> <b>gobies</b> of {{tropical}} islands are amphidromous : adults reproduce in rivers and larvae passively drift {{down to the}} sea immediately after hatching. Describing the phenology of this larval drift is essential to understanding the population dynamics of amphidromous gobies and to developing ecologically based recommendations for managing the watersheds. The larval drift patterns of two amphidromous gobies of Runion Island, Sicyopterus lagocephalus and Cotylopus acutipinnis, were studied {{on a monthly basis}} for 1 year using plankton nets at two sites on the Mat River, located 20 km and 7 km from the river mouth. Genetic analyses showed that larval assemblages were dominated at 90 % by S. lagocephalus, although the proportion of C. acutipinnis increased during early summer. Our findings highlighted a marked larval drift peak in full austral summer. The diel larval drift dynamic was described using periodic linear models. A diel pattern was only observed downstream, peaking a few hours after sunset. Finally, this study presents a new approach that improves standard methods for sampling and analyzing larval drift of amphidromous species...|$|E

40|$|Noise is an {{important}} theoretical constraint {{on the evolution of}} signal form and sensory performance. In order to determine environmental constraints on the communication of two <b>freshwater</b> <b>gobies</b> Padogobius martensii and Gobius nigricans, numerous noise spectra weremeasured from quiet areas and ones adjacent to waterfalls and rapids in two shallow stony streams. Propagation of goby sounds and waterfall noise was also measured. A quiet window around 100 Hz is present in many noise spectra from noisy locations. The window lies between two noise sources, a low-frequency one attributed to turbulence, and a high-frequency one (200 – 500 Hz) attributed to bubble noise from water breaking the surface. Ambient noise from a waterfall (frequencies below 1 kHz) attenuates as much as 30 dB between 1 and 2 m, after which values are variable without further attenuation (i. e., buried in the noise floor). Similarly, courtship sounds of P. martensii attenuate as much as 30 dB between 5 and 50 cm. Since gobies are known to court in noisy as well as quiet locations in these streams, their acoustic communication system (sounds and auditory system) must be able to cope with short-range propagation dictated by shallow depths and ambient noise in noisy locations...|$|E
40|$|The {{representatives of}} Pisces family, namely Gobidae are an {{important}} component of aquatic ecosystems. With a wide range of adaptation, this group has mastered the different types of fish ponds from completely fresh to the ocean. However, some species are found both in one and in other waters, displaying different (and sometimes conflicting) between a life strategy. Last relating to the four main components of the life of fish: water-salt metabolism, nutrition, respiration and reproduction. Mechanisms for implementing these different functions together. First, different concentrations of salts require different types of water- salt metabolism. Another equally important factor is the food base, which is also quite different, both in range and the nature of food. In the sea and reservoirs, over rivers, dissolved oxygen in the water is stratified, and very often in the summer and winter time is in short supply. For bulls, as the bottom of vertebrates, this fact is choking on a large scale. Moreover, in these bodies of water, {{there are a number of}} abiotic and biotic factors, which have different requirements in the process of reproduction. The totality of the above conditions vital for fish of Gobidae, makes the need for populations in the gene pool of potential adaptations to survive in those or other settings. Literature data of recent years, the enlargement of habitat bulls, indicating the presence of adaptations. In reservoirs in Ukraine in modern conditions the optimal conditions for Sandpiper observed in the Azov Sea. This contributes greatly to the optimal forage which has emerged over the last decade due to the desalination of sea and favorable conditions for reproduction. In the transition from marine to freshwater Sandpiper flagged fundamentally different and very diverse in every way possible. The difference in environmental conditions differently reflected in the life Bychkov fish, affecting their growth, development and other physiological processes. The result of this effect is the difference in weight, size and body parts. To clarify, as our model species was taken Cottus Sandpiper (Neogobius fluviatilis Pallas). The reason for this was the fact that this species, along with other Ponto- Caspian solonovato - <b>freshwater</b> <b>gobies,</b> the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified as species biology are poorly understood and require further research. This fact that deepened interest of ichthyologists in this group of fish, in this regard appeared in the literature as material for the bulls and in Sandpiper. Based on the above, the purpose of this paper is a comparative morphometric parameters characteristic of individuals of this species of fresh and salt water bodies of Ukraine. All this affects the absolute morphometric parameters, which decrease in the direction from sea to the river. However, it should be noted that in rivers with rich feeding grounds sheer size of some individuals close to the size and species of sea Kakhovskoe reservoir. This situation is observed in the Sandpiper Grouse River. Here are some specimens reach a length (TL) 118 - 148 mm and a weight of 15 - 36 g, Kakhovskoe Reservoir: 106 - 150 mm 11 - 38 g, in the Sea of ​​Azov: 115 - 174 mm 17 - 58 g. For relative parameters Sandpiper with these reservoirs are more similar, however, for some of them, there are differences. Among the latter is most clearly distinguished the ratio SL / N. This indicator podovzhenist (prohonystist) body. As pointed out by VP Mitrofanov (1977), this indicator shows the hydrodynamic qualities of fish: the larger the index, the more active lifestyle is individual. When compared with individuals with a little water and a large stream, in the latter case, individuals are more elongated. This is confirmed by our material: the ratio SL / L for the smallest species of sea of ​​Azov (4. 96), slightly more for Kakhovsky reservoir (5. 52) and even more for rivers Grouse, Trubizh, Desna, Ros (respectively 5, 86, 6. 22, 6. 26, 6. 44). This article directly deals with the analysis of morphometric parameters of monkey go-by (Neogobius fluviatilis Pallas, 1814) which comes from the Sea of Azov, Kakhovka reservoir and such rivers as Trubizh, Teteriv, Ros and Desna. The cluster analysis in 14 morphometric parameters shoved a significant difference between the sea, reservoir and river populations. The fresh water species show a tendency to be smaller in size and in weight. At the same time it was revealed the increase of mentioned above parameters, especially in rivers, where there is a rich food supply, which indicates the increase of moving into fresh water by this species.
