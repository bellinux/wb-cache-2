40|$|A {{simple system}} for sensing {{temperature}} in multiple zones {{based on a}} multi-wavelength Brillouin fiber laser ring is presented. Optical <b>fiber</b> <b>reels</b> are serially concatenated and divided in zones (one per sensing area). Setting the Brillouin lasing in each spool of fiber generates a characteristic wavelength {{that depends on the}} fiber properties and the temperature in the zone. Thus, it is possible to measure temperature independently and accurately through heterodyne detection between two narrow laser signals. The proposed sensor integrates the temperature along the whole spool of fiber in each zone. These real time measurements were successfully checked in our laboratory...|$|E

40|$|The spun-out {{silk fiber}} {{consists}} of two fibroin filaments that are cemented together by sericin coating. The serine-rich sericins, which make 20 - 30 % of the cocoon silk proteins in Bombyx mori, are dissolved in hot water during silk <b>fiber</b> <b>reeling</b> from the cocoon. The sericin extract is usually discarded. Only small amounts are currently used in cosmetics and lately also as replacement of bovine serum products in the cell culture media. The use in culture media is hindered by poor standardization of the extracts. To overcome this problem, we attempted preparation of several recombinant proteins based on partial sequences of {{one out of the}} three sericin genes of Bombyx mori, sericin 3. Translation product of the Ser 3 gene is extremely serine-rich with a relatively high representation of the aspartate, asparagin, glutamate, and glutamine. Using specific primers we have prepared a cDNAs of 267, 279, 525, 672, and 528 bp, respectively, derived from the Ser 3 gene. The cDNAs were cloned and expressed as fusion proteins with hexahistidine in Escherichia coli. The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis. Ser 3 gene contain repetitive motifs rich in serine and including some charged amino acids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNaturally colored silks are not {{durable and}} apt to fade during fabric {{processing}} and home laundering {{due to the}} unstable pigment composition and the accumulation of pigment in the surface sericin layer. In this study, the pigment of naturally yellow-colored silk was isolated, characterized and quantified. A dominant pigment composition identified by NMR analysis was all-trans-lutein and other five components were identified as all-trans-neoxanthin, all-trans-violaxanthin, all-trans-α-carotene, all-trans-β-carotene and 9 -cis-β-carotene, according to their characteristic UV–Vis spectra and EI-MS data. All six carotenoids were accumulated in sericin layer and exhibited a remarkable decrease in total content in the outer layer (220  μg/g), middle layer (117  μg/g) and inner layer (50  μg/g) of the cocoon shell as determined by analyzing the <b>reeled</b> <b>fiber</b> {{from one end to}} the other...|$|R
40|$|A {{distributed}} sensor {{using an}} optical fiber for detecting and locating intruders over long perimeters (> 10 km) is described. Phase changes resulting {{from either the}} pressure of the intruder on the ground immediately above the buried fiber or from seismic disturbances in the vicinity are sensed by a phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer (??OTDR). Light pulses from a cw laser operating in a single longitudinal mode and with low (MHz/min range) frequency drift are injected into one end of the single mode fiber, and the backscattered light is monitored with a photodetector. In laboratory tests with 12 km of <b>fiber</b> on <b>reels,</b> the effects of localized phase perturbations induced by a piezoelectric fiber stretcher on ??OTDR traces were characterized. In field tests in which the sensing element is a single mode fiber in a 3 -mm diameter cable buried in an 8 to 18 inch deep, 4 inch wide trench in clay soil, detection of intruders on foot up to 15 ft from the cable line was achieved. In desert terrain field tests in which the sensing fiber is in a 4. 5 -mm diameter cable buried in a 1 ft deep, 2. 5 ft wide trench filled with loose sand, high sensitivity and consistent detection of intruders on foot and of vehicles traveling down a road near the cable line was realized over a cable length of 8. 5 km and a total fiber path of 19 km in real time. In a final series of field tests in clay soil, phase changes produced by the steps of a person walking up to 15 ft away from the buried cable were observed, and vehicles traveling at 10 mph were consistently detected up to 300 ft away. Based on these results, this technology may be regarded as a candidate for providing low-cost perimeter security for nuclear power plants, electrical power distribution centers, storage facilities for fuel and volatile chemicals, communication hubs, airports, government offices, military bases, embassies, and national borders...|$|R
40|$|Optimized by Nature for {{millions}} of years, silk {{is one of the}} strongest biomaterials with outstanding mechanical properties, it is both extensible and tough in order to ensure specific functions. In particular, protein-based Bombyx mori silkworm silk's stiffness is originated from the crystalline region of the semi-crystalline fibroin and the extensibility from the length hidden within the amorphous region. The silk fiber is coated with sericin which acts as a glue connecting fibers together and as a matrix in the three-dimensional nonwoven multi-layer composite structure of the cocoon. These properties can be engineered and enhanced with forced reeling silk: fast spun silks are stiffer and less extensible than slow reeled silk. For this study, two-dimensional single cocoon layer webs are created by silkworms and tested under an increasing wind load until failure, the deflections are recorded. To complement the experimental results, the web's structure is generated in two different models: straight fiber web and wavy fiber web models. Both models are studied under constant wind load for four type of <b>fibers</b> with different <b>reeling</b> speeds thus different mechanical properties. These tests indicate that the deflection increases with wind load for both the experiments and the simulations, but also that webs composed of fibers with different mechanical properties are not necessary stiffer and less extensible as the material they are composed of are stiffer and less extensible because of the high redundancy and randomness of the web structure. The divergence in results between the experiments and the simulations suggests the need to improve the models to be more in accordance with the real webs. by Isabelle Su. Thesis: M.
