40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{elevated}} temperatures on the compressive strength stress-strain relationship (stiffness) and <b>energy</b> absorption <b>capacities</b> (toughness) of concretes are presented. High-performance concretes (HPCs) were prepared in three series, with different cementitious material constitutions using plain ordinary Portland cement (PC), with and without metakaolin (MK) and silica fume (SF) separate replacements. Each series comprised a concrete mix, prepared without any fibers, and concrete mixes reinforced with either or both steel fibers and polypropylene (PP) fibers. The results showed that after exposure to 600 and 800 °C, the concrete mixes retained, respectively, 45 % and 23 % of their compressive strength, on average. The results also show that after the concrete was exposed to the elevated temperatures, the loss of stiffness was much quicker than the loss in compressive strength, but the loss of <b>energy</b> absorption <b>capacity</b> was relatively slower. A 20 % replacement of the cement by MK resulted in a higher compressive strength but a lower specific toughness, {{as compared with the}} concrete prepared with 10 % replacement of cement by SF. The MK concrete also showed quicker losses in the compressive strength, elastic modulus and <b>energy</b> absorption <b>capacity</b> after exposure to the elevated temperatures. Steel fibers approximately doubled the <b>energy</b> absorption <b>capacity</b> of the unheated concrete. They were effective in minimizing the degradation of compressive strength for the concrete after exposure to the elevated temperatures. The steel-fiber-reinforced concretes also showed the highest <b>energy</b> absorption <b>capacity</b> after the high-temperature exposure, although they suffered a quick loss of this capacity.

25|$|West Village, {{located on}} the University of California campus in Davis, California, was the largest ZNE-planned {{community}} in North America {{at the time of}} its opening in 2014. The development contains student housing for approximately 1,980 UC Davis students as well as leasable office space and community amenities including a community center, pool, gym, restaurant and convenience store. Office spaces in the development are currently leased by energy and transportation-related University programs. The project was a public-private partnership between the university and West Village Community Partnership LLC, led by Carmel Partners of San Francisco, a private developer, who entered into a 60-year ground lease with the university and was responsible for the design, construction, and implementation of the $300 million project, which is intended to be market-rate housing for Davis. This is unique as the developer designed the project to achieve ZNE at no added cost to themselves or to the residents. Designed and modeled to achieve ZNE, the project uses a mixture of passive elements (roof overhangs, well-insulated walls, radiant heat barriers, ducts in insulated spaces, etc.) as well as active approaches (occupancy sensors on lights, high-efficiency appliances and lighting, etc.). Designed to out-perform California's 2008 Title 24 energy codes by 50%, the project produced 87% of the energy it consumed during its first year in operation. The shortcoming in ZNE status is attributed to several factors, including improperly functioning heat pump water heaters, which have since been fixed. Occupant behavior is significantly different than anticipated, with the all-student population using more energy on a per-capita basis than typical inhabitants of single-family homes in the area. One of the primary factors driving increased energy use appears to be the increased miscellaneous electrical loads (MEL, or plug loads) in the form of mini-refrigerators, lights, computers, gaming consoles, televisions, and other electronic equipment. The university continues to work with the developer to identify strategies for achieving ZNE status. These approaches include incentivizing occupant behavior and increasing the site's renewable <b>energy</b> <b>capacity,</b> which is a 4 MW photovoltaic array per the original design. The West Village site is also home to the Honda Smart Home US, a beyond-ZNE single-family home that incorporates cutting-edge technologies in energy management, lighting, construction, and water efficiency.|$|E
