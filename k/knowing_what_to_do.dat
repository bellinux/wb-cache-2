25|$|Klingon-backed gorillas attack Kirk's team, {{who have}} taken {{position}} in the Klingons' store room but the attackers are defeated. However, they discover that in the fracas, a sniper rifle was taken. Taylor, Kirk and the Starfleet crew ride out to stop the Klingons, and prevent Kor from assassinating Ursus who has gone to talk down Marius. They defeat Kor and his colleagues, but the Klingons beam back up to their ship. Ursus and Marius fight, with Ursus victorious. Kirk and his team leave to pursue Kor, leaving the rifles {{in the hands of}} the gorillas who are no longer puppets of the Klingons. The Enterprise chase Kor's ship for three days, and find themselves back at the alternative Earth as the atmosphere is destroyed by a cobalt bomb which eradicates all life on the planet. The Enterprise pursues Kor back through the portal to their own universe. Meanwhile, Cornelius, Zira and Milo are in orbit on-board a primitive space vessel having witnessed the destruction below. Not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> they consult a tricorder left behind by Kirk's team which instructs them on how to travel through time using a slingshot effect.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

[...] "It's not easy getting over whatever your addiction may be," [...] she says. [...] "The whole point of that song is, the temptation is there, but I'm {{not going to give}} in to it." [...] When asked if the lyrics were regarding a drinking problem, Clarkson responded, [...] "I'm not an alcoholic; that's not what it's about. It's just a metaphor.

500|$|The mystery {{surrounding}} Mary Alice and {{her family}} was the main storyline in the first season of the series, and it is resolved in the first season finale. Cherry had wanted {{there to be a}} [...] "definite end" [...] to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that Twin Peaks suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season. ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill [...] Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), the woman whose child she had illegally purchased, prompting the writers to make Deirdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions. Although Mary Alice {{and her family}} do not have much of a leading storyline thereafter, the mystery surrounding the character's suicide in the inaugural season is said to have informed and influenced every other season of the series. In 2006, when asked during an interview what viewers could expect from Mary Alice for the series' third season, Strong said that the character was [...] "going to be back with an attitude", stating: [...] "She will be a little less surreal, ethereal and a little more sassy, which means the show is going to be sassier." [...] During the series' final season in 2011, the actress appears as Mary Alice's ghost to her suicidal friend Bree (Marcia Cross). Strong enjoyed filming that particular scene, as it was the only scene during the entire series that featured solely Mary Alice and Bree. She described the scene as one of her personal favorites and called it an [...] "extraordinary opportunity", saying: [...] "In a way, Mary Alice becomes [...] conscious and her guide and her muse in <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her life. And it was an exquisitely written scene and it was really, I think in my experience on the show, one of my favorite scenes I have ever shot." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitney first appears {{when she}} and her family—mother figure Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), {{half-sister}} Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith), and Bianca's sons Liam Butcher (James Forde) and Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs)—are evicted by their landlord. The children spend a week in care after Bianca is arrested for assaulting a police officer, returning to her custody a week later and moving into Pat Evans' (Pam St. Clement) house. Over the next few months, Bianca becomes the beneficiary of a mystery [...] "guardian angel", who is revealed to be Whitney. Whitney tells Bianca she found a winning lottery ticket, but kept it secret as she knew that Bianca would spend the money. Bianca reluctantly agrees to deposit the money; however Whitney hides some to be used in emergencies. It is revealed that Bianca's imprisoned boyfriend Tony King (Chris Coghill) has been grooming Whitney since she was 12 and that they have had a sexual relationship. Having served a year-long prison sentence for assaulting a boy who apparently harassed Whitney, Tony is released in September 2008. He makes it clear to Whitney that they will resume their sexual relationship, and Whitney reveals that she has kept some of the lottery winnings so they can run away together. When Bianca harangues him about the prospect of marriage, he gives her Whitney's money to put a down-payment on a flat. When Whitney and classmate Peter Beale (Thomas Law) are cast in a school play, Tony is jealous of them rehearsing in private and punches Peter. Whitney convinces Peter and his sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield) not to report the attack to the police, but Tony blames her for the incident and ends their affair. Devastated when Tony accepts Bianca's marriage proposal, Whitney locks herself in her bedroom. Not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Bianca accepts Dr Poppy Merritt's (Amy Darcy) help and she refers Whitney to a psychiatrist. Bianca takes her away on holiday, attempting to mend their relationship. When they return, Tony and Whitney share a passionate kiss, and Tony informs Whitney that their relationship is back on.|$|E
