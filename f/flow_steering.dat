50|$|A purely {{software-based}} {{implementation of}} the receiving traffic distribution, known as receive packet steering (RPS), distributes received traffic among cores later in the data path, {{as part of the}} interrupt handler functionality. Advantages of RPS over RSS include no requirements for specific hardware, more advanced traffic distribution filters, and reduced rate of interrupts produced by a NIC. As a downside, RPS increases the rate of inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). Receive <b>flow</b> <b>steering</b> (RFS) takes the software-based approach further by accounting for application locality; further performance improvements are achieved by processing interrupt requests by the same cores on which particular network packets will be consumed by the targeted application.|$|E

Purely software implementations also exist, such as the receive packet steering (RPS) and receive <b>flow</b> <b>steering</b> (RFS). [...] Further performance improvements can be achieved by routing the interrupt requests to the CPUs/cores executing the applications which are actually the ultimate destinations for network packets that generated the interrupts. That way, taking the application locality into account results in higher overall performance, reduced latency and better hardware utilization, resulting from the higher utilization of CPU caches and fewer required context switches.

About one third of TCs in the SCS move eastward, while the other two thirds move westward. In the TC genesis peak seasons of June-October (JJASO), the westward moving TCs are controlled by the background TC <b>steering</b> <b>flow</b> of easterly, and the eastward moving TCs by the TC <b>steering</b> <b>flow</b> induced by the ISO.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Recent {{studies have}} found that {{equatorial}} Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) variability may be influencing tropical Indian Ocean climate (Kucharski 2009, Wang 2009). Due to the economic and social impact of tropical cyclones, it is important to investigate how an Atlantic-Indian Ocean connection may be affecting tropical cyclone behavior in the southern Indian Ocean. In this study, the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrAC) tropical cyclone database is used to derive metrics of tropical cyclone behavior, which are then compared with indices of tropical Atlantic SST variability representing Atlantic Niño, and Benguela Niño events. Changes in tropical Atlantic SSTs are found to coincide with significant differences in tropical cyclone activity for portions of the southern Indian Ocean. In addition, for these same regions, tropical Atlantic SST variability is associated with changes in large-scale atmospheric conditions, including <b>steering</b> <b>flow,</b> low level vorticity, and humidity, typically associated with tropical cyclogenesis, and tropical cyclone track. The changes in <b>steering</b> <b>flow</b> related to both indices of Atlantic SST anomaly are reproduced by an atmospheric model.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{continuing}} {{advance of}} laser technology enables {{a range of}} broadly applicable, laser-based flow manipulation techniques. The characteristics of these laser-based flow manipulations suggest that they may augment, or be superior to, such traditional electro-mechanical methods as ionic flow control, shock tubes, and small scale wind tunnels. In this study, methodology was developed for investigating laser flow manipulation techniques, and testing their feasibility {{for a number of}} aerospace, basic physics, and micro technology applications. Theories for laser-atom and laser-molecule interactions have been under development since the advent of laser technology. The theories have yet to be adequately integrated into kinetic flow solvers. Realizing this integration would greatly enhance the scaling of laser-species interactions beyond the realm of ultra-cold atomic physics. This goal was realized in the present study. A representative numerical investigation, of laser-based neutral atomic and molecular flow manipulations, was conducted using near-resonant and non-resonant laser fields. To simulate the laser interactions over a range of laser and flow conditions, the following tools were employed: a custom collisionless gas particle trajectory code and a specifically modified version of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo statistical kinetic solver known as SMILE. In addition to the numerical investigations, a validating experiment was conducted. The experimental results showed good agreement with the numerical simulations when experimental parameters, such as finite laser line width, were taken into account. Several areas of interest were addressed: laser induced neutral <b>flow</b> <b>steering,</b> collimation, direct flow acceleration, and neutral gas heating. Near-resonant continuous wave laser, and non-resonant pulsed laser, interactions with cesium and nitrogen were simulated.; These simulations showed trends and some limitations associated with these interactions, used for <b>flow</b> <b>steering</b> and collimation. The use of one of these interactions, the induced dipole force, was extended beyond a single Gaussian laser field. The interference patterns associated with counter-propagating laser fields, or “optical lattices,” were shown to be capable of both direct species acceleration and gas heating. This study resulted in predictions for a continuous, resonant laser-cesium flow with accelerations of 106 m/s 2. For this circumstance, a future straightforward proof of principle experiment has been identified. To demonstrate non-resonant gas heating, a series of pulsed optical lattices were simulated interacting with neutral non-polar species.

One-dimensional and two-dimensional Fourier decompositions in a limited region (120 (o) long) and in a global region are compared with six wavenumber low-pass filters (1 - 6, 1 - 9, [...] ., 1 - 21). The measure of goodness of the environmental <b>steering</b> <b>flow</b> interpolated to the storm position was to determine the minimum standard deviation of the propagation vector (defined as difference between storm motion and the steering estimate) for all six storms and the ensemble.
