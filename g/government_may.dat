5|$|If {{the grand}} jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to {{the grand jury}}. Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury. But, the <b>government</b> <b>may</b> narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The <b>government</b> <b>may</b> not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local <b>government</b> <b>may</b> not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E

5|$|Article VII of the Constitution sets up {{the basic}} {{framework}} for the structure and function of local government in Virginia. Local <b>government</b> <b>may</b> be established at the town (population over 1000), city (population over 5000), county or regional government level. Article VII gives the General Assembly the power to create general laws for the organization and governing of these political subdivisions, except that regional governments cannot be created {{without the consent of}} the majority of the voters who vote on the issue in the region.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{a future}} <b>government</b> <b>may</b> {{overturn}} the statute enforcing property tax rate caps, Daniels {{and other state}} Republican leaders pressed for an amendment to add the new tax limits to the state constitution. The proposed amendment {{was placed on the}} 2010 General election ballot and was a major focus of Daniels' reelection campaign. In November 2010, voters elected to adopt the tax caps into the Indiana Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the Supreme Court {{announced}} the following test: the <b>government</b> <b>may</b> separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element {{that the other}} does not. Blockburger is the default rule, unless the legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates, as can conspiracy.|$|E

5|$|Merchants and peasant farmers paid {{property}} and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with {{a portion of}} their crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han <b>government</b> <b>may</b> have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Government</b> <b>may</b> ask for {{the flag}} to be lowered to half-mast {{in the event of}} the death of an {{important}} person or for national mourning. No person is permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony. However, the national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral. No person may display any flag that is damaged or dirty. Any worn out or damaged flag should be packed into a sealed black trash bag before being disposed and not left visible in dustbins.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the <b>government</b> <b>may</b> not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipalities}} {{are responsible}} for planning and urban development, collection of municipal taxes, maintenance of public utilities and other services, such as parks, sewerage and public cemeteries. Whilst municipal <b>governments</b> <b>may</b> not be responsible for large highways, small roads and tracks usually come under their control. Additionally, municipal <b>governments</b> <b>may</b> issue permits for the operation of urban and intermunicipal bus services.|$|R

5|$|The <b>government</b> <b>may</b> not detain an {{individual}} even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v. Prouse (1979), the Court ruled an officer has made an illegal seizure when he stops an automobile and detains the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile, unless the officer has articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law.|$|E
5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the <b>government</b> <b>may</b> be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|Changes in <b>government</b> <b>may</b> {{occur during}} the campaign, for example as a {{consequence}} of a rise in republicanism. The United States may only come into existence if the ruling British Empire is unable to maintain social order. In addition, nations with highly unpopular governments and a history of workers' unrest may experience revolutions similar to the French Revolution. When the middle or upper classes become disenchanted with a current government, a civil war or revolt may occur. Upon revolution, the player can choose to side with the rebels or with the loyalists. The type of government selected by the player will determine how other factions view the player and influence their diplomatic relations. While religion no longer plays a central role (as in Medieval II: Total War), it is still important in helping bring under control newly captured regions and in influencing diplomatic relations between nations.|$|E

50|$|Article 22 of TRIPS {{also says}} that <b>governments</b> <b>may</b> refuse to {{register}} a trademark or may invalidate an existing trademark (if their legislation permits or {{at the request of}} another government) if it misleads the public as to the true origin of a good. Article 23 says <b>governments</b> <b>may</b> refuse to register or may invalidate a trademark that conflicts with a wine or spirits GI whether the trademark misleads or not.|$|R
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, the <b>government</b> <b>may</b> decide to close {{any part of}} its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many {{opposition}} figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe {{was sentenced to death}} in absentia and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu <b>government</b> <b>may</b> have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.|$|E
5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal <b>government</b> <b>may</b> have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} reasons why the <b>government</b> <b>may</b> wish to {{increase}} the school leaving age, considering it has raised the age numerous times over the 19th and 20th centuries, the last time being in 2015. With past age raisings, the reasons given have been focused mainly on generating more skilled labour by providing additional time for students to gain additional skills and qualifications. In recent years, {{it became apparent that}} most 16 to 18 year-olds have not been motivated to continue their education after completion of their GCSEs, thus increasing the overall unemployment rate given many are unable to find work. The British government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of 17 by 2013 and 18 by 2015, it could change this.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of {{constituencies}} (electoral divisions) in Singapore: Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). In SMCs candidates vie individually for parliamentary seats, whereas in GRCs the contest is between teams of candidates. Under the GRC scheme, which came into effect on 1 June 1988, the <b>Government</b> <b>may,</b> having regard to the number of voters in a particular constituency, advise the President to declare it to be a GRC and designate it as a constituency in which {{at least one of the}} candidates is from the Malay community, or from the Indian or some other minority community in Singapore. Each team in a GRC may have between three and six candidates.|$|E

They must also have lived in the state for at least one year, and must have lived in the district in which they are to run for at least six months, assuming the district has existed with its current boundaries for at least that long. No elected or appointed official of the United States government, including the military, may serve in the Senate, excluding those serving in the military reserves and National Guard. Similarly, no employees of the state <b>government</b> <b>may</b> serve, except for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers.|$|E
