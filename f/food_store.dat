The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a tenant in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely. Among the mall's other final tenants were a True Value hardware store, a jewelry store, a health <b>food</b> <b>store,</b> and a furniture store.|$|E

He {{goes to a}} health <b>food</b> <b>store</b> called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we examine how traditions in Japanese food {{consumption}} can (or cannot) explain the high density of <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> (the number of food shops per capita in a region) in Japan referring to various statistical sources from 1925 to 1997. Contrary to a stereotyped view on Japanese household consumption, {{it is difficult to}} attribute the high density of <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> to the large number of perishable <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> and high requirements　to freshness. Even in 1930 s the portion of perishable foods in the number of stores and in the household consumption was not very large. Shops in various categories, especially sweets shops and bakeries, are as important to realize the high density of <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> in pre-war and postwar Japan, which is unquestionable in itself. Density of retailers as a whole has long been also high, though recently declining sharply, and it has been related to high density of <b>food</b> <b>stores.</b> Lastly we tried some cross-section OLS estimations, to explain the regional difference in density of <b>food</b> <b>stores.</b> On early post-war data, Engel's coefficients are related to the regional difference of density of <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> in Japan, but in 1990 s we observe no more correlations, suggesting every region in Japan nowadays has similar retailing structure with large supermarkets as typical food suppliers...|$|R

25|$|African honeybees abscond (abandon {{the hive}} and any <b>food</b> <b>store</b> {{to start over}} in a new location) more readily than European honeybees. This is not {{necessarily}} a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with insufficient stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the Southern States of the United States, reaching as far north as the Chesapeake Bay in the east. The cold-weather limits of the African bee have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range. This is a more difficult area to prepare bees for early pollination placement in, such as is required for the production of almonds. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.|$|E

Places targeted include the U.N. World Food Program offices in Islamabad a <b>food</b> <b>store</b> in Peshawar; military headquarters in Rawalpindi; a market in Shangla; the intelligence establishments in Lahore; the police stations in Kohat and Peshawar; the Islamic center at the International Islamic University in Islamabad; and Air Science Laboratories (ASL) Complex in Kamra.

Additionally, the month of November saw suicide bombings of the National Bank of Pakistan in Rawalpindi, a market in Charsadda, and six bombings in Peshawar including the regional headquarters of the ISI and the Judicial Complex. In 2013, the media reported that the mastermind of chain of attacks in 2009, Abdullah Umar, was brutalized and killed in a police encounter with Punjab Police in 2013.
