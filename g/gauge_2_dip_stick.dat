This research is intended to evaluate the preferential binding of the complexes to the sequence of DNA (A-T or G-C sequence) and to investigate the binding strength and mode upon their interaction with DNA. Base-pair specificity of the DNA binding of the complexes was determined by comparing the equilibrium binding constant (Kb) of each complex to polysynthetic DNA that contain only A-T or G-C sequence. The Kb value of the interaction was determined by spectrophotometric titration and thermal denaturation temperature (Tm) was determined by monitoring the absorbance of the mixture solution of each complex and ct-DNA at λ = 260 nm as temperature was elevated in the range of 25 - 100 oC. Results of the study show that in general all iron(II) complexes studied exhibit a base-pair specificity in their DNA binding to prefer the relatively facile A-T sequence as compared to the G-C one. The thermal denaturation experiments have demonstrated that Fe(phen) 3] 2 + and [Fe(phen) <b>2</b> (<b>dip)</b> ] <b>2</b> + interact weakly with double helical DNA via electrostatic interaction as indicated by insignificant changes in melting temperature, whereas [Fe(phen) <b>2</b> (<b>dip)</b> ] <b>2</b> +  most probably binds to DNA in mixed modes of interaction, i. e. : intercalation and electrostatic interaction.

40|$|Background: The disco-interacting protein <b>2</b> homolog C (<b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C) gene is an uncharacterized gene found mutated in {{a subset}} of breast and lung cancers. To {{understand}} the role of <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C in tumour development we studied the gene in human cancer cells. Methods: We engineered human <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C knockout cells by genome editing in cancer cells. The growth properties of the engineered cells were characterised and transcriptome and methylation analyses were carried out to identify pathways deregulated by inactivation of <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C. Effects on cell death pathways and epithelial-mesenchymal transition traits were studied {{based on the results}} from expression profiling. Results: Knockout of <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C in RKO cells resulted in cell enlargement and growth retardation. Expression profiling revealed 780 genes for which the expression level was affected by the loss of <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C, including the tumour-suppressor encoding CDKN 2 A gene, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator-encoding ZEB 1, and CD 44 and CD 24 that encode breast cancer stem cell markers. Analysis of DNA methylation showed more than 30, 000 sites affected by differential methylation, the majority of which were hypomethylated following loss of <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C. Changes in DNA methylation at promoter regions were strongly correlated to changes in gene expression, and genes involved with EMT and cell death were enriched among the differentially regulated genes. The <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C knockout cells had higher wound closing capacity and showed an increase in the proportion of cells positive for cellular senescence markers. Conclusions: Loss of <b>DIP</b> <b>2</b> C triggers substantial DNA methylation and gene expression changes, cellular senescence and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells...|$|R
