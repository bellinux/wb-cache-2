25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to granulate urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the <b>granulator</b> instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E

The granulation liquid (fluid) contains a solvent which must be volatile {{so that it can be}} removed by drying, and be non-toxic. Typical liquids include water, ethanol and isopropanol either alone or in combination. The liquid solution can be either aqueous based or solvent-based.

40|$|An {{integral}} {{component in}} understanding the fundamental mechanisms of granulation is the powder flow behaviour within mixer <b>granulators.</b> All three classes of granulation rate processes: wetting and nucleation, consolidation and coalescence, and attrition and breakage require detailed knowledge of flow fields in mixing systems to enable rational approaches {{to the prediction of}} granule attributes. The three objectives of this thesis are to 1) develop a powder flow regime map to characterise the powder flow field, 2) investigate the effect of impeller speed, powder cohesion and blade-rake angle on powder flow and mixing behaviour and, 3) outline a framework for compartment models of vertical-axis high shear mixer (vHSM) <b>granulators.</b> In the development of the powder flow regime map, two distinct regimes were identified. Ideal roping regime occurs at high impeller speeds when the rotating blades pushes the powder out and up the mixer wall, and then back down the free surface forming the “roping” flow pattern.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{quantify}} the boundaries and validate the granule growth regime map for liquid-bound granules recently proposed by Iveson and Litster (AlChE J. 44 (1998) 1510). This regime map postulates that the type of granule growth behaviour is a function of only two dimensionless groups: the amount of granule deformation during collision (characterised by a Stokes deformation number, St(def)) and the maximum granule pore saturation, s(max). The results of experiments performed with a range of materials (glass ballotini, iron ore fines, copper chalcopyrite powder and a sodium sulphate and cellulose mixture) using both drum and high shear mixer <b>granulators</b> were examined. The drum granulation results gave good agreement with the proposed regime map. The boundary between crumb and steady growth occurs at St(def) of order 0. 1 and the boundary between steady and induction growth occurs at St(def) of order 0. 001. The nucleation only boundary occurs at pore saturations that increase from 70 % to 80 % with decreasing St(def). However, the high shear mixer results all had St(def) numbers which were too large. This is most likely to be because the chopper tip-speed is an over-estimate of the average impact velocity granules experience and possibly also due to the dynamic yield strength of the materials being significantly greater than the yield strengths measured at low strain rates. Hence, the map is only a useful tool for comparing the granulation behaviour of different materials in the same device. Until we {{have a better understanding of}} the flow patterns and impact velocities in <b>granulators,</b> it cannot be used to compare different types of equipment. Theoretical considerations also revealed that several of the regime boundaries are also functions of additional parameters not explicitly contained on the map, such as binder viscosity.
