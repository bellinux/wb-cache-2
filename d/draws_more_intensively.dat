40|$|This paper {{provides}} both {{a theoretical}} and an empirical {{investigation into the}} impact of job skill types on the black/white pay differentials. The theoretical analysis derives that the <b>more</b> <b>intensively</b> soft/hard skills are used in an occupation, the greater/smaller the black/white pay differential is there in that occupation. Moreover, {{in response to the}} differential pay gaps across jobs requiring different levels of soft/hard skills, blacks are more likely to self-select themselves into the jobs that use hard skills <b>more</b> <b>intensively,</b> ceteris paribus. Using NLSY data, we find consistent empirical evidence to our theoretical predictions. Hence, the paper bridges the existing literature on racial pay gaps and cognitive vs. non-cognitive skills by explicitly testing the impact of job skill types on racial pay gaps...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Anaerobic {{fermentation}} {{of relatively}} dry chicken manure and sawdust litter {{were performed to}} investigate volume and quality of biogas produced. Process was performed in 2 batch reactors at temperatures 37 °C and 54 °C without infiltrate circulation for both reactors. Concentration of methane increases up to 14 % for chicken manure and slougterhouse wastes mezophylic fermentation, and up to 37 % for chicken manure thermophylic fermentation, at the and of 2 -month fermentation period. Anaerobic fermentation process is ongoing <b>more</b> <b>intensively</b> at thermophilic temperature 54 °C in reactor F 4 compare to mezophilic temperature 37 °C provided in reactor F 3.

40|$|I {{investigate}} how banks manage liquidity as {{specified in the}} German prudential liquidity regulation, which combines a stock and cash-flow mapping approach.

The results suggest that commercial banks rely <b>more</b> <b>intensively</b> on markets when managing their liquidity, while savings and cooperative banks focus more on matching their cash inflows and outflows. Banks of all three types, except large commercial banks, also perform asset-side accounting exchanges and reduce their new long-term loans more when they need more liquid assets...|$|R
