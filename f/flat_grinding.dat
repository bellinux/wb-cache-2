The type of the original omnivorous teeth with short, [...] "bumpy" [...] molars, with which the prime members of the evolutionary line distinguished themselves, gradually changed into the teeth common to herbivorous mammals. They became long (as much as 100mm), roughly cubical molars equipped with <b>flat</b> <b>grinding</b> surfaces. In conjunction with the teeth, during the horse's evolution, the elongation of the facial part of the skull is apparent, and can also be observed in the backward-set eyeholes. In addition, the relatively short neck of the equine ancestors became longer, with equal elongation of the legs. Finally, the size of the body grew as well.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a conducted system {{analysis of the}} <b>flat</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel face, considers the state parameters, input and output variables of subsystems, namely: machine tool, workpiece, grinding wheel, cutting fluids, and the contact area. It reveals the factors influencing the temperature and power conditions for the grinding process. Aim: conducting the system analysis of the <b>flat</b> <b>grinding</b> process with wheel face expects to enable a development {{of the system of}} grinding process parameters as a technical system, which will make it possible to evaluate each parameter individually and implement optimization of the entire system. One of the most important criteria in defining the optimal process conditions is the grinding temperature, which, to avoid defects appearance of on the surface of component, should not exceed the critical temperature values to be experimentally determined. The temperature criterion can be useful for choosing the conditions for the maximum defect-free performance of the mechanical face grinding. To define the maximum performance of defect-free grinding can also use other criteria such as a critical power density, indirectly reflecting the allowable thermal stress grinding process; the structure of the ground surface, which reflects {{the presence or absence of}} a defect layer, which is determined after the large number of experiments; flow range of the diamond layer. Optimal conditions should not exceed those of defect-free grinding. It is found that a maximum performance depends on the characteristics of circles and grade of processed material, as well as on the contact area and grinding conditions. Optimal performance depends on the diamond value (cost) and specific consumption of diamonds in a circle. Above criteria require formalization as a function of the variable parameters of the grinding process. There is an option for the compromise of inter-criteria optimality, thereby providing a set of acceptable solutions, from which one can choose the best. A block – diagram for constructing a generalized model of the grinding process is presented. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of two types of occlusal accommodation on the arch separation in centric and eccentric arch positions and to assess the opposing tooth contacts in professionally made, thermoformed sports mouthguards. Maxillary and mandibular alginate impressions, a wax interocclusal record of centric occlusion together with maxillary/condylar face-bow registrations, were recorded clinically for 10 undergraduate dental students who are sports activist volunteers of the School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen's University Belfast. Two ethylene vinyl acetate thermoformed maxillary mouthguards were made for each player (N = 20) using a standardised procedure. Ten mouthguards served both as the control (i. e. the non-accommodated) group and also the accommodated, occlusally 'imprinted' group. The other 10 mouthguards served as the accommodated, occlusally 'ground' group. Casts were articulated, each non-accommodated and accommodated mouthguard was seated and the extent of the interocclusal opening was recorded in all three arch relationships. The number of mouthguard and mandibular tooth contacts were also recorded in each position. The increased vertical occlusal dimension that was found in the presence of non-accommodated mouthguards equated to the full-sheet thickness of the material that was used to form the mouthguards. Only mouthguards accommodated by grinding retained high levels of occlusal contact in all arch relationships that were tested. Within the limitations of this study, the modification of the occlusal surface made by <b>flat</b> <b>grinding</b> reduced the arch separation in eccentric movements and increased the opposing tooth contacts in custom-made mouthguards. This may contribute to increased comfort, compliance and the protective effect of these appliances thus resulting in a reduction of injuries to the teeth, arches and soft tissues...|$|E
40|$|Diamond {{smoothing}} tools {{have been}} proposed for use in conjunction with diamond cutting tools {{that are used in}} many finish-machining operations. Diamond machining (including finishing) is often used, for example, in fabrication of precise metal mirrors. A diamond smoothing tool according to the proposal would have a smooth spherical surface. For a given finish machining operation, the smoothing tool would be mounted next to the cutting tool. The smoothing tool would slide on the machined surface left behind by the cutting tool, plastically deforming the surface material and thereby reducing the roughness of the surface, closing microcracks and otherwise generally reducing or eliminating microscopic surface and subsurface defects, and increasing the microhardness of the surface layer. It has been estimated that if smoothing tools of this type were used in conjunction with cutting tools on sufficiently precise lathes, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the roughness of machined surfaces to as little as 3 nm. A tool according to the proposal would consist of a smoothing insert in a metal holder. The smoothing insert would be made from a diamond/metal functionally graded composite rod preform, which, in turn, would be made by sintering together a bulk single-crystal or polycrystalline diamond, a diamond powder, and a metallic alloy at high pressure. To form the spherical smoothing tip, the diamond end of the preform would be subjected to <b>flat</b> <b>grinding,</b> conical grinding, spherical grinding using diamond wheels, and finally spherical polishing and/or buffing using diamond powders. If the diamond were a single crystal, then it would be crystallographically oriented, relative to the machining motion, to minimize its wear and maximize its hardness. Spherically polished diamonds could also be useful for purposes other than smoothing in finish machining: They would likely also be suitable for use as heat-resistant, wear-resistant, unlubricated sliding-fit bearing inserts...|$|E

It guarantees that on the machined surface there will be no areas unaffected by the wheel.

On the other hand, a method of monitoring the dressing operation in real time, identifying the moment in which the dresser is worn and thus to be replaced, something which can be of great importance for the grinding process in order to assure quality and accuracy of the workpieces. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the wear of the single point dresser, through spectral analysis of vibration signal during the dressing operation. For this dressing assays were performed using a <b>flat</b> <b>grinding</b> and input variables a grinding wheel aluminum oxide, one the single point dresser of synthetic diamond r type CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition), depth of dressing 40 μm, dresser speed of 3. 45 mm /s {{and the degree of}} coating Ud equal to 1 at the beginning of dressing. The output variables were the acquisition of the vibration signals via an accelerometer fixed in the dresser holder, collected by an oscilloscope and dresser wear measurements using a microscope. Through spectral analysis of vibration signal in three conditions of use, and, new, half-life and worn, using the Welch method and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), it was possible to identify the frequency bands between 1 kHz and 8 kHz in the amplitude increased according to the dresser wear. It has been found that the in-creased vibration activity is directly proportional to the CVD dresser wear. It was possible to identify fre-quency bands that best characterize such a situation, as in bands of 2 kHz to 4 kHz and 6 kHz and 8 kHz. The results indicate the possibility of implementing a real-time monitoring system, from the use of digital filters in these frequency bands...|$|E
40|$|Tese (doutorado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro Tecnológico, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência e Engenharia de Materiais, Florianópolis, 2013. Abstract : The use of {{polished}} high gloss porcelain tile {{has become increasingly}} common in civil construction. One of the main factors that determine this choice is the great aesthetic call due to the high gloss, occupying the niche market previously dominated by natural stones, such as marble or granite, for example. The machining process to obtain that high gloss {{can be divided into}} several distinct stages, the first one is the <b>flat</b> <b>grinding</b> for roughing and removal of orthogonal defects from the top surface of ceramic plate. Commonly, the process parameters used into grinding are obtained directly on industrial line by "trial and error", depending strongly on the operator's experience and sensitivity to adjust the machinery. As a result of this empirical procedure, there are several problems that increase the cost of production and may injure the final gloss of the product. So this doctoral thesis aims to increase the knowledge of tribology and kinematics, optimizing the fragile grinding process for porcelain tile. It is considered in this study the physical interaction between the abrasive grain and the surface of the ceramic plate, as well the kinematic described by this one on the work piece. As a way to simulate the tribological effect during machining, tests were performed employing a surface grinding machine and sclerometry, using an abrasive well with a single diamond abrasive grain and a Vickers indenter as abrasive tool, respectively. The results were analyzed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and optical perfilometry. In theoretical evaluation, the equations proposed in the literature for material removal by fragile scratching based on the basic characteristics of ceramic were compared to the experimental results obtained, in order to validate their representativeness. At the end, based on the conclusions presented in this work, adaptations are proposed to improve the mathematical modelling, as well process conditions are pointed to optimize the fragile grinding step for high gloss porcelain tiles, seeking a balance between the state of art and the economic viability of the process...|$|E
5000|$|Double bevel or {{compound}} bevel — A back bevel, {{similar to}} a sabre or <b>flat</b> <b>grind,</b> is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single bevel, sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single bevel blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double bevels are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and back bevel angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a double bevel, with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|R
