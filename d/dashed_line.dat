5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short <b>dashed</b> <b>line.</b> The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E

25|$|The {{streamline}} which {{separates the}} final flow direction {{and the wall}} {{is known as a}} slipstream (shown as the <b>dashed</b> <b>line</b> in the figure). Across this line there is a jump in the temperature, density and tangential component of the velocity (normal component being zero). Beyond the slipstream the flow is stagnant (which automatically satisfies the velocity boundary condition at the wall). In case of real flow, a shear layer is observed instead of a slipstream, because of the additional no-slip boundary condition.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a novel structured light pattern {{designed to be}} compatible with the spatial light modulator (SLM) projection. The proposed pattern is a De Bruijn-based sequence applied {{to a combination of}} continuous and <b>dashed</b> <b>lines</b> for the pattern. The sequence is coded in the period and duty cycles of the <b>dashed</b> <b>lines.</b> It provides 16 different lines which limits to two the required number of <b>dashed</b> <b>lines</b> needed for identification. The segmentation has been made easier by alternating continuous and <b>dashed</b> <b>lines.</b> As required by the use of SLMs, the sequence has been adapted by making it symmetric. It has been improved by guaranteeing a hamming distance equal to two for two successive <b>dashed</b> <b>lines.</b> The implementation on a virtual model has shown that a subpixel accuracy has been achieved. This pattern has been developped for 3 -D endoscopy. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{nautical}} date line, not {{the same}} as the IDL, is a de jure construction determined by international agreement. It is the result of the 1917 Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, which recommended that all ships, both military and civilian, adopt hourly standard time zones on the high seas. The United States adopted its recommendation for U.S. military and merchant marine ships in 1920. This date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the 180° meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land, forming gaps—it is a pole-to-pole <b>dashed</b> <b>line.</b> The 15° gore that is offset from UTC by 12 hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5° gores that differ from UTC by ±12 hours.|$|E

2500|$|Graphically, {{this can}} be {{represented}} on a space-time diagram {{by the fact that}} a plot of the set of points regarded as simultaneous generates a line which depends on the observer.

[...] The dotted horizontal line represents the set of points regarded as simultaneous with the origin by a stationary observer. [...] This diagram is drawn using the (x, t) coordinates of the stationary observer, and is scaled so that the speed of light is one, i.e., so that a ray of light would be represented by a line with a 45° angle from the x axis.

2500|$|However, the Hood Canal fault {{has been}} [...] "largely inferred" [...] {{due to a}} paucity of evidence, {{including}} lack of definite scarps and any other signs of active seismicity. [...] A 2001 study using high-resolution seismic tomography questioned its existence. [...] Though a 2012 study interpreted a different variety of tomographic data as showing the Hood Canal fault, other mapping has [...] "found no convincing evidence {{for the existence of}} this fault", considers it doubtful, depicted it [...] "with low level of confidence", or omits it entirely.

2500|$|After inter-calibrating with CLARREO ISS/Pathfinder and its newly relaxed {{accuracy}} {{objective of}} 0.6% (k=2) from 2020 onwards, the [...] resulting measurements {{may be able}} to detect climate change signals by the year 2039 (move Red curve to year 20 or `2020', rather than 0 start point in Fig. 3).

2500|$|The Hood Canal Fault (and its {{possible}} extensions) and Saddle Mountain faults {{to the west}} are believed to form the western boundary to all this. On the east, the Devils Mountain Fault connects with the south striking Darrington Fault (not shown) which runs to the OWL, and the Southern Whidbey Island Fault extends via the Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (<b>dashed</b> <b>line)</b> to the OWL. South of the OWL a definite eastern boundary has not been found, with some indications it is indefinite. [...] (E.g., the Olympia Fault is aligned with {{and appears to be}} the northernmost member of a set of faults between Olympia and Chehalis that may extend to the Columbia River, {{and there has been a}} suggestion that the Tacoma Fault may connect with the White River—Naches River fault on the east side of the Cascades.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{energies}} for {{the lowest}} discrete states are shown in the graph above. [...] These can be obtained to within arbitrary accuracy using computer algebra from the generalized Lambert W function (see eq. (3) in that site and the reference of Scott, Aubert-Frécon, and Grotendorst) but were obtained initially by numerical means to within double precision by the most precise program available, namely ODKIL. The red solid lines are 2Σ states. [...] The green dashed lines are 2Σ states. The blue <b>dashed</b> <b>line</b> is a 2Πu state and the pink dotted line is a 2Πg state. [...] Note that although the generalized Lambert W function eigenvalue solutions supersede these asymptotic expansions, in practice, they are most useful near the bond length. [...] These solutions are possible because the partial differential equation of the wave equation here separates into two coupled ordinary differential equations using prolate spheroidal coordinates.|$|E
2500|$|As {{described}} above, {{the trace}} of the OWL becomes faint and somewhat confused between the Blue Mountains and {{the margin of the}} North American craton (the thick orange line on the map, just beyond the Oregonmdash&Idaho border; the <b>dashed</b> <b>line</b> on the diagram below). [...] This is the Wallowa terrane, a piece of crust that drifted in from somewhere else and got jammed between the Columbia Embayment [...] to the west and the North American continent to the east and north. A notable feature is the anomalously elevated Wallowa Mountains, to the east is Hells Canyon (Snake River) on the Oregonmdash&Idaho border. Northeast of the OWL (Wallowa Mountains) is the Clearwater Embayment ("CE" [...] on the map), delineated by ancient rock of the craton. [...] Southwest of this section of the OWL is a region of grabens (where large blocks of crust have dropped) extending about [...] south to the nearly parallel Vale Fault Zone (see diagram, below).|$|E
2500|$|China first {{asserted}} {{sovereignty in}} the modern sense to the South China Sea’s islands when it formally objected to France’s efforts to incorporate them into French Indochina during the Sino-French War (1884–1885). Initially, France recognized Qing China's sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagos, in exchange for Chinese recognition of Vietnam as a French territory. Chinese maps since then have consistently shown China’s claims, first as a solid {{and then as a}} <b>dashed</b> <b>line.</b> In 1932, one year after the Japanese Empire invaded northeast China, France formally claimed both the Paracel and Spratly Islands. [...] China and Japan both protested. [...] In 1933, France seized the Paracels and Spratlys, announced their annexation, formally included them in French Indochina. They built several weather stations on them, but they did not disturb the numerous Chinese fishermen found there. In 1938 Japan took the islands from France, garrisoned them, and built a submarine base at Itu Aba (now Taiping / 太平) Island. In 1941, the Japanese Empire made the Paracel and Spratly islands part of Taiwan, then under its rule.|$|E

2500|$|Further complicating this is {{a feature}} of unknown {{structure}} and origin, the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL). This is a seemingly accidental alignment of topographic features that runs roughly east-southeast from {{the north side of}} the Olympic Peninsula to the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon. It aligns with the West Coast fault and Queen Charlotte Fault system of strike-slip fault zones (similar to the San Andreas Fault in California) on the west side of Vancouver Island, but does not itself show any significant or through-going strike-slip movement. It is of interest here because the various strands of the Seattle Fault change orientation where they appear to cross the OWL, and various other features, such as the Rosedale monocline and Olympia structure, and a great many local topographical features, have parallel alignments. It may also be the original location of the Darrington—Devils Mountain Fault (the <b>dashed</b> <b>line</b> [...] "X" [...] at the top of the following map). The OWL appears to be a deep-seated structure over which the shallower crust of the Puget Lowland is being pushed, but this remains speculative.|$|E
2500|$|Figure 1 to {{the right}} is a simple sketch of {{the path of a}} {{parallel}} beam of electrons in a TEM from just above the sample and down the column to the fluorescent screen. [...] As the electrons pass through the sample, they are scattered by the electrostatic potential set up by the constituent elements. After the electrons have left the sample they pass through the electromagnetic objective lens. This lens acts to collect all electrons scattered from one point of the sample in one point on the fluorescent screen, causing an image of the sample to be formed. We note that at the <b>dashed</b> <b>line</b> in the figure, electrons scattered in the same direction by the sample are collected into a single point. This is the back focal plane of the microscope, and is where the diffraction pattern is formed. By manipulating the magnetic lenses of the microscope, the diffraction pattern may be observed by projecting it onto the screen instead of the image. An example of what a diffraction pattern obtained in this way may look like is shown in figure 2.|$|E
2500|$|Play {{is started}} at the {{beginning}} of each half by a kick-off. One side—determined following the toss of a coin—takes a drop kick from the middle of the halfway line to start the half. The ball must travel at least 10 m into the opposition half. None of the kicking team's players are allowed in front of the player taking the kick until after that player's foot has touched the ball. The kicking side frequently kicks the ball high and for it to go just over 10 m, which is marked by a <b>dashed</b> <b>line</b> across the pitch. This tactic gives their players time to chase the lobbed ball and hope to catch it before the opposition does. Alternatively the kick may be a long kick deep into opposition territory, sacrificing the chance to regain possession for territorial gain. A restart kick that does not cross the 10 m line can either be played by the receiving team, but not by the kicking team, or a midfield scrum is awarded to the receiving team. A restart kick that crosses the side lines without being touched awards the receiving team either a midfield scrum or a line out on the halfway line, receiving team option.|$|E
