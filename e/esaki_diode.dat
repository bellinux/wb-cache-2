40|$|<b>Esaki</b> <b>diodes</b> are tunnel diodes {{with a very}} abrupt and degenerately doped PN {{junction}}. This {{abrupt junction}} causes the conduction bands to overlap, thus allowing for tunneling when a small bias is applied. 111 -V on silicon <b>Esaki</b> tunnel <b>diodes</b> offer higher performance at lower power supplies compared to silicon. A vertical mesa etch is used to isolate the Esaki devices from each other. The etch results in a significant undercut below the gold contact which can cause issues with electrical testing.

The dielectric layer will reduce the topography variation caused by the mesa etch and prevent the metal contact from shorting to the surface. Bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) is a spin on polyimide with a low dielectric constant (k = 2. 5) and a high degree of planarization.

The continued scaling {{of the supply}} voltage of field-effect transistors, such as tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs), requires the implementation of advanced transistor architectures including FinFETs and nanowire devices. Moreover, integration of novel materials with high electron mobilities, such as III-V semiconductors and graphene, are also being considered to further enhance the device properties. In nanowire devices, boosting the drive current at a fixed supply voltage or maintaining a constant drive current at a reduced supply voltage may be achieved by increasing the cross-sectional area of a device, however {{at the cost of}} deteriorated electrostatics. A gate-all-around nanowire device architecture is the most favorable electrostatic configuration to suppress short channel effects, however, the arrangement of arrays of parallel vertical nanowires to address the drive current predicament will require additional chip area.

A maximum peak to valley current ratio (PVCR) of 1. 47 was obtained at the optimum annealing temperature of 680 C for 1 min. Peak and valley (excess) currents decreased more than two orders of magnitude as annealing temperatures and times were increased with rates empirically determined to have thermal activation energies of 2. 2 and 2. 4 eV respectively. The decrease in current density is attributed to widening of the tunneling barrier due to the diffusion of phosphorus and boron.
