25|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{research}} linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time, and while there may be a correlation between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.|$|E
500|$|However, {{he persuaded}} [...] John Cockcroft, {{a member of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, to suggest who might be invited to the 1958 conference. [...] He {{successfully}} resisted a subsequent attempt to take over the conferences, causing a Foreign Office official to write that [...] "the difficulty is to get Prof. Rotblat to pay any attention to what we think... He is no doubt jealous of his independence and scientific integrity", and that securing [...] "a new organizer for the British delegation seems to be the first need, but I do not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any hope of this." [...] By the early 1960s the Ministry of Defence thought that the Pugwash Conferences were [...] "now a very respectable organization", and the Foreign Office stated that it had [...] "official blessing" [...] and that any breakthrough may well originate at such gatherings. The Pugwash Conferences are credited with laying the ground work for the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 and the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. In parallel with the Pugwash Conferences, he [...] joined with Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, Bertrand Russell and other concerned scientists to found the World Academy of Art and Science, which was proposed by them in the mid-1950s and formally constituted in 1960.|$|E
2500|$|Hoffman had {{previously}} sought the Republican nomination. In July, when Scozzafava was nominated instead, Hoffman {{offered to help}} her. His email to her read: [...] "Hi Dede, Congratulations {{and the best of}} luck in your candidacy. Let me <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> anything I can do to help. Doug." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, he contacted Conservative Party leaders, seeking support for his own candidacy. One Republican leader said that Hoffman, while seeking the Republican nomination, had [...] "repeatedly" [...] pledged to support the nominee.|$|E

2500|$|In his Curentul Nou period, Sanielevici {{focused his}} {{attention}} on the young novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, whose work he considered the main manifestation of Sămănătorism. To his critic's dismissive remarks, Sadoveanu replied with a violent article in the political gazette Voinţa Naţională: [...] "I promise you a stern comeback, and do let me <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any clean spot on your body that may yet receive it." [...] The first fissures between Sanielevici and his Poporanist colleagues began to show {{at roughly the same}} time. Emerging as one of the Poporanist ideologues around 1905, Ibrăileanu defended Sadoveanu against Sanielevici's observations. This stance probably helped Sadoveanu to make up his mind about leaving the Sămănătorists and joining the Viaţa Românească group, while the controversy only increased his exposure.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Cornyn gained notice by {{connecting}} the Supreme Court's reluctance to hear arguments for sustaining Terri Schiavo's {{life with the}} recent murders of Judge Joan Lefkow's husband and mother {{as well as the}} courtroom murder of Judge Rowland Barnes. Cornyn said: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a cause-and-effect connection, but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and building up to the point where some people engage in violence". His statement and a similar one by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay were widely denounced, including by The New York Times. Cornyn later said that he regretted the statement.|$|E
