First, have impact disrepair experiments with several types of different grooves milling inserts, and find out the difference of the impact disrepair invalidation types among them, and build the impact disrepair life cumulating distribution function mathematic model. Second, based on the adhering disrepair experiments, find out the difference of the adhering disrepair invalidation types, build the quantitative mathematic relation between milling temperature and maximal adhering disrepair depth on rake <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter,</b> and analyze the rule that the milling temperature affects the adhering disrepair. And then, {{on the basis of the}} scene machining, have analysis on cutter disrepair phenomenon and mechanism under the joint action of force and heat, so to provide a theoretical basis on how to avoid premature failure of the tool for the actual production process...|$|E
40|$|Coopération avec Ecole Centrale LyonBecause {{a cutting}} fluid could be equally used for {{different}} cutting operations, this study proposed {{to investigate the}} behavior of a well-known extreme-pressure additive (pentasulfide) in both turning and milling operations of a steel workpiece. The experimental approach is based on the coupling of mechanical tests (turning, milling, and tribological tests) with physico-chemical characterizations (Auger Electron Spectroscopy and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) of the friction surfaces (chip and tool). In the case of milling, it was shown that the presence of a pentasulfide additive has a beneficial effect on the specific cutting energy (kc) and flank wear (Vb). These results are correlated with the presence of iron sulfides (FeS and FeS 2) on the flank <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> mill and on the chip face in contact with the mill. No such additive effects are found in case of turning. A lubrication model is proposed for the case of milling based on an indirect lubrication of the tool/workpiece and tool/chip contacts due to the transfer of iron and its reaction with sulfur compounds to produce iron sulfides. Because milling is a discontinuous cutting process, this lubrication mechanism is much more efficient than that observed in turning. Indeed, the tool faces are re-fed iron sulfides each time they leave the workpiece...|$|E
30|$|Both the UMCD and BDMCD films show micro-sized diamond grains with {{well-defined}} shapes, and the boron {{doping technique}} can slightly reduce the grain size. The {{average grain size}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UMCD film is 2 ‒ 4 μm, while that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BDMCD film is 1 ‒ 3 μm. Attributed to the distinct crests and valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaped diamond grains, the surface roughness Ra values on the rake and flank <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UMCD coated milling cutter are as high as 242.54 and 267.91 nm, and those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BDMCD coated ones are 237.15 and 252.4 nm. Cauliflower-like nodules composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dense nano-sized diamond grains (20 ‒ 500 nm) appear on <b>the</b> surfaces <b>of</b> not only <b>the</b> UFGD and BDFGD films, but also the BDM-UFGCD film with a surface UFGD layer. The nodules are more densely packed and form larger, shallower dome-like protrusions, resulting in a relatively lower surface roughness. Nevertheless, {{it is found that}} nano-sized diamond grains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BDM-UFGCD film are larger than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single-layer FGD films, which can be distinguished from cauliflower-like shapes in the FESEM micrographs with lower amplification factors. As a result, the surface roughness Ra values on the rake and flank <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UFGD coated <b>cutter</b> reach 142.36 and 161.94 nm, and those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BDFGD coated one are 137.22 and 167.54 nm, but those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BDM-UFGCD coated one are a little higher, which are 162.9 and 186.22 nm. As a comparison, <b>the</b> uncoated milling <b>cutter</b> (R-WC), which is elaborately ground, performs a rather smooth surface. The surface roughness Ra values on its rake and flank faces are as low as 61.47 and 73.29 nm, respectively, and those for the F-WC are 58.72 and 65.44 nm.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} evaluations examined <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> water spray pressure, curtain setback distance, and external and underboom spray use for controlling respirable dust levels and sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas concentrations around a continuous mining machine. This mining machine {{was equipped with}} a flooded-bed dust scrubber and was positioned in the box or slab cut. Exhaust line brattice was used for all tests. Dust levels were measured in the return airway and at locations representing <b>the</b> operators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuous mining machine and the standard and off-standard shuttle cars. Increasing water pressure or using the underboom sprays produced no significant impacts on dust levels, although their interactions did produce some significant impacts. Increasing curtain setback distance often elevated dust levels, likely by reducing <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> airflow reaching <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external sprays created additional airflow around the mining machine that pushed the dust cloud past the scrubber inlets. This significantly increased dust levels at all sampling locations. Tracer gas levels were measured on the off-curtain and curtain sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> head and in the return airway. Increasing water pressure generally led to significantly increased gas levels on the curtain side, although a slight decrease was observed on the off-curtain side with the machine in the box cut. Increasing setback distance elevated gas levels on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> head and in the return by limiting <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> ventilation airflow reaching <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external sprays provided additional airflow along <b>the</b> off-curtain side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine, significantly reducing gas levels in this region. These sprays adversely impacted the dilution and removal <b>of</b> gas on <b>the</b> curtain side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> head. Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underboom sprays adversely impacted gas levels on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> head. Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external sprays provided <b>the</b> best control <b>of</b> respirable dust and face gas concentrations. The smaller increases in miner operator dust levels produced by these sprays were offset by larger reductions in face gas levels on <b>the</b> off-curtain side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> head. Although <b>the</b> underboom sprays minimally impacted respirable dust levels, use of these sprays was not recommended because they increased face gas levels...|$|R
40|$|A drill {{setup is}} {{prepared}} to study <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> borehole pressure and bit hydraulics on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a drill bit. [...] Experimental study of bit-rock interaction shows that <b>the</b> negative influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borehole pressure on penetration mechanisms of polycrystalline diamond compact (POC) bits, {{in addition to the}} rock strengthening under elevated borehole pressure, is <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> cuttings in between <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>cutters</b> and rock surface in <b>the</b> zone <b>of</b> penetration. [...] <b>The</b> flow <b>of</b> cuttings on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter,</b> results in applying a confining pressure on <b>the</b> zone <b>of</b> penetration. This confinement causes a considerable rock strengthening in <b>the</b> zone <b>of</b> penetration, which increases the mechanical specific energy and reduces <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> penetration. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confinement is observed to be related to <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> friction between <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> and cuttings and <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rockcutter interaction.

However, the experimental results indicate that there is an optimum condition for applying the hydraulic power on the bit, which yields maximum drilling efficiency. [...] In addition, in a simulation of a single POC cutter-rock interaction, using the distinct element method, it has been found that there is an optimum condition for vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bit which results in <b>the</b> minimum energy <b>of</b> penetration. <b>The</b> optimum condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> oscillation can be defined in terms of vertical displacement amplitude and vertical velocity amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> while it is moving horizontally.
