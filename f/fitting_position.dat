By some extraordinary oversight, Miss Bygrave had been left, on the eve of her marriage, unprovided with a maid. Noel Vanstone declared that he would take the whole responsibility of correcting this deficiency in the arrangements, on his own shoulders; he would not trouble Mr. Bygrave to give him any assistance; he would confer, when they got to their journey's end, with the landlady of the hotel, and would examine the candidates for the vacant office himself. All the way to London, he returned again and again to the same subject; all the evening, at the hotel, he was in and out of the landlady's sitting-room, until he fairly obliged her to lock the door. In every other proceeding which related to his marriage, he had been kept in the background; he had been compelled to follow in the footsteps of his ingenious friend.

5000|$|When {{working with}} common 6-point {{hexagonal}} fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers {{double the amount}} of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut. This is of large importance on a box wrench which is typically adjustable in 15 or 30 degree increments. This versatility of <b>fitting</b> <b>position</b> is normally of small importance on a socket wrench which can be easily rotated in small increments regardless of socket type. Since loading contact points between the nut and socket are at the corner points (not the flats), twelve point sockets have more than adequate strength for most applications where nut and socket are in good condition. If the nut or socket is rounded by wear, using a [...] "double" [...] shaped socket {{is more likely to}} results in slippage or further rounding off and possible stripping of either the bolt head, nut or socket. This versatility is the main purpose of the 12-point shape found in common sockets, but is essential when working with 12-point bolt and nut heads. Socket strength is mainly a function of the alloys and heat treatments used to make the socket along with wall thickness of the socket wrench as measured at the corner points (thinnest section).|$|E

It has been successfully used for predictions and data <b>fitting</b> (<b>positions</b> and intensities) of numerous spectra of symmetric and spherical top molecules within the vibration extrapolation scheme. The new version offers more advanced possibilities for spectra calculations and modeling by getting rid of several previous limitations particularly for the size of polyads and the number of tensors involved. It allows dealing with overlapping polyads and includes more efficient and faster algorithms for the calculation of coefficients related to molecular symmetry properties (6 C, 9 C and 12 C symbols for C_{ 3 v}, T_{d}, and O_{h} point groups) and for better convergence of least-square-fit iterations as well. The new version is not limited to polyad effective models. It also allows direct predictions using full ab initio ro-vibrational normal mode hamiltonians converted into the irreducible tensor form. Illustrative examples on CH_{ 3 } D, CH_{ 4 }, CH_{ 3 } Cl, CH_{ 3 } F and PH_{ 3 } are reported reflecting the present status of data available.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I treat {{one of the}} {{possibilities}} of latent heat storage. I have used the phase-change materials (PCM), which are apropriate {{to be built in}} passive solar systems. When PCM are changing their phase from liquid to solid state or vice versa, they absorb or emit the heat at constant temperature. Therefore they can be used as stabilisers of temperature and during summer they can prevent the overheating of buildings. I present exisiting and tested construction complexes with different PCM systems that are integrated in walls, ceilings and floors. For the chosen example of modular facade system the most <b>fitting</b> <b>position</b> of PCM layer in the construction element is determined, based on calculated time of PCM melting. Estimated time of melting is determined with simplified Stefan or moving boundary problem. This goes for the case, where at the beginning the whole layer of PCM is in solid phase in thermal balance at temperature of phase change. Later, when the temperature at the surface of constructon complex is raised, the PCM starts melting. Firstly the outer surface melts and then the phase front, which seperates the areas of solid and liquid PCM, starts moving to the inside of PCM. Considering the summer temperature conditions, between three commercially accessible PCM the one with the most optimal temperature of phase transition was chosen, to ensure the heat comfort in the room. The analysis shows, that among tested PCMs, the most optimal slowdown of the response of the construction element on the temperature changes of the environment is, when using the layer of PCM with the temperature of phase transition around 21 °C on the internal side of construction element. With high external and internal temperatures the melting of the chosen PCM is slow enough in order to maintain constant temperature of internal wall surface...|$|E

40|$|The Gaussian {{function}} {{is simple and}} easy to implement as Point Spread Function (PSF) model for <b>fitting</b> the <b>position</b> of fluorescent emitters in localization microscopy. Despite its attractiveness {{the appropriateness of the}} Gaussian is questionable as it is not based on the laws of optics. Here we study the effect of emission dipole orientation in conjunction with optical aberrations on the localization accuracy of position estimators based on a Gaussian model PSF. Simulated image spots, calculated with all effects of high numerical aperture, interfaces between media, polarization, dipole orientation and aberrations taken into account, were fitted with a Gaussian PSF based Maximum Likelihood Estimator. For freely rotating dipole emitters it is found that the Gaussian works fine. The same, theoretically optimum, localization accuracy is found as if the true PSF were a Gaussian, even for aberrations within the usual tolerance limit of high-end optical imaging systems such as microscopes (Marechal’s diffraction limit). For emitters with a fixed dipole orientation this is not the case. Localization errors are found that reach up to 40 nm for typical system parameters and aberration levels at the diffraction limit. These are systematic errors that are independent of the total photon count in the image. The Gaussian {{function is}} therefore inappropriate, and more sophisticated PSF models are a practical necessity. Imaging Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
