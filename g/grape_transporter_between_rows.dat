40|$|A {{major concern}} with {{blasting}} at surface mines is generation of ground vibrations and airblast {{and their effects}} on nearby residences. This Bureau of Mines report looks at the use of millisecond delays in blast design and their effect on the resulting ground vibrations and airblast. A total of 52 production blasts were instrumented and monitored at a surface coal mine in southern Indiana. Arrays of seismographs were used to gather time histories of vibrations and airblast. The data were analyzed for peak values of vibration and airblast and for frequency con-tent. Various delay intervals were used within and <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> of blastholes. Delay intervals within rows were 17 and 42 ms, and those <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> ranged from 30 to 100 msj these intervals are equivalent to 0. 5 and 1. 3 ms/ft within rows and 1. 2 to 4. 3 ms/ft <b>between</b> <b>rows.</b> Sub-sonic delay intervals within rows reduced airblast by 6 dB. Large delay intervals <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> reduced the amplitude of ground vibrations; their frequency depended primarily upon the geology of the mine site...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a Border Planting (BP) pattern {{recommended}} by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council was tested against Regular Planting (RP) to assess the effect, if any, on gross phytoplankton photosynthesis and shading. A Wide Planting (WP) pattern was {{also included in the}} trial, as an extreme case, to assess the level of photosynthesis that might be obtained if some of the rice yield was sacrificed. Three rice-planting treatments, each with four replicates, using the rice variety BR 16, were undertaken: (1) RP, 26 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> N to S and E to W; (2) BP, 20 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> N to S and alternately 21 cm and 36 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> E, to W; and (3) WP, 66 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> N to S and E to W. BP showed no advantage compared to RP, possibly because the rice variety used was short and thus produced relatively little shading. WP did show a benefit for phytoplankton photosynthesis, but this may not generate an increase in fish yield sufficient to justify the negative impact of rice production...|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{profiles}} of wind velocity {{in and around}} a rice canopy at three different growing stages were experimentally investigated using a wind tunnel. The vertical profiles were measured <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> of rice bunches and above bunches in a rice canopy, and <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> and behind bunches outside the canopy. Each vertical profile was compared with the input profile of wind velocity, and trends in attenuation and acceleration of wind were examined. It was found that wind was accelerated above rice bunches, {{and the extent of}} acceleration depended on a growing stage of rice. For vertical profiles <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> of rice bunches, attenuation of wind velocity was found at the area that the rice bunches spread out leaves <b>between</b> <b>rows,</b> and wind was accelerated above and below the area. A peak location of attenuation behind bunches changed depending on a growing stage. For locations below appearance height of a rice canopy, the peak of attenuation appeared right behind the rice bunch 8. The wind velocity decreased by 60 % at the growing stage 2 nd and 3 rd.

Research was based on a split plot experiment where the following factors were analyzed: Factor A – grain sorghum hybrids with three graduations - Alize, Aquilon, Arack, Factor B - distance <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> with two graduations – at 70 cm and 50 cm, Factor C - fertilization treatments with 10 graduations – N 0 P 0 K 0 (Control), N 60 P 0 K 0, N 90 P 0 K 0, N 120 P 0 K 0, N 90 P 60 K 0, N 90 P 60 K 0 +foliar fertilization, N 90 P 60 K 60, N 90 P 60 K 60 +foliar fertilization, N 120 P 60 K 0, N 120 P 60 K 60. In the field conditions of the 2013 - 2014 agricultural year, grain sorghum crop produced a total average biomass (September, 2014) that varied from 26. 59 t/ha in the hybrid Arack to 26. 70 t/ha in the hybrid Alize at 70 cm distance <b>between</b> <b>rows,</b> and <b>between</b> 26. 71 t/ha in the hybrid Alize and 27. 75 t/ha in the hybrid Arack at the distance of 50 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows.</b> Depending on the fertilization rates, the total biomass at 70 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> ranged from 19. 18 t/ha in the hybrid Arack unfertilized to 31. 69 t/ha in the hybrid Aquilon fertilized N 120 P 60 K 60 +fertilization during the vegetative period. At the distance of 50 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> the total biomass according to the fertilization rates varied between 19. 14 t/ha in the hybrid Alize unfertilized and 31. 77 t/ha in the hybrid Aquilon fertilized N 120 P 60 K 60 +fertilization during the vegetative period.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} determine the appropriate planting distances of Ipecac plants (Cephaelis ipecacuanha Rich) grown under a tropical rain forest canopy.

The percentage of surviving plants increased linearly (P< 0. 01)  as distance <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> or <b>between</b> plants within a row increased. Three criteria useful to choose planting distances of Ipecac are discussed: 1) age and size of the plants at the uprooting time; 2) spread of structures of fungi known to infect this crop in Costa Rica as a consequence of heavy rain drops striking infected soil or plant tissue; 3) the benefit/cost ratio. Planting distances of 20. 0 cm <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> and 7. 5 cm between plants yielded the highest dry root weight and thus are recommended, but longer distances <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> should be tested...|$|R
