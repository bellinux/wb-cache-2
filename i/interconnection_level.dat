40|$|Abstract [...] The high <b>interconnection</b> <b>levels</b> of {{electrical}} systems is exposing them more to stringent operating conditions which {{can result in}} power oscillations and consequent system instability. Out to step protections are very useful to disconnect generators when genuine conditions of loose of synchronism arise and especially if the load loci crosses the impedance characteristics of the generators or their GSU transformers. Proper settings of out of step has been widely discussed and appropriate methods to simulate their effectiveness have are being proposed. This paper analyzes {{the benefits of the}} existing setting procedure and proposes efficient and practical methods to obtain results from stability programs, translated into COMTRADE formats to be applied to relays via modern testing equipment. The results help to confirm or propose modifications to current practices aiming the best possible protection of generation facilities.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of extremely compact multifunctional microsystems {{is a highly}} profitable long-term approach in spacecraft design. These systems bring substantial launch-cost reductions, and enable exciting space exploration and science missions. Silicon microsystems technology is an adequate choice for the multifunctional microsystem development. However, the development of basic microsystems technology cannot be financed within application-specific space missions. Rather, the microsystems technology should be matured through fundamental research. Silicon microsystems technology was used to develop a cold gas microthruster system suitable for minute movements of spacecraft (low Δv). In a hybrid integration, the system unit contains three silicon microsystem parts with four individual thrusters in total, together with external control electronics. The total mass is 0. 35 kg. Further integration {{will result in a}} mass of 0. 08 kg. Complete system integration means that all package and <b>interconnection</b> <b>levels</b> are integrated into the silicon microsystem units. Several vital issues must be addressed, e. g. the reliable bonding of silicon wafers, the microfabrication process compatibility, and the manufacture process sequence. A graphical tool is introduced for process sequence evaluation. Wafer bonding is used as fabrication process, assembly tool, and packaging technique. The quality and reliability of the bonded interfaces must be assessed in order to secure the operation of the microsystems in space. Therefore, statistical methods for burst test evaluation have been developed. Weibull fracture probability functions have been derived in order to interpret the bond quality. In addition, rank-sum tests on spot series and analysis of variance are performed for bond quality diagnostics. The dependence on annealing temperature and surface-activation are presented, together with diagnosed degradation of insufficiently annealed bonds due to different spaceflight environments (thermal cycling, vibration, γ-irradiation) ...|$|R
