5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bag</b> a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
2500|$|In a non-technical sense, Infocom was {{responsible}} for developing the interactive style that would be emulated by many later interpreters. The Infocom parser was {{widely regarded as the}} best of its era. It accepted complex, complete sentence commands like [...] "put the blue book on the writing desk" [...] {{at a time when most}} of its competitors parsers were restricted to simple two word verb-noun combinations such as [...] "put book". The parser was actively upgraded with new features like undo and error correction, and later games would 'understand' multiple sentence input: 'pick up the gem and put it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bag.</b> take the newspaper clipping out of my bag then burn it with the book of matches'.|$|E

He worked for me some half-dozen years <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bagging</b> factory, and he was my best hand, sir. He is an ingenious fellow, too: he invented a machine for the cleaning of hemp--a really valuable affair; it's gone into use in several factories. His master holds the patent of it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Without {{asking why}} it was so {{precious}} I took the pig and placed it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> work <b>bag,</b> where it has been ever since.

5000|$|Candiotti, nicknamed [...] "The Candy Man" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "Candy", was not drafted by any major-league team despite his success at Saint Mary's College.

Candiotti won five games that year for a Victoria team that lost out on the pennant by percentage points to the Walla Walla Padres. [...] "I {{had no place to}} stay", Candiotti recalled years later. [...] "For a week, I stayed in the locker room. After that, I stayed with a buddy. I slept on the floor at his place. I didn't have any money. I didn't have a car or anything. There were even a couple of times when I slept on the field <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sleeping <b>bag.</b> It was that bad." ...|$|R

In the first place, you must get me the stain; in the second, you must go into the bazaar and buy me a loincloth and light jacket, such as the {{soldiers}} wear when they lay aside their uniforms. As to the uniform, that is already arranged for; and I shall, of course, have one of the sheepskin greatcoats that have just been served out, and which I expect I shall find indispensable. Put <b>in</b> <b>my</b> kit <b>bag</b> one pair of my thickest woollen vests and drawers. I cannot carry more, for I mean to take one suit of my own clothes to put on in case, by any accident, I should be discovered and sent back. I can get that carried on the baggage waggon.|$|R
