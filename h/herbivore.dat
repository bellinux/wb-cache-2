5|$|Our {{understanding}} of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; {{the observation of}} plant debris in fossilised animal faeces; {{and the construction of}} <b>herbivore</b> mouthparts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this study, the non-additivity {{of effects}} of <b>herbivores</b> and {{pollinator}} on fitness {{of the plant}} Erysimum mediohispanicum (Cruciferae) has been experimentally tested. The abundance and diversity of the pollinator assemblage of plants excluded from and exposed to mammalian <b>herbivores,</b> and the combined effect of pollinators and <b>herbivores</b> on plant reproduction were determined {{over a period of}} 2 years. Pollinator abundance was higher and diversity was lower on plants excluded from <b>herbivores.</b> Furthermore, the experimental exclusions demonstrated that both pollinators and <b>herbivores</b> affected plant fitness, but their effects were not independent. <b>Herbivores</b> only had a detrimental effect on plant fitness when pollinators were present. Similarly, pollinators enhanced fitness only when <b>herbivores</b> were excluded. This outcome demonstrates that the importance of pollinators for plant fitness depends on the occurrence of <b>herbivores,</b> and suggests that <b>herbivores</b> may hamper pollinator-mediated adaptation in plants...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the habitat selection patterns by wild <b>herbivores</b> is critical for adaptive management, particularly towards ecosystem management and wildlife conservation in semi arid savanna ecosystems. We tested the following predictions: (i) surface water availability, habitat quality and human presence have a strong influence on the spatial distribution of wild <b>herbivores</b> in the dry season, (ii) habitat suitability for large <b>herbivores</b> would be higher compared to medium-sized <b>herbivores</b> in the dry season, and (iii) spatial extent of suitable habitats for wild <b>herbivores</b> will be different between years, i. e., 2006 and 2010, in Matetsi Safari Area, Zimbabwe. MaxEnt modeling was done to determine the habitat suitability of large <b>herbivores</b> and medium-sized <b>herbivores.</b> MaxEnt modeling of habitat suitability for large <b>herbivores</b> using the environmental variables was successful for the selected species in 2006 and 2010, except for elephant (Loxodonta africana) for the year 2010. Overall, large <b>herbivores</b> probability of occurrence was mostly influenced by distance from rivers. Distance from roads influenced much of the variability in the probability of occurrence of medium-sized <b>herbivores.</b> The overall predicted area for large and medium-sized <b>herbivores</b> was not different. Large <b>herbivores</b> may not necessarily utilize larger habitat patches over medium-sized <b>herbivores</b> due to the habitat homogenizing effect of water provisioning. Effect of surface water availability, proximity to riverine ecosystems and roads on habitat suitability of large and medium-sized <b>herbivores</b> in the dry season was highly variable thus could change {{from one year to}} another. We recommend adaptive management initiatives aimed at ensuring dynamic water supply in protected areas through temporal closure and or opening of water points to promote heterogeneity of wildlife habitats...|$|R

50|$|There are {{mechanisms}} that plants use {{to defend themselves}} against the grazing pressure of <b>herbivores.</b> Carbon-based secondary metabolites inhibit digestion in <b>herbivores.</b> Tough leafs provide physical defense against <b>herbivores.</b> On the other hand, other features of plants may make them more susceptible to <b>herbivores.</b> For example, leafs that are high in nitrogen have a higher dietary value for <b>herbivores.</b> Also, taller plants and forbs are often more sensitive to grazing, while shorter herbs can avoid the grazing by being overlooked by the grazing animals.|$|R
40|$|Nutrient {{pollution}} and fishing {{are the primary}} local causes of coral reef decline but their ecosystem-scale effects are poorly understood. Results from small-scale manipulative experiments of <b>herbivores</b> and nutrients suggest prioritizing management of fishing over nutrient pollution because <b>herbivores</b> can control macroalgae and turf {{in the presence of}} nutrients. However, ecological theory suggests that the opposite occurs at large scales. Moreover, it is unclear whether fishing decreases <b>herbivores</b> because fishing of predators may result in an increase in <b>herbivores.</b> To investigate this paradox, data on the fish and benthic communities, fishing, and nutrients were collected on Kiritimati, Kiribati. Oceanographic conditions and a population resettlement program created a natural experiment to compare sites with different levels of fishing and nutrients. Contrary to theory, <b>herbivores</b> controlled macroalgae in the presence of nutrients at large spatial scales, and <b>herbivores</b> had greater effects on macroalgae when nutrients were higher. In addition, fishing did not increase <b>herbivores.</b> These results suggest that protecting <b>herbivores</b> may have greater relative benefits than reducing nutrient pollution, especially on polluted reefs. Reallocating fishing effort from <b>herbivores</b> to invertivores or planktivores may be one way to protect <b>herbivores</b> and indirectly maintain coral dominance on reefs impacted by fishing and nutrient pollution...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{small size}} usually {{makes it easier}} for <b>herbivores</b> to escape or hide from predators, the {{decreased}} predation pressure on islands can allow them to grow larger.

5|$|Many governments now {{prohibit}} {{removal of}} coral from reefs, and inform coastal residents about reef protection and ecology.

5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare is a <b>herbivore,</b> {{and mostly}} feeds on moorland grasses such as bentgrass (Agrostis), goosegrass (Eleusine), Festuca, fountaingrass (Pennisetum) and bluegrass (Poa).

Not much has been recorded about its reproduction and behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{metabolic}} {{products can}} also be useful to <b>herbivores</b> due to the antibiotic properties of the toxins, which can protect <b>herbivores</b> against pathogens.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} among {{plants can}} influence host choice and larval performance in insect <b>herbivores.</b> Ploidy (cytotype) variation {{is a particularly}} dramatic form of plant genetic variation, and where diploid and polyploid cytotypes of a species occur in sympatry, they may provide <b>herbivores</b> with choices that are distinguished by profound and genome-wide genetic differences. We tested for nonrandom attack by five gallmaking insect <b>herbivores</b> on diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid cytotypes of the goldenrod Solidago altissima L., working in seven midwestern US populations where the ploidies co-occur on spatial scales relevant to insect host choice. For {{four of the five}} <b>herbivores,</b> attack was non-random with respect to ploidy at one or more sites. Ploidy effects on attack were complex: the ploidy subjected to highest attack varied both across <b>herbivores</b> within sites and (for most <b>herbivores)</b> across sites within <b>herbivores.</b> Ploidy effects on attack will alter rates of encounter between insect <b>herbivores</b> [...] either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of two <b>herbivores</b> sharing a host plant ramet, compared with the case with no effects of ploidy. Plant ploidy variation appears likely to {{have a major impact on}} insect community organization, and perhaps on plant-herbivore coevolution, but that impact is likely to be spatially heterogeneous...|$|R
30|$|Although {{livestock}} and wildlife share {{most of their}} ranges worldwide, little controlled experimental {{research has been done}} on their interactions. Since 1995 we have been manipulating the presence of cattle and large wild ungulates in a Kenyan savanna rangeland in order to better understand the nature of competition and coexistence between these two guilds of <b>herbivores</b> and how they affect biodiversity. In a replicated experiment in which different combinations of cattle and wild <b>herbivores</b> are allowed access to large-scale plots, we have been monitoring the impacts of these <b>herbivores</b> on vegetation, on the wild <b>herbivores,</b> and cattle themselves, and on a variety of other taxa. We have also been conducting experimental research to examine other ways in which livestock management in eastern Africa might affect biodiversity. These include studies on the impacts of fire, livestock corrals, and changes in tree density. This research has revealed the following patterns. (1) Cattle suppress many species of wild <b>herbivores,</b> presumably through competition for their shared resources. The nature of this competition, however, is contingent on rainfall and the presence of other <b>herbivores.</b> (2) Wild <b>herbivores</b> both compete with and facilitate cattle, depending on rainfall. (3) The pastoral practice of housing livestock nightly in protective corral enclosures (“bomas”) over time produces long-lived nutrient hotspots preferred by both {{livestock and}} wild <b>herbivores.</b> (4) Fire, frequently used by pastoralists in the past, is valuable for improving grass quality, with benefits for many species of wild <b>herbivores.</b> (5) Pastoral practices that reduce woody cover, including burning and boma construction, create local habitat patches that are preferred by wild <b>herbivores,</b> apparently for their greater anti-predator visibility. (6) Despite competition between livestock and wild <b>herbivores,</b> coexistence between these two guilds can be managed, and there are several positive (facilitative) pathways between livestock husbandry and wild <b>herbivores</b> and other biodiversity.|$|R
5|$|The geranium, for example, {{produces}} a unique chemical compound in its petals {{to defend itself}} from Japanese beetles.

5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of <b>herbivores.</b> Plants can sense being touched, and they can use several strategies to defend against damage caused by <b>herbivores.</b> Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of <b>herbivores.</b> These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to <b>herbivores,</b> or reduce plant digestibility.|$|R
40|$|Large {{mammalian}} <b>herbivores</b> {{are both}} predators and dispersers of Acacia seeds. While {{some of the}} seeds are destroyed during passage through the <b>herbivore's</b> digestive tract, others are defecated unharmed. Ingestion by large <b>herbivores</b> facilitates germination by scarification of the seed coat. The extent {{of the influence of}} <b>herbivores</b> on seed dispersal and germination depends on seed retention time and tooth size, which are both positively correlated with body size. Infestation by bruchid beetles (Bruchidae) reduces Acacia germination. <b>Herbivores</b> may reduce bruchid infestation in several ways. Larvae in recently infested seeds are killed by stomach acids penetrating the seed through the larval entry hole. Seeds that are partly excavated by burrowing larvae in more advanced stages may be crushed by the <b>herbivore's</b> teeth. Lastly, but probably most crucially, <b>herbivores</b> simply remove seeds from the natal tree prior to infestation or at least prior to reinfestation. The timing and magnitude of herbivory is crucial for both the reduction of bruchid infestation and Acacia seedling establishment. Although it is widely agreed that a three-way interaction exists between bruchid beetles, Acacia trees and large mammalian <b>herbivores,</b> it is also apparent that the relationship is highly complex and is not yet completely understood.

5|$|A <b>herbivore,</b> {{the royal}} {{antelope}} prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the antelope {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.|$|E
5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals were {{attracted}} to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. <b>Herbivore</b> entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of <b>herbivore</b> remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that {{only a few of the}} carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{abundant}} <b>herbivore</b> was the dicynodont Diictodon, with over 1900 known specimens from the Cistecephalus AZ.

The biarmosuchians Lemurosaurus, Lycaenodon, Paraburnetia, and Rubidgina were also present, along with the cynodonts Cynosaurus and Procynosuchus. Non-synapsids included the archosauromorph Younginia; the parareptilians Anthodon, Milleretta, Nanoparia, Owenetta, and Pareiasaurus; and the temnospondyl Rhinesuchus.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} ecological {{function of}} plants {{is that they}} produce organic compounds for <b>herbivores</b> {{in the bottom of}} the food web. A large number of plant traits, from thorns to chemical defenses, can be related to the intensity of herbivory. Large <b>herbivores</b> can also have many effects on vegetation. These include removing selected species, creating gaps for regeneration of new individuals, recycling nutrients, and dispersing seeds. Certain ecosystem types, such as grasslands, may be dominated by the effects of large <b>herbivores,</b> although fire is also an equally important factor in this biome. In few cases, <b>herbivores</b> are capable of nearly removing all the vegetation at a site (for example, geese in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Canada, and nutria in the marshes of Louisiana) but normally <b>herbivores</b> have a more selective impact, particularly when large predators control the abundance of <b>herbivores.</b> The usual method of studying the effects of <b>herbivores</b> is to build exclosures, where they cannot feed, and compare the plant communities in the exclosures to those outside over many years. Often such long term experiments show that <b>herbivores</b> have a significant effect upon the species that make up the plant community.|$|R
5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies used}} by plants include escaping or avoiding <b>herbivores</b> in any time and/or any place, for example by growing in a location where plants {{are not easily}} found or accessed by <b>herbivores,</b> or by changing seasonal growth patterns. Another approach diverts <b>herbivores</b> toward eating non-essential parts, or enhances {{the ability of a}} plant to recover from the damage caused by herbivory. Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of <b>herbivores,</b> which in turn protect the plant. Each type of defense can be either constitutive (always present in the plant), or induced (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by <b>herbivores).</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{were large}} predators, but members of various lines diversified into other niches. Aetosaurs were <b>herbivores</b> and some {{developed}} extensive armor. A few crocodilians were <b>herbivores,</b> e.g., Simosuchus, Phyllodontosuchus. The large crocodilian Stomatosuchus {{may have been}} a filter feeder. Sauropodomorphs and ornithischian dinosaurs were <b>herbivores</b> with diverse adaptations for feeding biomechanics.|$|R
5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a <b>herbivore.</b> Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores.

40|$|Root-feeding insects {{can affect}} the {{performance}} of aboveground insect <b>herbivores</b> when {{they are forced to}} feed on the same host plant. Here we explored whether the oviposition behaviour of two closely related herbivorous species (cabbage butterflies; Lepidoptera: Pieridae) is influenced by root-feeding insects, when they are given the chance to choose between host plants with and without root <b>herbivores.</b> Considering that egg load is an important physiological factor influencing the foraging behaviour of insects, we also examined whether root-feeding insects differentially influence oviposition preference in butterflies with low and high egg loads. Oviposition preference in both butterfly species with low and high egg loads was monitored using host plants with and without root <b>herbivores.</b> To ascertain the status of butterfly age with low and high egg loads, the oviducts of a separate group of butterflies was dissected to record the number of immature and mature eggs in butterflies of various ages. Pieris brassicae L. butterflies with low egg loads preferred plants without root <b>herbivores</b> over plants with root <b>herbivores,</b> and laid more egg clutches on the leaves of plants that were not attacked by root <b>herbivores.</b> Butterflies with comparatively high egg loads also selected a larger proportion of plants without root <b>herbivores,</b> but laid a similar number of egg clutches on the plant shoots independent of {{the presence or absence of}} root <b>herbivores</b> belowground. Independent of the age and egg load, Pieris rapae L. butterflies selected a larger proportion of plants not attacked by root <b>herbivores</b> to lay eggs, but the number of eggs laid was similar in plants with and without root <b>herbivores.</b> This study shows that belowground insects can influence behavioural decisions of aboveground insect <b>herbivores.</b> Interestingly, the strength of these interactions depends on the physiological state of the insects which is probably correlated with their perception of environmental quality. ...|$|R
