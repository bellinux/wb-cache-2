The most {{discordant}} {{feature in}} the whole scene is the cloud which hovers above the glass furnaces of Murano; but this we may not regret, as {{it is one of}} the last signs left of human exertion among the ruinous villages which surround us. The silent gliding of the gondola brings it nearer to us every moment; we pass the cemetery, and a deep sea-channel which separates it from Murano, and finally enter a narrow water-street, with a paved footpath on each side, raised three or four feet above the canal, and forming a kind of quay between the water and the doors of the houses. These latter are, for the most part, low, but built with massy doors and windows of marble or Istrian stone, square-set and barred with iron; buildings evidently once of no mean order, though now inhabited only by the poor. Here and there an ogee window of the fourteenth century, or a doorway deeply enriched with cable mouldings, shows itself in the midst of more ordinary features; and several houses, consisting of one story only carried on square pillars, forming a short arcade along the quay, have windows sustained on shafts of red Verona marble, of singular grace and delicacy. All now in vain: little care is there for their delicacy or grace among the rough fishermen sauntering on the quay with their jackets hanging loose from their shoulders, jacket and cap and hair all of the same dark-greenish sea-grey. But there is some life in the scene, more than is usual in Venice: the women are sitting at their doors knitting busily, and various workmen of the glass-houses sifting <b>glass</b> <b>dust</b> upon the pavement, and strange cries coming from one side of the canal to the other, and ringing far along the crowded water, from venders of figs and grapes, and gourds and shell-fish; cries partly descriptive of the eatables in question, but interspersed with others of a character unintelligible in proportion to their violence, and fortunately so if we may judge by a sentence which is stencilled in black, within a garland, on the whitewashed walls of nearly every other house in the street, but which, how often soever written, no one seems to regard: [...] "Bestemme non più. Lodate Gesù." ...|$|E

40|$|Issue: All {{types of}} dust {{have come under}} {{increasing}} regulatory control in the U. S. {{because of the potential}} or perceived health hazards they pose toward workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets standards for worker exposure to airborne dust under Federal regulations 29 CFR 1910. 1000. The standards can substantially effect the cost of dust control and material handling, as well as company liability for worker safety. Container glass is made from over 70 % silica. The term silica refers to the naturally occurring mineral silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Crystalline forms of silica, also known as “free”silica, can contribute to certain lung diseases under prolonged exposure conditions. An understanding of the difference between <b>glass</b> <b>dusts</b> and silica dusts in the crystalline form, and what the permissible exposure limits are, is necessary to ensure worker safety and to avoid liability in recycled glass processing. Best Practice: Glass In considering <b>glass</b> <b>dusts,</b> it is important to evaluate both the chemical composition of glass and its physical state. Bottle glass is a silicate containing various other ingredients that have been melted and upon cooling form an amorphous, or noncrystalline structure. The majority of the raw material silica occurs as quartz, a crystalline form of SiO 2. Other crystalline forms of silica include tridymite and cristobalite. Whil...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Understanding the {{chemical}} composition of container glass {{is critical to}} recycling {{for a number of}} reasons. First, the chemistry has significant implications for managing the behavior of molten glass in any remelt application, from large-scale container manufacturing down to cottage-industry pressed glass. Second, the composition has important implications for evaluating health concerns related to glass handling, such as free silica content (see Analysis of <b>Glass</b> <b>Dusts</b> Best Practice). In addition, product manufacturers are required to produce Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) which describe chemical composition and special handling precautions. Finally, the chemistry is important in determining the compatibility of glass with new and novel secondary uses. Best Practice: More than 95 % of all manufactured glass is made from sodium oxide, calcium oxide, and silicon dioxide, commonly referred to as a soda-lime-silica composition. Due to universal similarities in manufacturing techniques for glass containers, particularly the viscosity requirements of high-speed “press and blow ” production equipment, {{the chemical}} formulations of glass food and beverage containers have relative uniformity and compatibility. Container glass is formulated to set up quickly and to hold its shape when mechanically blown into molds. A random mix of container glasses is anticipated to be relatively homogenous, provided there are no significant contamination levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhalation}} of <b>glass</b> <b>dusts</b> {{mixed in}} resin, generally known as glass fiber–reinforced plastic (GRP), represents a little-studied occupational hazard. The few studies performed have highlighted nonspecific lung disorders in animals and in humans. In {{the present study}} we evaluated the alteration of the respiratory system and the pathogenic mechanisms causing the changes {{in a group of}} working men employed in different GRP processing operations and exposed to production dusts. The study was conducted on a sample of 29 male subjects whose mean age was 37 years and mean length of service 11 years. All of the subjects were submitted to a clinical check-up, basic tests, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); microscopic studies and biochemical analysis were performed on the BAL fluid. Tests of respiratory function showed a large number of obstructive syndromes; scanning electron microscopy highlighted qualitative and quantitative alterations of the alveolar macrophages; and transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of electron-dense cytoplasmatic inclusions indicating intense and active phlogosis (external inflammation). Biochemical analyses highlighted an increase in protein content associated with alterations of the lung oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis. Inhalation of GRP, independent of environmental concentration, causes alterations of the cellular and humoral components of pulmonary interstitium; these alterations are identified microscopically as acute alveolitis...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Processed {{recycled}} glass {{has been sold}} as an abrasive blasting medium under several brand names {{in different parts of}} the United States. However, limited public information is available regarding the performance of finely sized crushed glass in abrasive applications because manufacturers have developed their own proprietary data. Historically, the predominant material used for abrasive blasting was silica sand, hence the common reference to “sandblasting. ” Other media include garnet, staurolite and industrial by-products such as coal slag, copper slag, nickel slag and steel grit. Even walnut shells and plastic beads have been used for abrasive blasting. Individual abrasive media performance depends on hardness, shape, size, weight, and other characteristics. Health- considerations are sometimes significant in evaluating blasting abrasives. For example, concerns about silicosis due to the presence of crystalline silica have resulted in very little silica sand now being used in abrasive blasting. Best Practice: While silica sand is a raw material used in the production of glass (see Chemical Composition of Container Glass Best Practice), the manufacturing process converts the crystalline structure to an amorphous state. Tests have shown that recycled container glass contains less than 1 % crystalline silica (see Analysis of <b>Glass</b> <b>Dusts</b> Best Practice).

40|$|Issue: Processing {{any type}} of glass for {{recycling}} requires size reduction (crushing), an activity that creates fine particles of glass that can become airborne dust. All types of dust have come under increasing regulatory control in the U. S. {{because of the potential}} health hazards they pose toward workers (see Analysis of <b>Glass</b> <b>Dusts</b> Best Practice). Controlling dust in an industrial processing facility can be a costly proposition. Knowledge of effective dust control strategies for glass processing facilities is essential to create a safe working environment and to mitigate liability concerns. Best Practice: In designing a dust control system for a glass processing facility, {{it is important to consider}} the entire processing system layout. This includes everything from where material is received, to where finished product is loaded for shipment. One design strategy to minimize airborne dust generation involves enclosing equipment at any point where dust is likely to be created, particularly where the glass drops from one material handling device onto another, such as the discharge from the crushing mechanism, conveyors, and screens. Most material handling equipment is now available with enclosures from manufacturers. These products are a recent development by equipment manufacturers in response to growing health concerns related to airborne dusts. In designing enclosures on equipment such as conveyor belts, access to the processing lines should be considered, particularly at points where blockage of materia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Glass</b> <b>dust</b> waste creates chronic {{environmental}} problems, mainly {{due to the}} inconsistency {{of waste}} glass streams. Glass is widely used in our lives through manufactured products such as sheet glass, bottles, glassware, and vacuum tubing. Glass is an ideal material for recycling. The use of recycled glass helps in energy saving. The increasing awareness of glass recycling speeds up inspections {{on the use of}} waste glass with different forms in various fields. One of its significant contributions is to the construction field where the waste glass was reused for concrete production. The properties of concretes containing <b>glass</b> <b>dust</b> waste as fine aggregate were investigated in this study. <b>Glass</b> <b>dust</b> waste was used as a partial replacement for sand at 10 %, 20 % and 50 % of concrete mixes.

40|$|Issue: Recycled glass {{aggregate}} is {{a relatively}} new construction material. To promote its use, studies have been conducted to determine its engineering performance and environmental impact. The studies suggest that cullet aggregate is strong, clean, and safe to use. However, because cullet aggregate remains a relatively unfamiliar material, safety concerns surrounding the use of “crushed glass ” may discourage its use. These concerns generally involve the potential for skin cuts and punctures, and exposure to <b>glass</b> <b>dust</b> during transportation, handling, and placement. In order to ease concerns and to maintain a safe working environment, information about necessary precautions is needed. Best Practice: The most common health concern regarding the use of cullet aggregates is the potential for skin cuts or penetration. Workers may come into physical contact with cullet particles during transportation or placement of the cullet. Experience has shown that cullet 3 / 4 inch or smaller presents no greater cut or penetration hazard than fractured natural aggregates such as crushed rock. Therefore, the same safety precautions for working with natural aggregates should also be followed when working with cullet. Exposure to <b>glass</b> <b>dust</b> is another health concern with cullet aggregate. Studies have been conducted to determine whether <b>glass</b> <b>dust</b> contains crystalline silica, a known carcinogen. These studies have found tha...|$|E
