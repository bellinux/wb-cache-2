40|$|In this thesis, I use {{experimental}} and quasi-experimental data from 25 villages {{and a total}} of 1, 105 farmers from eastern DRC to investigate the relationship among agricultural training, the adoption of agricultural technologies, crop productivity, and household food insecurity and dietary diversity. I present evidence that contributes to narrow the gap in the literature on the role of input subsidies fostering small-scale farmers&# 39; uptake of productivity-enhancing technologies, how farmer field school and farmer-to-farmer trainings affect the adoption of agricultural technologies, how F 2 <b>F</b> <b>training</b> may reduce the costs of FFS implementation, how adoption materializes on yields of food crops, and how training through the adoption of improved agricultural technologies impacts household food insecurity and the diet diversification of target households. As a complement to econometric evidence and {{in order to understand the}} main findings, I also discuss behavioral features and farmer driven initiatives which somehow condition these impacts. Throughout the four main chapters, I identify practical implications that are highly important for the design and implementation of new programs and policies aimed to address agricultural productivity issues and reduce household food insecurity. In Chapter 1 I develop a general introduction to the research which discusses the evolution of agricultural extension in the last few decades, and describe FFS and F 2 <b>F</b> <b>training</b> methodologies. Chapter 2 provides a detailed description of the project intervention, technologies promoted, research settings and the data collection process. In Chapter 3, I report the results of an experimental study that analyses the impact of one-shot input starter packs on the adoption of productivity-enhancing complementary practices, which have the potential to maximize the impact of starter pack inputs. Additionally, I assess the levels of persistence on farmers’ use of improved crop seeds which are included in the starter packs. Overall, I find no evidence of starter packs’ impact on small-scale farmers’ adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies. Similarly, the levels of persistence regarding the use of seeds following the delivery of starter packs were not significant. These results are consistent with studies that have found minimal or no persistence on the use of inputs following the provision of subsidies, including Duflo, Kremer et al. (2011). The limited impact that starter packs had on yields in the first year may logically explain that farmers refrained from using improved seeds subsequently because the inputs are not economically attractive. Chapter 4 studies the effectiveness of knowledge transmission from farmers trained in FFS through farmer-to-farmer training (F 2 F), which could potentially result in lower extension costs and higher impacts. I find that FFS training has a higher impact than F 2 <b>F</b> <b>training</b> in the first period, but the magnitude of the treatment effect in the second period is not statistically different between the two training methods. I argue that the dissemination of technologies promoted in FFS groups can well be formalized through farmer-to-farmer deliberate training attached to the FFS approach. Given the low costs of F 2 <b>F</b> <b>training</b> compared to FFS, the introduction of F 2 <b>F</b> <b>training</b> may substantially alleviate a major constraint to the large-scale introduction of FFS as a training method, its high costs. In Chapter 5, I study the impact of farmer’s participation in FFS and F 2 <b>F</b> <b>training</b> on small-scale agricultural productivity. A multi-crop yield-index and the yields of cassava were used as impact indicators. The results indicate that both FFS and F 2 F trainings contribute to a significant increase in farmers’ yields, especially in the second period when the magnitude of the effect substantially increased. We also learned that the effect size does not differ between the two training approaches in neither period, suggesting that F 2 F communications are a suitable alternative or complement to FFS training. While the chapter was unable to confirm if training materializes in higher yields through technology adoption, I argue that in the context of the sample the adoption of productivity-enhancing practices and inputs are likely the most important impact mechanism. I also study the relationship between agricultural training, the adoption of improved technologies and household food insecurity. I find that farmers’ participation in agricultural trainings has a positive effect, through the adoption of improved technologies, on improvements in household dietary diversity (HDDS). Nonetheless, the impact on household access to food (HFIAS) is less evident. These results suggest that FFS/F 2 <b>F</b> <b>training</b> can well reduce household food insecurity, which is mostly achieved through the adoption of improved agricultural technologies. Yet, there are farm and household specific factors which constrain how training impacts technology adoption and how adoption affect household food insecurity and diet diversification. In Chapter 7, I synthesize the results of the four main chapters and articulate the sequence of results from training to adoption to productivity to food security...|$|E

5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction <b>F</b> <b>trains</b> started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour <b>F</b> <b>trains</b> may start running express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the <b>F</b> <b>trains</b> as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound <b>F</b> <b>trains</b> would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. <b>F</b> express <b>trains</b> would be slightly more crowded than current <b>F</b> <b>trains,</b> but the <b>F</b> locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent <b>F</b> local <b>trains</b> at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{significant}} requirement of trained personnel in Fish Health Management, the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC/AQD) offered 14 sessions of face-to-face (F 2 <b>F)</b> <b>training</b> (1988 - 2002) at its station in Iloilo. However, shrinking fellowship and travel funds necessitated {{a shift in}} training paradigm. Thus, transformation of teaching materials used in F 2 F trainings resulted to AquaHealth Online, a team developed and electronically delivered course on Health Management in Aquaculture. The general objective of the course transformation was to train a large pool of geographically dispersed participants at minimum cost, and this paper reports on the experience earned in course development, delivery and outcome. To enable Fish Health specialists to develop materials and skills to deliver courses for the online environment, SEAFDEC/AQD collaborated with the University of the Philippines Open University to help adapt, enhance, and reformulate materials in the F 2 F course for online delivery. The specialists underwent hours of training in "techno-pedagogy", or ways of transforming teaching activities into formats that could be understood even in our absence. The primary learning resource is a CD-ROM that provides interactive information with self-assessment questions. The course covers 12 modules in 4 units: I. Introduction to Fish Health Management; II. Infectious Diseases of Fish and Crustaceans; III. Non-Infectious Diseases; and IV. Disease Diagnosis, Prevention and Control. Learning enhancement and discussion occurs through internet-based Discussion Boards (DBs) presided over by module specialists. The DBs serve as media for asynchronous discussions and makes a permanent record of lessons learned. When first offered in 2002, AquaHealth Online had 25 enrollees from 10 countries. In 2003, there were 17 participants from 8 countries. Participants were led to "just-in" relevant information and encouraged to submit assignments from internet resources.

40|$|To {{accomplish}} {{more with}} fewer resources, many organizations are turning from costly traditional face-to-face (F 2 <b>F)</b> <b>training</b> to alternate methods, such as self-paced eLearning and distance learning. Distance learning is beneficial for various learning events, such as semester-long academic courses, {{which are often}} asynchronous, and shorter events, such as Webinars, which are typically synchronous. Although asynchronous methods, where learners interact with content and each other on individual timetables, can provide significant advantages, some learning experiences warrant synchronous real-time human interaction. Engaging synchronous distance learning can provide the economy of distributed learning while retaining the human element of F 2 F environments.

The study also assessed the prevalence of contemporary training practices frequently recommended for powerlifters in the popular literature. A 20 -item survey was distributed to 32 elite British powerlifters at an International competition. The subject group included multiple national, international and commonwealth champions and record holders. Based on 2007 competition results the average Wilks score of the group was 450. 26 ± 34. 7. The response rate for the surveys was 88 % (28 of 32). The survey was sectioned into 6 areas of inquiry (a) repetition speed, (b) explosive training load, (c) resistance materials used, (d) adjunct power training methods, (e) exercise selection, (<b>f)</b> <b>training</b> organization.
