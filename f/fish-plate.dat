40|$|Joints in {{railway track}} are {{vulnerable}} to failure, so most modern rail is welded. However, many signalling systems rely on sections of rail being electrically isolated from adjacent sections so insulated joints are necessary. At these joints several millimetres of insulation material, an “end post”, separates {{the ends of the}} rails. To support the rail two pieces of steel (known as fish-plates) are bolted {{on either side of the}} rail web. All steel components are separated from each other by insulation material. Conventional designs of rail joints are known to suffer from a range of failure modes: bolt failures, rail breaks, <b>fish-plate</b> failure, insulation degradation, and lipping (in which plastic flow in the rail ends bridges the gap between the rail ends). To assist in developing improved designs accelerated test procedures and sophisticated finite element models have been developed; this paper describes both. Results from physical testing and numerical modelling are presented and compared...|$|E

50|$|All {{permanent}} way, rolling {{stocks were}} transported from England in sailing ships to Calcutta via the Cape of Good Hope (the Suez Canal did not then exist). In April 1854, {{it was estimated}} that over 100,000 tons of rails, 27,000 tons of chairs, and some 8000 tons of keys, <b>fish-plates,</b> pins, nuts and bolts were needed.|$|R
50|$|Whilst jointed track has {{suffered}} buckles in the past; the <b>fish-plates</b> {{need to be}} removed and greased annually (the requirement was relaxed to bi-annually in 1993) and where this was forgotten or where ballast conditions were especially weak, buckling took place in hot weather. In addition, if rails were allowed to creep, it was always possible that several successive joints closed up, so that the expansion gap was lost, with inevitable results {{at the onset of}} hot weather.|$|R
5000|$|The railway is [...] gauge and {{virtually}} all single-track. 200,000 individual 30 ft rail-lengths and 1.2 million sleepers, 200,000 <b>fish-plates,</b> 400,000 fish-bolts and 4.8 million steel keys plus steel girders for viaducts and causeways had to be imported, necessitating {{the creation of a}} modern port at Kilindini Harbour in Mombasa. The railway was a huge logistical achievement and became strategically and economically vital for both Uganda and Kenya. It helped to suppress slavery, by removing the need for humans in the transport of goods.|$|R
50|$|The {{region has}} been proclaimed {{a zone of}} archaeological protection. It {{contains}} unique sites of archaeological interest, such as the tomb of Thrasymedes at Voidokoilia, the remains of Classical Pylos at Koryphasion, Palaiokastro or Palaionavarino, the cave of Nestor. In the 1960s at Yalova proper at the site called Divari, N. Yalouris, then director of the local archaeological service, excavated a Hellenistic necropolis. The excavations revealed several unspoiled shaft graves. Apart from the skeletal material, the graves were full of grave goods, mainly pottery, as well as coins, objects made of various metals and jewellery. Among these finds stand out a delta-shaped askos, known also as “hot-water bottle”, a clay sieve, a small aryballos made of faience and <b>fish-plates.</b> These finds are kept in the Archaeological Museum of Pylos.|$|R

6000|$|... "In the {{meantime}} {{you will be}} interested to know what my movements were. Everything had been prepared for days before, and only the finishing touches were needed. The side line which we had chosen had once joined the main line, {{but it had been}} disconnected. We had only to replace a few rails to connect it once more. These rails had been laid down as far as could be done without danger of attracting attention, and now it was merely a case of completing a juncture with the line, and arranging the points as they had been before. The sleepers had never been removed, and the rails, <b>fish-plates</b> and rivets were all ready, for we had taken them from a siding on the abandoned portion of the line. With my small but competent band of workers, we had everything ready long before the special arrived. When it did arrive, it ran off upon the small side line so easily that the jolting of the points appears to have been entirely unnoticed by the two travellers.|$|R
50|$|The {{width of}} the line at {{formation}} level is 11 feet on the embankments and 12 feet in cuttings. The gauges were 4 feet 8½ inches. The permanent way consists of flat-bottomed or Vignoles patterned rail stated to weigh 40 lbs per lineal yard in lengths of 15 feet, 17 feet 6 inches, and 21 feet, laid on transverse sleepers of half-round Baltic timber creosoted (4½ in.), and 9 feet long placed at an average distance of three feet apart, centre to centre, except that {{on some of the}} sharpest curves an extra sleeper has been inserted under every 21 feet length of rail. No chairs are made use of, but the rail is fastened to the transverse sleepers by a fang-bolt with a clip under the head, overlapping the flange of the rail on one side, and by a wrought iron spike on the other side. On the sharpest curves a wrought iron plate is laid between the rail and the sleeper, with holes punched in it, through which the fang-bolt and spike are driven; the joints of the rails are fastened with wrought iron <b>fish-plates</b> and bolts, and secured to the sleepers with a fang-bolt and clip {{on each side of the}} rail. The ballast is of gravel, a small proportion of sand; it was required according to the contract, to be eight inches deep under the sleepers, but is stated to average about one foot. No engine turn table has been provided. The line has a very large number of sharp curves having radii of 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 chains. The steepest incline is 1 in 66.|$|R

5000|$|The {{work itself}} is remarkably incomplete, and {{displays}} a charming disregard {{of the ordinary}} requirements in railway construction. There is not an inch of ballast {{from one end to}} the other, the sleepers are old, and the rails the cast-off stock of the Government lines. For the greater part of the distance the permanent way consists of a slight earth formation laid on the natural surface of the ground, and in many places the top is so narrow that the sleepers project over the sides. There is one good-sized cutting at the back of the Caulfield racecourse, from which about 10,000 square yards of material have been removed, and about a mile and a half from Elsternwick is the only [...] "bank" [...] worth speaking of. For the whole length there are two wooden culverts and one drain, but no ditches or gutters to preserve the earthwork from the destruction now progressing through the accumulation of large quantities of water. The sleepers, bad as they are, have been sparingly used. On regulation, well-ballasted lines, the maximum interval between the timbers is about 3ft, if not less. On the Rosstown line there is a space of 12ft between them, and the rails are only spiked to them alternately. The <b>fish-plates</b> which hold the rails together have four bolt-holes each, but only contain two bolts, and the spikes are only driven half home. If the line were to be made use of, everything but the earth and the gates would have to be removed, and then a very large expenditure would be necessary to make the work suitable or the reception of new sleepers and rails. Without reckoning the cost of the land, it is estimated that the line cost something under £1,000 per mile.|$|R
