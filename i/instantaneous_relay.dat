40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{classical}} 2 user Gaussian interference channel has only 1 degree of freedom (DoF), which can be achieved by orthogonal time division among the 2 users. It is also known that the use of conventional relays, which introduce a processing delay of at least one symbol duration relative to the direct paths between sources and destinations, does not increase the DoF of the 2 user interference channel. The use of instantaneous relays (relays-without-delay) has been explored for the single user point-to-point setting and it is known that such a relay, even with memoryless forwarding at the relay, can achieve a higher capacity than conventional relays. In this work, we show that the 2 user interference channel with an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relay,</b> achieves 3 / 2 DoF. Thus, an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relay</b> increases not only the capacity but also the DoF of the 2 user interference channel. The achievable scheme is inspired by the aligned interference neutralization scheme recently proposed for the 2 X 2 X 2 interference channel. Remarkably the DoF gain is achieved with memoryless relays, i. e., with relays that have no memory of past received symbols.

40|$|Cooperative {{transmission}} {{is considered to}} be a key-technique for increasing the robustness, the efficiency, or the coverage of wireless communication networks. The basic concept is that the information transmission from a sender to a receiver can be aided by one or several relay nodes in a cooperative manner under constraints on power, complexity or delay. The main part of this thesis is devoted to studies on practical realizations of cooperative communication systems. Coding solutions that implement the decode-and-forward protocol in three-node relay channels are proposed by employing convolutional and Turbo codes. Distributed Turbo coding (DTC) was the first technique to bring parallel code concatenation into relay networks. To complement the research on parallel concatenated codes, we propose distributed serially concatenated codes (DSCCs) which provide a better error-floor performance and an increased robustness compared with DTCs. Thereafter, we present a flexible distributed code design which can be adapted to the channel conditions in a simple way. For both the cases with perfect and limited channel-state information, the adaptive coding scheme outperforms static codes, like DTCs and DSCCs, in terms of transmission rate and application range. The aforementioned implementations of relaying are based on blockwise decoding and re-encoding at the relay. In some applications, however, these techniques are not feasible due to limited processing and storage capabilities of the relay nodes. Therefore, we propose to combine <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying</b> strategies with bit-interleaved coded modulation. A significant gain can be obtained by using sawtooth and constellation rearrangement relaying with optimized bit-to-symbol mappings compared with conventional <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying</b> strategies and compared with standard mappings optimized for point-to-point communications. Both the parameters of the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying</b> schemes and the bit-to-symbol mappings are optimized to maximize mutual information. QC 2010060...|$|R

40|$|In a {{multi-user}} {{wireless network}} equipped with multiple relay nodes, some relays are more intelligent than other relay nodes.

40|$|Cooperative {{communications}} by pooling available resources—for example, {{power and}} bandwidth—across the network, is a distributed solution for providing robust wireless transmission. Motivated by contemporary applications in multi-hop transmission and ad hoc networks, the classical three-node relay channel (RC) {{consisting of a}} source–destination pair and a relay node has received a renewed attention. One of the crucial aspects of the communication over relay networks (RNs) is the design of proper relaying protocols; that is, how the relay should {{take part in the}} transmission to meet a certain quality of service. In this dissertation, we address the design of reliable transmission strategies and quantification of the associated transmission rates over RNs. We consider three canonical examples of RNs: the classical RC, the multiple-access RC (MARC) and the two-way RC. We also investigate the three-node RC and MARC with state. The capacity of the aforementioned RNs is an open problem in general except for some special cases. In the thesis, we derive various capacity bounds, through which we also identify the capacity of some new classes of RNs. In particular, we introduce the class of state-decoupled RNs and prove that the noisy network coding is capacity achieving under certain conditions. In the thesis, we also study the effect of the memory length on the capacity of RNs. The investigated relaying protocols in the thesis can be categorized into two groups: protocols with a finite relay memory and those with infinite relay memory requirement. In particular, we consider the design of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying</b> (also referred to as memoryless relaying) in which the output of the relay depends solely on the presently received signal at the relay. For optimizing the relay function, we present several algorithms constructed based on grid search and variational methods. Among other things, we surprisingly identify some classes of semi-deterministic RNs for which a properly constructed <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying</b> strategy achieves the capacity. We also show that the capacity of RNs can be increased by allowing the output of the relay to depend on the past received signals as well the current received signal at the relay. As an example, we propose a hybrid digital–analog scheme that outperforms the cutset upper bound for strictly causal relaying. QC 20110909 </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} TDMA-based {{medium access control}} {{protocol}} which enables cooperative communications in multi-hop wireless mesh networks.

Benefiting from the elaborate mini-slot design, channel resources are fairly and efficiently allocated to each router so that no handshake is needed prior to each packet transmission. By providing access priority to cooperative transmission through an optimal relay which is determined by combined <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relay</b> channel conditions, higher system throughput can be achieved. To analyze the performance of the proposed cooperative protocol a Markov chain is introduced to model the behavior ofthe protocol.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} a two-user {{interference}} channel with a causal relay, where the relay’s transmit symbol depends {{not only on}} its past received symbols, but also on its present received symbol. This is an appropriate model for studying amplify-and-forward type relaying when the bandwidth delay-spread product is much smaller than one. For the discrete memoryless interference channel with a causal relay, we derive a genie-aided outer bound. For the Gaussian interference channel with a causal relay, we define strong and very strong interference conditions and propose an outer bound for each case. We also propose an achievable scheme based on instantaneous amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying for the Gaussian interference channel with a causal relay and so it achieves capacity under some conditions.

40|$|Relay {{networks}} and cooperative transmission have spurred considerable interest in recent years, promising performance improvements in, e. g., system capacity, robustness and transmission rate. In this thesis, {{the focus is}} on the so-called half-duplex relay channels, where in the system, a source node wants to transmit a message to a destination node and a relay node can potentially assist this transmission. The relay is said to be half-duplex in the sense that it cannot transmit and receive at the same time within the same frequency band. It is natural to categorize the potential relaying schemes (operations of the relay node) into two kinds. The relay can either decode the message of the source node, or it can process its received signal without decoding. The thesis investigates various schemes of the second kind and they are termed as ``relaying schemes without decoding. '' The first part of the thesis is devoted to the approach of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying.</b> The <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying</b> schemes belong to the relaying schemes without decoding, where the relay node is implemented by a deterministic single-variable function. Both linear and non-linear functions are investigated and it is demonstrated that the functions with sawtooth-like shape give higher achievable rates than other functions investigated. Furthermore, the work is extended to half-duplex multiple-access relay channels, where an extra source node is present. For such channels, the relay's operation is ``instantaneous'' in the sense that it is represented by a deterministic function of two variables. Essentially, the function handles the received signals from the two source nodes, combining them together and transmitting the combined signal to the destination node. Novel functions based on the Archimedean spiral mapping and sawtooth-like functions are proposed and demonstrated to perform well, using achievable rate regions and achievable sum rates of the two source nodes as figures of merit. In the second part of the thesis, the class of relaying schemes without decoding and with memory is investigated, where for such schemes, information theoretic source and channel coding with long codewords is used at the relay node. The two predominant schemes of such kind are the so-called compress-and-forward (CF) and quantize-and-forward (QF) schemes. The achievable rate results of the two schemes and some of their variants are derived for static channels. Furthermore, under the assumption of slow fading channels, with transmitter channel state information (CSIT) not available at the source and relay nodes, outage probabilities, expected rates as well as diversity [...] multiplexing trade-offs (DMT) of the respective schemes are derived and compared. In addition, to compensate for the loss due to the absence of relay CSIT, a finite-resolution feedback link from the destination node to the source node is designed for the CF and QF schemes to provide the relay node with partial CSIT, and thus, the performance of the respective schemes can be improved. Lastly, the thesis considers the problem of lack of relay CSIT from another viewpoint. The concept of hybrid digital-analog coding, as is first investigated in source-channel coding, is adapted and applied at the relay node. Such relaying schemes are termed hybrid digital-analog relaying schemes and their performance in terms of expected rate is studied. It is shown that the hybrid schemes significantly outperform the conventional digital-only (e. g., the CF scheme) and the analog-only schemes (e. g., the so-called amplify-and-forward scheme).

Although they work well with sinusoidal waveforms, there is little published information on their characteristics. Due to shunt connected non-linear devices, {{not the least of which}} is the use of power electronic equipment, the supply is distorted. Consequently, RCCBs as well as other protection relays are subject to non-sinusoidal current waveforms. Recent studies showed that RCCBs are greatly affected by harmonics, however the reasons for this are not clear. A literature search has also shown that there are inconsistencies in the analysis of the effect of harmonics on protection relays. In this work, the way RCCBs operate is examined, then a model is built with the aim of assessing the effect of non-sinusoidal current on RCCBs. Tests are then carried out on a number of RCCBs and these, when compared with the results from the model showed good correlation. In addition, the model also enables us to explain the RCCBs characteristics for pure sinusoidal current. In the model developed, various parameters are evaluated but special attention is paid to the instantaneous value of the current and the tripping mechanism movement. A similar assessment method is then used to assess the effect of harmonics on two types of protection relay, the electromechanical <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relay</b> and time overcurrent relay. A model is built for each of them which is then simulated on the computer. Tests results compare well with the simulation results, and thus the model developed can be used to explain the relays behaviour in a harmonics environment.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of link delays on the {{capacity}} of relay networks. The relay-with-delay {{is defined as a}} relay channel with relay encoding delay of d ∈ Z units, or equivalently a delay of d units on the link from the sender to the relay, zero delay on the other two links, and zero relay encoding delay. Two special cases are studied. The first is the relay-with-unlimited lookahead, where each relay transmission can depend on its entire received sequence, and the second is the relay-without-delay, where the relay transmission can depend only on current and past received symbols, i. e., d = 0. Upper and lower bounds on capacity for these two channels that are tight in some cases are presented. It is shown that the cut-set bound for the classical relay channel, where d = 1, does not hold for the relay-without-delay. Further, it is shown that <b>instantaneous</b> <b>relaying</b> can be optimal and can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound. Capacity for the classes of degraded and semi-deterministic relay-with-unlimited-lookahead and relay-without-delay are established. The results are extended to the AWGN relay-with-delay case, where it is shown that for any d ≤ 0, capacity is achieved using amplify-and-forward when the channel from the sender to the relay is sufficiently weaker than the other two channels. Further, it is shown that a superposition of amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward can achieve higher rates than the classical cut-set bound.

Prony analysis is used to track the actual system frequencies by decomposing the measured voltage and current signals to its modal components: amplitude, frequency, damping factor and phase angle. Once the actual system modes are predicted, the instantaneous apparent impedance seen by the relay is calculated. The simulation results show that loci of the instantaneous apparent impedance are effective and reliable in predicting and describing the behavior of the system during out-of-step operation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Amplify-and-forward (AF) relay based {{cooperation}} {{has been}} investigated in the literature given its simplicity and practicality. Two models for AF, namely, fixed gain and fixed power relaying, have been extensively studied. In fixed gain relaying, the relay gain is fixed but its transmit power varies {{as a function of}} the source-relay (SR) channel gain. In fixed power <b>relaying,</b> the <b>relay’s</b> <b>instantaneous</b> transmit power is fixed, but its gain varies. We propose a general AF cooperation model in which an average transmit power constrained relay jointly adapts its gain and transmit power {{as a function of the}} channel gains. We derive the optimal AF gain policy that minimizes the fading-averaged symbol error probability (SEP) of MPSK and present insightful and tractable lower and upper bounds for it. We then analyze the SEP of the optimal policy. Our results show that the optimal scheme is up to 39. 7 % and 47. 5 % more energy-efficient than fixed power relaying and fixed gain relaying, respectively. Further, the weaker the direct source-destination link, the greater are the energy-efficiency gains. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{interference}} relay-without-delay channel {{which is an}} interference channel with a relay helping the communication. We assume the relay's transmit symbol depends not only on its past received symbols but also on its current received symbol, which is an appropriate model for studying amplify-and-forward type relaying when the overall delay spread is {{much smaller than the}} inverse of the bandwidth. For the discrete memoryless interference relay-without-delay channel, we show an outer bound using genie-aided outer bounding. For the Gaussian interference relay-without-delay channel, we define strong and very strong interference relay-without-delay channels and propose an achievable scheme based on <b>instantaneous</b> amplify-and-forward (AF) <b>relaying.</b> We also propose two outer bounds for the strong and very strong cases. Using the proposed achievable scheme and outer bounds, we show that our scheme can achieve the capacity exactly when the relay's transmit power is greater than a certain threshold. This is surprising since the conventional AF relaying is usually only asymptotically optimal, not exactly optimal. The proposed scheme can be useful in many practical scenarios due to its optimality as well as its simplicity. Comment: 19 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

In this paper, we {{investigate}} several relay selection strategies for cooperative Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization (SC-FDE) with the amplify-and-forward protocol. We consider both maximum likelihood (ML) -SC-FDE and {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) -SC-FDE receivers. We provide a novel pairwise error probability (PEP) -based selection criterion (SHARM) for frequency selective channels. We further present several selection strategies for cooperative (C) MMSE-SC-FDE receivers, which are motivated by minimizing the instantaneous error rate. These are, norm-based <b>relay</b> selection (NBRS), <b>instantaneous</b> mutual information-based <b>relay</b> selection (CBRS), singular value based relay selection (SVRS), and equalizer output signal quality-based relay selection (EQRS) strategies. We further propose a novel relay selection strategy, selective-to-flat fading relay selection (SFRS), in which from the effective frequency selective source-relay-destination channel link associated with the selected relay, only the channel tab with highest power is passed to the destination terminal. Additionally, to tackle the multiple relay selection problem considering generic mobile scenarios with moderately fast fading channels, in order to select the near best relay subset within the minimum processing time, we apply estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and formulate a modified EDA for the relay selection problem. Our results show promising performance of EDA with comparable computational complexity. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Oregon {{utilities}} are replacing their portfolios of traditional fossil fuel generation with renewable generating sources. Stepping away from carbon-producing energy will leave {{a deficit of}} on-demand power, resulting in decreased reliability. To overcome these technical challenges, utilities must maximize {{the use of their}} present dispatchable resources. One such resource is the Portland General Electric (PGE) Dispatchable Standby Generation Program (DSG), which is an aggregated 105 MWs of distributed generation (DG). These resources are brought on-line when there is a critical need for power. Resources are added to the program if a transfer trip scheme is in place or a modeling study reveals that the feeder load is at least three times the generator capacity. If the load-to-capacity ratio were lower, more assets could be added to the DSG program. To investigate the impacts of lowering the DG load-to-capacity ratio on existing distribution feeders, we use Open-Source Distribution System Simulator (OpenDSS). We modeled the Oxford Rural feeder by converting a utility CYME database to instantiation files using several MATLAB programs. A MATLAB control program varies the load-to-capacity ratio of the OpenDSS feeder model and monitors the generator behavior immediately following a fault. We analyzed the results to determine the ideal load-to-capacity ratio that prevents unintentional islanding. The results show that the <b>instantaneous</b> (50) <b>relay</b> element settings dictate both the minimum load-to-capacity ratio and the maximum DG capacity. The present three-to-one ratio is very conservative and can be reduced. Additional dispatchable resources include a five MW battery-inverter system currently used as grid-back up. The battery is grid-tied to a 12. 4 kV feeder making it an ideal candidate for conservation voltage reduction (CVR). Using the same feeder model, we investigated the effects of lowering the system voltage to the allowable minimum using injections of reactive power. A lower system voltage reduces the load at peak times. Conversely, increasing the voltage prevents generation conflicts. To determine the benefit of CVR by VAr-injection on the Oxford Rural feeder, we created a MATLAB optimization program to output the optimal feeder voltage for reduced system power. We use a Simulink feedback model to determine the appropriate reactive power needed to achieve the voltage change. We analyze the system model to reveal that the feeder is ideal for CVR but the system capacity must be increased to achieve the maximum power reduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{share of}} {{electric}} power from small scale Distributed Generation (DG) connected to low voltage distribution networks (DNs) is increasing in the electricity market {{day by day}} as this technology is not only becoming cheaper relative to other resources but is also environmentally friendly. However, along with these benefits, DG can also have an adverse impact on operation of the power systems. For example, voltage regulation, power system stability and protection coordination can be affected due to connection of DG to DNs. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate {{the potential impact of}} DG on the protection setup of DNs and to suggest solutions to solve these problems for safe integration of DG. The thesis analyzes the potential impacts of DG on DN protection {{with the help of a}} case study of DG installation in a typical DN. The issues discussed include increase in the fault current level, blinding of protection, sympathetic tripping, reduction in reach of a distance relay, lack of detection of single-phase to ground (1 LG) fault with ungrounded utility side interconnection transformer configuration and failure of a fuse saving scheme. In respect of the case study, practical and effective solutions that rely on conventional protection devices and practices, for example, <b>instantaneous</b> overcurrent <b>relay,</b> zero sequence voltage detection and transfer trip scheme are proposed. A novel protection strategy that combines the characteristics of both the time and instantaneous overcurrent elements along with a simple algorithm for adaptively changing the setting of the latter is proposed to ensure proper recloser-fuse coordination even in the presence of DG. Conventional protection schemes face serious challenges when they are considered for protecting an islanded microgrid having an inverter interfaced DG unit and need major revision in order to detect and isolate the faulty portion, as fault currents are very limited in such systems. Protection coordination issues including lack of sensitivity and selectivity in isolation of a fault can occur in a microgrid, especially in an islanded mode of operation. The thesis presents and critically reviews traditional and state of the art protection strategies in respect of a microgrid protection. Total harmonic distortion (THD) based islanding detection schemes that measure the output current THD of the inverter interfaced DG (IIDG) are discussed and the role of various factors like uncertainties in filter parameters, variations in the utility THD and the utility impedance on the performance of these schemes is investigated. The simulation results show that the THD in the inverter output current may be affected (depending upon the design of the controller) by the variations in the utility THD and the utility impedance. Consequently, the working of THD based schemes may suffer if these factors are not taken into consideration while selecting the trip threshold. A large L 2 (the inductor of the LCL filter facing the grid) can make the output current THD of the inverter less sensitive to variations in the utility impedance and, thus, makes the selection of the trip threshold easier. Moreover, through simulations it is shown that electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) capacitors can also affect the islanding detection schemes used for IIDG as they can introduce a large increase in the output current THD of the inverter.
