5|$|An {{official}} {{remake of}} Metroid II, titled , was revealed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS at E3 2017. The game features 2.5D graphics, {{along with several}} gameplay improvements, such as being able to aim <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> and new abilities. The game was developed by MercurySteam, and was released on September 15, 2017.|$|E

Regeneration can occur only in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-EMF and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that the {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction,</b> as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E
5|$|For random {{walks in}} -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya {{published}} in 1919 and 1921 work, {{where he studied}} {{the probability of a}} symmetric random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric random walk, which has an equal probability to advance <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction.</b> It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rules}} in the Sheffield game were adopted by and are still {{featured}} in today’s association game. Twelve changes {{were made to the}} FA code between 1863 and 1870, of which eight were taken from Sheffield Rules. During this period the Sheffield FA had significant influence over the FA and encouraged it to continue when it was close to collapse in 1867. The corner kick was adopted by the FA in 1872 and they restricted handling of the ball to the goalkeeper's own half in 1873. In the final negotiations between Sheffield and London the latter agreed to allow throw-ins <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> in exchange.|$|E
5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by rolling <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> with the analog stick {{and using the}} A button to punch opponents with a boxing glove attached to their monkey's ball. Points are awarded for knocking opponents {{off one of the}} three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one's boxing glove.|$|E

5000|$|Translation and {{rotation}} are the {{two types}} of movement of a solid body. Almost all 3D video games include variable rotational control (mostly pitch and yaw, sometimes roll), which allows rotation <b>in</b> <b>any</b> rotational <b>direction</b> at <b>any</b> speed. However, few games also offer variable translation control, with which the user can translate <b>in</b> <b>any</b> translational <b>direction</b> at <b>any</b> speed, yielding a very smooth fluid motion.|$|R

5|$|The Batmobile has two modes, {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full 360-degree range of movement, including strafing <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction,</b> while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a third-person perspective, and the player can freely move in three-dimensional space and rotate the camera <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction.</b> The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera will shift to first-person mode to assist in aiming.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Jumping Flash! 2 {{is virtually}} identical to its predecessor; {{the game is}} presented in a first-person perspective, and the player can move freely in three-dimensional world and rotate the camera <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction.</b> The user interface resembles much {{of the characteristics of}} its predecessor; the top part of the screen shows the time remaining, the player's score, and one of four of Robbit's AI sidekicks who offers the player warnings, reminders and hints.|$|E

5|$|Dynamite Headdy is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King's army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin and the key masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw his head <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> to attack enemies. His head {{can also be used}} to grab hooks and pull himself up to other platforms. Headdy's health is represented by a spotlight in the corner of the screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, they will lose a life.|$|E
5|$|Jumping Flash! is {{presented}} in a first-person perspective. The player assumes the role of Robbit, a robotic rabbit, and can freely move Robbit in three-dimensional space and can rotate the camera <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction.</b> The top part of the screen shows the remaining time, the player's score, and a character named Kumagoro—Robbit's sidekick artificial intelligence who offers the player warnings and hints. The top left corner of the screen shows the collected power-ups; the top right corner contains the radar showing the locations of objects including enemies, power-ups, jet pods and enemy projectiles. The bottom shows a health meter on the sides {{and the number of}} remaining lives in the centre. The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 6, around 8:00 or 8:30a.m., Grant's {{flagship}} stopped alongside Wallace's boat moored at Crump's Landing and gave orders for the 3rd Division to be held ready to move <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction.</b> Wallace concentrated his troops at Stoney Lonesome, although his westernmost brigade remained at Adamsville. He then waited for further orders, which arrived between 11 and 11:30a.m. Grant ordered Wallace to move his unit up to join the Union right, {{a move that would}} have been in support of Sherman's 5th Division, which was encamped around Shiloh Church when the battle began. The written orders, transcribed from verbal orders that Grant gave to an aide, were lost during the battle and controversy remains over their wording. Wallace maintained that he was not ordered to Pittsburg Landing, which was to the left rear of the army, or told which road to use. Grant later claimed that he ordered Wallace to Pittsburg Landing by way of the River Road (also called the Hamburg–Savannah Road).|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 6 allows {{players to}} select between four {{scenarios}} with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows {{one of four}} main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as rolling <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> and running whilst shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within {{a limited amount of}} time.|$|E
5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> and to move the {{flashing}} cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The player's character, the part-slug and {{part-cat}} Slugcat, uses {{spears and}} rocks {{to survive a}} hostile, ruined, and obtuse 2D world {{in search of the}} family from whom it was separated. The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>direction</b> via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens, each with randomized enemies. The Slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food, which is used to hibernate in scarce, designated safe rooms. Hibernation resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. The player can move between regions by having the Slugcat hibernate multiple times without dying. If the player does not reach the hibernation point quickly, a crushing rain will pour, both flooding the world and possibly pummeling the Slugcat to death.|$|E
