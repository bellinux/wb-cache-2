Ki no Tsurayuki mentioned Narihira in his kana preface to the Kokinshū as one of the Six Poetic Geniuses—important poets of an <b>earlier</b> <b>age.</b> He was also included in Fujiwara no Kintō's later Thirty-Six Poetic Geniuses.|$|E
5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting {{that some people are}} genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and at an <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than is typical.|$|E

An <b>early</b> <b>age</b> may be classified into a category of an age of child, however a child’s age may not be sure classified as a category of an <b>early</b> <b>age.</b> Beside that, there is no explicit instruction of the effect of laws from the child marriage of an <b>early</b> <b>age,</b> is that any preventions or cancellations of the marriage, yet it just be said as there will be a divorce...|$|R
40|$|Sports and Physical Fitness in <b>Early</b> <b>Age</b> Children. Sports {{activities}} {{are important for}} <b>early</b> <b>age</b> children. Through such activities they can improve their physical fitness {{and the quality of}} their organs, including the heart, lungs, blood circulation, energy metabolism, growth hormones, immune system, and secretion system. The improvement will result in the higher quality of their physical and spiritual conditions. Characteristics of good sports activities for <b>early</b> <b>age</b> children are that: (1) they provide a variety of movements (multilateral training) in the form of games and competitions, (2) they stimulate the development of all the five senses, (3) they develop imagination, and (4) they follow a rhythm/song and a story. <b>Early</b> <b>age</b> children’s physical fitness can be controlled by taking account of their body composition, namely by maintaining the balance between the food intake and the physical activities.

At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male could become a freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man's mid-twenties.

5|$|The {{length of}} the trinucleotide repeat {{accounts}} for 60% {{of the variation in}} the age symptoms appear and the rate they progress. A longer repeat results in an <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease before age 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may not ever develop noticeable symptoms. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to obtain the}} tensile {{properties}} of <b>early</b> <b>age</b> concrete based on a uniaxial tension test employing RC slender members. First, the paper shows that concrete strain {{is equal to the}} strain of rebar at the mid-span of the RC member. The tensile Young’s modulus and the strain capacity of <b>early</b> <b>age</b> concrete are estimated using strain measurements. The experiment indicated that the tensile Young’s modulus at an <b>early</b> <b>age</b> is higher than the compressive modulus. This observation was similar to one found in a previous investigation which used a direct tension test of <b>early</b> <b>age</b> concrete. Moreover, the paper describes how an empirical equation for mature concrete {{can be applied to the}} relation between uniaxial tensile strength and splitting tensile strength even in <b>early</b> <b>age</b> concrete. Based on a uniaxial tension test, the paper proposes an empirical equation for the relationship between standard bond stresses and relative slip...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} performance of a self compacting concrete (SCC) with fibers, during the cement hydration process and the evolution in to a rigid material, was carried out. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the improvement of the hardened performance due to the use of fibers and the <b>early</b> <b>age</b> cracking control ability of fibers at two different scales: on a nano-structural level with the addition of carbon nano-fibers (CNF) and on a micro-structural level with the addition of polypropylene micro-fibers. The inclusion of nanofibers increased the flexural strength of cement based pastes although some problems concerning <b>early</b> <b>age</b> cracking emerged. As any other concrete, SCC can exhibit problems during the very <b>early</b> <b>ages</b> after mixing, when cement hydration occurs, as shrinkage and early cracking. Although these problems arise during <b>early</b> <b>ages,</b> their effect can seriously compromise the long term performance and durability of the material. SCC samples with and without fibers were monitored through its hardening process using several experimental techniques and considering the effect of water evaporation due to wind exposition during the setting process. The effect of the fibers and different SCC components, as nanosilica, and a high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA), was analysed. Besides, the ability of the applied components to avoid the stress development during the <b>early</b> <b>ages</b> was also evaluated. The influence of the fibers and additional components on the <b>early</b> <b>age</b> shrinkage was assessed, identifying the relationship between shrinkage and <b>early</b> <b>age</b> cracking...|$|R
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} HD, but there are {{treatments}} available to reduce the severity {{of some of its}} symptoms. For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. An association between caffeine intake and <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.|$|E

25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> of the bump in women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
