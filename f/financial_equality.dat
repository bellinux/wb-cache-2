5000|$|Particularly in {{the early}} 19th century, several utopian ideas arose, often in {{response}} to the belief that social disruption was created and caused by the development of commercialism and capitalism. These ideas are often grouped in a greater [...] "utopian socialist" [...] movement, due to their shared characteristics. A once common characteristic is an egalitarian distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of money. Citizens only do work which they enjoy and which is for the common good, leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a utopia was Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward. Another socialist utopia is William Morris's News from Nowhere, written partially {{in response to the}} top-down (bureaucratic) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; Marx in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism he described as utopian.

In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation, and only perfect social and <b>financial</b> <b>equality</b> exists.|$|E
5000|$|In Quebec, women's rights within {{marriage}} and family law have advanced slower than {{in the rest of}} Canada. Quebec has been slow on giving civil rights to married women: until 1954, a married woman was legally listed as [...] "incapable of contracting", together with minors, [...] "interdicted persons", [...] "persons insane or suffering a temporary derangement of intellect ... or who by reason of weakeness of understanding are unable to give a valid consent", and [...] "persons who are affected by civil degradation." [...] The removal of the married woman from this list however, did little to improve her legal situation, due to marriage laws which restricted her rights and gave the husband legal authority over her: legal incapacity was still the general rule. A major change followed in 1964: Bill 16 (An Act respecting the legal capacity of married women) removed the obligation of the wife to obey her husband, and gave the married woman full legal capacity subject to restrictions that may result from the matrimonial regime. However, discriminatory provisions resulting from matrimonial regimes and from other legal regulations still remained. In July 1970, Bill 10 came into force, reforming matrimonial regimes, and improving the situation of married women. In 1977 another important change took place: the wife obtained equal rights with the husband with regard to legal authority over the children during marriage, abolishing the previous rule of 'paternal authority' which gave the husband more legal rights with regard to judicial matters concerning the children; the new law created the concept of parental authority shared equally between the wife and husband. A major change also happened in April 1981, when new family regulations based on gender equality came into force. Other reforms followed throughout the 1980s, including the introduction of the concept of family patrimony in 1989, in order to ensure <b>financial</b> <b>equality</b> between spouses when the marriage ends. On January 1, 1994 the new Civil Code of Quebec came into effect, replacing the old one.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a brief history of}} {{financial}} regulation. The removal and relaxation of controls on credit and interest rates in the 1980 s and the growing emphasis on prudential controls is highlighted. Three criteria for evaluating financial regulation and structure are discussed: (1) stability, (2) efficiency, and (3) fairness. As a result of massive losses suffered by financial institutions, stability is a significant concern. It can be enhanced by increasing capital requirements and strengthening financial supervision. In developing countries there is growing concentration and a spread of universal banking, suggesting economies of both scale and scope. Available evidence suggests that concentrated banking systems tend to have lower margins and operating costs as well as higher profits. However, large banks tend to be inefficient. Their size is the result of controls and restrictions on competition and entry rather than superior efficiency. Protecting users of financial systems from abusive behavior by the <b>financial</b> institutions, creating <b>equality</b> in the competition between banking institutions, and tackling the problems caused by potential conflicts of interest is the"fairness"issue. There are tradeoffs between these three criteria for evaluating financial regulation and structure. The answers must be sought on a country-by-country basis.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 68 - 76) The aim {{of multiple}} artifacts {{is to examine}} the literature formed around diverse student populations, including LGBTQ students, sexual assault victims, veterans, undocumented students, and first-generation students. The following reviews of the literature are in response to prompts from the 2014 Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) Standards. 	In consideration of the various challenges the LGBTQ student population experiences, a literature review is used to propose the implementation of weekly intervention programs to facilitate psychological well-being, and lower physical safety concerns for LGBTQ students. These issues were explored with the use of Cass???s model of Homosexual Identity Formation (1984). Further implications were provided for student affairs professionals, including the importance of campus climate change for LGBTQ students. Sexual violence can hinder the development of students across their life time. A review of the literature was explored to emphasize the importance of the availability of support services for college women who have experienced sexual assault in their lifetimes. Implications indicate that the increase of empowerment and support services for these women can lower psychological distress, leading to higher retention rates and success in college. The cognitive and psychological impairments of student veterans can be hindering to their employment outlook, therefore the implementation of Strength-Based Programming on college campuses can increase employment attainment for veteran college students. College counselors and student affairs professionals can promote employment attainment in student veterans by increasing their self-confidence through the use of positive psychology. While working with undocumented students in community college or university settings, it is vital to understand characteristics and challenges that this at-risk and underrepresented student population faces. Factors such as <b>financial</b> concerns, <b>equality</b> and marginalization can be hindering to the educational attainment process of undocumented students.

40|$|It is {{primarily}} {{the emergence of}} new state policies promoting market mechanisms in the ﬁeld of education that has encouraged research on education markets (Maroy, 2006). In the 1980 s, conservative American and British governments, drawing on theories of public choice (Chubb & Moe, 1998), encouraged reforms aimed at reducing the alleged ineﬃciency and ineﬀectiveness of the bureaucratic management of schools by increasing their autonomy as well as parental choice (Ball, 1993; Bosetti, 2005; Glennerster, 1991; Uchitelle, 1993). Similar reforms have also been implemented in various European countries for over 20 years (Mons, 2007), often in relation with a decennia-long co-existence of public and state-granted schools. These private schools are most often Catholic or protestant schools operating within a national educational system receiving state grants. The countries of the European Union can be divided into three groups according to the relationship private education has with the public authorities (Eurydice, 20001). In Greece and the UK, private schools receive no public funding. However, this absence of funding does not prevent the state from exercising control over private education institutions. In the UK, most denominational and other schools owned by churches or trustees are considered to form part of the public sector education. In the second group of countries (France, Italy, and Portugal), diﬀerent types of contracts exist which create a link between private schools and public authorities. Depending on the type of contract, the school receives grants of a more or less signiﬁcant amount and is freer {{to a greater or lesser}} extent with regard to conditions (of teaching, teacher recruitment, etc.) imposed by public authorities. Finally, within the last group, which comprises the majority of countries, grant-aided private schools appear to have much in common with public sector schools. In Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland, and Sweden, private education is grant aided, either partially or fully, but operates under more or less the same conditions as public sector education. In The Netherlands, <b>ﬁnancial</b> <b>equality</b> between public and grant-aided private institutions is a constitutional right. The size of these public and non-public school sectors varies strongly between these European societies for speciﬁc historic reasons, and non-public schools disappeared in some of these societies as a consequence of the communist regime.

After the {{beginning}} of the financial crisis in Lithuania and the world, the demand to balance public finances arose in order to safeguard current liabilities due to lower budget revenues. Thus, the pensions constitute the major part of current payments. The issue of pensions remains relevant {{not only because of the}} crisis but also because of other socio-economic challenges. The aim of the article is to analyse the direction of the neoliberal or interventionist Lithuanian pension policy during the period of 2009 – 2015. Earlier studies related to the pension system were mostly focused on the purpose of the pension as well as on challenges caused by socio-economic changes (Eckardt 2005); (Fernandez 2012) new risks (Shuey, O’Rand 2006); prevention of poverty (Foster 2011) etc. The article is based on a qualitative document analysis. The following documents of 2009 – 2015 are analyzed: the Conception of the Pension Reform; the Benchmark Plan of the Reform of Pension System; the Law of Recalculation of Social Benefits and the Draft of Labor and State Social Insurance Juridical administrative Model. The methodological approach based on neoliberal/interventionist categories according to Frericks et al. (2009) is utilized in the article. The research findings demonstrate that during the analyzed period not pure neoliberal or interventionist but more mixed model of the pension policy prevailed in Lithuania.

In a cross-sectional large-scale community-based study, 4583 people aged 19 and older, living in Isfahan, Iran, were investigated. Logistic quantile regression was used for modeling perceived stress, measured by GHQ questionnaire, as the bounded outcome (dependent), variable, and {{as a function of}} most important stressful life events, as the predictor variables, controlling for major lifestyle and sociodemographic factors. This model provides empirical evidence of the predictors’ effects heterogeneity depending on individual location on the distribution of perceived stress. Results. The results showed that among four stressful life events, family conflicts and social problems were more correlated with level of perceived stress. Higher levels of education were negatively associated with perceived stress and its coefficients monotonically decrease beyond the 30 th percentile. Also, higher levels of physical activity were associated with perception of low levels of stress. The pattern of gender’s coefficient over the majority of quantiles implied that females are more affected by stressors. Also high perceived stress was associated with low or middle levels of income.

This {{has led to a}} number of projects supported by the World Bank and donor agencies in emerging, transitional and developing economies designed to create secure property rights through titling and land registration. There is, however, still considerable uncertainty about the conditions needed for improvement in security of tenure. In particular there is a question as to whether tenure security interventions can be effective if pursued in isolation from other policy initiatives, for example, aimed at changing the business environment or the ethos of public service. This paper takes four measures of the security of property rights produced by the Heritage Foundation, the World Economic Forum, Bertelsmann Stiftung, and USAID and examines the factors which are associated with greater security. It focuses on the countries included in the USAID study and those in the Bertelsmann Transformation Index in order to exclude the richer countries which generally have a relatively high level of security of property rights as it is considered that their presence in a sample could have a distorting effect. The paper includes a critique of the sources of property rights data. It examines the extent to which secure property rights are associated with factors such as the strength of the legal system, corruption and the efficiency of government, the quality of the governance of a country, the quality of corporate governance, the degree of development of the business environment, the quality of education, healthcare and infrastructure, the strength of the <b>financial</b> system, gender <b>equality,</b> and environmental stress...|$|R

Favoritism and impartiality {{refers to the}} desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as [...] "special". For instance, a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades, demonstrating favoritism. Openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private. When chatting with a boss about one's weekend, there is the desire to be open, however, closedness is also at play, as certain details are often left out, because of the context. Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new. When creating scheduled meetings for board members, the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule, however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration. Instrumentality and affection, is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship. An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection, but maintaining it for benefits such as <b>financial</b> security. Finally, <b>equality</b> and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, European {{football}} has gone through massive structural changes. The end of foreign player quotas (Bosman ruling) and substantial increases in revenue have paved the way toward today’s two-speed Football hierarchy. Top teams’ revenues have increased exponentially while {{there has been little}} change in revenues for lower budget clubs. As a result, a trend of competitive imbalance has emerged. UEFA has tried to address these problems with Financial Fair Play (FFP), a regulation system which obliges teams to respect the principle of “break even”, meaning that clubs must not finance themselves with loans and “favors” from wealthy owners. While FFP has been successful in limiting clubs’ indebtedness and ensuring long term viability, it does not have the capacity to deal with competitive imbalance. As long as unequal distributions of revenue persist among teams and leagues, the issue of competitive imbalance will not be solved. This paper focuses on identifying recommendations that could lead to improved competitive balance in football. What would better competitive balance achieve for fans? With player talent more equally distributed, outcomes of matches and league competitions would be more difficult to predict and thus more enjoyable for spectators to follow. In arriving at the recommendations that are presented in this work, measures that have been successfully adopted in other professional sports are examined and tested. Firstly, the distribution of TV revenue in the UEFA Champions League is tackled. By emphasising the importance of one home TV market (market pool), UEFA does not treat all teams equally. Therefore, a system of distribution without market pooling has been developed and proposed. Secondly, the salary cap system was found to be a very effective tool in promoting increased <b>financial</b> <b>equality</b> among clubs and within leagues. Thirdly, the possibility of introducing a playoff system in football was addressed. Playoffs would increase the uncertainty of outcomes until post-season, however, implementation would be complex and would require changes in the number of teams per league. The results of this research reveal that tools to promote competitive balance do indeed exist, however, implementation barriers are quite high. Also, to avoid the threat of top teams deciding to break away and creating their own leagues if the regulating measures are too severe, compromises will be necessary in terms of the strictness of measures that will be adopted and applied...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the benefit}} of five years to heal its wounds, the United States remains hobbled from the devastating {{economic}} injuries of the 2007 - 08 global financial crisis. Families across the country still struggle with overwhelming debt and debilitating joblessness. The financial innovations that were once seen as a path to broader homeownership and greater <b>financial</b> <b>equality</b> nearly led to a once-unthinkable catastrophe, and ironically, have worked to widen the {{gap between rich and}} poor. These events took many top business leaders and regulators by surprise. After the crisis abated, legislators and other policymakers sought to understand how a financial crisis of such severity could arise undetected {{in one of the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most advanced and well-regulated economies. To this end, in May 2009 Congress created the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2 ̆ 2 FCIC 2 ̆ 2). The FCIC was composed of commissioners 2 ̆ 2 with national recognition and significant depth of experience in such fields as banking, regulation of markets, taxation, finance, economics, consumer protection, and housing, 2 ̆ 2 and Congress charged it with analyzing the causes of the global financial crisis. After an eighteen-month investigation, during which the FCIC 2 ̆ 7 s commissioners and staff 2 ̆ 2 reviewed millions of pages of documents, interviewed more than 700 witnesses, and held 19 days of public hearings 2 ̆ 2 (p. xi), the FCIC made public its book-length final report, titled The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report: Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States. The Report attributed the crisis to 2 ̆ 2 widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision 2 ̆ 2 (p. xviii); 2 ̆ 2 dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions 2 ̆ 2 (p. xviii); 2 ̆ 2 excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency 2 ̆ 2 (p. xix); the government 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 ill prepar[ation] for the crisis, and its inconsistent response 2 ̆ 2 (p. xxi); and 2 ̆ 2 a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics 2 ̆ 2 (p. xxii). Though commissioned for submission to the President and Congress, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report also attracted significant popular attention, spending two weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers 2 ̆ 7 List for Paperback Nonfiction...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the potential of mobile operating systems and native apps to transform educational inclusion for disabled students. It is framed by a philosophy of inclusive technology, which theorises that contemporary technologies, such as the World Wide Web, netbooks, tablets and smartphones, could possibly increase the social inclusion of people with disabilities, as these technologies are more portable, provide greater social access to institutional environments and communities, are more socially acceptable and allow greater social communication than traditional assistive technologies. By drawing reference to this philosophy, the article evaluates the accessible software available in Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS operating systems for tablets and smart phones. These systems were chosen as previous literature observes that they offer provision for students with disabilities, and their manufacturers have claimed that they are amongst the most accessible technologies on the market. Two instruments are used to evaluate these devices: (1) A sociological model of technical capital: This model is based on Bourdieu’s theory of social capital, and is premised on the notion that access to technology, either through financial, geographical, intellectual or physical means, increases life chances and access to <b>financial</b> capital, social <b>equality</b> and access to higher levels of education; (2) The SAMR Model of Educational Technology: This model is premised on the theory that educational applications of technology are premised on the transformation or enhancement of traditional pedagogies, either through the substitution, augmentation, modification or redefinition of educational tasks. The evaluation of these mobile operating systems concentrates on their use in three staple study skills: (1) The making and sharing notes in written, audio and video formats; (2) The organisation of information in the form of text based, audio and video files; (3) The recording of still images, audio and video files. The evaluation finds that both operating systems have similarly effective accessible settings in terms of their ability to enlarge text, reverse colours and save and change the quality of audio and video files. However, it is found that Android has better native facilities for audio recording, organizing and sharing files, and Apple iOS has an advantage in terms of its ability to photograph in photo-negative and create time lapse recordings. However, there are issues with both operating systems in terms of pricing, potential ease of use, and cultural diversity. The evaluation concludes that these mobile operating systems have the potential to be used for tasks discussed in the SAMR model, but both systems still need to improve a number of features in order to make their potential technical capital more socially accessible...|$|R
50|$|The {{ruling class}} among the mediaeval townsfolk were rich {{merchant}} families whose houses stood right near the castle tower and {{were surrounded by}} the first town wall once it was built. The area of today's Rossmarkt ("Horse Market"), in which many simple craftsmen lived, was only brought within the fortifications once the second town wall was built. The inhabitants there, however, unlike the merchant élite, were accorded no entitlement to a voice in town affairs and {{were not allowed to}} send representatives to the town council. Nevertheless, they had to bear the main financial burden of running the town. Only in 1458 were they allowed to send two representatives to town council.Saint George's Cathedral (Sankt-Georgs-Dom) built on the old monastery church's site, and also called Georgsdom, was consecrated in 1235. On 14 May 1289, a devastating fire wiped out great parts of the inner town, although these were subsequently rebuilt. One of the houses built at that time was the Römer 2-4-6, which is today one of Germany's oldest half-timbered houses. In 1337, Limburg's Jews were expelled from the town. Only in 1341 were they once again able to settle in the town, by royal decree. In 1344 a half share of the town was pledged to the Electorate of Trier, and in 1420, the town passed wholly into the ownership of Trier. This event, along with another town fire in 1342, the Black Death in 1349, 1356 and 1365, but above all the rise of the Territorial Princes, led to a gradual decline. In 1315 and 1346, the old stone Lahn Bridge was built (presumably in two sections).Against the background of the German Peasants' War, unrest also arose among the townsfolk in 1525. After the Elector of Trier had demanded that the townsmen turn a Lutheran preacher out of the town, a board made up of townsmen who were ineligible for council functions handed the council a 30-point comprehensive list of demands on 24 May. It dealt mainly with <b>financial</b> participation and <b>equality</b> in taxation, trade and building issues with the merchant class. In the days that followed, these demands were reduced in negotiations between the council and the board to 16 points, which were likely also taken up with the Elector afterwards. On 5 August, however, Archbishop Richard ordered the council to overturn all concessions to the townsmen. Furthermore, a ban on assembly was decreed, and the ineligible townsmen were stripped of their right to send two representatives to council.|$|R
