40|$|Fig wasps and fig {{trees are}} {{mutually}} dependent, {{with each of}} the 800 or so species of fig trees (Ficus, Moraceae) typically pollinated by a single species of fig wasp (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae). Molecular evidence suggests that the relationship existed over 65 Ma, during the Cretaceous. Here, we record the discovery of the oldest known fossil fig wasps, from England, dated at 34 Ma. They possess pollen pockets that contain fossil Ficus pollen. The length of their ovipositors indicates that their host trees had a dioecious breeding system. Confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy reveal that the fossil female fig wasps, and more recent species from Miocene Dominican amber, display the same suite of anatomical characters associated with fig entry and pollen-carrying as modern species. The pollen is also typical of modern Ficus. No innovations in the relationship are discernible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>tens</b> of millions of years...|$|R

Gastón Ramírez came on at half time and was involved in a few early attacks for the hosts, but 25 minutes into the second half (after Lukaku had taken advantage of defensive errors to double his team's lead) he was sent off for an incident involving Fortuné following an alleged elbow on Shane Long, which also saw the West Brom goalscorer dismissed.

40|$|Rapport de Master Sciences et Génie de l'Environnement option "Systèmes Aquatiques et Gestion de l'Eau" (50 pages) Lake Bourget, {{located in}} the Alps region, is the largest natural French lake. It {{constitutes}} an important reservoir of drinking water for thousands of inhabitants. In the 60 's, the first occurrence of eutrophication has been observed in Lake Bourget. In order to tackle the eutrophication, many restoration programs have been implemented since the 1970 s. The massive reduction in nutrient loads (phosphorus and nitrate) has improved the water quality {{over the past two}} decades. In 2008, according to OECD trophic categories, Lake Bourget is classified as mesotrophic. However, blooms of the filamentous, phycoerythrin-rich, non-nitrogen fixing and hepatoxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens have occurred since 1996. The first objective of this work is to use the one dimensional vertical (1 DV) thermal and biogeochemical model to simulate the lake temperature during 3 decades (1976 - 2008) in order to study the pluriannual water temperature evolution. The second objective involves studying the phytoplankton dynamics, in particular Planktothrix rubescens which dominates Lake Bourget phytoplankton <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>tens</b> years despite <b>the</b> restoration efforts.
