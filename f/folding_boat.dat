25|$|The {{assault was}} ordered for 19.00 on 25 August, with a {{reinforced}} brigade crossing on a two-battalion front, one {{either side of}} the destroyed road bridge. While 15th (Kent) GHQ Troops RE ferried the assault troops across, and other RE units prepared to build a heavy Bailey bridge, 43rd Divisional Engineers had the task of constructing a Class 9 <b>Folding</b> <b>Boat</b> Equipment (FBE) bridge on rafts. It emerged that DUKW amphibious vehicles could not enter the river, so the assault had to be carried out with powered storm boats, until 260 Fd Co had bulldozed ramps in the river bank. 553rd and 204th Fd Companies began work on the bridge after an approach had been bulldozed under intense machine gun and mortar fire. Close support rafts built by 553rd Fd Co were taken over next morning by 15th (Kent) GHQTRE to continue the ferrying operation and support the hard-pressed assault troops on the far side.|$|E

500|$|The 7th Division {{was treated}} to a {{training}} film, [...] "Loading the Douglas C-47", and {{the commander of the}} Advanced Echelon of Lieutenant General George Kenney's Fifth Air Force, Major General Ennis Whitehead, made five C-47 Dakota transports available to the 7th Division each day so they could practise loading and unloading. Whitehead also made a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress available so Vasey could fly low over the target area on 7 August. Meanwhile, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and 2/6th Field Company practiced crossing the Laloki River with <b>folding</b> <b>boats.</b> They flew to Tsili Tsili Airfield on 23 and 24 August.|$|R
5000|$|They began experimenting in the {{methodology}} for launching reconnaissance {{from the sea}} and testing various equipment. [...] Inflatable rubber boats were mostly used, although kayaks and canvas <b>folding</b> <b>boats</b> had been tested but were rejected. The determining criteria for boat selection was that recon boats needed to fit through the small hatches of fleet submarines while carrying weapons and equipment and be capable of handling related loads. Lt. Peddicord designed an inflatable boat and brought his plans to the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company who produced the Landing Craft Rubber-Small craft able to hold seven men that was extensively used by the later Naval Combat Demolition Units.|$|R

50|$|Some folding boats have a transom for {{attaching}} {{an electric}} or petrol engine outboard. These are {{usually in the}} order of 2 - 4HP but can be up to 10HP. Electric motors are versatile on a <b>folding</b> <b>boat</b> and are well suited to calm water fishing due to low noise and weight.|$|E
50|$|The Shellbend is {{a wooden}} <b>folding</b> <b>boat,</b> {{designed}} in the late 19th century by the Liverpool architect and civil engineer Mellard Treleaven Reade. It is constructed out of mahogany panels, which fold using canvas hinges to {{a fifth of the}} boat's original size. The intent was to create a lightweight collapsible boat, lighter than a solid-hull boat, {{to be used as a}} ship's tender.|$|E
50|$|<b>Folding</b> <b>Boat</b> Equipment was {{developed}} in 1928 and went through several versions until it was used in WW2 to compliment the Bailey Pontoon. It had a continuous canvas hinge and could fold flat for storage and transportation. When assembled it could carry 15 men and with two boats and some additional toppings it could transport a 3-ton truck. Further upgrades during WW2 resulted in it moving to a Class 9 bridge.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>folding</b> <b>boats</b> have two-part skins, with {{different}} materials {{used for the}} deck and the hull. Decks can be made of a breathable cotton/hemp blend, as Klepper has done since their early days, or of coated synthetics, as Feathercraft, Folbot, Long Haul, Nautiraid, Pouch and TRAK do. Each approach has its own particular benefits and drawbacks; all work well in practice, and some companies, such as Long Haul Folding Kayaks, offer both materials. Hulls are generally made of a heavily coated synthetic fiber. In the early days, rubber coated cotton canvas was used, while the modern boats use a synthetic elastomer —Hypalon, polyurethane or PVC—over a synthetic (typically Dacron) cloth. The tension on the hull is what gives certain folding kayaks performance advantages over others. One manufacturer (TRAK) incorporates several hydraulic jacks into the frame that allow the user to change the hull's shape.|$|R
50|$|The stone frigate HMAS Assault was {{commissioned}} on 1 September 1942; Assault was initially operated from Westralia, but moved ashore on 10 December 1942. The base's main {{purpose was to}} train boat crews for landing craft, beach commandos to prepare beaches and coordinate landings on the shore, and signals sections to facilitate communications between ships and land-based forces. Training at Assault was initially hampered {{by the lack of}} LCVP and LCM craft available, with the base forced to use <b>folding</b> <b>boats</b> towed by launches and lighters to simulate landing craft, and , a requisitioned pleasure boat, as an assault transport. By March 1943, enough landing craft had been manufactured in Australia and delivered from the United States to allow for full-scale landing exercises. For administrative purposes, landing and shore personnel trained at Assault were considered to be attached to the base, not the ships that they were embarked in.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} of CMP truck bodies in Canada was subcontracted out to smaller companies in Ontario and Manitoba, organized into the wartime Steel Body Manufacturers Association by the Department of Munitions and Supply. The {{wide variety of}} truck body designs included general service (GS), water tanker, fuel tanker, vehicle recovery (tow truck), dental clinic, mobile laundry, wireless house, machinery (machine shop), <b>folding</b> <b>boat</b> transport, and anti-tank gun portee.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{boats in}} the same {{category}} as folding boats include inflatable dinghies and small aluminium boats (tinnies). Inflatable boats try to solve the portability problem with an inflatable keel and side pods. This allows better storage and weight advantages. The main problems of these craft are that they are still quite heavy, they can puncture while on the water and can be time consuming to inflate and deflate for usage. Folding boats require in the order of 10 to 15 minutes to set up and put away but are much tougher than an inflatable craft, and may ultimately be smaller in storage as an inflatable boat may have hard board components for the floor. Aluminium boats cannot be disassembled, and the <b>folding</b> <b>boat</b> of space-age material is stronger than aluminium, while the strength to weight of some wooden ply is actually stronger than aluminium. The lower stiffness and rigidity may add to potential safety of a <b>folding</b> <b>boat</b> by allowing it to flex over waves. This stops the boat from the rocking effect of an inflexible boat.|$|E
50|$|During the American Civil War {{various forms}} of pontoon bridges were tried and discarded. Wooden {{pontoons}} and India rubber bag pontoons shaped like a torpedo proved impractical until the development of cotton-canvas covered pontoons, which required more maintenance but were lightweight and easier {{to work with and}} transport. From 1864 a lightweight design known as Cumberland Pontoons, a <b>folding</b> <b>boat</b> system, were widely used during the Atlanta Campaign to transport soldiers and artillery across rivers in the South.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, a force under Lieutenant Colonel J. T. Lang, {{consisting}} of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, 2/6th Field Company, and detachments from the 7th Division Signals, 2/5th Field Ambulance and ANGAU, with 760 native carriers, set out from Tsili Tsili on 2 September. Most of the force moved overland, reaching Kirkland's Crossing on 4 September, where it rendezvoused with B Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. That night, a party of engineers and pioneers set out from Tsili Tsili in 20 small craft, sailed and paddled down the Watut and Markham Rivers to join Lang's force at Kirkland's Crossing. The small river-borne task force included 10 British 5-ton <b>folding</b> assault <b>boats</b> and Hoehn military folboats. which met up with 2/6 Independent Commandos who had reconnoitered the proposed crossing area with 8 of these folboats the day before. While neither river was deep, both were fast flowing, with shoals and hidden s. Three boats were lost with their equipment and one man drowned. On the morning of 5 September, Lang's force was treated {{to the sight of}} the air force passing overhead. At this point, the Markham River formed three arms, separated by broad sand bars. Two were fordable but the other was deep and flowing at [...] Using the <b>folding</b> <b>boats</b> and local timber, they constructed a pontoon bridge, allowing the whole force to cross the river safely with all their equipment. That evening, they reached the Americans' position.|$|R
50|$|Although a few {{hardshell}} kayakers {{are critical}} of <b>folding</b> <b>boats,</b> and do not regard them as {{in the same category}} as hardshell <b>boats,</b> <b>folding</b> kayaks exhibit many of the same paddling characteristics as the original skin-and-frame vessels of the circumpolar north. Other than contemporary versions of Inuit, Aleut, and Yup'ik kayaks and baidarkas, they are the closest relatives to the skin-and-frame boats of the past. The performance of these folding kayaks depend largely on the design of the kayak. The speed may be comparable to sea kayaks made from composite materials such as fibreglass or carbon/kevlar. In general, most folding kayaks trade off some performance in speed for the ease of travelling with a kayak. This is because the sponsons found in most modern folding kayaks makes the kayaks wider; this increases drag and slows the kayak down.Many in the folding kayak community believe folding kayaks and other skin-on-frame kayaks offer features that aid paddling efficiency. In a hardshell kayak, waves and chop on the water can slow down the momentum of the craft and push the kayak back. Some hypothesize flexible skin on such kayaks help the kayak absorb the energy of waves and current, which allows the boat to move more easily through rough conditions. Some paddlers find skin-on-frame kayaks to be very efficient paddling rougher waters, while many simply enjoy the feeling of closer contact with the water and waves.|$|R
5000|$|During the Second World War the British and Commonwealth {{special forces}} {{employed}} [...] "canoes" [...] in the Mediterranean, European, and South-east Asian theatres. The special {{forces of the}} day (COPPS, RMBPD, etc.) had developed for them about a dozen {{state of the art}} [...] "canoes" [...] which were given the codename Cockle. These Cockles ranged from the Mk 1 early frame-and fabric 'folbot' type to the four man boats made of aluminum alloy; most were 'collapsible' rather than being boats that could be completely disassembled, as with modern-day <b>folding</b> <b>boats.</b> The Mk 2 could be collapsed but along its 15 ft length... to just c. 7 inches. This Mk 2 and its three-man Mk 2** were all of the same design and were designed by the same man—a Mr Fred Goatley. The Cockle Mk II was used by the RMBPD in Operation Frankton, the attack on Bordeaux in late 1942.There is plenty of documentation showing delivery of British canoes Mk 3's and Mk 6's for British Military in Australia and beyond. For the British led Operation Jaywick the British Mark 1 type canoes were used.|$|R
