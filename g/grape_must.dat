5|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected {{to become a}} part of a strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century. The Tsar Cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians, resulted in the development of vodka, the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy. The Genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the alchemists of Provence, who used an Arab-invented distillation apparatus to convert <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> into alcohol. A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of adding sugar to <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> {{has been part}} of the process of winemaking since the Romans added honey as a sweetening agent. While not realizing the chemical components, Roman winemakers were able to identify the benefits of added sense of body or mouthfeel.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of nitrogen compounds in <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> {{on the content}} of sulphur compounds of wines was studied. Different vinifications were performed with the addition of methionine (20 mg l− 1) and/or cysteine (40 mg l− 1) to <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> before alcoholic fermentation. Six <b>grape</b> <b>musts,</b> with different nitrogen composition, from cultivars of the ‘Vinhos Verdes’ Region, in Portugal, were used. Addition of methionine to <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> enhanced the content of wines in 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester, 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid and some unidentified sulphur compounds. Increase of cysteine concentration in musts led to the production of wines with high levels of hydrogen sulphide and cis- 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophene- 3 -OL and also unidentified sulphur compounds; however, the content of 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid in the wines decreased considerately with the addition of cysteine to <b>grape</b> <b>musts.</b> This work showed that cultivars from the Vinho Verde Region show different sulphur compound contents. Avesso wines, elaborated from <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> with low amino acids level, presented the highest total sulphur compounds content. Wines from Azal branco and Alvarinho were characterised by high contents of 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol and 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid, respectively. A high content of N-(3 -(methylthio) propyl) -acetamide and dimethylsulphone characterise the Loureiro wines. In contrast, Trajadura wines, produced from a must rich in amino acids, presented a low total sulphur compounds content; however, these wines were also characterised by high concentrations of 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester and hydrogen sulphide...|$|R
5000|$|Under a legal {{point of}} view, TBV is {{categorized}} as 'food condiment', while BVM is a 'wine vinegar'. BVM {{can be produced}} without an aging period, whereas TBV gains its peculiar features during a long aging period fixed by law at no less than 12 years. TBV is the only condiment in the world produced starting from cooked <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> without the adding of other substances, whereas BVM {{is a blend of}} concentrated <b>grape</b> <b>musts,</b> wine vinegars, and caramel (optional).|$|R
25|$|Chaptalization is {{the process}} of adding sugar to {{unfermented}} <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> in order to increase the alcohol content after fermentation. The technique is named after its developer, the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal. This process is not intended to make the wine sweeter, but rather to provide more sugar for the yeast to ferment into alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Different {{techniques}} are employed {{to adjust the}} level of sugar in the <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> In the normal chaptalization process, cane sugar {{is the most common}} type of sugar added, although some winemakers prefer beet sugar or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown sugar is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Of the Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN) {{that make}} up YAN, the amino acids arginine, proline and {{glutamine}} are the most abundant followed by alanine, threonine, serine and aspartic acid in much smaller concentrations though trace amounts of most known amino acids {{can be found in}} <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> Proline is usually the most concentrated and can represent up to 30% of the total amount of amino acids. The exact amount FAN will vary and can range 22 to 1242mg of nitrogen/liter of YAN being derived from free amino acids.|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{methodology}} {{was developed}} and validated for the determination of spiroxamine residues in <b>grapes,</b> <b>must,</b> and wine by gas chromatography/ion trap-mass spectrometry (GC/IT-MS). Two extraction procedures were used: the first involved <b>grapes,</b> <b>must,</b> and wine extraction with alkaline cyclohexane-dichloromethane (9 + 1, v/v) solution, and the second grape extraction with acetone, dichloromethane, and petroleum ether. In both procedures, the extract was centrifuged, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in cyclohexane or 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane-toluene (9 + 1, v/v), respectively. Spiroxamine diastereomers A and B were determined by GC/IT-MS, and a matrix effect was observed {{in the case of}} grapes but not in must and wine. Recovery of spiroxamine from fortified samples at 0. 02 to 5. 0 mg/kg ranged from 78 - 102 % for <b>grapes</b> and <b>must,</b> with relative standard deviation (RSD) < 13 %; for red and white wines, recoveries ranged from 90 to 101 % with RSD < 9 %. The limit of quantification was 0. 02 mg/kg for <b>grapes,</b> <b>must,</b> and wine or 0. 10 mg/kg for grapes, depending on the extraction procedure used...|$|R

25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN that winemakers {{will see in}} their grape musts depends {{on a number of}} {{components}} including grape variety, rootstock, vineyard soils and viticultural practices (such as the use of fertilizers and canopy management) as well as the climate conditions of particular vintages. Infections by mold, such as Botrytis cinerea (known as noble rot when it is desired) can reduce the amino acid content of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> by as much as 61%. Some regions are noted for having low YAN such as Washington State which during a typical vintage will have 90% of tested must below 400mg N/L and nearly a quarter be below 150mg N/L.|$|E
25|$|Biogenic amines {{have been}} implicated as a {{potential}} cause of red wine headaches. In wine, histamine, cadaverine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, and tyramine have all been detected. These amines are created by the degradation of amino acids found in <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and {{left over from the}} breakdown of dead yeast cells after fermentation. Most LAB have the potential to create biogenic amines, even some strains of O. oeni, but high levels of biogenic amines are most often associated with species from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. In the European Union, the concentration of biogenic amines in wine is beginning to be monitored, while the United States currently does not have any regulations.|$|E
25|$|If grape {{pressing}} was used, {{an estate}} would press the skins {{one to three}} times. Since juice from later pressings would be coarser and more tannic, the third pressing normally made wine of low quality called lora. After pressing, the <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> was stored in large earthenware jars known as dolia. With a capacity of up to several thousand liters, these jars were often partially buried into the floors of a barn or warehouse. Fermentation {{took place in the}} dolium, lasting from two weeks to a month before the wine was removed and put in amphoras for storage. Small holes drilled into the top allowed the carbon dioxide gas to escape.|$|E

25|$|YAN is a {{measurement}} of the primary organic (free amino acids) and inorganic (ammonia and ammonium) sources of nitrogen that can be assimilated by S. cerevisiae. There are several nitrogenous compounds found in must and wine including peptides, larger proteins, amides, biogenic amines, pyridines, purines and nucleic acids but these cannot be directly used by yeast for metabolism. Taken together, the total nitrogen content of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> can range from 60 to 2400mg of nitrogen per liter, however not all of this nitrogen will be assimilable. The lack of protease enzymes, which break down larger peptides into smaller components, that can work outside the cell, limits {{the size of the}} molecules that yeast can use as a source for nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{organic acids}} are mainly malic and tartaric acids. Tartaric acid is a {{characteristic}} of grapes; in its leaves its content ranges from 5 to 7 grams per litre. Malic acid is present in green grapes and its ratio decreases with maturation to give between 2 and 7 grams per litre at harvest. The range is very wide depending on the variety and soil with hot climates giving lower rates as the heat accelerates its degradation. There are many other acids in small quantities: citric acid, ascorbic acid, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric acid, galacturonic acid, coumaric acid, etc. Their variable quantity varies the pH of the wort. The must of white wine is generally more acidic than red <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> simply because the grape maturity is less advanced.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the French {{government}} commissioned Louis Pasteur {{to conduct a}} study on the problems plaguing the French wine industry. His findings had a lasting influence on the science of French winemaking. Pasteur was asked to help identify wine quality control issues that caused spoilage and other faults. During the 3 to 4 years that Pasteur spent studying wine he observed and explained the process of fermentation—noted that it was living organisms (yeast) that convert sugar in the <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> into alcohol in some form of chemical reaction. He also noted the presence of glycerol and succinic acid in wine as well as the beneficial process of adding tartaric acid during winemaking. Another observation that Pasteur made was that oxygen {{played a significant role in}} the aging and improvement of wine.|$|E

Nitrogen-phosphorus and mass spectrometric detectors were used, because of their low sensitivity and high selectivity. Because of high selectivity of detector, no cleanup was necessary and the extract was concentrated 5 times. Recoveries from fortified <b>grapes,</b> <b>must,</b> and wine ranged from 93 to 110 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Glutathione is an {{important}} constituent of <b>grapes,</b> <b>must,</b> and wine. However, to date, no review has provided an integrated view {{of the role of}} this compound in wine-related systems. In this review, special emphasis is given to its occurrence in <b>grapes,</b> <b>must,</b> and wine and its role as an antioxidant in wine. The effect of glutathione on both desirable and undesirable aroma compounds is also outlined. Furthermore, the use of glutathione-enriched products in winemaking and the various analytical techniques for the quantification of glutathione in must and wine are discussed. Limitations in existing knowledge are also identified...|$|R
25|$|Similarly, re-hydration {{procedures}} {{will also}} {{vary depending on}} the manufacturer and winery. Yeast is often inoculated in a volume of water or <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> that is 5–10 times the weight of the dry yeast. This liquid is often brought to temperature of 40°C (104°F) prior to the introduction of the yeast (though some yeast strains may need temperatures below 38°C (100°F)) to allow the cells to disperse easily rather than clump and sink {{to the bottom of the}} container. The heat activation also allows the cells to quickly reestablish their membrane barrier before soluble cytoplasmic components escape the cell. Re-hydration at lower temperatures can greatly reduce the viability of the yeast with up to 60% cell death if the yeast is re-hydrated at 15°C (60°F). The culture is then stirred and aerated to incorporate oxygen into the culture which the yeast uses in the synthesis of needed survival factors.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, {{where the}} saint's day is celebrated across the country, {{it is common}} for {{families}} and friends to gather around the fire in reunions called magustos, where they typically eat roasted chestnuts and drink wine, jeropiga (drink made of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and firewater) and aguapé (a sort of weak and watered-down wine). According to the most widespread variation of the cloak story, Saint Martin cut off half of his cloak in order to offer it to a beggar and along the way, he gave the remaining part to a second beggar. As he faced a long ride in a freezing weather, the dark clouds cleared away and the sun shone so intensely that the frost melted away. Such weather was rare for early November, so was credited to God's intervention. The phenomenon of a sunny break to the chilly weather on Saint Martin's Day (11 November) is called Verão de São Martinho (Saint Martin's Summer, veranillo de san Martín in Spanish) in honor of the cloak legend.|$|E
25|$|After fermentation, the must is {{normally}} high in malic acid and producers {{will put the}} wine through malolactic fermentation to soften the wine. The process of chaptalization, adding sugar to the <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> to boost alcohol levels, has been a controversial issue for Beaujolais winemakers. Historically, Beaujolais producers would pick grapes at ripeness that were at minimum potential alcohol levels of 10-10.5% and then add sugar in order to artificially boost the alcohol levels to the near the maximum of 13-13.5%. This created wines lacking structure and balance {{to go with the}} high alcohol body and mouthfeel. The recent trend towards higher quality wine production has limited the use of chaptalization in the premium levels of Beaujolais wine. Filtering the wine in order to stabilize it is practiced to varying degrees by Beaujolais winemakers. Some producers who make Beaujolais on a large commercial scale will filter the wine aggressively to avoid any impurity or future chemical reactions. This can have the negative side effect of diminishing some of the wine's unique fruit character and leave a flavor that critics have described as Jell-O-like.|$|E
40|$|Azoxystrobin, fluazinam, kresoxim-methyl, mepanipyrim, and {{tetraconazole}} {{were determined}} in <b>grapes,</b> <b>must,</b> and wine by a gas chromatographic method with nitrogen-phosphorus (NP) and mass spectrometric (MS) detectors.

25|$|According to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, wine in Canada is an {{alcoholic}} beverage that {{is produced by}} the complete or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> products derived solely from fresh grapes, or any combination of them.

Plus, even [...] "dry" [...] wines that have been fermented to dryness still have unfermentable pentose sugars (such as arabinose, ribose and xylose) left behind that can be used by both positive and spoilage bacteria. As with wine yeast, manufacturers of cultured LAB inoculum usually offer specially prepared nutritional additives that be used as a supplement. However, unlike wine yeast, lactic acid bacteria can not use the supplement diammonium phosphate as a nitrogen source.|$|E
