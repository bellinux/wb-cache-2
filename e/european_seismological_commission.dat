40|$|A magnetotelluric (MT) profile {{comprising}} eight measuring sites {{was conducted}} in the Mygdonia basin, a <b>European</b> <b>Seismological</b> Test Site. The MT-stations were deployed in a direction almost perpendicular to the major axis of the sedimentary basin to cover the area between the Lagada and Volvi lakes. The earth beneath the measuring points was considered to consist of a 2 D-regional basement coupled with local, near surface, 3 D-inhomogeneities. Impedance tensor decomposition analysis {{in conjunction with the}} magnetotelluric study of Mohr circles was implemented in the MT-data. From the electric field polarization diagrams and the interpretation of the Mohr circles results it is inferred that the local structure at all the sites polarizes the electric field in comparable directions ranging from N 60 °E to N 80 °E, except for the cases of the two stations located at the northern and southern borders of the basin, where the boundary conditions produce a deviation. Furthermore, the deeper structure seems to be two-dimensional. The strike-direction of the 2 D-basement was found to be ~ N 70 °E.

40|$|This poster is ESC 2016 - 527 in the 35 th General Assembly of the <b>European</b> <b>Seismological</b> <b>Commission</b> (Trieste, 4 - 10 September 2016) Ground motion {{prediction}} equations (GMPE) are recognised as a {{key component}} of any seismic risk analysis. The consideration of both aleatory and epistemic sources of variability in the ground motion models may have significant influence on the overestimation or underestimation of the final losses. With the increased availability of new developed GMPEs over the past few years, it has been observed that the epistemic uncertainty due the choice between potential GMPEs is not decreasing, even though related knowledge is improving. The proposed model enables a complex problem to be represented by a minimum number of branches for single-site hazard analysis and mapping.

40|$|QuakeML is an XML-based data {{exchange}} standard for seismology {{that is in}} its fourth year of active community-driven development. Its development was motivated {{by the need to}} consolidate existing data formats for applications in statistical seismology, as well as setting a cutting-edge, community-agreed standard to foster interoperability of distributed infrastructures. The current release (version 1. 2) is based on a public Request for Comments process and accounts for suggestions and comments provided by a broad international user community. QuakeML is designed as an umbrella schema under which several sub-packages are collected. The present scope of QuakeML 1. 2 covers a basic description of seismic events including picks, arrivals, amplitudes, magnitudes, origins, focal mechanisms, and moment tensors. Work on additional packages (macroseismic information, ground motion, seismic inventory, and resource metadata) has been started, but is at an early stage. Several applications based on the QuakeML data model have been created so far. Among these are earthquake catalog web services at the <b>European</b> Mediterranean <b>Seismological</b> Centre (EMSC), GNS Science, and the Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC), and QuakePy, an open-source Python-based seismicity analysis toolkit. Furthermore, QuakeML is being used in the SeisComP 3 system from GFZ Potsdam, and in the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) testing center installations, developed by Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC). QuakeML is still under active and dynamic development. Further contributions from the community are crucial to its success and are highly welcome. ...|$|R
30|$|In Europe, post-earthquake {{response}} is coordinated {{at the national}} level by the individual civil protection agencies, although separate earthquake loss estimation (ELE) tools such as KOERILOSS, SIGE-DPC, ESCENARIS, SELENA, and DBELA (Strasser et al. 2008 b) have been developed in various European countries. The OpenQuake engine is the seismic hazard and risk assessment software developed recently by the Global Earthquake Model (Silva et al. 2013). The EC-funded Network of Research Infrastructures for European Seismology (NERIES Project, 2010) project developed a rapid loss estimation tool known as Earthquake Loss Estimation Routine (ELER v 3.1, 2010) to be used by European agencies such as the <b>European</b> Mediterranean <b>Seismological</b> Center (EMSC) for computing and broadcasting near-real-time earthquake loss estimates to the relevant emergency response institutions (Strasser et al. 2008 a). In this study, the application of an earthquake rapid shaking map and loss estimation system for Istanbul city is introduced. The developed methodology consists of two modules of analysis: earthquake hazard assessment (EHA) and earthquake loss assessment (ELA). The EHA module produces ground shaking maps of intensity, peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and spectral parameters at certain periods by using ground motion attenuation relationships; correlations among shaking intensity and PGA, PGV, and spectral parameters; and soil condition information. This module also uses the real-time ground motion information obtained by the strong motion stations distributed throughout the densely populated areas of Istanbul city. The ELA module uses ground motion information from the EHA module, grid-based demography, and building inventory data and provides damage and casualty information.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades the use of mobile digital seismic {{stations}} has become more and more widespread both for active and passive seismological studies. Many industries have designed and realized seismic stations suitable for portable use and characterized by small dimension and low power consumptions. The modern portable seismic instruments are generally provided with 24 bit AD converter, GPS time code and acquisition on high capacity hard disk and/or continuous data stream for telemetry. These data loggers are generally equipped with high sensibility broad-band seismometers. The PCM 5800 Digital Seismological System has been produced by LENNARTZ ELECTRONIC GmbH (Tubingen, D) since the middle Eighties. It became the first digital seismic equipment for many <b>european</b> and worldwide <b>seismological</b> institutions and laboratories, in many of which it is still in operation. This instrumentation, however, suffers of a weak point which is the acquisition based on a UHER magnetic tape recorder (13 cm wheels) with low capacity (about 8 MB; 90 minutes of continuous recording at 4. 75 cm/sec speed). This UHER recorder has high maintenance costs and it often needs expensive repairs. We propose to replace the UHER recorders with an easy and cheap solution based on commercial digital recorders with removable media in order to continue to use the high number of instruments (Encoder and Decoder) still held by the seismological community, without any modification to the existing hardware and software...|$|R

40|$|On May 21, 2003, the Eastern part of Algiers {{was struck}} by an {{earthquake}} (Mw= 6. 8) that injured 11. 455 people and caused serious damage in cities close the hypocenter. The purpose of this work is to analyse the rupture directivity of this event using a Doppler Effect approach. The inversion method developed (DIRDOP) (Caldeira et al., 2004) allows an estimation of the rupture direction and velocity from a collection of time pulses, extracted from body waveforms or a relative source time function (RSTF). This seismic data has been downloaded from the IRIS consortium and has a reasonable azimuthal coverage. We have used 30 teleseismic broadband body wave data and 6 relative RSTF obtained from the deconvolution in the time domain (Borges, 2003) using the synthetic Green functions. These are calculated using the Haskell propagator matrix. The results show a bilateral rupture in the E-W direction. In the first 5 seconds the rupture propagates from the epicentre toward the East (N 87 oE +- 13 o) with an average velocity of 2. 9 0. 31 km/s. In the last 10 seconds the rupture propagates with the same velocity but {{in the opposite direction}} (S 84 W+- 14 o). Both results are coherent with the focal mechanism (strike= 64 o, dip= 50 o, rake= 83 o) and the seismic source obtained elsewhere (Bezzeghoud et al., 2004). REFERENCES Bezzeghoud M., B. Caldeira, J.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{in the frame of}} the {{cooperative}} line that several Spanish Universities and other foreign partners started with the Haitian government in 2010. According to our studies (Benito et al. in An evaluation of seismic hazard in La Hispaniola, after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, 33 rd General Assembly of the <b>European</b> <b>Seismological</b> <b>Commission,</b> Moscow, Russia, 2012) and recent scientific literature, the earthquake hazard in Haiti remains high (Calais et al. in Nat Geosci 3 : 794 – 799, 2010). In view of this, we wonder whether the country is currently ready to face another earthquake. In this sense, we estimated several damage scenarios in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien associated to realistic possible major earthquakes. Our findings show that almost 50 % of the building stock of both cities would result uninhabitable due to structural damage. Around 80 % of the buildings in both cities have reinforced concrete structure with concrete block infill; however, the presence of masonry buildings becomes significant (between 25 and 45 % of the reinforced concrete buildings) in rural areas and informal settlements on the outskirts, where the estimated damage is higher. The influence of the soil effect on the damage spatial distribution is evident in both cities. We have found that the percentage of uninhabitable buildings in soft soil areas may be double the percentage obtained in nearby districts located in hard soil. These results reveal that a new seismic catastrophe of similar or even greater consequences than the 2010 Haiti earthquake might happen if the earthquake resilience is not improved in the country. Nowadays, the design of prevention actions and mitigation policies is the best instrument the society has to face seismic risk. In this sense, the results of this research might contribute to define measures oriented to earthquake risk reduction in Haiti, which should be a real priority for national and international institutions.
