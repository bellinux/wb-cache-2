40|$|We {{report a}} panel of 12 {{microsatellite}} markers, including nine novel polymorphic loci isolated in the European polecat and three loci previously developed in closely related species, for genetic studies <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> and ferrets. We tested the panel at fine geographic scales in polecat and domestic ferret populations of Britain and Portugal and at a broad geographic scale, using 50 polecat samples from across Western Europe. At the fine geographic scales, we recorded one to five alleles per locus and observed and expected heterozygosities ranging from 0 to 0. 80 and from 0 to 0. 74, respectively. These values increased markedly in the European sample <b>of</b> <b>polecats.</b> No linkage disequilibrium was detected between any pair of loci and all genotypic frequencies complied with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium expectations. The microsatellite panel allowed the molecular discrimination <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> and domestic ferrets in Britain, where hybridisation between the two species has been documented. Thus, these loci may be useful not only in genetic studies <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> and ferrets but also in studies to assess hybridisation between these two mustelid species...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the steppe polecat, the European polecat has a {{much more}} settled way of life, with {{definite}} home ranges. The characteristics <b>of</b> <b>polecat</b> home ranges vary according to season, habitat, sex and social status. Breeding females settle in discrete areas, whereas breeding males and dispersing juveniles have more fluid ranges, being more mobile. Males typically have larger territories than females. Each polecat uses several den sites distributed throughout its territory. Occasionally, abandoned European badger or red fox burrows are used. Rabbit warrens are often areas <b>of</b> intense <b>polecat</b> activity. In winter, the polecat may use farm buildings or haystacks as daytime resting sites. The polecat is not as territorial as other small mustelids, having been known to share territories {{with other members of}} the same sex. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> marking their territories is sparse. Like other mustelids, the polecat is usually a silent animal, though it will growl fiercely when angered, and squeak when distressed. It also emits a low, mewling cry to its mate or offspring.|$|R

40|$|Steppe polecat (Mustela eversmanni Lesson, 1827) is the {{dominant}} species of mustelids in the alpine meadow ecosystem of the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) plateau in China. Using the live and dead rats as the experimental prey, researchers investigated the effects of prey body masses, numbers and activities on predatory behaviors <b>of</b> the <b>polecat.</b> The results revealed that the prey activity {{was the most important}} factor that affected prey selection <b>of</b> the <b>polecat</b> during searching phase. The searching time used for live prey by polecat was significantly longer than that used for dead prey. Also, the prey numbers and body masses significantly affected prey selection <b>of</b> the <b>polecat.</b> When the activities of prey were the same, the polecat always preferred the group with more prey than the one with less prey. When the number and activity of prey were the same, the searching duration was significantly decreased from the lowest weight class to the highest one.

40|$|Summary: In Britain, {{the use of}} "second-generation " rodenticides {{has become}} {{widespread}} on agricultural premises. The high toxicity and relatively long half-lives of these compounds has raised concerns over potential secondary exposure and poisoning of non-target predators. Over the last 15 years, exposure has been extensively documented in the barn owl Tyto alba but relatively {{little is known about}} mammalian terrestrial predators. This paper reviews recent studies and demonstrates that there is evidence of both secondary exposure and secondary poisoning in a variety of non-target, terrestrial mammals in Britain. It also presents new data on rodenticide levels in the polecat Mustela putorius which preys on farmyard rats in winter in Britain and is, therefore, considered to be highly vulnerable to exposure to rodenticides. The new data demonstrated that 26 % <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> in the sample contained difenacoum or bromadiolone and that exposure was geographically widespread and occurred in several years. The possible effects of secondary exposure on populations <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> and other predators are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The European polecat {{is present}} in all of France's territories, {{excepting}} Corsica, {{and has been in}} a state of decline for several decades. Nevertheless, it is listed as Least Concern on France's Red Data Book. The European polecat is rare in numerous regions or départements. In the Rhone-Alps region, its population has undergone a sizeable decline since the 1990s, largely as a consequence of poisoning campaigns against muskrats. A 1999 study on the decline <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> in this region indicated the species has little chance of surviving there. Elsewhere, it is considered either rare or sporadic in 22 districts and absent or extirpated in 22 others. In Drôme, for example, polecat populations have been decreasing since 1975, and have disappeared in 27 communes in Isère. Its numbers are declining in Morvan and Ariège, and is thinly distributed in Brittany. Though present in Aquitaine, its numbers have been dropping since the 1950s, and is very rare in the mountain regions. In Normandy, the speed <b>of</b> the <b>polecat's</b> decline has somewhat decreased. In the alpine départements, its range is limited by altitude, as the species relies on more Mediterranean climates to thrive. It is, however, especially abundant in the irrigated Crau, but is absent on {{the eastern part of the}} area, apparently being restricted by the valleys of the Durance and Rhone Rivers. The largest populations occur in Northern France: Pas de Calais, Central France Alsace, Lorraine and the areas of the Loire with the Vendée, which holds the largest record <b>of</b> <b>polecat</b> observations. It is common in all the départements of Champagne-Ardenne.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{northern}} Europe underwent a warm climatic period which coincided with {{an expansion of}} the range <b>of</b> the European <b>polecat.</b> The European mink possibly was gradually absorbed by the polecat due to hybridisation.

50|$|The {{town was}} named after the area's first {{permanent}} settler, a full-blood Lower Creek Indian named Sapulpa, of the Kasihta Tribe, from Osocheetown, Alabama. About 1850, he established a trading post near the meeting <b>of</b> <b>Polecat</b> and Rock creeks (about one mile (1.6 km) southeast of present-day downtown Sapulpa). When the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (later known as the Frisco Railroad) built a spur to this area in 1886, it was known as Sapulpa Station. The Sapulpa post office was chartered July 1, 1889. The town was incorporated March 31, 1898.|$|R
40|$|As {{in other}} European countries, {{there are some}} {{indications}} that the polecat population in the Republic of Croatia is declining.

In order to acquire firm data on the number <b>of</b> <b>polecats,</b> their behaviour and social or-ganization, further studies are to be encouraged. Based on the results of these studies, a recovery plan should be arranged. This plan must include the creation of a positive image for polecats at all levels of society and the prevention of a further decline in the polecat population brought about by continuing inappropriate exposure of poisoned baits...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} {{study was to investigate}} kin discrimination in the polecat and to analyse the ontogeny <b>of</b> interactions. Juvenile <b>polecats</b> (ten males and nine females) had been raised under four distinct experimental conditions: 1, kin, familiar; 2, kin, unfamiliar; 3, non-kin, familiar; 4, non-kin, unfamiliar. During dyadic encounters between polecats in neutral enclosures, the number of positive (tolerance), negative (aggression), intermediate (intimidation), and neutral interactions (no direct interactions) were recorded at two different ages of the animals (50 and 70 days old). Male-male encounters were characterised by more aggressive behaviour than female-female ones. The proportion of these negative interactions increased with age, while the proportion of positive interactions decreased. Although aggressive behaviours varied among groups, the reaction did never differ with the kinship. Kin selection theory provides successful explanations {{for a wide range of}} phenomena, but our results suggest that multiple mechanisms running simultaneously might be involved in social behaviours. Familiarity clearly influenced the social behaviour <b>of</b> <b>polecats</b> and might be involved in a kin facilitation effect favouring interactions. Animals raised together demonstrated more positive and less negative interactions, so that, despite the individualistic way of life <b>of</b> the <b>polecat,</b> familiarisation may result in more tolerance, emphasising that solitary species may provide significant information on social life. Anyway, familiarisation in polecat may be regarded as a cognitive form of recognition...|$|R

Overall, the environmental descriptors that most infl uence Polecat distribution are main water course length, the number of scrubland patches, the Shannon Wiener landscape diversity index and the number of water surface patches.

50|$|The European polecat {{population}} in Britain declined following widespread predator control, {{particularly in the}} late 19th century. Today, it has recolonised much of its former range. In order to gauge the extent of this range expansion, the trust has carried out three national polecat distribution surveys since the 1990s, the most recent of which took place during 2014 and 2015. The Trust has carried out research to further understanding of the ecology <b>of</b> the <b>polecat,</b> including live trapping, radio-tracking, investigation of secondary rodenticide poisoning, and genetic analysis <b>of</b> hybridisation between <b>polecats</b> and ferrets.|$|R
50|$|The European polecat is a {{valuable}} fur bearer, whose pelt (fitch) is more valuable than the steppe polecat's. Its skin is used primarily {{in the production of}} jackets, capes and coats. It is particularly well suited for trimmings for women's clothing. The tail is sometimes used for the making of paintbrushes. One disadvantage <b>of</b> <b>polecat</b> skin, however, is its unpleasant odour, which is difficult to remove. The European polecat was first commercially farmed for its fur in Great Britain during the 1920s, but was only elevated to economic importance in Finland in 1979. It never became popular in the United States and Canada, due to import laws regarding non-native species. It did gain economic importance in the USSR, though.|$|R
