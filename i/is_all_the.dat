Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she {{is in love with}} him. Peter, however, feels that he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies. He hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.|$|E
5|$|Each road stage (that <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stages {{except the}} team time {{trial and the}} {{individual}} time trial) included an intermediate sprint. This was {{a point where the}} leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification. Many of the stages also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification, with the most difficult climbs earning the most points.|$|E

5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E

This accomplishment <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more remarkable considering the engineers did not enjoy the benefits of computer-aided design or wind tunnel testing. The original Elite drawings were by Peter Kirwan-Taylor. Frank Costin (brother of Mike, one of the co founders of Cosworth), at that time Chief Aerodynamic Engineer for the de Havilland Aircraft Company, contributed to the final design.|$|E
25|$|Sumerian {{metallurgy}} and goldsmithing {{were highly}} developed. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more remarkable for {{a region where}} metals had to be imported. Known metals included gold, gold, silver, copper, bronze, lead, electrum, and tin. The use of binary, tertiary and quaternary alloys were already in use during the Uruk period. Sumerians used bronze, although the scarcity of tin meant that they used arsenic instead. Metalworking techniques included lost-wax casting, plating, filigree, and granulation.|$|E
25|$|In some city, {{the fare}} {{of the public}} {{transportation}} depends on the travel distance, such as the MRT in Taipei, Taiwan. This increases the transportation expense for those who has been move to the urban area, what's more, they have less money to earn by investment because they are using all of money to pay their daily expense already. For example, the fare of New York city subway(MTA) <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> same {{no matter how long}} do you travel, it's all 2.75 USD. It's justice of Housing inequality.|$|E

Leather grips are usually used to help maintain a grip on the bar.|$|E
25|$|However {{over the}} {{following}} few years the city began to grow again due to immigration, taking in of refugees and the gradual return of millions of citizens who sat out the plague overseas and off world.

25|$|In fact, {{from the}} beginning, {{a sense of}} urgency gave the first Zionists the {{profound}} conviction that the task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis.

In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews {{at the beginning of the}} century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.|$|E

25|$|In the {{relatively}} small and geographically dispersed Canadian market, magazines producing long-form journalism have often struggled to stay afloat. Saturday Night, which The Walrus editor John Macfarlane formerly published, lost money continuously despite being a celebrated publication. But as Macfarlane reports, The Walruss charitable model, {{similar to that of}} Harper's, is so far sustaining it: donations covered about half of the costs of producing the magazine in 2010, with the traditional revenue streams of circulation and advertising providing the rest. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> more important for the magazine because its educational mandate requires that it keep a ratio of no less than 70 percent editorial content to 30 percent advertising.|$|E
25|$|That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> control (or sensitivity) is on {{the first}} step. This {{situation}} represents the classic rate-limiting step that is frequently mentioned in text books. The flux through the pathway is completely dependent on the first step. Under these conditions, no other step in the pathway can affect the flux. The effect is however dependent on the complete insensitivity of {{the first step to}} its product. Such a situation is likely to be rare in real pathways. In fact the classic rate limiting step has almost never been observed experimentally. Instead, a range of limitingness is observed, with some steps having more limitingness (control) than others.|$|E
25|$|The Carnot {{heat-engine}} cycle described is {{a totally}} reversible cycle. That <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> processes that comprise it can be reversed, in which case it becomes the Carnot refrigeration cycle. This time, the cycle remains exactly the same except that the directions of any heat and work interactions are reversed. Heat is absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir, heat is rejected to a high-temperature reservoir, and a work input is required to accomplish all this. The P-V diagram of the reversed Carnot cycle {{is the same as}} for the Carnot cycle except that the directions of the processes are reversed.|$|E

Later known as the National Pact, it affirmed the inviolability of the Ottoman “frontiers”—that <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman lands inhabited by Turks when the Armistice of Mudros was signed. It declared the provisional government, which is named as Turkish Grand National Assembly (GNA). On the economic front, this document also followed the Ottoman position of rejection of special status arrangements for the minorities, which was named as the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. A steering committee was established and Mustafa Kemal as selected head.|$|E
25|$|Pliny {{says that}} Timaeus (born about 350 BC) {{believed}} Pytheas' {{story of the}} discovery of amber. Strabo says that Dicaearchus (died about 285BC) did not trust the stories of Pytheas. That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> information that survives concerning the date of Pytheas' voyage. Presuming that Timaeus would not have written until after he was 20 years old in about 330BC and Dicaearchus would have needed time to write his most mature work, after 300BC, there is no reason not to accept Henry Fanshawe Tozer's window of 330–300BC for the voyage. Some would give Timaeus an extra 5years, bringing the voyage down to 325BC at earliest. There is no further evidence.|$|E
