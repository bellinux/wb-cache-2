25|$|The {{victim was}} {{identified}} as a 16-year-old Romulus high school student named Maralynn Skelton, who had disappeared while hitchhiking in Ann Arbor. She was last seen alive outside a <b>drive-in</b> <b>restaurant</b> on Washtenaw Avenue two days before her body was discovered (although autopsy reports indicated Skelton had died between 24 and 36 hours before her body was discovered). Investigators noted strong similarities between this murder and previous killings attributed to the Michigan Murderer, including the fact that a garter belt had been tied around Skelton's neck and her clothes and shoes had been neatly placed beside her body. However, the dramatic increase in savagery exhibited against the victim and the fact that Skelton was a known drug user and dealer as opposed to a university student led some junior investigators to speculate her murder may have been drug-related. Nonetheless, Ann Arbor Police Chief Walter Krasny formally linked Skelton's murder to the series.|$|E

2500|$|Users have {{experimented with}} various {{alternative}} flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions.

The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.|$|E
2500|$|Johnie's Broiler (originally Harvey's Broiler) was a <b>drive-in</b> <b>restaurant</b> {{and coffee}} shop, {{which has been}} in movies and sitcoms as well as TV {{commercials}} and music videos. Completed in 1958, it is an example of Googie architecture. Johnie's was well known to Southern California locals, many of which drove miles to cruise through its massive lot. In the mid-1960s, renowned author Tom Wolfe immortalized the cruising, car and fashion scene that surrounded Harvey's Broiler at the time; The article, [...] "The Hair Boys," [...] appears in a bestselling 1968 collection of his articles titled, The Pump House Gang. He made drawings of the denizens of Harvey's that appear in a later book, The Purple Decades. The Broiler was a regular commercial and movie location for films such as Heat, What's Love Got to Do with It, Unstrung Heroes, Reality Bites, Can't Hardly Wait, Jawbreaker, as well as a television episode of The X-Files and [...] Mad Men.

The first standalone Chicken in the Rough restaurant was opened on U.S. Route 66 at 2429 North Lincoln in 1936, and was initially a small <b>drive-in</b> <b>restaurant</b> with nine stools and four booths. The restaurant was significantly expanded to seat 1,100 people, and became a place that was visited by travelers, film stars and state executives. Celebrities who were friends with the Osbornes and patrons of Beverly's Pancake Corner restaurants include Bob Hope and Gene Autry. Beverly's Pancake House has a framed black-and-white photo on a wall showing Bob Hope with a birthday cake that the restaurant made him one year.

2500|$|As {{with the}} {{invention}} of the hamburger, the exact origins of the cheeseburger are unknown. Several chefs claim to have been the first to add a slice of cheese to a hamburger. Lionel Sternberger of Rite Spot in Pasadena, California takes credit for the cheeseburger, claiming that he invented it between 1924 and 1926. A description from a 1928 menu from the O'Dell Restaurant in Los Angeles reveals that it was serving burgers with slices of cheese at the time. Luis Ballast, owner of the Humpty Dumpty <b>drive-in</b> <b>restaurant</b> in Denver, Colorado, made an attempt to create a cheeseburger with a registered trademark known as a [...] "yellowburger" [...] in 1935. J.C. Reynolds, the operator of a bar in Southern California from 1932 to 1984, popularized a pimento burger. Processed cheese, the type of cheese most used in cheeseburgers, was invented in 1911 by Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland, although the first U.S. patent awarded for it was given to James L. Kraft in 1916. Kraft Foods went on to create the first commercial version of sliced processed cheese, which was first introduced to the market in 1950.|$|E
2500|$|A new and {{short-lived}} {{option for}} 1970 was the vacuum operated exhaust (VOE), which was vacuum actuated via an underdash lever marked [...] "exhaust". The VOE {{was designed to}} reduce exhaust backpressure and to increase power and performance, but it also substantially increased exhaust noise. The VOE option was offered from November 1969 to January 1970. Pontiac management was ordered to cancel the VOE option by GM's upper management following a TV commercial for the GTO that aired during Super Bowl IV on CBS January 11, 1970. In that commercial, entitled the [...] "Humbler", which was broadcast only that one time, a young man pulled up in a new GTO to a <b>drive-in</b> <b>restaurant</b> with dramatic music and exhaust noise in the background, pulling the [...] "exhaust" [...] knob to activate the VOE and then left the drive-in after failing to find a street racing opponent. That particular commercial was also cancelled by order of GM management. Approximately 233 1970 GTOs were factory built with this rare option including 212 hardtop coupes and 21 convertbiles, all were [...] "YS" [...] 400ci 350hp with either four-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions. This particular GTO in the commercial was [...] "Palladium" [...] silver with a black bucket interior. It was unusual in several respects as it also had the under-dash [...] "Ram Air" [...] knob just {{to the right of}} the VOE knob, and it sported [...] "'69 Judge" [...] stripes, as a few very-early '70 GTOs could be ordered with. It also had a Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, remote mirror, Rally II wheels, A/C, hood tach, and a new-for-1970 Formula steering wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{different}} {{variants of}} the hamburger {{have been created}} over the years, {{some of which have}} become very popular. Much of this diversity has been the product of other restaurant chains that have tried to reproduce the success of McDonald's and White Castle, while others served to influence McDonald's. An example of a restaurant that influenced McDonald's and its imitators is Big Boy, which was first opened in 1936 by Bob Wian in Glendale, California and became known in that locale as Bob's Big Boy. It was at this restaurant that a major hamburger variant, the double deck cheeseburger, with two beef patties, was first made. Wian's creation was distinctively served by Big Boy restaurants with the bun sliced twice, the center slice—known as the club section—separating the two patties. The chain also popularized the <b>drive-in</b> <b>restaurant</b> format, taken and simplified by McDonald's type fast food operators. By the 1960s, Big Boy had expanded throughout the United States and Canada. Despite the benefits it provided to Wian, the chain was sold along with the rights to their signature Big Boy hamburger to the Marriott Corporation in 1967. This same year McDonald's franchisee Jim Delligatti, created an imitation of the Big Boy — the Big Mac.'This wasn’t like discovering the lightbulb,' Mr. Delligatti later told the Los Angeles Times. 'The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.'|access-date=January 3, 2017}} An example of the many McDonald's and White Castle imitators is Kewpee Hamburgers, a fast-food chain founded in 1923 in Flint, Michigan by Samuel V.
