40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} offered diverse {{contractual}} forms of alliance, {{in which the}} supply chain partners coordinate their decisions for greater joint performance in an entirely self-interested way. Prior literature implicitly assumes free inventory financing. However, this assumption is questionable in the real marketplace. Firms frequently finance their working capital {{from a variety of}} credit sources, such as banks, and incur positive costs of the funds for inventory. Surprisingly, the impact of inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> on supply chain coordination has not been sufficiently investigated by supply chain academics. We address this issue by explicitly assuming capital-constrained agents and positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> Specifically, we consider four extensively discussed coordination mechanisms for investigation: (i) all-unit quantity discount, (ii) buybacks, (iii) two-part tariff, and (iv) revenue-sharing. We show that, under the assumption of positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> these contracts fail to achieve joint profit maximization if each agent relies on direct financing from a financial institution. Positive <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> call for trade-credit in order to subsidize the retailer's <b>costs</b> of inventory <b>financing.</b> Using trade-credit in addition to the contracts, the supplier fully coordinates the supply chain for the largest joint profits. Moreover, positive inventory <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> make revenue-sharing less profitable than the other three contracts. We present three different schemes for coordination in a decentralized supply chain, using buybacks, quantity discount, and two-part tariff, respectively. We also derive the optimal trade-credit rate not only for the supplier's profit, but also for joint supply chain profit.

40|$|Part I of this {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effect of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> on {{the efficiency of the}} T-bill futures market. The cost-of-carry model is used and three types of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> are selected as proxies for RP (repurchase agreement) rates. The results suggest that the cost-of-carry model assuming a constant RP rate is unreliable in explaining the pricing of T-bill futures. A search for "true" <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> shows that such <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> could be a nonlinearly weighted rate of the term RP rate (or the 90 -day-maturity T-bill rate) and the federal funds rate. Theoretically implied RP rates in the year of 1983 are also generated for comparisons. Part II examines the impact of inflation uncertainty on the futures-forward rate differential. The cost-of-carry model assuming a constant RP rate ignores the future fluctuations of <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> A "risk premium" could arise due to inflation uncertainty. This part provides evidence that there exists a systematic relationship between the daily futures-forward rate differences and the inflation rate. Part III provides a theoretical treatment of the optimal arbitrage investment under uncertainty and of equilibrium pricing in the T-bill futures market. A dynamic stochastic programming model shows that a "myopic" property exists in the T-bill futures market in the sense that expectations of the future one-period price movements do not exert an impact on the current optimal arbitrage investment decision under uncertainty. It shows, however, that such a "myopic" property is not pure in that expectations of <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> in the next period affect the investment decision in the current period. Equilibrium pricing of the T-bill futures is obtained under arbitrage arguments. It shows that an equilibrium price is achieved {{at the point where the}} expected current one-period arbitrage profits are zero when cost-of-carry is required, even in a multi-period setting...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{an individual}} lending credit market {{in a rural}} society, where potential borrowers have a dynamic incentive of strategic default, and a benevolent lender gives them a credible threat to cut future credit when loands are not repaid. A crucial issue is that social sanction of default depends on the default rate in the society. Our analysis suggests that for a relatively small <b>financing</b> <b>cost,</b> a credit market exists where borrowers have little motivation to default voluntarily, associated with intense social sanctions. The results also reveal that a relatively large <b>financing</b> <b>cost</b> causes the credit market to collapse, since it raises motivation of default, associated with less intense social sanctions. These results could justify government support to reduce the lender’s <b>financing</b> <b>cost.</b> The model further illustrates the plausibility of two equilibria: a low default rate associated with a low lending rate and intense social sanctions, and a high default rate with a high lending rate and less intense social sanctions.

In a real options model with costly external financing we derive optimal investment timing as a trade-off of present and expected future <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b> While a pure-quantity constrained firm always overinvests in investment states, we find that <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> can induce both voluntary delay and acceleration of investment, and we show that both investment volume and investment-cash flow sensitivities are non-monotonic in financing constraints. For high- and low-liquidity firms, we find that sensitivities are increasing in con-straints, and that both dimensions of constraints, namely liquidity constraints and capital market frictions inducing <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> have similar effects on investment. In contrast, the effects are ambiguous for firms with intermediate liquidity. JEL Classification: G 31, G 3...|$|R

Thus, optimal {{monetary and}} fiscal policy is time inconsistent. However, if preferences (and/or productivity) satisfy certain conditions, the former force disappears and optimal monetary and fiscal policy becomes time consistent. The results hold with both flexible exchange rate regimes and fixed exchange rate regimes. The latter indicates that a credible fixed exchange rate regime does not help render optimal policy time consistent. ...|$|R
