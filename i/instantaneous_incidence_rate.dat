Existing criteria need improvement in terms of specificity and individual risk assessment to allow for better targeted and earlier interventions. To develop a differential predictive clinical model of transition to first-episode psychosis. Prospective multicenter, naturalistic field study with a total follow-up time of 18 months. Six early-detection outpatient centers in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, and England. Two hundred forty-five help-seeking patients in a putatively prodromal state of psychosis according to either ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria or the basic symptom-based criterion cognitive disturbances (COGDIS). Incidence of transition to psychosis. At 18 -month follow-up, the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> for transition to psychosis was 19 %. Combining UHR and COGDIS yielded the best sensitivity. A prediction model was developed and included positive symptoms, bizarre thinking, sleep disturbances, a schizotypal disorder, level of functioning in the past year, and years of education. With a positive likelihood ratio of 19. 9, an area under the curve of 80. 8 %, and a positive predictive value of 83. 3 %, diagnostic accuracy was excellent. A 4 -level prognostic index further classifying the general risk of the whole sample predicted <b>instantaneous</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of up to 85 % and allowed for an estimation of time to transition.

This work models and analyzes the dynamics of lung and bronchus cancer age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> by race (White and Black), gender (male and female), and prevalence of daily smoking in 38 U. S. states, the District of Columbia, and across eight U. S. geographic regions from 1999 to 2012. Data, obtained from the U. S. Cancer Statistics Section of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reflect approximately 77 % of the U. S. population and constitute a representative sample for making inferences about <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> in lung and bronchus cancer (henceforth lung cancer). A longitudinal linear mixed-effects model was used to study lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> and to estimate <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> {{as a function of}} time, race, gender, and prevalence of daily smoking. Between 1999 and 2012, age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> in lung cancer have decreased in all states and regions. However, racial and gender disparities remain. Whites continue to have lower age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> for this cancer than Blacks in all states and in five of the eight U. S. geographic regions. Disparities in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> between Black and White men are significantly larger than those between Black and White women, with Black men having the highest <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of all subgroups. Assuming that lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> remain within reasonable range, the model predicts that the gender gap in the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> for Whites would disappear by mid- 2018, and for Blacks by 2026. However, the racial gap in lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> among Black and White males will remain. Among all geographic regions, the Mid-South has the highest overall lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> and the highest <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> for Whites, while the Midwest has the highest <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> for Blacks. Between 1999 and 2012, there was a downward trend in the prevalence of daily smokers in both genders. However, males have significantly higher rates of cigarette smoking than females at all time points. The highest and lowest prevalence of daily smoking are found in the Mid-South and New England, respectively. There was a significant correlation between lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> and smoking prevalence in all geographic regions, indicating a strong influence of cigarette smoking on regional lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rates.</b> Although age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> in lung cancer have decreased throughout the U.

Age and birth cohort effects on the <b>incidence</b> and mortality <b>rates</b> were examined, using multiplicative models. Results. The age-adjusted mortality rate has been increasing since the 1960 s (4. 1 per 100 000 population in 1950 and 6. 6 in 1991, adjusted by the World Population). The age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> has also been rising since 1975. Age-specific rates have been increasing particularly in the age range 40 - 79 years.

A total of 254 individual counties in Texas with corresponding lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> from 2004 to 2008 and median household incomes in 2006 were collected from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance System. A simple linear model and spatial linear models with two structures, Simultaneous Autoregressive Structure (SAR) and Conditional Autoregressive Structure (CAR), were used to link median household income and lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> in Texas. The residuals of the spatial linear models were analyzed with Moran 2 ̆ 7 s I and Geary 2 ̆ 7 s C statistics, and the statistical results were used to detect similar lung cancer <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> clusters and disease patterns in Texas. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: European {{legislation}} requires {{manufacturers of}} plasma products to report epidemiological data on human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus in donor populations. The <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of such infections {{are directly related}} to the risk of infection transmission. We propose two statistical tests to evaluate these <b>incidence</b> <b>rates.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infection data of the four Dutch blood collection centres from 2003 through 2006 were analysed. For transversal comparison of centres and detection of increased <b>incidence</b> <b>rates,</b> a new statistical test was developed (outlier test). For longitudinal detection of trends in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates,</b> a generic test for trend is proposed. The power and risk of non-detection are evaluated for both tests. RESULTS: Application of the outlier test did not reveal any significantly increased <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> among centres in The Netherlands. The test for trend showed no significant increase in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> in individual centres, but on national level a statistically significant increase in hepatitis C virus incidence was observed (P-value of 0. 01). CONCLUSION: The proposed tests allow signalling of outlier centres and trends in <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> both at individual centre and at national levels. Graphical support and the use of as much relevant historical data as possible is recommended. The statistical tests described are generic and can be applied by any blood establishment and plasma fractionation institut...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the impact of the}} form of the non-linearity of the infectious disease <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> on the dynamics of epidemiological models. We consider a very general form of the non-linear <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> (in fact, we assumed that the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> is given by an arbitrary function f (S, I, N) constrained by a few biologically feasible conditions) and a variety of epidemiological models. We show that under the constant population size assumption, these models exhibit asymptotically stable steady states. Precisely, we demonstrate that the concavity of the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> with respect to the number of infective individuals is a sufficient condition for stability. If the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> is concave in the number of the infectives, the models we consider have either a unique and stable endemic equilibrium state or no endemic equilibrium state at all; in the latter case the infection-free equilibrium state is stable. For the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> of the form g(I) h(S), we prove global stability, constructing a Lyapunov function and using the direct Lyapunov method. It is remarkable that the system dynamics is independent of how the <b>incidence</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the number of susceptible individuals. We demonstrate this result using a SIRS model and a SEIRS model as case studies. For other compartment epidemic models, the analysis is quite similar, and the same conclusion, namely stability of the equilibrium states, holds...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of velocity-based gain-scheduling techniques to a demanding, highly nonlinear, missile control design task. Scheduling on <b>instantaneous</b> <b>incidence</b> (a rapidly varying quantity) is well known to lead to considerable difficulties with conventional gain-scheduling methods. Moreover, the missile dynamics do not have well-defined relative degree at operating points where the lateral velocity is zero and thus conventional feedback linearisation methods {{cannot be applied to}} design a controller...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. – A {{population-based}} epidemiolog-ical {{study that}} concerns {{the estimate of}} <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of Hodgkin’s Disease (HD) and Non Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) in a Central Italy area was per-formed. All the new cases of HD and NHL diag-nosed from 1982 till 1994 in the target population were collected by multiple information sources. The temporal trend of <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> and their rela-tion with age, gender and histological variant were analyzed. In the considered period 95 cases of HD and 297 cases of NHL were collected. Constant age-adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> of HD were observed, while an increasing trend of NHL <b>incidence</b> <b>rates</b> was observed especially for cases at presentation in stage III and IV and for histotypes G, H and I...|$|R
