In this study, the alpha wave and its harmonics are of particular interest. The alpha frequency can vary over a few Hertz with age and from individual to individual. It is typically around 8 Hz for an adult. A number of adjacent frequencies were examined in the tests but 8, 4, and 20 Hz and their bifrequency combinations are selected for figures in this work. Only auto-bicoherence is reported in this study. A frequency of 8 Hz actually implies the frequency closest to it when the 128 point DFT is computed. This is the 5 -th frequency bin at 7.8125 Hz. Similarly 9 Hz refers to the closest DFT bin at 9.375 Hz.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the current}} state of relations between the United Kingdom (UK) government and its Overseas Territories, with a particular focus on the Caribbean territories, Bermuda and St Helena. Over the last two decades the general approach of successive UK governments towards its overseas territories and the decolonization agenda has remained fairly constant. Both Labour and Conservative administrations have made significant efforts to engage with the territories and offer them further, albeit limited, constitutional autonomy. Consequently, every territory under <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> the exception of Anguilla has adopted recently a new Constitution. But the UK has retained important powers of oversight, which it feels are necessary to make-sure its interests are properly safeguarded. Because of the constitutional model that the UK favours, and the lack of interest on all sides in moving towards either integration or independence, the territories remain on the UN list of non-self-governing territories. Rapid and fundamental change in the territories’ status is very unlikely, but initiatives such as political confidence-building measures, improving economic sustainability, and broadening political engagement can help advance the decolonization agenda, as set out by the UN...|$|R

Schmidt was a member of Carpenter's Union No. 4 and worked initially in a partnership with John H. Bertram as Schmidt & Bertram. Amelia L. Huschke was born near Davenport in 1866. The couple were married on November 26, 1889, at St. Margaret's Cathedral, and they lived in a house on Bridge Avenue with their three children. [...] They bought this property in 1891 and he built this house in 1895. The house served as the family's residence and as the base for Louis' business. The Schmidts lived in this house until the 1940s. Louis died in 1942 at 81 and Amelia died in 1957 at 91, and she out-lived her four children.

40|$|In this memo, I {{am going}} to discuss the effects of {{globalization}} {{on the distribution of}} income. While the term “globalization ” encompasses the various economic, political, cultural and social aspects of the many different types of international integration such as trade, capital mobility, labor migration etc, I will focus on what I consider the main component of globalization, namely freer trade. As I will argue in this memo, the predicted effects of trade on income distribution are dependent on the assumptions we make about intersectoral factor mobility in our models. In presence of costly intersectoral factor adjustments, the popular support for trade liberalization (or the opposition to it) in a country depends, among many things, on the degree to which people discount their future and on their perceived uncertainty about the future. How the support for reforms actually gets transformed into actual reforms depends on the political process. In this memo, I try to discuss all these issues and their implications for the nature of questions that should figure in the proposed survey. I start my <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> <b>with</b> the staple model of international trade theory, namely the Heckscher-Ohlin model. In this model, we assume perfect, intersectoral factor mobility along with perfect competition in all markets and constant returns to scale in production. Trade in this model help...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} work of “Luxury fashion : the role of {{innovation}} as a key contributing factor {{in the development of}} luxury fashion goods and sustainable fashion design” (Finn, 2011). The <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> begins <b>with</b> the observation that post consumer textile waste remains a major obstacle in realising a model of sustainable fashion design and production however, amongst the millions of tonnes of textile and clothing sent to landfill each year there is little evidence of authentic luxury branded goods ending life as landfill. The sustainable fashion movement often support approaches such as fashion up-cycle, re-cycle and cradle to cradle solutions. This paper argues that the priority should be to break the cycle of consumerism as an immediate intervention in ongoing unsustainable (and in some cases unethical) practices involved in the production of fashion goods. The connections between maker and consumer are explored through object analysis and the findings raise questions of the separation between luxury fashion goods and fashion goods that bear luxury fashion branding. This paper suggests that unethical and subversive exploitation of these connections may be used to promote increased consumerism {{while at the same time}} purporting exclusivity and superior craftsmanship...|$|R

After {{reviewing}} the general-relativistic “gap ” model of accretion, I discuss {{its relation to}} the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in low-mass X-ray binaries.

Back then, magnetic fields were all the rage. Gamma-ray bursts supposedly showed in their spectra cyclotron absorption lines suggesting (to many) that the sources are Galactic neutron stars, a view completely ruled out in the decade of Compton GRO, Beppo SAX and the observations of afterglows (described carefully in Dr. Fishman’s talk here in Elounda).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Rorty's view of {{the relation}} between religion and philosophical pluralism. The first section deals with monotheism in the context of Rorty's pluralist approach to truth. The <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> deals mainly <b>with</b> the reflexive stance towards belief that pluralism requires of the believer. The second section considers the way Rorty sketches the moral hopes embodied in pluralism, the basic kind of social relations that would typify a pluralist culture, and the capacity of monotheism to orient or sustain those relations. The general conclusion to be drawn from these considerations is that monotheism - at least in the sense Rorty gives to that term - is structurally at odds with pluralism in the ways Rorty suggests. In the third section, however, it is argued that Rorty's case is vitiated by its reliance on utilitarianism. Rorty invokes utilitarianism to show how religion can be made compatible with pluralism, but - as critics of utilitarianism have long argued - utilitarianism is badly suited to this purpose because it is insensitive to the specific normative content of religion. 16 page(s...|$|R
30|$|We have included, for <b>discussion</b> <b>here,</b> three {{thunderstorms}} <b>with</b> similar characteristics. Pawar et al. (2010) {{have reported}} the electrical characteristics {{of one such}} severe thunderstorm (which is included for analysis here). All these thunderstorms developed in late night hours and lasted for a short duration, and active phases of these thunderstorms lasted for less than 30  min. None of these thunderstorms produced severe weather - such as heavy winds, hails, heavy precipitation - at the ground. Upper air radiosonde observations made at 1730  hours around 30  km from the observational site on all these days showed that the CAPE was around 2, 000  J kg− 1 and level of free convection was at 800  m which are conducive for development of a thunderstorm. Although no radar observation is available, we could infer to some extent from observed electric field whether the storm remained stationary or not. Our observations indicate that the electric field induced by lightning remained similar {{up to the last}} observed lightning which suggests that these thunderstorms remained stationary overhead for most of their lifetime. By small thunderstorms, we mean storms of small duration.|$|R
40|$|Items arrive {{randomly}} at {{a production}} facility that {{functions as a}} single-server queueing system. The items might represent parts, raw material, etc. and the server might be a factory worker or a machine in a production line. Following service, items are placed in a buffer where they are accumulated before delivery to a customer or some downstream activity in a production line. In practice, the buffer {{might be called a}} hopper; it may {{take the form of a}} cart or a pallet moved by a forklift. For simplicity the <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> keeps <b>with</b> the cart terminology. The cart is delivered at times to be determined; during its absence the queue will in general grow by new arrivals. An item's average time in system, from arrival to delivery, is to be made small. The system must compromise between infrequent deliveries to avoid long delays in the queue and frequent deliveries to avoid long waits in the cart. This problem has a simple relation with standard batch-sizing problems in production scheduling. The cart delivery (batch-sizing) strategy considered here depends on two integers M and N. Delivery begins when N are in the cart or when the queue is empty and at least M are in the cart (M < N). Items are assumed to arrive by a Poisson process, and their service times have a general distribution. Generating functions are derived which determine probability distributions for the numbers k in the cart, q in the queue, and k + q in the system. Numerical results are given for special cases M = N, N = ∞, and M = 0. batch-sizing problems, production scheduling, queueing systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} novel world-line {{framework}} for computations of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Starting from the fermion determinant in the QCD effective action, we show explicitly how its real part {{can be expressed}} as a supersymmetric world-line action of spinning, colored, Grassmanian particles in background fields. Restricting ourselves for simplicity to spinning particles, we demonstrate how their constrained Hamiltonian dynamics arises for both massless and massive particles. In a semi-classical limit, this {{gives rise to the}} covariant generalization of the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation; the derivation of the corresponding Wong equations for colored particles is straightforward. In a previous letter we outlined how Berry's phase arises in a non-relativistic adiabatic limit for massive particles. We extend the <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> to systems <b>with</b> a finite chemical potential. We discuss a path integral formulation of the relative phase in the fermion determinant that places it on the same footing as the real part. We construct the corresponding anomalous world-line axial vector current and show in detail how the chiral anomaly appears. Our work provides a systematic framework for a relativistic kinetic theory of chiral fermions in the fluctuating topological backgrounds that generate the CME in a deconfined quark-gluon plasma. We outline some further applications of this framework in many-body systems. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
