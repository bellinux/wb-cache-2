5|$|After Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies {{also lost}} their final regular season game to Xavier, which left {{the two teams}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie</b> for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie.</b> So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie {{remained}} and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head {{back out on the}} road against the Bonnies.|$|E

5|$|Both leagues {{employ the}} same two-series playoff format, {{with the top}} three teams from each league {{participating}} in their own two-stage playoff. If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records, the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed {{to advance to the}} playoffs, unless if both teams finished with the same previous season record. The First Stage is a best-of-three series involving the regular season's second- and third-place finishers, with all games played at the second-place team's home field. The winner of this series goes on to face the league's pennant-winner in the Final Stage. This series is best-of-six. The league champion is awarded a one-win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series, unlike most professional leagues where a 5-game playoff series runs 2-2-1 or 2-3 or a 7-game playoff series that runs 2-3-2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game. The winning teams advance to the Japan Series, where they compete against one another. Unlike MLB, NPB games may end <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie</b> if there is no winner after 12innings of play. If a Climax Series game results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie,</b> the win is credited to neither team. If this causes the series to end <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tie,</b> the team who finished higher in the regular-season standings advances, unless if both teams finished with the same regular-season record. If both teams finished with the same regular season record, the team who won the most matches against the other team will advance.|$|E
