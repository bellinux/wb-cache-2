5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia {{are on the}} edge of their natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former is confined to Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution is confined to Scotland, although recent research suggests that it may be a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of horse}} and foot {{soldiers}} immersed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad {{themselves and their}} horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{near the}} British Isles on September6 as an extratropical storm, Danielle {{produced}} severe sea {{conditions on the}} western part of the isles. Major beach erosion was observed, and many people required rescuing. Coastal portions of Cornwall were evacuated as high waves inundated many homes, and an all-terrain police vehicle was shoved into the sea by a rogue wave in the Isles of Scilly. An 11‑year-old boy and his father were trapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea</b> cave on the north coast of Cornwall due to rough surf. Two other men from Port Isaac also became isolated in the same location after their boat capsized. All four were eventually rescued by a helicopter that hovered near the entrance of the sea cave. At the West Sands Caravan Park near Selsey, West Sussex, twelve families were evacuated to higher ground. A yacht filled with eight people ran aground near Calshot; they required rescuing by the Solent Coastguards. Flash flooding was reported throughout Wiltshire, especially in the city of Melksham. Numerous motorists were left stranded in inundated streets, while water entered several homes, store basements, a fire station, and the Cooper Avon Tyre Factory.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> this paper, <b>an</b> {{integrated}} {{model for the}} wave-induced <b>seabed</b> response <b>in</b> <b>a</b> porous <b>seabed</b> is proposed. Most previous studies have considered two-dimensional cases and <b>a</b> flat <b>seabed.</b> <b>In</b> this study, <b>a</b> full three-dimensional case is considered as well as <b>a</b> sloping <b>seabed.</b> The wave model (SWAN) and soil model (PORO-WSI) is coupled into one model. With the new model, the effects of wave and soil characteristics on the ocean waves-induced seabed response (including pore pressure and stresses) are investigated. Based on numerical results, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) {{the magnitude of the}} wave-induced soil response <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sloping <b>seabed</b> is much smaller than that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>seabed</b> (2) the wave-induced pore pressure decreases as the slope of the seabed increases.

40|$|AbstractExtreme waves can induce seepage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>seabed</b> {{and cause}} {{problems}} to marine structures in coastal regions. In this study, the seepage under cnoidal waves was studied using the transient seepage equation. An analytical solution is presented for the pore pressure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>seabed</b> of defined thickness. Parametric studies {{were carried out}} to examine the influence of air content in the pore water, and of the soil hydraulic conductivity on the seepage. It has been shown that the air content and the soil hydraulic conductivity can affect the pore pressure response significantly. An increase in the air content or <b>a</b> decrease <b>in</b> the soil hydraulic conductivity will increase the magnitude of the pore pressure gradient and results in the pore pressure varying sharply. The liquefaction potential of <b>a</b> <b>seabed</b> under cnoidal waves is discussed. Consequently, comparative studies are carried out to show that the soil shear modulus and Poisson constant can influence the difference between the transient seepage equation and Biot's equation, and the transient seepage equation is a limit of Biot's equation...|$|R
