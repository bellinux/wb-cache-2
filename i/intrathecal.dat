5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} locating {{the site of}} a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is <b>intrathecal</b> contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E
5|$|An <b>intrathecal</b> pump infuses an opioid such as {{morphine}} {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. <b>Intrathecal</b> saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases <b>intrathecal</b> injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
25|$|Ziconotide, a peptide {{compound}} {{derived from}} the omega-conotoxin, is a selective N-type calcium channel blocker that has potent analgesic properties that are equivalent to approximate 1,000 times that of morphine. It must be delivered via the <b>intrathecal</b> (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid) route via an <b>intrathecal</b> infusion pump.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cancer}} has {{central nervous system}} involvement, or with meningeal disease, <b>intrathecal</b> {{chemotherapy}} may be administered.|$|E
25|$|The most {{specific}} laboratory {{marker of}} MS reported to date, as of 2016, is the <b>intrathecal</b> MRZ (Measles, Rubella and Varicella) reaction showing 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya's invention, the Ommaya reservoir, was {{the first}} {{subcutaneous}} reservoir that allowed for repeated <b>intrathecal</b> injections. Before his invention patients had to suffer repeated lumbar punctures for <b>intrathecal</b> drug administration. Spinal angiography was pioneered by Ommaya, Di Chiro, and Doppman. This work allowed for the visualization of arteries and veins and allowed for understanding of spinal cord arteriography. The same team reported the treatment of spinal cord AVMs by percutaneous embolization of an intercostal artery using stainless steel pellets. This {{was one of the}} first reports of interventional neuroradiology.|$|E
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{reactions}} to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the <b>intrathecal</b> route (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), which include myelopathies and leucoencephalopathies. It has {{a variety of}} cutaneous side effects, particularly when administered in high doses.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{unprecedented}} {{collaboration between}} individual physicians and {{parents of children}} afflicted with NPC, approximately 15 patients worldwide have received HPbCD cyclodextrin therapy under compassionate use treatment protocols. Treatment involves a combination of intravenous therapy (IV), <b>intrathecal</b> therapy (IT) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) cyclodextrin therapy.|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate can {{be given}} by mouth or by {{injection}} (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or <b>intrathecal).</b> Doses by mouth are usually taken weekly, not daily, to limit toxicity. Routine monitoring of the complete blood count, liver function tests, and creatinine are recommended. Measurements of creatinine are recommended at least every 2 months.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} that {{quantification}} of several immune cell subsets, both in blood and CSF, showed differences between <b>intrathecal</b> (from the spine) and systemic immunity, and between CSF cell subtypes in the inflammatory and noninflammatory groups (basically RRMS/SPMS compared to PPMS). This showed that some patients diagnosed with PPMS shared an inflammatory profile with RRMS and SPMS, while others didn't.|$|E
25|$|Medications that {{impede the}} release of {{excitatory}} neurotransmitters {{have been used to}} control or prevent spasms. Treatment with <b>intrathecal</b> baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, decreases muscle tone and has been shown to decrease the frequency of muscle spasms in ADCP patients. Tetrabenazine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Huntington's disease, {{has been shown to be}} effective treating chorea.|$|E
25|$|At {{least five}} {{characteristics}} {{are present in}} CNS tissues of MS patients: Inflammation beyond classical white matter lesions, <b>intrathecal</b> Ig production with oligoclonal bands, an environment fostering immune cell persistence, Follicle-like aggregates in the meninges and a disruption of the blood–brain barrier also outside of active lesions. The scars that give the name to the condition are produced by the astrocyte cells healing old lesions.|$|E
25|$|On December 25, 2010, the FDA granted {{approval}} for HPbCD {{to be delivered}} via IV to an additional patient, Peyton Hadley, aged 13, under an IND through Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford, Oregon. Soon after in March 2011, approval was sought for similar treatment of his sibling, Kayla, age 11, and infusions of HPbCD began shortly after. Both have since begun <b>intrathecal</b> treatments beginning in January 2012.|$|E
25|$|Particularly {{to prevent}} the {{medication}} errors in {{the perspective of the}} <b>intrathecal</b> administration of local anaesthetics, there is a proposal to change the presentation and packaging of the appliances and agents used for this purpose. One spinal needle with a syringe prefilled with the local anaesthetic agents may be marketed in a single blister pack, which will be peeled open and presented before the anaesthesiologist conducting the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya first {{reported}} the Ommaya reservoir in 1963. The reservoir is subcutaneous implant for repeated <b>intrathecal</b> injections, to treat hydrocephalus and malignant tumors. The reservoir {{was the first}} medical port to use silicone which is biologically inert and self-sealing. The Ommaya reservoir allows delivery of intermittent bolus injections for chemotherapy to the tumor bed. Agents are injected percutaneously into the reservoir and delivered to the tumor by compression of the reservoir. The Ommaya reservoir provided a great improvement for treatment which {{reduces the risk of}} infection.|$|E
25|$|On May 17, 2010, the FDA granted Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin {{orphan drug}} status and {{designated}} HPbCD cyclodextrin {{as a potential}} treatment for Niemann–Pick type C disease. On July 14, 2010, Dr. Caroline Hastings of UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland filed additional applications with the FDA requesting approval to deliver HPbCD directly into the central nervous systems of the twins {{in an attempt to}} help HPbCD cross the blood–brain barrier. The request was approved by the FDA on September 23, 2010, and bi-monthly <b>intrathecal</b> injections of HPbCD into the spine were administered starting in October 2010.|$|E
25|$|GABAA agonists, usually {{diazepam}} {{but sometimes}} other benzodiazepines, {{are the primary}} treatment for SPS. Drugs that increase GABA activity alleviate muscle stiffness caused {{by a lack of}} GABAergic tone. They increase pathways that are dependent upon GABA and have muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects, often providing symptom relief. Because the condition worsens over time, patients generally require increased dosages, leading to more side effects. For this reason, gradual increase in dosage of benzodiazepines is indicated. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, is generally used when individuals taking high doses of benzodiazepines have high side effects. In some cases it has shown improvements in electrophysiological and muscle stiffness when administered intravenously. <b>Intrathecal</b> baclofen administration may not have long-term benefits though, and there are potential serious side effects.|$|E
25|$|Overdoses with {{lidocaine}} can be {{a result}} of excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children who are more susceptible to overdose, accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, <b>intrathecal,</b> or paracervical) injection, or prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgical procedures. These occurrences have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. It is important in the interpretation of analytical results to recognize that lidocaine is often routinely administered intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parental feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more commonplace {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
25|$|The genus Exserohilum {{comprises}} dematiaceous fungi {{commonly associated}} with foliar plant diseases and rarely with human and animal phaeohyphomycosis. Fungi of this genus are characterized {{by the presence of}} melanin in their cell walls, which is thought to contribute to their virulence. Many Exserohilum species are plant pathogens that affect a wide range of plant species, especially grasses Poaceae, causing distinct leaf spots and blights. However, S. rostrata has also been shown to survive in human as well as animal hosts, indicating pathogenic versatility. Though E. rostratum is a rare cause of infection in people, the species can cause a spectrum of diseases including allergic fungal sinusitis, skin and subcutaneous infections, invasive disease and occasionally keratomycosis an inflammation of the cornea. Invasive and skin infections caused by Exserohilum occur more frequently in those that are immunodeficient or have impaired immunity, these include infections in the sinuses, lungs, lining of the heart, and bone. Whereas, local trauma is a predisposing factor for skin and corneal infections. Meningitis and peripheral arthritides have also been reported pursuant to exposure to contaminated <b>intrathecal</b> drugs.|$|E
500|$|Some {{anaesthetics}} {{and chemotherapy}} are injected intrathecally into the subarachnoid space, where they {{spread around the}} CSF, meaning substances that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier can still be active throughout the central nervous system. [...] Baricity refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid and is used in general anesthesia to determine {{the manner in which}} a particular drug will spread in the <b>intrathecal</b> space.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intrathecal</b> pumps deliver {{medication}} {{directly to}} the fluid filled (subarachnoid) space surrounding the spinal cord. Opioids alone or opioids with adjunctive medication (either a local anesthetic or clonidine) or more recently ziconotide are infused. [...] Complications such as serious infection (meningitis), urinary retention, hormonal disturbance and <b>intrathecal</b> granuloma formation have been noted with <b>intrathecal</b> infusion.|$|E

2500|$|Given that OCBs are not pathogenic, their {{remaining}} importance {{is to demonstrate}} the production of <b>intrathecal</b> immunoglobins (IgGs) against debris, but this can be shown by other methods. Specially interesting are the free light chains (FLC), specially the kappa-FLCs (kFLCs). Free kappa chains in CSF have been proposed as a marker for MS evolution ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas {{a variety}} of Solanum species {{containing}} potent tropane alkaloids were used for anesthesia. In 13th century Italy, Theodoric Borgognoni used similar mixtures along with opiates to induce unconsciousness, and treatment with the combined alkaloids proved a mainstay of anesthesia until the nineteenth century. [...] Local anesthetics were used in Inca civilization where shamans chewed coca leaves and performed operations on the skull while spitting into the wounds they had inflicted to anesthetize. Cocaine was later isolated {{and became the first}} effective local anesthetic. [...] It was first used in 1859 by Karl Koller, at the suggestion of Sigmund Freud, in eye surgery in 1884. German surgeon August Bier (1861–1949) was the first to use cocaine for <b>intrathecal</b> anesthesia in 1898. Romanian surgeon Nicolae Racoviceanu-Piteşti (1860–1942) was the first to use opioids for <b>intrathecal</b> analgesia; he presented his experience in Paris in 1901.|$|E
2500|$|On the whole, oral {{fluconazole}} and intravenous amphotericin B {{are used}} in progressive or disseminated disease, or in immunocompromised individuals. Amphotericin B {{used to be the}} only available treatment, although now there are alternatives, including itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used for milder disease. Fluconazole is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. <b>Intrathecal</b> or intraventricular amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis. [...] Because the symptoms of valley fever are similar to the common flu and other respiratory diseases, it is important for public health professionals {{to be aware of the}} rise of valley fever and the specifics of diagnosis. [...] Greyhound dogs often get valley fever as well, and their treatment regimen involves 6–12 months of Ketoconazole, to be taken with food.|$|E
50|$|Systemic (intravenous or oral) {{chemotherapy}} and <b>intrathecal</b> chemotherapy: <b>Intrathecal</b> therapy is when injection is done {{directly to the}} spinal cord into the sub-arachnoid space to avoid the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) and gain {{direct access to the}} CSF. <b>Intrathecal</b> Therapy is preferred since intravenous chemotherapy do not penetrate the BBB. The most common chemicals used are liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) and <b>intrathecal</b> methotrexate (MTX).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Intrathecal</b> protocols. One of the {{difficulties}} with brain and spinal tumors is that the blood brain barrier needs to be crossed so that the drug {{can get to the}} tumor. One mechanism to deliver the drug is through a device called an Ommaya reservoir. This is a device which shares some characteristics with a shunt in which a tube a surgically placed in the fluid surrounding the brain and a bulb shaped reservoir attached to the tubing is placed under the skin of the scalp. When the child is to receive <b>intrathecal</b> chemotherapy, the drug is administered into this bulb reservoir. At other times <b>intrathecal</b> chemotherapeutic agents are delivered through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap). A current Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium Protocol uses <b>intrathecal</b> mafosfamide, a pre-activated cyclophosphamide derivative, in addition to other modalities to try to effect this tumor.|$|E
