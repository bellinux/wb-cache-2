5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E

All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in {{an attack on the}} plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment.

30|$|However, a nonlocal reaction–diffusion {{equation}} with nonlinear absorption and {{coupled with}} nonlinear nonlocal Neumann boundary condition, to our knowledge, {{has not been}} well studied. Furthermore, because this kind of problem is widely used in physics and engineering, {{it is necessary to}} study it. Motivated by those of the above works, we will get blow-up and global existence criteria for problem (1.1) with nonlinear absorption and nonlocal nonlinear Neumann boundary, which are not only different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> with <b>the</b> Dirichlet boundary condition, but also different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> with problem (1.7)–(1.9) without absorption term. We will show that the nonlinear absorption and the nonlinear term u^l(y, t) in the boundary condition of (1.1) play substantial roles in determining whether a solution blows up or not. In fact, we will prove that if p+q< m, l≤ 1, the solution exists globally for any k(x,y) and any nonnegative initial data. We notice that if p+q>m> 1, l> 0, a blow-up occurs in finite time if the initial data u_ 0 (x) satisfies ∫_Ωu_ 0 (x)φ (x) dx> 1. We also find that if p+q=m> 1, then problem (1.1)–(1.3) has blow-up solutions in finite time as well as global solutions.|$|R

25|$|Capital {{intensive}} companies, {{particularly high}} tech companies, always {{need to raise}} high volumes of capital in their early stages. For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges {{has been one of}} the most important funding sources for many capital intensive startups. After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company already has products in the market and is generating sales and earnings, or the company has completed advanced promising clinical trials, earned potentially profitable patents or conducted market research which demonstrated very positive outcomes. This is quite different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) went public in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world, in the total absence of sales, earnings and any well-documented promising outcome.
