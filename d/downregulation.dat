5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine. Prenatal cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain. This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent <b>downregulation.</b> Therefore, in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550mg/m², 18% when the dose is 551–600mg/m² and 36% when the dose exceeds 600mg/m². There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress, <b>downregulation</b> of genes for contractile proteins, and p53 mediated apoptosis. The drug dexrazoxane is used to mitigate doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect <b>downregulation</b> of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the <b>downregulation</b> was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
25|$|C-terminal {{involved}} in <b>downregulation</b> of DNA binding {{of the central}} domain: residues 356-393.|$|E
25|$|During {{withdrawal}} from full or partial agonists, changes occur in benzodiazepine receptor with upregulation of some receptor subtypes and <b>downregulation</b> of other receptor subtypes.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the <b>downregulation</b> of KCC2 observed following neuronal trauma, and the consequent depolarizing shift of GABAA-mediated synapses, may be an aspect of neuronal de-differentiation. De-differentiation of damaged portions {{of the nervous system}} would allow for neuronal networks to return to higher levels of plasticity in order to rewire of surviving neurons to compensate for damage in the network. In addition, reduced glutamatergic transmission upon KCC2 <b>downregulation</b> may serve as a homeostatic process to compensate for the reduced GABA transmission due to altered chloride extrusion.|$|E
25|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are members}} of non-coding RNAs that {{range in size from}} 17 to 25 nucleotides. miRNAs {{regulate}} a large variety of biological functions in plants and animals. So far, in 2013, about 2000 miRNAs have been discovered in humans and these can be found online in a miRNA database. Each miRNA expressed in a cell may target about 100 to 200 messenger RNAs that it downregulates. Most of the <b>downregulation</b> of mRNAs occurs by causing the decay of the targeted mRNA, while some <b>downregulation</b> occurs at the level of translation into protein.|$|E
25|$|Both {{in vitro}} and in vivo, ROS {{have been shown}} to induce {{transcription}} factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis (MMP, VEGF) and metastasis (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and <b>downregulation</b> of PTEN).|$|E
25|$|<b>Downregulation</b> of miR-181 family {{contributes}} to aggressive leukemia phenotype through mechanisms {{related to the}} activation pathways of innate immunity mediated by toll-like receptors TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 and interleukin-1β IL1B (humans on chromose 2).|$|E
25|$|The exudate of {{the larvae}} {{themselves}} also contains antibacterial substances, with activity peaking at hatching and declining as the larvae age. Rfemoving parents {{results in a}} <b>downregulation</b> of antibacterial effort, possibly due {{to the need to}} invest energy in other more important tasks that arise due to parental absence.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{substituted}} imidazoles, including clotrimazole, are selective inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, {{which makes them}} interesting drug targets in inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and tumors of the nervous system. Other biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the <b>downregulation</b> of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with translation initiation.|$|E
25|$|PEDF {{expression}} is upregulated by plasminogen kringle domains 1-4 (also known as angiostatin) and the kringle 5 (K5) domain. Hypoxia, or low oxygen conditions, {{leads to the}} <b>downregulation</b> of PEDF. This effect is due to hypoxic conditions causing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to proteolytically degrade PEDF. In addition, amyloid beta {{has been shown to}} decrease PEDF mRNA levels.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, salvinorin A shows {{atypical}} properties as an agonist of the KOR {{relative to}} other KOR agonists. For instance, it is 40-fold less potent in promoting internalization (that is, receptor <b>downregulation)</b> of the human KOR relative to the prototypical KOR agonist U-50488.The drug has been found not to produce diuresis in mice, possibly due to its short duration.|$|E
25|$|Due to its partial agonistic activity, THC {{appears to}} result in greater <b>downregulation</b> of {{cannabinoid}} receptors than endocannabinoids, further limiting its efficacy over other cannabinoids. While tolerance may limit the maximal effects of certain drugs, evidence suggests that tolerance develops irregularly for different effects with greater resistance for primary over side-effects, and may actually serve to enhance the drug's therapeutic window. However, this form of tolerance appears to be irregular throughout mouse brain areas.|$|E
25|$|Some {{drugs are}} {{specifically}} directed against dividing cells. They {{can be used}} against tumors and viral diseases (both against retrovirus and against other virus), as the diseased cells replicate much more frequently than normal cells and also against some non-malignant diseases related to excessively rapid cell replication (for instance psoriasis). It {{has been suggested that}} the antiviral and anti-cancer activity of thymidine analogues is, at least partly, achieved by <b>downregulation</b> of mitochondrial thymidine kinase.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to cyclin dependent kinases {{a new round}} of replication is thought to be prevented through the <b>downregulation</b> of Cdt1. This is achieved via degradation of Cdt1 as well as through the inhibitory actions of a protein known as geminin. Geminin binds tightly to Cdt1 and is thought to be the major inhibitor of re-replication. Geminin first appears in S-phase and is degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition, possibly through ubiquination by anaphase promoting complex (APC).|$|E
25|$|Anti-TNF {{therapy has}} shown only modest effects in cancer therapy. Treatment of renal cell {{carcinoma}} with infliximab resulted in prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients. Etanercept was tested for treating patients with breast cancer and ovarian cancer showing prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients via <b>downregulation</b> of IL-6 and CCL2. On the other hand, adding infliximab or etanercept to gemcitabine for treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer {{was not associated with}} differences in efficacy when compared with placebo.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to most other cancers, adrenocortical neoplasms {{appear to have}} decreased expression of H19. To determine a possible cause for the <b>downregulation</b> of H19, Gao et al. studied the methylation of 12 CpG sites in the H19 promoter in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals. They found that in carcinomas, there was more methylation of CpGs than in normal, hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals. Consequently, normal H19 expression was detectable in normal and hyperplasia adrenals, but in carcinomas and surprisingly, adenomas, there was a lower H19 expression that was coupled with detectable (increased) IGF2 expression.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that introgressed Neanderthal genes exhibit cis-regulatory effects in modern humans, {{contributing}} to the genomic complexity and phenotype variation of modern humans. Looking at heterozygous individuals (carrying both Neanderthal and modern human versions of a gene), the allele-specific expression of introgressed Neanderthal alleles was found to be significantly lower in the brain and testes relative to other tissues. In the brain, this was most pronounced at the cerebellum and basal ganglia. This <b>downregulation</b> suggests that modern humans and Neanderthals possibly experienced a relative higher rate of divergence in these specific tissues.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{responses}} to triggers such as TNF-α involve macrophages with components that include miR-155. miR-155 is overexpressed in atopic dermatitis {{and contributes to}} chronic skin inflammation by increasing the proliferative response of T(H) cells through the <b>downregulation</b> of CTLA-4. In Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, miR-155 showed higher expression in patients' tissues and synovial fibroblasts. In multiple sclerosis, increased expression of mir-155 has also been measured in peripheral and CNS-resident myeloid cells, including circulating blood monocytes and activated microglia. It was also found that mir-155 is implicated in inflammation. Overexpression of mir-155 will lead to chronic inflammatory state in human.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to other}} GABAA {{receptor}} positive allosteric modulators such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol, tolerance {{has been found}} to develop with exposure to increased levels of allopregnanolone and related inhibitory neurosteroids. This includes <b>downregulation</b> and desensitization of the GABAA receptor, reduced effects of allopregnanolone and other GABAA receptor activators (e.g., GABA and benzodiazepines), and rebound or withdrawal effects upon falls in allopregnanolone levels. Moreover, changes in allopregnanolone levels have been implicated in adverse neuropsychiatric effects associated with the menstrual cycle (e.g., dysphoria, depression, anxiety, irritability) and postpartum period (e.g., postpartum depression), as well as in catamenial epilepsy (seizures).|$|E
25|$|Dysregulation of IGFBP-3 {{has been}} implicated in many cancers. IGFBP-3 is {{sometimes}} referred to as a tumor suppressor, and <b>downregulation</b> of its tissue expression by promoter hypermethylation in some cancers, such as hepatoma. and non-small cell lung cancer may be associated with poor patient outcome. However, consistent with the dual inhibitory and stimulatory roles of IGFBP-3 seen in cell culture, there are other cancer types, such as breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and clear cell renal cell cancer in which high tissue IGFBP-3 expression has been linked to poor prognostic features or patient outcome. The mechanisms regulating these contrasting effects of IGFBP-3 in vivo are not well understood.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and <b>downregulation</b> of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} could {{give rise to}} {{neuronal}} or glial progenitors, {{depending on the type}} of signals that they receive - gliogenic or neurogenic signals, respectively. Glial progenitor cells could differentiate into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. However, lineage commitment of neural progenitors involves the suppression of alternative fates. Therefore, vertebrate proneural genes promote neuronal fates and simultaneously inhibit glial fates. For example, the <b>downregulation</b> of the expression of proneural gene ngn2 in the spinal cord represses oligodendrocyte differentiation. In the context of restricted glial progenitors, proneural genes might have functions that are distinct from their better-characterized role in lineage specification, perhaps in the differentiation of glial lineages.|$|E
25|$|Kcne2-/- mice exhibit achlorhydria, gastric hyperplasia, and mis-trafficking of KCNQ1 to the parietal cell basal membrane. The mis-trafficking {{occurs because}} KCNE3 is {{upregulated}} in the parietal cells of Kcne2-/- mice, and hijacks KCNQ1, {{taking it to}} the basolateral membrane. When both Kcne2 and Kcne3 are germline-deleted in mice, KCNQ1 traffics to the parietal cell apical membrane but the gastric phenotype is even worse than for Kcne2-/- mice, emphasizing that KCNQ1 requires KCNE2 co-assembly for functional attributes other than targeting in parietal cells. Kcne2-/- mice also develop gastritis cystica profunda and gastric neoplasia. Human KCNE2 <b>downregulation</b> is also observed in sites of gastritis cystica profunda and gastric adenocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Levels of FOXP2 {{in adult}} zebra finches are {{significantly}} higher when males direct their song to females {{than when they}} sing song in other contexts. “Directed” singing refers to when a male is singing to a female usually for a courtship display. “Undirected” singing occurs when for example, a male sings when other males are present or is alone. Studies have found that FoxP2 levels {{vary depending on the}} social context. When the birds were singing undirected song, there was a decrease in of FoxP2 expression in Area X. This <b>downregulation</b> was not observed and FoxP2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song.|$|E
25|$|The double {{positive}} thymocytes undergo lineage commitment, maturing into a CD8+ T cell (recognising MHC class I) or a CD4+ T cell (recognising MHC class II). Lineage commitment {{occurs at}} the late stage of positive selection and works by <b>downregulation</b> of both CD4 and CD8 (reducing the signal from the T cell receptor) and then upregulation of CD4 only. Thymocytes that start receiving signal again are those that recognise MHC class II, and they become CD4+ T cells. Thymocytes that do not start receiving signal again are those that recognize MHC class I, and they downregulate CD4 and upregulate CD8, to become CD8+ T cells. Both of these thymocytes types are known as single positive thymocytes.|$|E
25|$|Recently, new {{findings}} have emerged that suggest a novel mechanism of teratogenicity. Cereblon is a 51 kDa protein localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and peripheral membrane of cells in numerous {{parts of the}} body. It acts {{as a component of}} the E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulating various developmental processes, including embryogenesis, carcinogenesis and cell cycle regulation, through degradation (ubiquitination) of unknown substrates. Thalidomide has been shown to bind to cereblon, inhibiting the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in accumulation of the ligase substrates and <b>downregulation</b> of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and FGF10. This disrupts the positive feedback loop between the two growth factors, possibly causing both multiple birth defects and anti-myeloma effects.|$|E
25|$|Even during digestion, in general, one or {{two hours}} {{following}} a meal, insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous, but oscillates with a period of 3–6minutes, changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 pmol/l to less than 100 pmol/l. This is thought to avoid <b>downregulation</b> of insulin receptors in target cells, and to assist the liver in extracting insulin from the blood. This oscillation {{is important to consider}} when administering insulin-stimulating medication, since it is the oscillating blood concentration of insulin release, which should, ideally, be achieved, not a constant high concentration. This may be achieved by delivering insulin rhythmically to the portal vein or by islet cell transplantation to the liver.|$|E
25|$|Receptor {{desensitization}} {{is mediated}} {{through a combination}} phosphorylation, β-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. <b>Downregulation</b> occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a lysosome. Because lysosomal membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many degradative enzymes, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a lysosome, detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends {{on a variety of}} factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis of response to herbivory is being explored in tall fescue, where it appears the production of jasmonic acid {{may play a role in}} <b>downregulation</b> of the host plant’s chemical defense pathways when a fungal endophyte is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, especially in regards to understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|BPV-4 causes {{squamous}} cell carcinomas of the alimentary tract, and BPV-1/2 causes carcinomas and haemangioendotheliomas of the urinary bladder, {{in both cases}} in animals that have fed on bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Such cancers are common in locations where grazing land is infested with bracken, such as the western Scottish Highlands, southern Italy and the Nasampolai Valley in Kenya. Bracken contains several immunosuppressants and mutagens, including quercetin and ptaquiloside. Consumption of large quantities by cattle leads to an acute poisoning syndrome with symptoms of bone marrow depletion, while at lower levels of long-term consumption it acts as a cancer cofactor. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process; tumours also contain activated Ras, as well as mutation or <b>downregulation</b> of the tumour suppressor genes p53 in alimentary tract cancers and fragile histidine tetrads (FHIT) in urinary bladder cancers. Viral particles are not produced in either alimentary tract or urinary bladder tumours.|$|E
25|$|Not all proneural {{genes are}} equally {{sensitive}} to lateral inhibition. For example, in Xenopus, Chitnis and Kintner demonstrated that ‘’XASH-3’’ and NeuroD (achaete-scute complex) respond differently to lateral inhibition, which reflect different ability to activate target genes and differential susceptibility of these target genes to repression by notch. Posterior studies revealed {{that even when}} Notch/Delta signaling pathway is blocked, Wnt2b is capable of inhibiting neuronal differentiation, through the <b>downregulation</b> of mRNA expression of multiple proneural genes and also of Notch1. With this mechanism Wnt2b maintains progenitor cells undifferentiated by attenuating the expression of proneural and neurogenic genes, preventing cells from getting into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch. Although notch signaling {{is involved in the}} control of proneural gene expression, positive-feedback loops are required to increase or maintain the levels of proneural genes. The transcription factors responsible for this maintenance can act through the inhibition of the notch signaling pathway in particular cells or at a post-transcriptional level, affecting proneural genes transcription and function.|$|E
500|$|TGF-beta is a {{regulator}} {{of tissue}} remodeling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in development, and promotes metastasis in cancer. [...] A {{number of studies}} have identified NEDD9 as a downstream effector in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, essential for promoting EMT. In MCF-7 cells, NEDD9 negatively regulates expression of the epithelial protein E-cadherin, preventing association of E-cadherin with cell membrane and activating SRC-kinase. Activated SRC provides internalization and lysosomal degradation of E-cadherin. Consistent with these findings is a study demonstrating <b>downregulation</b> of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, occludin, β-catenin) and concurrent upregulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin) in response to NEDD9 overexpression in MCF-10 cells.|$|E
