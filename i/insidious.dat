5|$|The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu (Summer-Fall 1911) (US Title: The <b>Insidious</b> Dr. Fu-Manchu).|$|E
5|$|Gun control enactments {{adopted in}} the {{following}} three decades focused on banning of <b>insidious</b> weapons such as daggers or rifles hidden in walking sticks. Despite having been already banned under the 1727 law, foreword to 1820 enactment lamented their widespread presence among population both within cities {{as well as in}} the countryside.|$|E
5|$|The {{young men}} and women of Hazelwood East {{expected}} a civics lesson, but not the one the Court teaches them today...Such unthinking contempt for individual rights is intolerable from any state official. It is particularly <b>insidious</b> from (a school principal) to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an appreciation for the cherished democratic liberties that our constitution guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, set 18 months after, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack is {{believed}} to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the American government. The acquisition of nerve gas by the terrorists poses a new threat, and Jack discovers an <b>insidious</b> conspiracy while trying to stop those responsible.|$|E
5|$|As Link and his clones {{wander the}} overworld of Hyrule Field on {{their quest to}} restore peace to Hyrule, they learn that the {{creation}} of Link's evil counterpart and the release of Vaati is only a small part in an <b>insidious</b> plot to take control of Hyrule. Things complicate as the dimension of the Dark World appears and people are being abducted throughout Hyrule. The four Links learn that not only have the knights of Hyrule mysteriously disappeared, but evil versions of them have been creating havoc. Hyrule castle has been taken over and monsters are appearing everywhere. The four Links agree that they will defeat Vaati, and then rescue Zelda to restore peace to Hyrule.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The New York Times Book Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and <b>insidious.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are <b>insidious</b> liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and <b>insidious</b> weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century {{and dealt with}} illegal use of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.|$|E
5|$|More than 100 insect species prey on H. zea, usually {{feeding on}} eggs and larvae. The <b>insidious</b> flower bug (Orius insidiosus), a pirate bug, feeds on the eggs of H. zea, thus {{acting as a}} {{biological}} control agent. Some plants emit a blend of chemicals in response to damage from H. zea, which attract parasitic insects. Cardiochiles nigriceps, a solitary endoparasitoid wasp, makes use of these volatile plant compounds to identify the presence of H. zea. When the wasps find damaged host plants, they hover around and then search for the host with their antennae. When the females find their prey, they use their antennae to position themselves and deposit eggs into the host. The braconid wasp Microplitis croceipes, which deposits its eggs inside a living caterpillar, {{is also an important}} parasitoid of both H. zea and the related species Heliothis virescens. When larval densities are high, a fungal pathogen, Nomuraea rileyi, can cause an outbreak of disease. However, pupal mortality is high not because of predators, but because of harsh weather conditions, collapsing pupal chambers, and disease.|$|E
5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in the field of view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is <b>insidious</b> for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Phosgene is an <b>insidious</b> poison as {{the odor}} {{may not be}} noticed and {{symptoms}} may be slow to appear.|$|E
25|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Diaghilev stayed abroad. The new Soviet regime, once {{it became}} obvious that he could not be lured back, {{condemned}} him in perpetuity as an especially <b>insidious</b> example of bourgeois decadence. Soviet art historians wrote him out of the picture for more than 60 years.|$|E
25|$|In DIC, the {{underlying}} cause usually leads to symptoms and signs, and DIC is discovered on laboratory testing. The onset of DIC can be sudden, as in endotoxic shock or amniotic fluid embolism, {{or it may be}} <b>insidious</b> and chronic, as in cancer. DIC can lead to multiorgan failure and widespread bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Another less <b>insidious</b> tactic {{journals}} employ is {{to publish}} {{a large portion of}} its papers, or at least the papers expected to be highly cited, early in the calendar year. This gives those papers more time to gather citations. Several methods, not necessarily with nefarious intent, exist for a journal to cite articles in the same journal which will increase the journal's impact factor.|$|E
25|$|Krause {{publicly}} portrayed Jackson as a two-faced {{character who}} {{had very little}} regard for his assistant coaches, a perception that certain Krause associates in the Bulls organization had sought to spread about Jackson. At {{the height of the}} hard feelings in the spring of 1998, one of Krause's scouts went to press row in Chicago's United Center to explain to a reporter the <b>insidious</b> nature of Jackson's ego (excerpt from the Phil Jackson biography Mindgames).|$|E
25|$|Clinically, the <b>insidious</b> {{increase}} in the number and size of renal cysts translates as a progressive increment in kidney volume. Trail-blazing studies led by Mayo Clinic professionals established that the total kidney volume (TKV) in a large cohort of ADPKD patients was 1060 Â± 642ml with a mean increase of 204ml over three years, or 5.27% per year in the natural course of the disease, among other important, novel findings that were extensively studied for the first time.|$|E
25|$|DIC {{does not}} occur by itself but only as a complicating factor from another {{underlying}} condition, usually in those with a critical illness. The combination of widespread loss of tissue blood flow and simultaneous bleeding leads to {{an increased risk of}} death in addition to that posed by the underlying disease. DIC can be overt and severe in some cases, but milder and <b>insidious</b> in others. The diagnosis of DIC depends on the findings of characteristic laboratory tests and clinical background. Treatment is mainly geared towards the underlying condition.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{clogging}} {{is particularly}} <b>insidious,</b> {{as it is}} usually not discovered immediately, but only later by an unsuspecting user trying to flush a loaded toilet. Overflowing of the water mixed with excrement may then occur, depending on the bowl volume, tank capacity and severity of clogging. For this reason, rooms with flush toilets may be designed as wet rooms, with a second drain on the floor, and a shower head capable of reaching the whole floor area. Common means to remedy clogging include use of a toilet plunger, drain cleaner or a plumber's snake.|$|E
25|$|Hepatic reactions, {{including}} hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, {{chronic active hepatitis}}, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely. The {{onset of}} chronic active hepatitis may be <b>insidious,</b> and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests that would indicate liver injury. These reactions usually occur after exposure to the drug for more than 6 weeks. If signs of liver failure are observed in a patient taking nitrofurantoin, the drug should be discontinued. Re-challenge with the drug {{at a later date}} is not recommended, as the reaction may have a hypersensitivity component and recur when the drug is resumed.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifespan}} {{of patients}} with NPC is usually related {{to the age of}} onset. Children with antenatal or infantile onset usually succumb in the first few months or years of life, whereas adolescent and adult onset forms of NiemannâPick type C have a more <b>insidious</b> onset and slower progression, and affected individuals may survive to the seventh decade. Adult cases of NPC are being recognized with increasing frequency. It is suspected that many patients affected by NPC are undiagnosed, owing to lack of awareness of the disease and the absence of readily available screening or diagnostic tests. For the same reasons the diagnosis is often delayed by many years.|$|E
25|$|This anticlericalism was {{not left}} unanswered. The {{leader of the}} {{conservative}} Calvinists, Gisbertus Voetius, published {{the first volume of}} his Politica Ecclesiastica in 1663, in which he attacked (in Latin) De Witt and the Erastian policies of the regents. Possibly by Voetius also, but in any case by someone close to him, was the Resurrected Barnevelt, in which the anonymous writer, writing in Dutch, attacked the provincial-supremacy doctrine and the prayer formulary as an <b>insidious</b> attempt to make the other six provinces subservient to Holland. To which possibly De Witt himself replied with a scalding pamphlet, entitled Schotschen Duyvel in which he denounced Voetius by name as a master-mutineer.|$|E
25|$|The radical discipleship {{interpretation}} {{asserts that}} the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i.e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society. In this interpretation the primary agenda {{of the book is}} to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom. The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values â imperialism, nationalism, and civil religion being the most dangerous and <b>insidious.</b>|$|E
25|$|The German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union began on June 22, 1941. A decree from the Presidium of the Executive Committee {{on the same day}} forbade the entry or exit from the USSR's border regions, which were under a state of martial law. Such mandates demonstrated the Soviets' fear of spreading panic and their commitment to asserting direct state control over wartime relocations to maintain order. Soviet wartime population policy consisted of two distinct operations: deportation and evacuation. Deportation aimed to clear regions near the front of potentially <b>insidious</b> anti-Soviet elements that could hamper the war effort, while evacuation policy aimed to move Soviet industry and intelligentsia to the rear, where they would be safe.|$|E
25|$|Mom (Tress MacNeille) â Mom is the malevolent, foul-mouthed, cruel, and narcissistic {{owner of}} MomCorp, the thirty-first century's largest {{shipping}} and manufacturing company, with {{a monopoly on}} robots. In public, she maintains {{the image of a}} sweet, kindly old woman by speaking in stereotypically antiquated statements and wearing a mechanical fat suit. She occasionally launches <b>insidious</b> plans for world domination and corporate takeover. She has a romantic history with the Professor which left her bitter and resentful. She has three bumbling sons, Walt, Larry, and Igner (modeled after The Three Stooges), who do her bidding despite frequent abuse, and often infuriate her with their incompetence. In , it is revealed that Igner's father is Professor Farnsworth.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{diabetes}} is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs {{are twice as}} likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are also more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles. The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be <b>insidious.</b> Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.|$|E
25|$|In the Soviet 1982 miniseries Niccolo Paganini the {{musician}} is portrayed by the Armenian actor Vladimir Msryan. The series focuses on Paganini's {{relationship with the}} Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, plays Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an <b>insidious</b> Jesuit official. The information in the series is generally spurious and it also plays {{to some of the}} myths and legends rampant during {{the musician}}'s lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity. He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.|$|E
25|$|The next leg of {{the journey}} takes the prince into a deep forest {{inhabited}} by the evil SpÃ¢nul, or Bald Man. There follow three consecutive encounters between the protagonist and the Bald Man: after twice refusing the latter's <b>insidious</b> offer of services, the prince is eventually forced by dire circumstance into accepting it. After another elaborate deception, the creature is able to trap the prince into a well, and only leaves him out in exchange for swearing on his backsword that they would exchange roles: the Bald Man will be introduced as the king's son to his uncle, while the young man will become a slave {{under the name of}} Harap Alb. They proceed to the Green Emperor's palace, who innocently welcomes the Bald Man as his son. During the meeting, the master makes a point of mistreating and hitting his slave. This upsets the emperor's daughter, who asks him to behave with more reserve, and secretly begins to wonder about his actual identity.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, Moss Cass, Minister for the Environment and Conservation, led parliamentarians and ALP branch {{members in}} expressing {{concerns}} {{about the effects of}} uranium mining. A key concern was the adverse effect that uranium mining would have on the northern Aboriginal people. Cass said: [...] "nuclear energy creates the most dangerous, <b>insidious</b> and persistent waste products, ever experienced on the planet".|$|E
500|$|Ten years earlier, Bukovsky sketched {{some of the}} {{numerous}} and <b>insidious</b> ways such Western complicity was secured.

500|$|Lampooning a {{controversy}} surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality, essayist Dennis Hans wrote a 2005 satirical {{piece for the}} National Catholic Reporter focusing on the marriage of Plankton and Karen. He remarked, in jest, that SpongeBob's sexual orientation was a lesser issue compared to the positive representation of Plankton's [...] "technosexuality". Hans identified instances where both Planktons were portrayed as a loving couple and joked: [...] "the subliminal message from SpongeBob's <b>insidious</b> creators... the technosexual lifestyle means bonding forever with your one true love".|$|E
