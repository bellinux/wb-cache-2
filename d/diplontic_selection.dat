40|$|In {{a recent}} study on stored lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds we showed that loss of seed {{viability}} is associated with an accumulation ofchromosome damage in the surviving seeds (see Rao et al. 1987). Like many other previous investigators we evaluated the chromosome damage in the primary roots by examining the anaphase cells of the first mitotic divisions where the chromosomes containing lesions induced uring storage form visible aberration configurations. Aberrant cells containing ross chromosome damage were however shown to be removed subsequently b <b>diplontic</b> <b>selection</b> since they occasion mechanical separation problems during divisions and produce daughter cells which are genetically imbalanced. Structural changes in the chromosomes involving rearrangement of segments such as translocations and inversions, however, do not form aberrant configurations in mitotic ells, hence they are not subjected to selection, and survive through successive c ll generations to become visible only at meiosis. As is well known, translocations and inversion heterozygotes produce gametes containing duplica tions and deficiencies which, as a result are inviable and cause considerable sterility in the plants carrying them. Also small deficiencies may escape <b>diplontic</b> <b>selection</b> and survive up to meio sis and induce sterility since, being haploid, the gametophyte is extremely sensitive to even smal...|$|E
40|$|Chimerism is the {{concurrence}} of genotypically different tissues in {{one individual}} and usually {{results from a}} mutation early {{in the development of}} that individual. With the possibility to induce mutations came the problem of chimerism which gives heterogeneous plants and, allegedly, loss of mutations by <b>diplontic</b> <b>selection,</b> i. e. selection between genetically different tissues within an individual where the mutated tissue is assumed to be at a disadvantage. Literature on anatomy, morphology and development, and on the. mutation process gives the explanation for various aspects of chimerism: The appearance of chimerism depends on the constitution of the material treated and on the action of the mutagen used. Periclinal and sectorial chimerism are related to the structure of the apex i. e. the existence of independent cell layers and of a few central (apical) initial cells. The development of chimerism after a mutagenic treatment is determined by the differentiation already present in the material treated (usually seed), in which the destiny of most of the cells is already fixed. The presented experiments (on arabidopsis and sunflower) indicate that the mutagenic action of the mutagens used (EMS and colchicine applied separately or simultaneously) was mainly confined to the duration of the treatment. In addition the mutagens influenced development, stimulating it at first and later (especially colchicine) retarding it, which has consequences for sensitivity with combined treatments, and which may affect chimerism. Differences in average distribution of mutations (from seed versus seedling treatment, "first" versus "second" mutation) were ascribed to differential mutagen (EMS) sensitivity of cells destined to form the various parts of the plant (main inflorescence, side shoots). Chimerism in the sporogenic tissue (pollen and M 2 were scored) occurred as sectors (usually 2 in the inflorescence and up to 4 in the stem of arabidopsis) which often seemed twisted probably due to the (twisted) growth of the plants. Generally chimerism was lost, apparently at random with regard to the observed mutations (polypIoidy and M 2 chlorophyll, mutants). Although <b>diplontic</b> <b>selection</b> is often mentioned in the literature, most of the cases reported can be explained equally well, and often better, as aspects of normal development or as the result of differential (mutagen) sensitivity. Environmental conditions influence the development of the plant and also the (observed) mutation rate, but this influence may be indirect i. e. through the effect on chimerism. Chimerism depends on the stability of the apical initial cells which will be related to the stability of the apex and therefore to plant development and thus indirectly to environmental conditions. Plants from experiments with various growth conditions (greenhouse vs field, daylength) differed in development and vigour, and simultaneously, in degree and persistence of chimerism, vigorous plants showing more chimerism. Treatments which retard apical development at an early stage (etiolation, vernalization) decreased chimerism. In both cases effects on the stability of the apex were probably responsible. This loss of chimerism, at random with regard to the genotype, may be called diplontic drift. It depends on conditions affecting plant growth and may offer an opportunity to manipulate chimerism. Chimerism decreases the chance to detect a mutation but increases the number of (different) mutations that can be obtained from one plant, so that the degree of chimerism desired, may vary...|$|E
40|$|Loss of seed {{viability}} in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) during storage {{is associated with}} an increase in the frequency of cells in the surviving seeds showing chromosome damage during first mitoses. The relation is linear when probit of the frequency of aberrant cells is plotted as a function of probit percentage normal germination. The slope of the relation, however, varies according to moisture content so that the proportion of aberrant cells for any given loss of germination increases with decrease in moisture content over the range 13. 0 â€“ 5. 5 per cent. At 3. 3 per cent moisture content, however, the proportion of aberrations was no greater than at 5. 5 per cent moisture content; and at 18. 1 per cent moisture content the proportion was no less than at 13. 0 per cent moisture content. Despite these differences, the increase in chromosomal aberrations per unit time for a given temperature was always less the lower the moisture content. <b>Diplontic</b> <b>selection</b> markedly reduced the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and eliminated the differences in these frequencies between the different storage treatments. But even after five weeks' growth, root tips from aged seed still contained about twice as many aberrant cells as compared with similar root tips derived from the original seed stock. Studies on the frequency of recessive mutations indicated that excessive amounts of heritable mutations were not present in the progenies of aged seed, even when stored at moisture contents as low as 5. 5 per cent. All this and other evidence reinforces the view that orthodox seeds for genetic conservation should be stored at not more than about 5 per cent moisture content, and that even lower moisture contents are worth considering. The results also emphasise the need for maintaining a high regeneration standard, i. e. the percentage to which {{seed viability}} is allowed to fall during storage before the seed stock is regenerate...|$|E
