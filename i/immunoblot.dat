25|$|At CDC, a {{combination}} of tests with purified adult worm antigens is used for antibody detection. All serum specimens are tested by FAST-ELISA using S. mansoni adult microsomal antigen (MAMA). A positive reaction (greater than 9 units/µl serum) indicates infection with Schistosoma species. Sensitivity for S. mansoni infection is 99 percent, 95 percent for S. haematobium infection, and less than 50 percent for S. japonicum infection. Specificity of this assay for detecting schistosome infection is 99 percent. Because test sensitivity with the FAST-ELISA is reduced for species other than S. mansoni, immunoblots of the species appropriate to the patient's travel history are also tested to ensure detection of S. haematobium and S. japonicum infections. Immunoblots with adult worm microsomal antigens are species-specific and so a positive reaction indicates the infecting species. The presence of antibody is indicative only of schistosome infection at some time and cannot be correlated with clinical status, worm burden, egg production, or prognosis. Where a person has traveled can help determine what Schistosoma species to test for by <b>immunoblot.</b>|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{compare the}} {{predictive}} value of <b>immunoblotting</b> and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in diagnosing Lyme borreliosis. METHODS [...] An ELISA using a whole cell sonicate of the B 31 strain of Borrelia burgdorferi {{was used to}} screen samples submitted for Lyme borreliosis serology. A total of 1222 serum samples reactive in the ELISA were tested by <b>immunoblotting</b> also using the B 31 strain. Patients with other spirochaetal diseases were tested by both methods to assess specificity, while those with erythema migrans were used to evaluate sensitivity. Subjects with different clinical conditions, {{which may have been}} associated with Lyme borreliosis, were tested using both techniques. RESULTS [...] Only 16. 3 % of serum samples from patients submitted for Lyme borreliosis serology which were reactive by ELISA were confirmed as positive by <b>immunoblotting.</b> This is unlikely to represent a sensitivity problem as 51 % of samples from 53 patients with erythema migrans were detected by <b>immunoblotting</b> compared with only 28 % by ELISA. Patients whose samples were negative by ELISA were also negative by <b>immunoblotting.</b> Serum samples from patients with relapsing fever were reactive in both ELISA and by <b>immunoblotting,</b> but for other test groups <b>immunoblotting</b> offered increased specificity. CONCLUSIONS [...] Not all ELISA results could be confirmed by <b>immunoblotting.</b> Yet <b>immunoblotting</b> was both more sensitive and specific than ELISA techniques. As a result of these observations all ELISA results should be serologically confirmed by <b>immunoblotting.</b> Though <b>immunoblotting</b> is not suited to large scale screening of samples, it can be used satisfactorily in conjunction with ELISA methods to improve the predictive value of serological tests for Lyme borreliosis...|$|R

40|$|Paraneoplastic {{pemphigus}} is an autoimmune bullous {{skin disease}} in which autoantibodies immunoprecipitate a characteristic antigenic complex. The {{objective of this}} study was to analyze by <b>immunoblotting</b> and immunoelectron microscopy the autoimmune response in five patients with clinical and immunohistoligic features typical of paraneoplastic pemphigus. In a first series of experiments, <b>immunoblotting</b> and immunoelectron microscopy were performed using anti-human whole Ig. Although <b>immunoblotting</b> results were consistent with the autoantibody specificities sera, immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the presence of Ig deposits on desmosomal plaques, on hemidesmosomes and, surprisingly, on both the extracellular part of desmosomes and the keratinocyte plasma membrane. In a second series of experiments, <b>immunoblotting</b> and immunoelectron microscopy were carried out using anti-human IgG subclasses. The major observation was that two sera contained, in addition to the anti-desmoplakins I-II, anti- 185 -kD and anti- 230 -kD autoantibodies, autoantibodies that stained the desmoglea by indirect immunoelectron microscopy and bound to a 130 -kD polypeptide by <b>immunoblotting.</b> One serum was particularly demonstrative: IgG 1 bound to the 250 - and 220 -kD bands corresponding to desmoplakins I and II on <b>immunoblots</b> and to the desmosomal plaques of keratinocytes in immunoelectron microscopic preparation; IgG 3 recognized a 185 -kD <b>immunoblotting</b> band and hemidesmosomes and desmosomal plaques by immunoelectron microscopy; IgG 4 bound to the 130 -kD <b>immunoblotting</b> band of pemphigus vulgaris and labeled the desmoglea and the keratinocyte plasma membrane by immuoelectron microscopy.
