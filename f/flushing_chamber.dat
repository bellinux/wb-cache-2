40|$|In {{addition}} to anodic dissolution there are secondary reactions during electrochemical machining (ECM) of metal materials. Among others the secondary reactions include {{the generation of}} hydrogen and oxygen. These gases {{are present in the}} working gap in form of bubbles and influence the local conductivity of the electrolyte, and thus also the local current density. During machining the working gap is flushed with fresh electrolyte and so a distribution of gas bubbles in flush direction has to be expected. The described influence of the gas generation is one significant challenge in ECM process design. [1, 2] In this study the generation of gas during pulsed electrochemical machining (PECM) will be examined. Therefore a device is created to analyse the amount of generated gas in a PECM process. The device realises a quantitative ascertainment of the generated gas volume and was implemented into a commercial PECM setup. The generated gas is directed into a measuring cylinder. This enables the analysis of the gas amount through the displacement principle [3]. The gas collector is implemented at the electrolyte outlet of the <b>flushing</b> <b>chamber.</b> In this connection the diameter from the electrolyte outlet to the measuring cylinder becomes bigger and the electrolyte-gas-mixture slows down. Thereby the gas bubbles up in the measuring cylinder and is gathered in the upper part. For correct measuring during a machining process the gas level is measured before and after the machining process. The determination of gas generation is shown on selected removal experiments by variation of the current density and pulse duration...|$|E

40|$|The {{circadian}} rhythm in susceptibility to oxygen toxicity seizures was investigated by using six groups of 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats (101 - 196 gm.). The animals were given standard chow, exposed to standard diurnal conditions of light (0700 - 1900 hr) and dark (1900 - 0700 hr), and fasted for 15 - 16 hr {{prior to exposure}} to hyperbaric oxygen.

Time of exposure in minutes prior to seizure was significantly longer in those exposed at 0700 - 0800 hr and 1000 - 1100 hr than in four other groups. There was no relationship between animals' weights and time of exposure to seizures. All R values were negative, and the highest R value was - 035.

40|$|We {{constructed}} a new two-chamber device for gas diffusion measurements in the laboratory, where the diffusion process {{is followed by}} two counter-diffusing gases. One of the two chambers of the new apparatus is flushed with Ar, and the diffusion process is started by removing a metal slide separating the chamber from the soil sample. The partial pressure of Ar as well as O- 2 is time-lapse monitored in the <b>flush</b> <b>chamber</b> {{as well as in}} a passive chamber coupled {{to the other end of}} the soil sample. We measured the gas diffusion coefficient for undisturbed and remolded soil when the samples were drained to a matric potential of - 300 hPa. Cores of autoclaved, aerated concrete (AAC) were prepared in the sizes fitting the new device as well as an existing one-chamber apparatus. Gas diffusion was measured through the AAC cores and through simple tubes for both methods. The relative gas diffusivity of Ar and O- 2 for soil samples in the two-chamber device closely followed a 1 : 1 relation, indicating no significant O- 2 consumption during measurements. The relative diffusivities for the cylindrical tubes were identical to their cross-sectional area, providing a quantitative assessment of the absolute accuracy. The inter-calibration of the two methods based on the AAC cores showed no significant difference, and also indicates that the error from not taking the storage aspect into account for the one-chamber system is negligible for moist soil samples. We consider the new two-chamber, two-gas methodology as promising for detailed studies of gas diffusion in soil...|$|R

According to this technique, the mixture of filtrates obtained at cathode and anode sides, is used for continuous <b>flushing</b> of anode <b>chamber</b> of the filter press during electrodewatering. The anode flushing is aimed to eliminate essential problems of electrodewatering: ohmic heating, rise of electric energy consumption, electrodes corrosion, and filtrate contamination. This is attained by better control of the filtrate pH, the filter cake temperature and the dryness at anode side, where the physicochemical conditions are most aggressive. The efficiency of the proposed technique is evaluated at lab scale on drilling sludge electrodewatering with and without anode flushing. In experiments without anode flushing, increasing of electric current density caused strong increase of anode temperature, desiccation of the filter cake at anode side, rise of voltage and significant alkaline contamination of filtrate. The application of anode flushing allowed controlling the electric field strength and the temperature. Thus, the dewatering of the sludge has been extended at high electric field without damaging the filter equipment by drastic heating.

In an additional dynamic dilution step the final concentration is adjusted with a flow of purified synthetic air to typical mixing ratios between several ppt (v/v) and ppb (v/v).

Extensive tests over 21 months showed that the diffusion rates varied little with time, between 1. 4 % and 3. 1 %, depending on the compound. The system proved to be suitable for compounds {{with a wide range of}} boiling points, from 305 K (1, 1 -dichlorethene) to 418 K (1, 2 -dimethylbenzene) The diffusion device was applied to a gas chromatographic system with a flame ionization detector and an electron-capture detector.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{handling}} of debris in small hydro power intakes is assessed by evaluating the concept of back flushing with a horizontally fixed trash rack. The concept of back flushing is to reverse the flow over the trash rack {{for a short period}} of time in order to detach and evacuate clogged debris through a flushing pipe or gate. In this study the concept of back flushing with a horizontal trash rack is evaluated for two different designs; a one chamber design and a two chamber design. The one chamber design is based on H. Brekke?s conceptual idea. The two chamber design is also based on H. Brekke?s idea but it is also inspired by Bergedammen. Bergedammen is an intake designed with two chambers making it possible to continue power production while back <b>flushing</b> one <b>chamber</b> at the time. The efficiency of back flushing as well as the hydraulic performance during normal operation is mainly evaluated using numerical modelling and a CFD-software. The concept of back flushing, general intake hydraulics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is covered by the literature study in this thesis. The evaluation of the back flushing concept is initiated by a physical demonstration model with two chambers. The demonstration model is built and tested for flushing efficiency and performance during normal operation. The following numerical tests are performed on 4 different model designs. The first model illustrates a full scale one chamber design. The second model illustrates a full scale two chamber design. The third model is identical to the demonstration model. The forth model is designed as a result of the demonstration model and the previous numerical models, where important model parameters were identified. The important model parameters for effective flushing and hydraulic performance during normal operation is identified as the height of the weir, the vertical position of the trash rack, the length of the model and the amount of water available for flushing. The numerical analyses evaluate the flushing efficiency by assessing the velocity distribution over the trash rack. The hydraulic performance of the models during normal operation is evaluated by assessing streamlines, head loss and turbulent kinetic energy levels (TKE) by the outlet. During flushing the most important parameter is the height between the top of the weir and the trash rack. A high weir results in an even velocity distribution over the trash rack. A low weir results in uneven velocities with higher velocities along the weir. During normal production the length of the model and the height of the weir are important parameters affecting both the total head loss and TKE-values. The results achieved by the numerical modelling should be validated, as further research, on a scale model designed and built in the lab. The test program for the scale model is presented in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Generally, the {{determination}} of the gamma-ray dose in a mixed neutron-gamma field is obtained by using ¿neutron-insensitive¿ detectors. For this purpose, graphite, magnesium and aluminum ionization chambers are available. It is known that graphite chambers suffer from porosity and magnesium chambers encounter oxidation and manufacturing problems. So far, the aluminum chamber is mostly applied in fast neutron fields. This study presents the results of an aluminum <b>chamber,</b> <b>flushed</b> with argon gas, when applied in a mixed neutron and gamma field. A computer model of the ionization chamber is developed for an accurate interpretation of the responses. Special interest is given to the charge that can be measured after the irradiation has stopped, which is due to decay of 28 Al. Methods and Materials: The Monte Carlo code MCNPX is used to simulate the neutrons, gammas and charged particles in and around the Al-Ar chamber. The detector is modeled in detail and all possible reactions which can occur in the materials of the chamber are incorporated. The response of the Al-Ar chamber is compared with the results of a Mg-Ar one in terms of collected charge. Results: All individual components contributing to the signal of the detector are identified and calculated. Although the decay-charge produced by aluminum is much higher, in comparison to magnesium, a better estimation of the gamma dose is expected when the decay-charge in aluminum can be accurately determined. Another advantage is that the higher activation in Al can be used for identifying the neutron contribution. Despite the great detail in the model used, there is a ~ 25 % discrepancy between the experimental and simulated total charges for both the Mg-Ar and Al-Ar chambers, which requires evidently further investigation. Conclusions: The Al-Ar chamber can be used complementary to the Mg-Ar chamber as gamma dosimeter in a mixed field of neutrons and gammas. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} DA- 9701 on the gastric emptying of a solid meal using the 13 C-octanoic acid breath test in a mouse model. METHODS: Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice aged > 8 wk and with body weights of 20 - 25 g were used in this study. The solid test meal consisted of 200 mg of egg yolk labeled with 1. 5 L/g 13 C-octanoic acid. The mice were placed in a 130 mL <b>chamber</b> <b>flushed</b> with air at a flow speed of 200 mL/min. Breath samples were collected for 6 h. The half-emptying time and lag phase were calculated using a modified power exponential model. To assess the reproducibility of the 13 C-octanoic acid breath test, the breath test was performed two times at intervals of one week in ten mice without drug treatment. To assess the gastrokinetic effects of DA- 9701, the breath test was performed three times in another twelve mice, with a randomized crossover sequence of three drug treatments: DA- 9701 3 mg/kg, erythromycin 6 mg/kg, or saline. Each breath test was performed at an interval of one week. RESULTS: Repeatedly measured half gastric emptying time of ten mice without drug treatment showed 0. 856 of the intraclass correlation coefficient for the half gastric emptying time (P = 0. 004). The mean cumulative excretion curve for the 13 C-octanoic acid breath test showed accelerated gastric emptying after DA- 9701 treatment compared with the saline control (P = 0. 028). The median half gastric emptying time after the DA- 9701 treatment was significantly shorter than after the saline treatment [122. 4 min (109. 0 - 137. 9 min) vs 134. 5 min (128. 4 - 167. 0 min), respectively; P = 0. 028] and similar to that after the erythromycin treatment [123. 3 min (112. 9 - 138. 2 min) ]. The lag phase, which {{was defined as the}} period taken to empty 15 % of a meal, was significantly shorter after the DA- 9701 treatment than after the saline treatment [48. 1 min (44. 6 - 57. 1 min) vs 52. 6 min (49. 45 - 57. 4 min), respectively; P = 0. 049].

40|$|Cladophora glomerata is the {{dominant}} spring and summer epilithic macroalga in the lower Laurentian Great Lakes, and was a notorious nuisance prior to nutrient management of the early 1970 s. It is an indicator of excessive nutrient supply {{and appears to be}} experiencing a resurgence in the nearshore of the lower Great Lakes. This thesis examines the ecology of C. glomerata in an urbanized location of Lake Ontario and addresses decadal scale environmental changes to the lake and their impact on this macroalga. A Cladophora growth model (CGM) was calibrated and validated to simulate attached and sloughed Cladophora biomass using two years of collected input data and independent measurements of Cladophora biomass. The CGM was used to hindcast Cladophora growth using multiplicative factors of seasonal minimal tissue phosphorus concentrations (QP) and seasonal mean nearshore light attenuation (KdPAR) of the early 1970 s and 1980 s relative to contemporary data. Cladophora QP in Lake Ontario is currently lower than in the early 1980 s, resulting in reduced Cladophora biomass at all depths in the euphotic zone. KdPAR has also declined, most strongly since the mid- 1990 s, following Dreissena mussel invasion, driving an increase in macroalgal biomass between 3. 5 and 10 m depth. Combining these effects, the CGM predicted that biomass is currently lower in Lake Ontario than in the early 1980 s. However, increases in QP in this post-dreissenid mussel period are predicted to result in greater Cladophora proliferation than in previous decades due to increased nearshore water clarity. The in situ rates of primary production on Cladophora-dominated rocky substrata at 1 m depth were measured through the spring and summer. Net primary production (NPP) was measured as change in dissolved inorganic carbon (using IRGA) in benthic incubation <b>chambers</b> <b>flushed</b> continuously with water. Incubations were of 15 - 20 minutes duration, permitting measurements of productivity rates over diurnal and seasonal scales. Maximum biomass-specific net photosynthetic rates (PBmax) were highest in the spring and late-summer/fall (2. 39, 1. 98 mgC gDM- 1 hr- 1, respectively) and decreased to negative rates by early summer (− 0. 76 mgC gDM- 1 hr- 1). Directly measured rates of net primary production were simulated with the CGM. Simulated depth-integrated rates of Cladophora primary production were compared with published depth-integrated measurements of planktonic primary production from Lake Ontario. From the shoreline to the 12 m depth contour, the benthos was estimated to contribute 70 % of the areal primary production. On a seasonal basis, attached macroalgae are {{an important component of the}} energy flux in the Lake Ontario nearshore. This phenology of Cladophora glomerata growing in the western end of Lake Ontario is also described. Based on internal stoichiometric ratios (C:P and N:P), and a positive correlation between the decrease in the biomass-specific maximum photosynthetic rate (PBm) and phosphorus quota (QP), Cladophora productivity at shallow depths was shown to be P limited. In addition, light attenuation through the Cladophora canopy was estimated to be 24. 1 ± 3. 3 (standard deviation) m- 1 using paired light loggers deployed in situ. Acclimation to lower light levels through the Cladophora stand was demonstrated by significantly higher Cladophora chlorophyll concentrations at the base of the canopy. Decreases in Cladophora canopy cover in the summer resulted in increased PBm, even when QP remained near the minimal cell quota, indicating potential co-limitation of Cladophora productivity by light during peak standing crop. Cladophora growing at 1 m depth was also shown here to be tolerant of high irradiance, with an average decline of less than 10 % in Fv/Fm at during peak midday insolation, regardless of nutrient status or ambient water temperature. In conjunction with its role as a seasonally important nearshore primary producer, Cladophora appears to play a role as a seasonal nutrient regulator in the nearshore of Lake Ontario. The nutrient chemistry of nearshore lake water, Cladophora tissue, and a dominant tributary to western Lake Ontario were examined over the growing season of 2 years. As Cladophora grew and assimilated nutrients in the spring, total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations declined in the nearshore. Detachment and sloughing of Cladophora in the late summer was associated with increasing TP in the water column. These changes in nearshore nutrient concentrations were correlated with Cladophora phenology and not catchment loading. Nutrient loading from Oakville Creek was compared with the nutrient uptake of an adjacent Cladophora stand. The TP supply directly from the creek during the growing season was insufficient to meet the concentration of stored P in Cladophora tissue. It appears Cladophora is growing on P regulated by recycling within the lake, supporting the hypothesis that dreissenid mussels are sustaining Cladophora growth through recycling of TP in the lake. Cladophora remains P limited, however, such that increases in catchment loading would further augment its resurgence...|$|R
