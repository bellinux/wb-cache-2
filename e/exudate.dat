Treatment of root <b>exudates</b> with insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, which binds phenolic compounds, indicated that tomato root <b>exudates</b> contain phenolic compounds inhibitory to F. oxysporum microconidia germination. Our study indicates that tomato root <b>exudates</b> similarly stimulate microconidia germination of both Fol and Forl. However, individual F. oxysporum strains differ in the degree of germination response to the root <b>exudates.</b> Furthermore, root <b>exudates</b> from non-host plants also contain compounds that stimulate microconidia germination of Fol. In general, the effects of root <b>exudates</b> from non-host plants did not differ considerably from those of tomato.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} elevated serum lipids with retinal hard <b>exudates</b> in type 2 diabetic patients in rural Karnataka. MATERIAL AND METHODS : Hospital based cross sectional study which included 60 (n= 60) type 2 diabetic patients (60 eyes) fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Patients were subjected to detailed ocular examination, fundus examination done under full dilatation using indirect ophth almoscope with 20 D lens and slit lamp biomicroscope with 90 D lens. Fundus photographs were obtained using fundus camera. Grading of retinal hard <b>exudates</b> performed by utilizing modified Airlie House classification. The modified Airlie House Classification used is as follows: Grade 0 - No evidence of hard exudates; Grade 1 : Questionable hard <b>exudates</b> present; Grade 2 : Hard <b>exudates</b> less than standard photograph 3; Grade 3 : Hard <b>exudates</b> {{greater than or equal}} to standard photograph 3, but less than standard p hotograph 5; Grade 4 : Hard <b>exudates</b> {{greater than or equal to}} standard photograph 5, but less than standard photograph 4 and Grade 5 : Hard <b>exudates</b> greater than or equal to standard photograph 4. These grades were further divided into three groups of patie nt severity as follows: Group 1 (absent or minimal hard <b>exudates)</b> included patients with Grade 0, 1 or 2 hard exudates; Group 2 (hard <b>exudates</b> present) included patients with Grade 3 or 4 hard <b>exudates</b> and Group 3 (prominent hard <b>exudates)</b> included patient s with Grade 5 hard <b>exudates.</b> Fasting lipid profile including serum total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides was obtained. Association of dyslipidemia with retinal hard <b>exudates</b> was analysed using one way ANOVA test. RESULTS: On statistical analysis with ANOVA test retinal hard <b>exudates</b> were significantly associated with elevated total cholesterol (p=. 0001), triglycerides (p=. 0001), serum LDL (p=. 008), serum VLDL (p=. 012), and negative correlation was found with serum HDL (p=. 0001). CONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia was significantly associated with retinal hard <b>exudates</b> formation in type 2 diabetic patients. This study suggests treating ophthalmologist should get a fasting lipid profile done if patient has significant hard <b>exudates</b> on fundus examination. Study also recommends need of lipid lowering drugs due to high incidence of dyslipidemia in these patients...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Rhizospheres, {{the most}} active {{interfaces}} between plants and soils, {{play a central role}} in the long-term maintenance of the biosphere. The anti-erodibility of soils (AES) regulated by the root <b>exudates</b> is crucial to the soil stability in the rhizospheres. However, scientists still debate (1) the key organic matter of the root <b>exudates</b> affecting the AES and (2) the interspecific variation of these root <b>exudates.</b> Methods We used an incubation of soils to test the effects of the root <b>exudates</b> from eight woody plant species on the change in soil aggregation and identified the organic matter in these root <b>exudates</b> with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and biochemical methods. Furthermore, the relationships between the organic matter in the <b>exudates</b> and the AES in the rhizospheres of 34 additional tree species were analyzed. Results The water-stable aggregates of the soils incubated with the root <b>exudates</b> increased by 15 %– 50 % on average compared with control samples. The interspecific differences were significant. The root <b>exudates</b> included hundreds of specific organic matter types; hydrocarbon, total sugar, total amino acids, and phenolic compounds were crucial to the AES. These organic matter types could explain approximately 20 – 75 % of the variation in the total effect of the root <b>exudates</b> on the AES, which was quantified based on the aggregate status, degree of aggregation, dispersion ratio, and dispersion coefficient. Discussion The effects of the root <b>exudates</b> on the AES and the interspecific variation are as important as that of root density, litters, and vegetation covers. Many studies explored the effects of root density, litters, vegetation covers, and vegetation types on the AES, but little attention has been paid to the effects of the root <b>exudates</b> on the AES. Different plants secrete different relative contents of organic matter resulting in the variation of the effect of the root <b>exudates</b> on the AES. Our study quantified the causal relationships between the root <b>exudates</b> and the AES using modeling experiments in laboratory and field observations and indicated the interspecific variation of the AES and organic matter of the root <b>exudates.</b> Conclusions More organic compounds of the <b>exudates</b> related to the AES were recognized in this study. These results enhance the understanding of the soil stability at a slope and can be applied to ecosystem restoration...|$|R
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to <b>exudate,</b> and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

40|$|Root <b>exudates</b> are {{credited}} {{with having a}} major influence on the structure of rhizosphere bacterial communities.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the phytochemical constituents, antibacterial activities and the effectiveness of a mixture of these <b>exudates</b> in the treatment of corneal ulcers as claimed in Traditional medicine practice. Method: Fresh <b>exudates</b> were collected in different containers. They were reduced to dryness and each residue tested for phytochemical constituents. <b>Exudates</b> of P. angolensis was further tested for antimicrobial activities and its effect on chemical – induced corneal ulcers in rabbits. Result: Only reducing sugars were detected in <b>exudates</b> of A. angolensis and C. senegalensis.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPlant root <b>exudates</b> {{have been}} shown to play an {{important}} role in mediating interactions between plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and their host plants. Most investigations were performed on Gram-negative rhizobacteria, while much less is known about Gram-positive rhizobacteria. To elucidate early responses of PGPR to root <b>exudates,</b> we investigated changes in the transcriptome of a Gram-positive PGPR to plant root <b>exudates.</b> ResultsBacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42 is a well-studied Gram-positive PGPR. To obtain a comprehensive overview of FZB 42 gene expression in response to maize root <b>exudates,</b> microarray experiments were performed. A total of 302 genes representing 8. 2 % of the FZB 42 transcriptome showed significantly altered expression levels in the presence of root <b>exudates.</b> The majority of the genes (261) was up-regulated after incubation of FZB 42 with root <b>exudates,</b> whereas only 41 genes were down-regulated. Several groups of the genes which were strongly induced by the root <b>exudates</b> are involved in metabolic pathways relating to nutrient utilization, bacterial chemotaxis and motility, and non-ribosomal synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and polyketides. ConclusionsHere we present a transcriptome analysis of the root-colonizing bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB 42 in response to maize root <b>exudates.</b> The 302 genes identified as being differentially transcribed are proposed to be involved in interactions of Gram-positive bacteria with plants...|$|R
