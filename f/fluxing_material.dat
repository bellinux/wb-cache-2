40|$|A {{potential}} recycling rout for the end-of-life {{cathode ray}} tubes (CRT) is its application as a <b>fluxing</b> <b>material</b> in lead and copper smelting processes. Therefore, a thorough study on possible {{effects of the}} additional CRT on products and by-products of the metallurgical operation is required. In this paper, influences of CRT addition on mineralogy and leaching behaviour of a fayalite-type slag from a Swedish copper producer are investigated. Mixtures of slag/CRT, in different fractions, were prepared and re-melted in a Tamman furnace. Materials characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and standard leaching tests were done for all samples. Results depict that the main crystalline phase of the slag does not change due to CRT addition. By 10 wt-% CRT addition, leachability of major elements decreases; whereas, that of some minor elements increases. With 35 wt-% CRT addition, leaching of some environmentally detrimental elements make the material unacceptable for construction purposes according to the regulations.

Rock dust has been found good for using as <b>fluxing</b> <b>material</b> after XRF study. The samples were tested for different properties such as water absorption, porosity, mechanical strength, linear shrinkage, and bulk density. The strength values have exceeded the minimum standard requirement for roof tiles with low water absorption in most samples. The results obtained made it possible to conclude about the possibility of producing roof tiles incorporating up to 40 % of rock dust having better properties (lower water absorption 6. 5 %, strength value 31. 97 MPa) fired at 900 °C.

40|$|The SiO 2 {{fractions}} in laterite-nickel ores {{are quite}} high, thus {{certain amount of}} lime should be used as <b>fluxing</b> <b>material</b> to achieve good fluidity and desulfurization capacity in industrial smelting process. However, this operation leads to an additional cost of lime. In addition, the increase of slag volume decreases the effective furnace volume. To avoid such problem, partial reduction of FeO has been suggested. Therefore, the high SiO 2, low MgO and FeO and very little CaO slag is formed, which was less studied in the previous literature. Therefore, the viscosity and slag structure are investigated {{in the present study}} through FT-IR and Raman analysis methods. Experimental results show that the slag is a mixture of liquid and solid phases under the experimental temperature. The FT-IR and Raman spectra show that the fractions of the complex polymerization structure decrease significantly with the increase of FeO content and slag basicity, resulting in the decrease of apparent viscosity...|$|E

40|$|Reactor {{pressure}} vessel steel welds {{are affected by}} irradiation during operation. The irradiation results in nanometre cluster formation, which in turn affects the mechanical properties of the material, e. g. the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature is shifted to higher levels. In this study, cluster formation is characterised in high Ni (1. 58 %) low Cu (0. 04 %) steel welds identical to Ringhals R 4 welds, using atom probe tomography in both surveillance material and in material irradiated at accelerated dose rates. Clusters containing mainly Ni and Mn, but also some Si and Cu were observed {{in all of the}} irradiated materials. Their evolution did not change drastically during irradiation; the clusters grew and new clusters were nucleated. Hence, both the cluster number density and the average size increased with irradiation time. Some flux effects were observed when comparing the high <b>flux</b> <b>material</b> and the surveillance material. The surveillance material has a lower cluster number density, but larger clusters. The resulting impact on the mechanical properties of these two effects cancel out, resulting in a measured hardness that seems {{to be on the same}} trend as the high <b>flux</b> <b>material.</b> The dispersed barrier hardening model with an obstacle strength factor of 0. 15 was found to reproduce the increase in hardness. In the investigated high <b>flux</b> <b>materials,</b> the clusters' Cu content was higher. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Investigations are carried out by fluxing the melt with B 2 O 3 and without any <b>fluxing</b> <b>material.</b> The isothermal experiments allow us to determine the complete time–temperature-transformation diagram with a minimum crystallization time of about 200 s for the fluxed melt and about 130 s for the unfluxed Pd 43 Ni 10 Cu 27 P 20 melt. The results of the experiments at constant cooling and heating rates are summarized in a continuous heating and cooling diagram. The critical cooling rate for the fluxed alloy is determined to be 0. 09 K/s, whereas the critical heating rate is 6 K/s.

40|$|Silicomanganese {{is widely}} used as a complex reducer and an {{alloying}} addition {{in the production of}} various grades of steel due to its economic and metallurgical advantages. It is also used as a semi-product in the manufacture of medium- and low-carbon ferromanganese and metallic manganese. Manganese-rich slag, resulting from high carbon ferromanganese production, has the advantages of high manganese content, high Mn/Fe ratio, low excess oxygen, low phosphorus content, low fine content and low cost. Such slag seems to be very attractive to use as raw materials for the production of silicomanganese alloys. In the present study, experimental heats were designed and carried out to optimise the factors affecting the production process of silicomanganese using manganese rich slag in the charge. The results of pilot plant experimental heats showed that the optimum metallic yield and recoveries of manganese and silicon are obtained with initial slag basicity, (CaO + MgO) / (Al 2 O 3), equals 1. 8 by using dolomite as <b>fluxing</b> <b>material</b> and charging quartzite and fluorspar in percentage of 25 % and 4 % of the blend, respectively.

40|$|The {{traditional}} Sekishu roofing-tiles {{have been}} made from the raw clays occurring in the Tsunodu formation of the Neogene age. These clays consist mainly of disordered kaolinite, quartz and feldspar, accompanied by a small quantity of mica clay minerals and halloysite. The properties of three types of low quality clays, two are of sediment origin and the one is red color altered granite, were investigated in order to utilize them as potential raw materials for the preparation of compound roofing-tile bodies, since the raw clays of good quality tend to be steeply exhausted. As a result, {{it was found that}} these clays have functional uses for making compound bodies, although they are lack in shaping ability, individually. The one of sedimentary clays, characterized by dark brown color owing to the accumulation of humic substances, is advantage to improve the plasticity of compound bodies, because it is rich in the finer particle-size fractions and contains a small quantity of smectite. The other one, abundant in quartz and feldspar with coarser particle size, found the uses as non-plastic material and <b>fluxing</b> <b>material.</b> The red color clay, in which gibbsite and halloysite form dominantly, resembles the existent raw clays in chemical composition and is characterized by remarkably small size-changes in firing.

40|$|The agro-industrial {{activities}} {{are responsible for}} the production of large amounts of solid wastes, which, so far, have found scarce reuse alternatives. Among the former, coffee bean beneficiation generates an equal amount of coffee husks whose highest reuse potential is as fuel. The resulting ashes are frequently an object of illegal covert disposal and a serious source of environmental impact. However, coffee husk ashes (CHA) are particularly rich in alkaline and alkaline-earth metals, and might be adequate to replace the traditional feld-spars, which are used in high content as fluxes in clay-based ceramic formulations but are becoming scarce and costly. In this work, the fluxing effect of CHA additions to an industrial clay-based mixture was evaluated. Based on the characterization results and the mullite-silica-leucite phase diagram, additions of 5 to 20 wt. % CHA were made to the clay-based mixture and the resulting compositions were evaluated after sintering at temperatures between 1100 and 1200 degrees C (60 min soaking time). The results obtained show that firing temperatures near 1180 degrees C and similar to 10 wt. % CHA addition lead to linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength values that fall within the range specified by floor tile standards (NBR 13817, EN 176 and ISO 13006), requiring no significant changes in processing parameters. Coffee husk ashes can thus advantageously replace feldspars in the role of <b>fluxing</b> <b>material,</b> with the potential to reduce not only natural ceramic raw material consumption, but also production and landfill costs as well as waste disposal area requirements.

40|$|The pyrometallurgical {{processing}} of copper-iron-sulphide containing concentrates typically involves initial smelting, producing a copper-iron-sulphide matte, followed by matte converting, producing blister copper. The converting {{stage of the}} process is currently undertaken, in most existing operations, using batch Peirce-Smith converters, which use silica as a flux to produce a molten iron-silicate based slag. Due {{to a number of}} issues associated with Peirce-Smith converters, including difficulties in fugitive gas capture, continuous copper converting processes have been developed. These continuous processes have identified a number of problems associated with using only silica as a <b>fluxing</b> <b>material,</b> including the formation of solid magnetite crusts within the furnaces at normal operating conditions, and that alternative fluxing practices, including the use of lime, can eliminate a number of these problems. Both the calcium ferrite system, fluxing only with lime, and the ferrous calcium silicate system, fluxing with both lime and silica, are possible alternative slag systems for use in copper converting; these slags are described by the “Cu 2 O”-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 system at copper saturation A critical review of the scientific literature available on the experimental phase equilibria on calcium ferrite and ferrous calcium silicate slags has shown that the phase equilibria in these systems are well defined only in the limiting conditions of air and metallic iron saturation, in both cases without the presence of copper oxide. There are disagreements in the literature in both systems with regards to the shape of the liquidus at fixed intermediate oxygen partial pressure conditions, and no experimental work had been found on either system at copper saturation and at fixed oxygen partial pressures. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to define the phase equilibria of both ferrous calcium silicate and calcium ferrite slag systems at conditions directly relevant to copper converting, including: • Intermediate oxygen partial pressures in the range 10 - 5. 0 to 10 - 6. 5 atm; • Copper free slags; and • Metallic copper saturated slags. Experimental methods have been developed to investigate the phase equilibria of these complex slag systems without the presence of metallic copper involving rapid quenching of slag samples equilibrated at high temperatures in platinum crucibles with the resulting phase assemblages analysed using electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA). These methods have been then further developed to allow for accurate, objective and repeatable measurements of copper saturated slags using primary phase substrate supports at both neutral and fixed oxygen partial pressures. This technique removed the limitations arising from the use of crucible/refractory materials and facilitated rapid quenching of the melt. This methodology allowed for the experimental determination of the phase equilibria in: • “FeO”-CaO-SiO 2 system in the temperature range of 1200 C- 1350 C at an oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 6. 0 atm; • “FeO”-CaO-SiO 2 system at an oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 5. 0 atm at 1250 C; • “Cu 2 O”-“FeO”-CaO-SiO 2 at 1250 C and 1300 C and at an oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 6. 0 atm at metallic copper saturation; • “Cu 2 O”-“Fe 2 O 3 ” and “Cu 2 O”-CaO systems at metallic copper saturation; • “Cu 2 O”-“Fe 2 O 3 ”-CaO system in the temperature range of 1100 C- 1250 C at metallic copper saturation; and • “Cu 2 O”-“Fe 2 O 3 ”-CaO system at 1200 C and 1250 C at an oxygen partial pressure range of 10 - 5. 0 atm to 10 - 6. 5 atm, including the effect of SiO 2 on the spinel and dicalcium ferrite liquidus. The experimental data reported {{in the present study were}} used in the verification of: • Thermodynamic computer models of the ferrous calcium silicate system; and • Empirical methods for calculating copper concentrations in calcium ferrite slags. The experimental determination of the new phase equilibria data on the calcium ferrite and ferrous calcium silicate systems has made it possible, using a mass and energy balance approach, to accurately assess the relative technical merits of using these systems in copper converting technologies. The comparison of calcium ferrite and ferrous calcium silicate slags, at the selected conditions, indicates that, in general, calcium ferrite slags have lower copper losses, lower total slag masses, reduced energy requirements and higher concentrations of SO 2 in the off gas. It was shown, however, that unlike calcium ferrite slags the use of ferrous calcium silicate slags makes it possible to operate at high silica concentrations and, if the operating temperature of the process is increased, the performance approaches that of calcium ferrite slags. To enable the development of an optimised thermodynamic database for the “Cu 2 O”-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 system at metallic copper saturation further experimental studies are recommended to determine the high temperature properties of both calcium ferrite and ferrous calcium silicate slags involving the determination of the effects of: • Temperature; • Oxygen partial pressure; • Minor elements, for example MgO, Al 2 O 3 and S, on the phase equilibria; and • Distribution of minor impurity elements between metal and slag. These data will provide further support for existing and developing copper converting operations so that informed decisions can be made regarding the optimum choice of slag compositions, fluxing strategies, and operating conditions, for given feed, product and environmental requirements...|$|E
