40|$|Background: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) {{external}} codes (E codes) for <b>drowning</b> {{assist in}} determining the primary event leading to <b>drowning,</b> but do not alone allow the precise deter-mination of the overall <b>drowning</b> rates. Aims: To analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} ICD E codes for <b>drowning.</b> To describe the pattern and trend of <b>drowning</b> deaths that are classified with E codes other than for <b>drowning.</b> Setting: Finland, 1969 – 2000. Methods: Mortality files of Statistics Finland were searched electronically using the injury codes (I codes) and E codes for <b>drowning.</b> Cross analysis of I and E coded drownings was performed to determine the rate and pattern of <b>drowning</b> cases classified with E codes other than for <b>drowning.</b> Time trends were calculated using the Poisson regression model. Results: Of 13 705 <b>drowning</b> deaths, 644 (4. 7 %) were not identified with the E codes for <b>drowning.</b> The great majority (n= 547, 84. 9 %) of these cases were traffic accidents resulting in <b>drowning.</b> No sig-nificant time trends were found even after the introduction, in 1996, of the ICD 10 th revision. Conclusions: In Finland, underestimation of overall <b>drowning</b> rates using the E code alone is less pro-nounced than in countries where similar studies have been performed.

40|$|<b>Drowning</b> is a {{major public}} health concern in low- and middle-income countries. In South Africa there is sound {{information}} and an emerging knowledge base for <b>drowning</b> prevention. However, there remains a scarcity of analyses of <b>drowning</b> in the country. The purpose of this analysis was to quantify the magnitude and describe occurrence of unintentional <b>drowning</b> deaths in five major South African cities, recorded between 2001 and 2005 by the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System. <b>Drowning</b> in South African cities occurred at rates of between 1. 4 and 2. 7 / 100, 000 population. The majority of <b>drowning</b> occurred among males, while the highest rates were observed among 0 – 4 year olds. Most <b>drowning</b> deaths occurred during recreational periods, over weekends and in the afternoon. Of adult <b>drowning</b> victims, 41. 5 % were alcohol-positive {{at the time of}} death. This study is based on one of only two known systematic sources of <b>drowning</b> mortality in Africa. It provides an indication of <b>drowning</b> rates in South African cities with young children and males at considerably more risk. The most likely locations for <b>drowning</b> varied from city to city. Among adult victims, especially men, alcohol is an important risk factor...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{which is}} titled An algorithm of care about <b>drowning</b> {{people from the}} perspective of paramedics deals with the procedure in prehospital emergency care about <b>drowning</b> people. The procedure of rescue is meant here as an initial technical rescue of a <b>drowning</b> person from the water and then follow-up medical care. At the beginning of the theoretical part there is the definition of <b>drowning</b> and the division of <b>drowning</b> and getting <b>drowned.</b> After that there is the slightly detailed description of the pathophysiology of <b>drowning</b> where the processes that occur in <b>drowning</b> are mapped. There is also mentioned the statistics of <b>drowning</b> and prevention of <b>drowning.</b> Furthermore the material and technical equipment for the rescue of a <b>drowning</b> with water rescue and emergency medical services are processed. This chapter outlines the basic utilities for needs of <b>drowning</b> person of water rescue and emergency medical services. The described equipment is briefly defined and there are highlighted some benefits of life-saving utilities. The last part of the theoretical work is in details. I dealt there with the algorithm of care about <b>drowning</b> people and there is properly shown the exact procedure of rescue of <b>drowning</b> person from the first noticing to the post-resuscitation treatment. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to map the process of pre-hospital care of emergency medical services and water rescue from <b>drowning</b> and map material and technical equipment of water rescue and emergency medical services. In the research part of the thesis was used qualitative method of interviewing with prepared questions. Interviews were given by respondents from the Czech Red Cross Water Rescue Service and Emergency Medical Services from the South Bohemia. Questions were especially about the procedure of rescue of <b>drowning</b> person and about the equipment for rescue from <b>drowning.</b> Both the above-mentioned objectives of the work were done. The result is the exact procedure of pre-hospital emergency care from <b>drowning</b> with water rescue and emergency medical services. Then I maped material and technical equipment of water rescue and emergency medical services for needs of <b>drowning</b> person. This work includes two different views on the process of pre-hospital emergency care in the condition of <b>drowning.</b> It turned out that both rescue IRS coincides in certain procedures or in usable equipment. There were also distinct variances in procedure of rescue and the usage for the rescue of <b>drowning</b> people. The interviews also created recommendations for extension of the material and technical equipment for the rescue of <b>drowning</b> person...|$|R
2500|$|Dry <b>drowning</b> is a {{term that}} has never had an {{accepted}} medical definition, and that is currently medically discredited. Following the 2002 World Congress on <b>Drowning</b> in Amsterdam, a consensus definition of <b>drowning</b> was established. Based on this definition, <b>drowning</b> is the [...] "process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid." [...] This definition resulted in only three legitimate <b>drowning</b> subsets: fatal <b>drowning,</b> non-fatal <b>drowning</b> with illness/injury, and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> without illness/injury. In response, major medical consensus organizations have adopted this definition worldwide and have officially discouraged any medical or publication {{use of the term}} [...] "dry drowning". Such organizations include the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the Wilderness Medical Society, the American Heart Association, the Utstein Style system, the International Lifesaving Federation, [...] the International Conference on <b>Drowning,</b> Starfish Aquatics Institute, the American Red Cross, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Emergency Physicians.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the issues}} that motivate the members of Lifeguards Without Borders to {{continue}} on their mission is the issue with the term “drowning.” <b>Drowning</b> has had several different definitions. There have also been different categories of <b>drowning,</b> including silent, wet and dry <b>drowning.</b> The 2002 World Congress of <b>Drowning,</b> the first conference of its kind, came to a consensus of the definition of <b>drowning</b> as, ”the process of experiencing respiratory impairment as the result of submersion/immersion in a liquid medium”. The <b>drowning</b> research conducted by Lifeguards Without Borders also concluded that <b>drowning</b> is the tenth leading cause of death for people of all ages in the United States and is the cause of 1% of deaths worldwide. The organization was able to educate people of the extensive research they conducted on <b>drowning</b> through an article published on www.jems.com, written by co-founder Justin Sempsrott. The article also includes other information relating to the history of <b>drowning.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT - In the {{geological}} record a <b>drowning</b> process is documented by {{various types of}} shallow water-to-pelagic or shallow water to mixed benthic/pelagic carbonate transitions. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities are paraconformities, to disconformities, to angular unconformities, and their <b>drowning</b> surfaces range from planar to highly irregular morphologies. <b>Drowning</b> successions display a mix of products of both the benthic and pelagic carbonate factories. These successions can be also bounded by unconformities. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities and <b>drowning</b> successions are contrasted through a description and discussion of examples of escarpment-bounded platforms from the Jurassic of the Northern Apennines and, subordinately, from Sicily and other Tethyan sectors. The areal distribution of <b>drowning</b> unconformities and successions is discussed with reference to a complex depositional system whose architecture {{was the product of}} the riftinduced fragmentation of a regional Hettangian carbonate megabank. The examples in this study show <b>drowning</b> unconformities to be exclusive to intrabasinal highs, while <b>drowning</b> successions are found both on highs and in hangingwall basins. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities, with their long associated hiatuses, and <b>drowning</b> successions are often seen to merge laterally into one another over very short distances on the same intrabasinal high. The deposits of the <b>drowning</b> succession are sometimes missing {{on the top of the}} platform, while they are found forming clinoforms along its flanks, evidence that sediment could be permanently swept from the highs in these depositional systems at this stage...|$|R

5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would <b>drown.</b> He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
