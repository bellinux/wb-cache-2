40|$|Phenylacetylene and 1 -hexyne were {{polymerized}} using single-site catalysts, such as zirconocene <b>dichloride,</b> <b>ethylene</b> bis(indenyl) zirconium <b>dichloride,</b> and bis(imino) pyridyl iron(II) chloride. In all cases, methylaluminoxane {{was used}} as cocatalyst. The polymerization activities were {{comparable to those of}} the conventional titanium tetrabutoxide / aluminum triethyl catalyst and, in some cases, superseded its activities. By FTIR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, the ratio of cis to trans isomer in the polymer was determined, whereby the catalysts led to formation of more of the cis isomers (57. 3 %). The polymers were further characterized by Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Ultraviolet Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and solubility studies. The latter indicated the absence of any cis-cisoidal isomer. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) to be Mn ca. 2500 g/mol. PPA-carbon nanotube composites were also made using the iron-based catalyst to improve the stability of the polymer, which could be shown by TGA. Finally selected polymers were tested for their electroconductivity...|$|R

40|$|The {{preparation}} {{of a variety}} of lactone and olefin homopolymers and their copolymers using alkyl aluminoxanes and soluble Ziegler-Natta catalysts was studied. ^ After investigation {{of a variety of}} soluble Ziegler-Natta cocatalyst and alkyl-aluminoxanes, either bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride, Cp 2 ZrCl 2, or <b>ethylene</b> bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium <b>dichloride,</b> Et(ThInd) 2 ZrCl 2, with isobutylaluminoxane, IBAO, were found to be very effective for the copolymerizations, so these catalyst systems were used throughout this thesis research program. In order to vary the type of functionality and biodegradability, the possible copolymerization of lactones (including β-butyrolactone (β-BL), ε-caprolactone (CL), γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL), and DL-lactide (DL-L)) and olefin containing monomers (including styrene (S), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and ethyl acrylate (EA)) were studied. Many of these copolymers were synthesized {{for the first time in}} this study. The characterization results showed that some of these copolymers had high molecular weights, narrow polydispersities, unimodal GPC chromatograms and single values of glass transition temperatures (T g), and they were also totally amorphous. These results indicate that they were true copolymers. ...|$|R
