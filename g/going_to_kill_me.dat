2500|$|The trial resumed on Monday, October 16 {{with the}} playing of the {{recorded}} {{negotiations between the}} FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit and Saldívar. The tape began with Saldívar stating how badly she wanted to die. During the conversation, the jury heard Larry Young try to persuade her to lower her gun; Saldívar said {{that she could not}} do so. Young told her that by committing suicide she would only harm her parents. Saldívar then asked to contact her mother to say goodbye and ask for forgiveness. She continued to whine [...] "I just wanna die" [...] as Young began talking about religion to determine if she believed in a faith that might cause her to reconsider suicide. Young told Saldívar that if she would give herself up, he would place a jacket over her so that the media would not have a picture of her face during her surrender. Isaac Valencia told Saldívar that if she were to surrender they promised to turn off all of the lights that were pointing towards her truck; she agreed. As she left her truck, she was scared by the dozens of armed police and FBI agents who were pointing rifles and pistols at her. She ran back to her truck, pointed the gun at her head, and screamed at Young: [...] "They're carrying guns! They're carrying guns! They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me!</b> They're going to kill me!" [...] Anchor newswoman, María Celeste Arrarás, wrote in her 1997 investigative book, that she found it [...] "curious" [...] for a person who cried for hours that she wanted to die: [...] "would be afraid that someone might make her wish come true." [...] The New York Times also commented that: [...] "she alternately begged to be killed and expressed fear that she would be killed if she left the truck." ...|$|E

Benz was offered the small role of the vampire Darla in the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her performance was so well-received that her character appeared in a few more episodes. In an interview with TheTVAddict.com, Benz said of her casting: [...] "I was supposed to die in the pilot, but about halfway through the pilot Joss Whedon was like, 'We're giving you a name and we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> you.'

5000|$|In {{many ways}} Zaynab {{functioned as a}} model of {{defiance}} against oppression and other forms of injustice. When her nephew, Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, was sentenced to death by the governor of Kufah (Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad), she threw herself over him in a protective embrace yelling [...] "By God, I will not let go of him. If you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him, you will have <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> along with him." [...] Moved by Zaynab’s action, the captors spared Zayn al-Abidin's life.
