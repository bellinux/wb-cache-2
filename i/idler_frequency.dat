50|$|The {{other method}} is quasi-phase-matching. In this method the {{frequencies}} involved are not constantly locked in phase with each other, instead the crystal axis is flipped at a regular interval Λ, typically 15 micrometres in length. Hence, these crystals are called periodically poled. This {{results in the}} polarization response of the crystal to be shifted back in phase with the pump beam by reversing the nonlinear susceptibility. This allows net positive energy flow from the pump into the signal and <b>idler</b> <b>frequencies.</b> In this case, the crystal itself provides the additional wavevector k = 2π/Λ (and hence momentum) to satisfy the phase-matching condition. Quasi-phase-matching can be expanded to chirped gratings to get more bandwidth and to shape an SHG pulse like it is done in a dazzler. SHG of a pump and self-phase modulation (emulated by second-order processes) of the signal and an optical parametric amplifier can be integrated monolithically.|$|R

Many three- and four-wave nondegenerate parametric phenomena can be interpreted from this matrix, including effects such as frequency up- and down-conversion. Using a subset of these matrix equations, we treated the three-wave nondegenerate amplifier, where the signal and single idler are considered. By solving for an idler distinct from the signal, we found that the pumpistor impedance was now phase insensitive.

30|$|Regarding {{frequencies}} {{and how we}} label them, in this work we consider at most six frequencies due to possible mixing effects. Foremost, we consider a “signal” which exists at a frequency assigned to index 1. For a parametric amplifier, the signal frequency serves as the frequency of both the input and output of the device. In this case, we determine both the small-signal current and voltage components at this same signal frequency. This gives us a “signal impedance” upon which we base our subsequent reasoning. Some driven “pump” disturbance occurs at a frequency of index 3. This pump frequency corresponds to the frequency at which the SQUID is driven externally. The pumping of the SQUID provides for a nonlinear interaction to occur. Another frequency we consider is the “idler” <b>frequency.</b> An <b>idler</b> response comes about due to the nonlinear mixing between signal and pump. In the general case, we need {{to provide for the}} possibility for the idler response to exist, even if it remains as an internal state variable (serving neither as an externally accessible input or output to the circuit). Among the various topologies which allow <b>frequency</b> mixing, an <b>idler</b> tone occurs at a frequency that is some linear combination of the signal and pump frequencies. In this work we delineate an idler as either a sum or a difference between signal and pump frequencies, for either the three-wave or four-wave case. An underlying principle of the parametric amplifier is that (some portion of) the power absorbed at the pump frequency is transferred to signal and <b>idler</b> <b>frequencies,</b> allowing for an amplified response.|$|R
