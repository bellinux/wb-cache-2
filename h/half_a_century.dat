5|$|A new {{critical}} {{edition of}} both BWV 243 and 243a {{was published in}} 1955 as Series 2, Volume 3 of the New Bach Edition. Although the D major version remained the standard for life performance and studio recordings, <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later also the E-flat major version had been published in new editions adapted to performance, it had been recorded several times, and its composition history had been further unravelled.|$|E
5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson {{kept her}} promise and burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 {{and ruled}} until 1143. John was a pious and {{dedicated}} Emperor who {{was determined to}} undo {{the damage to the}} empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.|$|E

50|$|With {{this type}} of {{institutionalized}} corruption, the political path in Mexico was very narrow. There were specified political participation channels (the party) and selective electoral mobilization (party members). These issues, deeply engrained in Mexico’s political culture after over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century’s</b> existence, have continued to generate and institutionalize political corruption in today’s Mexico.|$|R

5|$|At {{the heyday}} of Reformation in the Commonwealth, {{at the end of}} the 16th century, there were about one {{thousand}} Protestant congregations, nearly half of them Calvinist. <b>Half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later, only 50% of them had survived, with the burgher Lutheranism suffering lesser losses, the szlachta dominated Calvinism and Nontrinitarianism (Polish Brethren) the greatest. The closing of the Brethren Racovian Academy and a printing facility in Raków on charges of blasphemy in 1638 forewarned of more trouble to come.|$|E
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts for more than <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1833, Wagner's brother Albert {{managed to}} obtain {{for him a}} {{position}} as choir master at the theatre in Würzburg. In the same year, {{at the age of}} 20, Wagner composed his first complete opera, Die Feen (The Fairies). This work, which imitated the style of Weber, went unproduced until <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later, when it was premiered in Munich shortly after the composer's death in 1883.|$|E

5|$|More than <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> {{after the}} capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} {{the construction of the}} Dome of the Rock over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
5|$|On {{a single}} day in 1825, 23 ships were left {{stranded}} off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, almost <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> {{before the arrival of}} the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E

5|$|The guide's list of {{subscribers}} was {{topped by}} George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph {{when the first}} edition appeared in print in 1795. The book proved very popular and remained a staple manual for millers for over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> undergoing several revisions and fifteen printed editions between 1795 and 1860. The book's popularity rested on its detailed practical explanations of mill design and construction, and as the principal guidebook for American milling {{it would not be}} superseded until after the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed almost <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of}} the Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E

5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> later, and her reputation among cookery {{writers such as}} Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
