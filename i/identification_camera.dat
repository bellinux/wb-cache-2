The visual system has four capabilities: the target detection, the target motion model online <b>identification,</b> <b>camera</b> control for target tracking and target position estimation. In order to minimize the time required for the image target detection, the target is made of elementary features: colored circular object. The target detection consists of two stages algorithm: (i) a color classification stage, and (ii) a knowledge-based shape detection stage. The color classification stage utilizes the distribution of the target color in the HSV color space in order to obtain an initial set of candidate regions. The second stage of the detection scheme uses mathematical morphology operators for circular object detection. The camera control exploits the detection in conjunction with an affine fit between 2 consecutive images. After the affine fit has been made, the camera control parameters are estimated. Due to the fact that the perspective projection is a many to one mapping, we designed the servomotorcamera-target system as a time variant system. A two phases control strategy is implemented. During the first phase (initialization) the target dynamics is estimated. The second phase consists of a state feedback control strategy. The target depth is estimated by using the appearance similarity between the target and its image. This system runs continuously in time and updates the target localization at a frame-rate of 170 µs on a Pentium 400 MHz PC. 1...|$|E

40|$|Source <b>camera</b> <b>identification</b> {{refers to}} the task of {{matching}} digital images with the cameras that are responsible for producing these images. This is an important task in image forensics, which in turn is a critical procedure in law enforcement. Unfortunately, few digital cameras are equipped with the capability of producing watermarks for this purpose. In this paper, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} achieve a high rate of accuracy in the identification by noting the intrinsic lens radial distortion of each camera. To reduce manufacturing cost, the majority of digital cameras are equipped with lenses having rather spherical surfaces, whose inherent radial distortions serve as unique fingerprints in the images. We extract, for each image, parameters from aberration measurements, which are then used to train and test a support vector machine classifier. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the success rate of a source <b>camera</b> <b>identification</b> with five <b>cameras.</b> The results show that this is a viable approach with high accuracy.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{confidence}} map and a pixel-based weighted correlation method for digital <b>camera</b> <b>identification.</b> In traditional <b>camera</b> <b>identification</b> method, a simple denoising technique {{is used to}} extract the photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) as {{the difference between the}} original image and the denoised image. One of the major problems is that the image content is left behind in the noise residue which affects the correlation calculation for identifying the source camera. In order to solve the problem, we first study the image content effect by examining the effect of different image features on correlation. We then formulate the image content effect by nonlinear regression model and apply this relationship to obtain a confidence map for the testing images. In such way, the confidence map shows the reliability of each pixel in correlation calculation. It {{can be used as a}} weighting function so as to give a higher weighting to pixel which is more reliable and a lower weighting for less reliable pixel. By using the weighted correlation, our proposed method is able to improve the identification accuracies especially for the low quality image such as heavy JPEG compression.

40|$|In recent years, {{multimedia}} forensics {{has received}} rapidly growing attention. One challenging problem of multimedia forensics is source <b>camera</b> <b>identification,</b> {{the goal of}} which is to identify the source of a multimedia object, such as digital image and video. Sensor pattern noises, produced by imaging sensors, have been proved to be an effective way for source <b>camera</b> <b>identification.</b> Precisely speaking, the conventional SPN-based source <b>camera</b> <b>identification.</b> has two application models: verification and identification. In the past decade, significant progress has been achieved in the tasks of SPN-based source <b>camera</b> verification and <b>identification.</b> However, there are still many cases requiring solutions beyond the capabilities of the current methods. In this thesis, we considered and addressed two commonly seen but less studied problems. The first problem is the source camera verification with reference SPNs corrupted by scene details. The most significant limitation of using SPN for source <b>camera</b> <b>identification.</b> is that SPN can be seriously contaminated by scene details. Most existing methods consider the contaminations from scene details only occur in query images but not in reference images. To address this issue, we propose a measurement based on the combination of local image entropy and brightness so as to evaluate the quality of SPN contained by different image blocks. Based on this measurement, a context adaptive reference SPN estimator is proposed to address the problem that reference images are contaminated by scene details. The second problem that we considered relates to the high computational complexity of using SPN in source <b>camera</b> <b>identification.,</b> which is caused by the high dimensionality of SPN. In order to improve identification. efficiency without degrading accuracy, we propose an effective feature extraction algorithm based on the concept of PCA denoising to extract a small set of components from the original noise residual, which tends to carry most of the information of the true SPN signal. To further improve the performance of this framework, two enhancement methods are introduced. The first enhancement method is proposed to take the advantage of the label information of the reference images so as to better separate different classes and further reduce the dimensionality. Secondly, we propose an extension based on Candid Covariance-free Incremental PCA to incrementally update the feature extractor according to the received images so that {{there is no need to}} re-conduct training every time when a new image is added to the database. Moreover, an ensemble method based on the random subspace method and majority voting is proposed in the context of source <b>camera</b> <b>identification.</b> to tackle the performance degradation of PCA-based feature extraction method due to the corruption by unwanted interferences in the training set. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on the challenging Dresden image database and experimental results confirmed their effectiveness. ...|$|R
