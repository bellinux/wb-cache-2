50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage. This maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> and the eddy current <b>loss.</b> Although the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> is less than the eddy current loss, it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable frequency source since the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> varies linearly with supply frequency and the eddy current loss varies with the square.|$|R
40|$|The damage {{evolution}} and life prediction of cross-ply C/SiC ceramic-matrix composite (CMC) under cyclic-fatigue loading {{at room temperature}} and 800 °C in air have been investigated using damage parameters derived from fatigue hysteresis loops, i. e., fatigue hysteresis modulus and fatigue <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> energy. The experimental fatigue hysteresis modulus and fatigue <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> energy degrade with increasing applied cycles attributed to transverse cracks in the 90 ° plies, matrix cracks and fiber/matrix interface debonding in the 0 ° plies, interface wear at room temperature, and interface and carbon fibers oxidation at 800 °C in air. The relationships between fatigue hysteresis loops, fatigue hysteresis modulus and fatigue <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> energy have been established. Comparing experimental fatigue <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> energy with theoretical computational values, the fiber/matrix interface shear stress corresponding to different cycle numbers has been estimated.

Combining the fiber fracture model with the interface shear stress degradation model and the fibers strength degradation model, the fraction of broken fibers versus the cycle number can be determined for different fatigue peak stresses.

40|$|Assuming that {{different}} energy dissipation mechanisms {{are at work}} along <b>hysteresis,</b> a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> subdivision procedure has been proposed, using the induction at maximum permeability (around 0. 8 T, in electrical steels) as {{the boundary between the}} ""low-induction`` and the ""high-induction`` regions. This paper reviews the most important results obtained in 10 years of investigation of the effect of microstructure on these components of the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss.</b> As maximum induction increases, the ""low-induction loss`` increases linearly up to 1. 2 T, while the ""high-induction loss`` is zero up to 0. 7 T and then increases as a power law with n = 5. Low-induction loss behavior is linearly related to H(c) between 0. 4 and 1. 2 T. Grain size has a larger influence on low-induction losses than on high-induction losses. Texture has a much stronger influence on high loss than on low-induction loss, and it is related to the average magnetocrystalline energy. 6. 5 %Si steel shows smaler <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> at 1. 5 T than 3. 5 %Si steel only because of its smaler high-induction component. The abrupt increase in <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> due to very small plastic deformation is strongly related to the high-induction loss component. These results are discussed in terms of energy dissipation mechanisms such as domain wall movement, irreversible rotation and domain wall energy dissipation at domain nucleation and annihilation.

50|$|Ferrites {{that are}} used in {{transformer}} or electromagnetic cores contain nickel, zinc, and/or manganese compounds. They have a low coercivity and are called soft ferrites. The low coercivity means the material's magnetization can easily reverse direction without dissipating much energy (<b>hysteresis</b> <b>losses),</b> while the material's high resistivity prevents eddy currents in the core, another source of energy loss. Because of their comparatively low losses at high frequencies, they are extensively used in the cores of RF transformers and inductors in applications such as switched-mode power supplies and loopstick antennas used in AM radios.|$|E
50|$|In a {{resistive}} FCL, {{the current}} passes directly through the superconductor.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to test three {{flexible}} polyurethane foams for mattress for comfort and durability. In particular, they were investigated the effects of foam composition and cell architecture on some physical-mechanical properties of interest for bedding applications and related to foam comfort levels (i. e. surface firmness, <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> and resistance to bottoming out), and their changes after artificial weathering due to moisture and temperature. The results demonstrated that all the three foams have open cell morphology and similar cell structure, with average cell diameters ranging from 430 to 510 micron and wide cell size distribution. As a consequence, they also show comparable water vapor transport behavior. On the contrary, their mechanical response, in terms of <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss,</b> surface firmness and resistance to bottoming out, was found strongly dependent on their chemical structure and molecular mobility, as inferred from infrared spectroscopy analysis. During accelerated weathering all the foams undergo oxidations that affected their comfort factors in static conditions, giving a progressive lowering of <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss,</b> surface firmness and resistance to bottoming out, particularly for the two foams having lower crosslinking level and thus slow recovery rate after compression...|$|R
