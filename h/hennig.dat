50|$|When Harley Race {{returned}} to the AWA in 1984, he wrestled <b>Hennig's</b> son, Curt - a match that was fueled by Larry <b>Hennig's</b> confronting his former tag team partner {{at the end of}} the match. The following year, Curt's first major push would be alongside his father in a feud with The Road Warriors. The <b>Hennigs</b> were unsuccessful in their bid to win the tag titles but proved to be worthy opponents, an attempt by the AWA to raise Curt's clout amongst fans. It was during this time that Curt became one of the biggest stars of the company and Larry's career came to a close. Before Larry's retirement in 1985, however, the <b>Hennigs</b> would win the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship.|$|R

5|$|LeDuc {{made his}} AWA {{television}} debut on August 2, 1975 defeating Angel Rivera. LeDuc was given wins over Buddy Wolff and Boris Breznikoff (Nicolai Volkoff) before forming {{the team with}} Larry <b>Hennig.</b> Leduc and <b>Hennig</b> first teamed on September 12, 1975 in Denver, Colorado losing to Jimmy and Johnny Valiant. Leduc and <b>Hennig</b> feuded with the Valiant Brothers for several months before entering a feud with Baron Von Raschke and Mad Dog Vachon. Jos and Larry also received a few title shots against AWA tag champs Blackjack Lanza and Bobby Duncum in August 1976. Probably his most memorable accomplishment while working for the promotion was a bus-pulling stunt filmed in Minneapolis that was also used in promo videos while appearing in the Memphis and Atlanta territories, among others. LeDuc departed the AWA in September 1976.|$|E

5|$|Unaware that <b>Hennig</b> {{had already}} defined a lectotype, Peter Galton {{selected}} two dorsal vertebrae, specimens MB.R.1930 and MB.R.1931, from the material figured in Hennig's 1915 description, as 'holotypes'. This {{definition of a}} holotype is not valid, because Hennig's selection has priority. In 2011, Heinrich Mallison clarified that all the material known to <b>Hennig</b> in 1915, i.e. all the bones discovered before 1912, when Hermann Heck concluded the last German excavations, are paralectotypes, and that MB.R.4800 is the correct lectotype.|$|E
5000|$|Nelson & Platnick (1981) {{also note}} that: [...] "all of <b>Hennig’s</b> groups {{correspond}} by definition to patterns of synapomorphy. Indeed, <b>Hennig’s</b> trees are frequently called synapomorphy schemes. The concept of ‘patterns within patterns’ seems, therefore, an empirical generalization.” Pattern cladists hence regard synapomorphies to be patterns free of processes.|$|R

5|$|In the {{original}} description, <b>Hennig</b> did not designate a holotype specimen. However, in a detailed monography on the osteology, systematic position and palaeobiology of Kentrosaurus in 1925, <b>Hennig</b> picked {{the most complete}} partial skeleton, today inventorised as MB.R.4800.1 through MB.R.4800.37, as a lectotype (see syntype). This material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae, several vertebrae of the back, a sacrum with five sacral vertebrae and both ilia, both femora and an ulna, and {{is included in the}} mounted skeleton at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The type locality is Kindope, Tanzania, near the Tendaguru hill.|$|E
5|$|A single large wing from {{a species}} of Diptera in the Triassic (10mm instead of usual 2–6mm) was found in Australia (Mt. Crosby).This family Tilliardipteridae, despite of the {{numerous}} 'tipuloid' features, {{should be included in}} Psychodomorpha sensu <b>Hennig</b> on account of loss of the convex distal 1A reaching wing margin and formation of the anal loop.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Adams was {{put into}} nWo Black and White or nWo B-Team, a group of mid-card nWo wrestlers of the nWo Reunion after both nWo factions united. Adams {{was put into}} a {{partnership}} with Horace Hogan and the two participated in a tournament to crown the new World Tag Team Champions. They ousted Billy Kidman and Chavo Guerrero, Jr. and Faces of Fear before losing to Curt <b>Hennig</b> and Barry Windham and Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko in semi-final matches.|$|E
5|$|The {{type and}} sole {{accepted}} species of Kentrosaurus is Kentrosaurus aethiopicus, named by <b>Hennig</b> in 1915. Fragmentary fossil material from Wyoming, named Stegosaurus longispinus by Charles Gilmore in 1914, was in 1993 {{classified as a}} North American species of Kentrosaurus, as K. longispinus. However, this action was not accepted by the paleontological community, and S. longispinus has been assigned to its own genus, Alcovasaurus, differing from Kentrosaurus in having more elongated tail spikes {{and the structure of}} the pelvis and vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and Amy <b>Hennig</b> {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of the characters were meant to highlight different aspects of Drake's personality. Reception to {{the characters in the}} series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of the characters and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator pointed out that the women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hennig's</b> {{works in}} Stuttgart dealt almost {{exclusively}} with taxonomic revisions of Dipterans. For the Stuttgarter Beiträge zur Naturkunde, where he published {{the majority of}} his works, he completed 29 issues {{by the end of his}} life. Significant are the review articles published in Erwin Lindner's Flies of the Palaearctic Regions and the Handbuch der Zoologie. The cladistic methodology was also represented in several published works, foremost among them the article, Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification? A reply to Ernst Mayr (1974), intended as an internationally accessible reply to the criticism Ernst Mayr had made of <b>Hennig's</b> phylogenetic systematics.|$|R

Adams made his in-ring debut on the February 19 episode of Thunder in a tag team match with nWo teammate Curt <b>Hennig</b> against Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart, with the match resulting in a double disqualification. The nWo split in April 1998 and Adams chose to join Hollywood Hogan's nWo Hollywood faction. Adams made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at Slamboree against Lex Luger in a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other studies have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi <b>Hennig</b> helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
5|$|Fertig {{was part}} of plans for a faction to feud with The Undertaker in mid-2008, however, he {{underwent}} hip surgery in September, and the plans did not proceed. He competed in his final match in FCW on December 4, when he, Sheamus, and Gavin Spears were defeated by Joe <b>Hennig,</b> Johnny Prime, and Eric Escobar in a six-man elimination match. In January 2009, he was offered a new contract with WWE, but turned it down. As a result, WWE {{announced that he had}} been released from contract by request on January 9, although his contract did not technically end until April 5, preventing him from wrestling for other promotions.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hennig</b> and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Kentrosaurus {{was a small}} stegosaur. It had {{the typical}} dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a small head, a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, {{horizontal}} and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs {{and an array of}} plates and spikes running along both sides of the top mid-line of the animal. Only a single complete tooth was known when <b>Hennig</b> published his monography in 1925. Later, a part of a dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the front lower jaw, was found, which bears a just emerging tooth, and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges.|$|E
25|$|In WCW, Rude {{became a}} member of the New World Order (nWo), {{managing}} his friend Curt <b>Hennig.</b> Thus, Rude became the first wrestler to be part of both DX and nWo. When the nWo split, <b>Hennig</b> and Rude joined the nWo Wolfpac, and they tried to motivate Konnan to defeat Goldberg, who was undefeated at the time. When Konnan was defeated by Goldberg, Rude and <b>Hennig</b> attacked him, later joining nWo Hollywood, the rivals of the Wolfpac. By late 1998, both Rude and <b>Hennig</b> were off WCW television due to injuries. <b>Hennig</b> had an ongoing leg injury that year, and Rude was thought to have had testicular cancer which later turned out to be a spermatocele. <b>Hennig</b> returned to the nWo from his injury at Starrcade without Rude, who was still unable to appear. Rude officially left WCW in March 1999.|$|E
5000|$|There is some scepticism among biogeographers {{about the}} {{usefulness}} of general rules. For example, J.C.
