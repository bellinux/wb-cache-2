40|$|Guiding systems {{used for}} {{transfer}} of cryogenic pellets to the tokamak inboard currently undergo optimisation to possibly extend the operational range of Inboard pellet injection scenarios. Work reported {{here has been}} concentrating on experimental studies and calculations of pellet mass loss during transfer in a guiding tube {{as a function of}} pellet parameters such as velocity and ice composition, and <b>guiding</b> <b>track</b> characteristics such as vacuum conductance, geometry, size and shape of cross-section. Results from ASDEX Upgrade and ORNL systems suggest, that centripetal loads on the pellets due to small radii bends in the systems strongly increase the erosion of pellet ice. A deleterious effect of accumulated gas due to sublimated D₂-ice blocking the tube and eroding subsequent pellets has been found. However, an efficient vacuum pumping set up for a given pellet repetition rate can significantly improve the mass conservation with respect to closed tube systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the process}} of train operation, the {{interaction}} between train wheels and railway track underneath leads to changes in track geometry. Changes in track geometry result in track irregularity. For managing the mean value of track irregularity, Railway Maintenance Department in China uses track quality index (TQI) to quantify track irregularity of a unit track section. TQI is used for planning and scheduling railway track maintenance and <b>guiding</b> <b>track</b> maintenance work in China. Based {{on the characteristics of}} changes in TQI and in accordance with differential and integral principles, a novel track irregularity prediction technique has been developed in this article. This technique utilizes track waveform data generated by a track geometry car to build different track irregularity prediction models for each unit section and use different models to make predictions for TQIs of different unit sections along the railway track on each day in a future short-range period of time. In this article, the technique was applied to 25 sets of track waveforms generated for Beijing–Shanghai railway up-going track (Jing–Hu up-going track) administrated by Jinan Railway Bureau and errors in predicted TQI were analysed in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The error analysis results show that some maintenance works, such as temping, levelling, and aligning have significant influence on TQI predictions. The methods for weakening the influence of such track maintenance and the usage of TQI predictions were also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} a new biomedical / open surgical instrument to assist surgeon in applying surgical clips to patient’s body tissue and blood vessel during surgical processes. The new clip delivery {{system is designed}} to better the clip’s distal advance through internal clip channel, jaw <b>guiding</b> <b>track,</b> and all other transition areas to keep surgical clip from accidental shooting out during clip’s distal move into jaws. Currently the clip distal move in normal surgical instrument is usually driven by compression springs and some complains of clip accidental drop-off were recorded in surgical procedures. Because higher request of dimensional tolerance and better component surface quality are needed in case the compression springs are used as driven force, a little dimensional devia-tion or less qualified part surface produced from manufacturing processes will potentially cause surgical clip device malfunction or misfiring of the clips. It is clearly known that the jaws can seriously sever or damage patient’s blood ves-sel or body tissue {{if there is no}} clip inside the jaws due to accidental clip drop-off, when surgeons close instrument handles. The improved internal system design in this new open surgical instrument can prevent clip from accidental drop-off because of well guided and controlled clip distal move through internal clip channel and track. Besides the operational force to fully form clip is lower than existing surgical clip devices due to better mechanical advantage in this new instrument design. In addition to the above, manufacturing and product cost can be decreased since lower requirement of dimensional tolerance and surface quality of instrumental parts is allowed in this new surgical instrument design. This new instrumental prototype is build upon the analysis of computer aided modeling and simulation to prove its good mechanical advantage, feasible function, reliable performance. The preliminary results of instrument fir-ing force from both computer aided modeling and prototype testing are very close to each other, and preliminary prototype testing shows no accidental clip drop-off in this new biomedical / surgical clip instrument...|$|E

40|$|Known {{facilities}} are basically not universally applicable since {{the size of}} the workpieces to be treated is dependent on the dimensions of the recipients, i. e. their volume. This means that with small workpieces, a considerably large volume is evacuated. The problem therefore exists of creating a device adaptable to the workpiece size. According to the invention, the device consists of a middle section acting as the recipient said middle section containing all the modules required for the process in addition to the electron gun. Segments are flanged vacuum-tight to the middle section. On both sides, there is an end piece arranged in the same way, whereby one is formed as a door. Each part of the recipient contains a <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> to transport the workpiece carrier through the device. Said <b>guide</b> <b>tracks</b> join up to form a continuous <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> when mounted side by side.

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{existence}} of relative motion between the grinding machine body and working table, the manufacturing error of <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> {{would result in}} a considerable grinding error inevitably. Thus the guide direction error becomes the most important static error source for longitudinal cylindrical grinding. In this paper, an error compensation system based on industrial computer was developed and used to counteract the guide direction error. In order to verify the performance of the proposed system, several grinding experiments were carried out. The experimental results show that the grinding error due to <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> error reduces by about 33 % using the error compensation system...|$|R
