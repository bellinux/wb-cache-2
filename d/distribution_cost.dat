The model features two types of transport costs (iceberg <b>costs</b> and <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> in terms of nontradables) and incomplete markets.

40|$|Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (International Real Business Cycles, JPE, 100 (4), 1992) {{documented}} several {{discrepancies between}} the observed post-war business cycles of developed {{countries and the}} predictions of a two-country, complete-market model. The main discrepancy termed as the â€œquantity anomalyâ€ that cross-country consumption correlations are {{higher than that of}} output in the model as opposed to data, has remained a central puzzle in international economics. In order to resolve this puzzle mainly two strategies: restrictions on asset trade, and introducing non-traded goods in the model, have been employed by researchers. While these extensions have been successful in closing the gap to some extent, the ordering of correlations has stayed unchanged: consumption correlations still exceed that of output. This paper attempts to resolve the quantity puzzle by introducing non-traded <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> in the retailing of traded goods. In a standard two-good model traded output and traded consumption, by definition, are identical goods. With <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> traded output and consumption are two distinct entities as each unit of final traded consumption good incorporates a unit of traded good and a fixed amount of non-traded goods. Thus, effectively, the model with <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> {{can be viewed as a}} model without <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> but with a modified utility function that has a substantially stronger complementarity between traded and non-traded goods. In a simple two-good extension of the Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland model, it is shown that the cross-country consumption and output correlations are 0. 55 and 0. 30, respectively, whereas with <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> consumption correlation reduces to 0. 09, output correlation to 0. 23. Incorporating <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> in addition, improves the model’s performance in matching the volatility of real exchange rates and the correlation of net exports with output. These improvements are achieved without sacrificing the model's performance in any other dimension. open economy business cycles; quantity puzzle; <b>distribution</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Artículos en revistasThis paper proposes an {{approach}} to calibrate incentives for continuity of supply in electricity distribution in Spain. This approach consists on the estimation {{of the impact of}} continuity of supply improvements on <b>distribution</b> network <b>costs.</b> For this purpose, <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> resulting from different continuity of supply requirements are computed by a Reference Network Model (RNM). The results obtained from the RNM are used to estimate a cost-function that considers continuity of supply a <b>cost</b> driver for <b>distribution</b> <b>costs.</b> This methodology is applied to three Spanish areas of service (an urban one, a semi-urban one and a rural one) {{in such a way that}} differences in <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> caused by the characteristics of the area type can be taken into account. The analysis indicated that <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> are more sensitive to continuity of supply improvements in rural areas of service. It also demonstrated that the incentive for reducing number of service interruptions should be higher than the incentive for reducing duration of service interruptions. Finally, the current Spanish incentive scheme for continuity of supply was analyzed under the perspective of the proposed approach. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Economies {{of scale}} in {{infrastructure}} are a recognised factor in urban agglomeration. Less recognised {{is the effect}} of <b>distribution</b> or access <b>costs.</b> Infrastructure can be classified as: (a) Area-type (e. g. utilities); or (b) Point-type (e. g. hospitals). The former involves <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> the latter access costs. Taking water supply as an example of Area-type infrastructure, the interaction between production <b>costs</b> and <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> at settlement level is investigated using data from England & Wales and the USA. Plant level economies of scale in water production are confirmed, and quantified. Water <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> are analysed using a new measure of water distribution output (which combines volume and distance), and modelling distribution areas as monocentric settlements. Unit <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> are shown to be characterised by scale economies with respect to volume but diseconomies with respect to average distance to properties. It follows that higher settlement densities reduce unit <b>distribution</b> <b>costs,</b> while lower densities raise them. The interaction with production costs then means that (a) higher urban density (“Densification”) is characterised by economies of scale in both production and distribution; (b) more spread out settlement (“Dispersion”) leads to diseconomies in distribution; (c) “Suburbanisation” (expansion into lower density peripheral areas) lies in between, with roughly constant returns to scale, taking production and distribution together; and (d) “Constant density” expansion leads to small economies of scale. Keeping (per capita) water supply costs low thus appears to depend as much on density as size. Tentative generalisation suggests similar effects with other Area-type infrastructure (sewerage, electricity supply, telecommunications); and with Point-type infrastructure (such as hospitals), viewing access <b>costs</b> as <b>distribution</b> <b>costs</b> in reverse. It follows that the presumption in urban economics that such services are always characterised by economies of scale and therefore conducive to agglomeration may not be correct...|$|R

Alastair Fothergill and Andy Byatt are credited as directors, and six cinematographers were also credited: Doug Allan, Mike deGruy, Peter Scoones, Simon King, Rick Rosenthal, and Bob Cranston. The idea for Deep Blue developed from when a shorter version of The Blue Planet was cut for The Proms in 2002 and for which George Fenton composed a score. When BBC Worldwide partnered with Greenlight Media and the latter helped {{raise money for the}} film, the filmmakers reviewed over 70,000 hours of raw footage from The Blue Planet. Ultimately, a quarter of Deep Blue consisted of footage not shown in The Blue Planet. Producer Sophokles Tasioulis said, [...] "There's not a single cut in the movie that's the same as the TV series." [...] The film contains only 15 lines of narrative. Filmmakers enlisted Fenton to compose the film's score, which was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic in their cinematic debut. Voiceovers were also recorded for different countries. Production of the theatrical version cost £2.8 million, while marketing and <b>distribution</b> <b>cost</b> an additional £1 million.|$|E
50|$|The {{food supply}} for the population, and {{particularly}} for the Parisians, was a major economic and political problem {{before and during the}} Revolution; it had led to food riots in Paris and attacks on the Convention. To assure the supply of food to the sans-culottes in Paris, the base of support of the Jacobins, the Convention had strictly regulated grain distribution and set maximum prices for bread and other essential products. As the value of the currency dropped, the fixed prices soon did not cover the cost of production, and supplies dropped. The Convention was forced to abolish the maximum on 24 December 1794, but it continued to buy huge quantities of bread and meat which it distributed at low prices to the Parisians. This Paris food <b>distribution</b> <b>cost</b> {{a large part of the}} national budget, and was resented by the rest of the country, which did not have that benefit. By early 1796, the grain supply was supplemented by deliveries from Italy and even from Algeria. Despite the increased imports, the grain supply to Paris was not enough. The Ministry of the Interior reported on 23 March 1796 that there was only enough wheat to make bread for five days, and there were shortages of meat and firewood. The Directory was forced to resume deliveries of subsidized food to the very poor, the elderly, the sick, and government employees. The food shortages and high prices were one factor in the growth of discontent and the Gracchus Babeuf's uprising, the Conspiracy of the Equals, in 1796. The harvests were good in the following years and the food supplies improved considerably, but the supply was still precarious in the north, the west, the southeast, and the valley of the Seine.|$|E
