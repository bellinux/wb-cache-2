5|$|Sheindlin has {{authored}} seven books. In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her insight into <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999. A New York Times best seller, the book challenges women {{to be the best}} they can be.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> disease develops, {{as well as providing}} ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E

25|$|Debate {{persists}} as to <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> British {{lost the}} battle. Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, {{as opposed to}} the strategic lapses and failings in grand tactics on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.|$|E

Susan Bayly, on the other hand, states that jati system emerged because it offered a source of advantage in an era of pre-Independence poverty, lack of institutional human rights, volatile political environment, and economic insecurity.|$|E

Yet, the Central Bank had the power to issue directives to the Financial Regulator if it thought it was conducting its business in a way that was contrary to overall Central Bank policy aims. None were issued.|$|E

Its {{purpose is to}} provide an overview {{to a number of}} approaches toward the economic aspects of feudalism and to indicate promising directions in this field for comparative economists. To this end, four major questions are discussed: What is feudalism? <b>How</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> did <b>the</b> feudal economic system emerge? What are the short-term economic mechanisms within a feudal economy? <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> did <b>the</b> feudal economic system decline...|$|R
25|$|The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge {{conspiracy}} theory {{is the argument}} that U.S. Government officials had advance knowledge of Japan's December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Ever since the Japanese attack there has been debate as to <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> United States had been caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans for an attack. In September 1944, John T. Flynn, a co-founder of the non-interventionist America First Committee, launched Pearl Harbor revisionism when he published a forty-six page booklet entitled The Truth about Pearl Harbor.|$|E
25|$|As the social, political, and {{cultural}} influences change a society, most historians revise and update their explanation of historical events. The old consensus, based upon limited evidence, might {{no longer be}} considered historically valid in explaining the particulars — of cause and effect, of motivation and self-interest — that tell <b>How?</b> <b>and</b> <b>Why?</b> <b>the</b> past occurred as it occurred; therefore, the historical revisionism of the factual record is revised to concord with the contemporary understanding of history. As such, in 1986, the historian John Hope Franklin described four stages in the historiography of the African experience {{of life in the}} U.S., which were based upon different models of historical consensus.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, 2008 General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made {{a public}} {{announcement}} that the U.S. intended {{to shoot down}} USA-193. In this announcement he laid out several criteria into when, <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> satellite would be shot down. The major objective was {{to reduce the risk}} to space, air and terrestrial platforms. He explained that they would wait for the shuttle to land, so the potential harm to the shuttle would not be a factor. Next they wanted to wait until the satellite was close to re-entry, this would limit the amount of space debris created. Finally, {{they did not want to}} let the satellite enter the earth’s atmosphere because of its non-aerodynamic characteristics, which would make it extremely hard to intercept. He suggested that these criteria gave them an eight-day window.|$|E

25|$|Plants {{demonstrate}} {{best the}} great {{value of the}} exceptional preservation of the Rhynie chert. The presence of soft tissue, including parenchyma, is not observed elsewhere in the fossil record until the advent of amber in the Triassic. This allows the study of structures such as the air spaces behind stomata, whereas the conventional record at its best allows {{no more than the}} counting of stomata. It has also enabled paleobotanists to firmly deduce that plants such as Aglaophyton were not aquatic, as once believed. Further, as plants are preserved in situ, the study of exactly <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> branching patterns of the early plants emerged is possible, whereas typical fossils only show that branching was present. The analysis of rhizomes and rhizoids makes it possible to discern which plants had an active water uptake system (e.g. Horneophyton), and which were likely to have colonised waterlogged surfaces (Asteroxylon). In some cases, it is possible to see different mechanisms of repairing wounds, and to deduce that they were caused by fungal or bacterial infection.|$|E
25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} {{both kinds of}} {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E
25|$|From {{the sociological}} perspective, group {{processes}} scholars study how power, status, justice, and legitimacy impact {{the structure and}} interactions that take place within groups. Group processes scholars study how group size affects the type and quality of interactions that take place between group members, an area of study initiated {{by the work of}} the German social theorist, Georg Simmel. Dyads consist of two people and triads consist of three people, and the fundamental difference is that one person who leaves a dyad dissolves that group whereas the same is not true of a triad. The difference between these two types of groups also indicates the fundamental nature of group size, which is that every additional member of a group increases the group's stability but also decreases the possible amount of intimacy or interactions between any two members. Groups are also distinguished in terms of <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> members know each other, and this stems from whether they are members of primary groups consisting of close friends and family held together by expressive ties; secondary groups consisting of coworkers, colleagues, classmates, etc. held together by instrumental ties; or reference groups consisting of people who do not necessarily know or interact with each other but who use each other for standards of comparison for appropriate behaviors. Group processes researchers also study interactions between groups, such {{as in the case of}} Muzafer Sherif's Robbers Cave Experiment.|$|E

500|$|Back in {{the world}} of academia, Du Bois was able to resume his study of Reconstruction, the topic of the 1910 paper that he {{presented}} to the American Historical Association. In 1935, he published his magnum opus, Black Reconstruction in America.Aptheker, Herbert (1989), The literary legacy of W. E. B. Du Bois, Kraus International Publications, p. 211 (Du Bois called the work his [...] "magnum opus"). The book presented the thesis, {{in the words of the}} historian David Levering Lewis, that [...] "black people, suddenly admitted to citizenship in an environment of feral hostility, displayed admirable volition and intelligence as well as the indolence and ignorance inherent in three centuries of bondage." [...] Du Bois documented how black people were central figures in the American Civil War and Reconstruction, and also showed how they made alliances with white politicians. He provided evidence that the coalition governments established public education in the South, and many needed social service programs. The book also demonstrated the ways in which black emancipation– the crux of Reconstruction– promoted a radical restructuring of United States society, as well as <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> country failed to continue support for civil rights for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction.|$|E
