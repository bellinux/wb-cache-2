40|$|Abstract: We {{identify}} the penalties incurred in all-optical networks on routing and restoration operations. We show that these penalties {{can be avoided}} if we replace the transparent switches with opaque switches interfaced by transponders. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) mesh networks that route optical connections using wavelength selective optical cross-connects (OXCs) have been proposed to implement next generation networks. In a DWDM network, optical paths on specific wavelengths are set up through the action of OXCs. All Optical Switches (AOS) are OXCs that perform elementary functions such as wavelength routing and switching with all operations executed in the optical domain, thereby providing end-to-end transparent “clear ” channels (optical connections). Because {{of the absence of}} wavelength conversion the constraint of wavelength continuity applies to all optical connections: a signal must remain on the same wavelength from source to destination. The restriction imposed by wavelength continuity can be avoided in an opaque network built as point-to-point DWDM systems with transponders and switches connecting the DWDM channels. The switch fabric in this scenario can be either optical or electrical. In a switch with Optical/Electronic interface (OE switch) the incoming optical signal is converted to an electronic signal, routed and converted back to the optical domain, possibly on a different wavelength. Following a wave of timely technological breakthroughs, optical network vendors are now announcing a variety of all optical gears capable of redirecting light without <b>electronic</b> <b>intervention.</b> However, there is much ambiguity about th...|$|E

METHODS: We conducted systematic searches of English-language, peer-reviewed publications in MEDLINE and EMBASE, 1966 through December 31, 2008. We selected randomized controlled trials of interventions to improve adherence to medications for preventing or treating cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Articles were classified based on {{mode of delivery}} of the main intervention as (1) person-independent interventions (mailed, faxed, or hand distributed; or delivered via electronic interface) or (2) person-dependent interventions (nonautomated phone calls, in-person interventions).

40|$|Background: Smoking {{is harmful}} to health. On average, lifelong smokers lose 10 years of life, {{and about half}} of all lifelong smokers have their lives {{shortened}} by smoking. Stopping smoking reverses or prevents many of these harms. However, cessation services in the NHS achieve variable success rates with smokers who want to quit. Approaches to behaviour change can be supplemented with electronic aids, and this may significantly increase quit rates and prevent a proportion of cases that relapse. Objective: The primary research question we sought to answer was: What is the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of internet, PC and other electronic aids to help people stop smoking? We addressed the following three questions: (1) What is the effectiveness of internet sites, computer programs, mobile telephone text messages and other electronic aids for smoking cessation and/or reducing relapse? (2) What is the costeffectiveness of incorporating internet sites, computer programs, mobile telephone text messages and other electronic aids into current NHS smoking cessation programmes? and (3) What are the current gaps in research into the effectiveness of internet sites, computer programs, mobile telephone text messages and other electronic aids to help people stop smoking? Data sources: For the effectiveness review, relevant primary studies were sought from The Cochrane Library [Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ] 2009, Issue 4, and MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC) (Ovid) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost) from 1980 to December 2009. In addition, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) were searched for information on cost-effectiveness and modelling for the same period. Reference lists of included studies and of relevant systematic reviews were examined to identify further potentially relevant studies. Research registries of ongoing studies including National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database, Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials. gov were also searched, and further information was sought from contacts with experts. Review methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating smoking cessation programmes that utilise computer, internet, mobile telephone or other electronic aids in adult smokers were included in the effectiveness review. Relevant studies of other design were included in the cost-effectiveness review and supplementary review. Pair-wise meta-analyses using both random- and fixed-effects models were carried out. Bayesian mixed-treatment comparisons (MTCs) were also performed. A de novo decision-analytical model was constructed for estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was calculated. Narrative synthesis of key themes and issues that may influence the acceptability and usability of electronic aids was provided in the supplementary review. Results: This effectiveness review included 60 RCTs/quasi-RCTs reported in 77 publications. Pooled estimate for prolonged abstinence [relative risk (RR) = 1. 32, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 21 to 1. 45] and point prevalence abstinence (RR = 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 07 to 1. 22) suggested that computer and other electronic aids increase the likelihood of cessation compared with no intervention or generic self-help materials. There {{was no significant difference in}} effect sizes between aid to cessation studies (which provide support to smokers who are ready to quit) and cessation induction studies (which attempt to encourage a cessation attempt in smokers who are not yet ready to quit). Results from MTC also showed small but significant intervention effect (time to relapse, mean hazard ratio 0. 87, 95 % credible interval 0. 83 to 0. 92). Cost-threshold analyses indicated some form of <b>electronic</b> <b>intervention</b> is likely to be cost-effective when added to non-electronic behavioural support, but there is substantial uncertainty with regard to what the most effective (thus most cost-effective) type of <b>electronic</b> <b>intervention</b> is, which warrants further research. EVPI calculations suggested the upper limit for the benefit of this research is around £ 2000 - 3000 per person. Limitations: The review focuses on smoking cessation programmes in the adult population, but does not cover smoking cessation in adolescents. Most available evidence relates to interventions with a single tailored component, while evidence for different modes of delivery (e. g. e-mail, text messaging) is limited. Therefore, the findings of lack of sufficient evidence for proving or refuting effectiveness should not be regarded as evidence of ineffectiveness. We have examined only a small number of factors that could potentially influence the effectiveness of the interventions. A comprehensive evaluation of potential effect modifiers at study level in a systematic review of complex interventions remains challenging. Information presented in published papers is often insufficient to allow accurate coding of each intervention or comparator. A limitation of the cost-effectiveness analysis, shared with several previous cost-effectiveness analyses of smoking cessation interventions, is that intervention benefit is restricted to the first quit attempt. Exploring the impact of interventions on subsequent attempts requires more detailed information on patient event histories than is available from current evidence. Conclusions: Our effectiveness review concluded that computer and other electronic aids increase the likelihood of cessation compared with no intervention or generic self-help materials, but the effect is small. The effectiveness does not appear to vary with respect to mode of delivery and concurrent non-electronic co-interventions. Our cost-effectiveness review suggests that making some form of electronic support available to smokers actively seeking to quit is highly likely to be cost-effective.

However, compliance remains at or below 50 %. 1 To improve compliance, a growing number of hand hygiene compliance interventions apply electronics-based technologies in their methods for measurement and feedback. We describe these as automated/semiauto-mated interventions (ASAIs) in recognition of the fact that human data gathering is becoming more automated with technology. Existing peer-reviewed studies are important criteria in evaluating technology concepts. 2, 3 However, there is little evidence-based research documenting the reliability of installation-ready devices in 1 or more clinical settings. The limited availability of peer-reviewed clinical studies that evaluate and compare installation-ready systems often leaves the infection control team with no option but to make decisions from non-peer-reviewed marketing messages.

We interviewed 15 study participants to investigate why they had declined the appointment and what sort of help they might prefer to receive. Results: Ten patients (five in each group) accepted an appointment, and one patient (control) attended. Most interviewees’ did not see their drinking as a problem or were confident they could manage it by themselves.

40|$|ODL 12 Conference paperIn 2005 I joined Unisa {{as part of}} {{the merger}} between the former Unisa, Technikon Southern Africa (TSA) and Vista University for {{distance}} education (Vudec). I {{became a member of the}} Economics 1 A team since I was involved in the teaching of Economics I and II at the former Technikon Southern Africa. When I joined Unisa the pass rate for Economics IA had for a number of years not been above 25 % per semester. I became the module leader for Economics 1 A (ECS 1501) in 2009. Knowing the subsidy formula has changed to a greater emphasis on so-called “through-put” rates, that the strategic vision of the University of South Africa was to incorporate technology more as a learner support and tuition tool as part of Open Distance Learning (ODL), and lastly, the given low pass rates, I decided to use the myUnisa platform extensively in an attempt to improve the pass rate for Economics 1 A. The purpose of this paper is to indicate how the use of the myUnisa announcement function, the additional resources function, the discussion forum and the tutor project site, have assisted in improving the pass rate for Economics 1 A. Indirect benefits of using the myUnisa platform to communicate with students and tutors were also the reduction in telephone calls and e-mails that were sent to the Economics Department. Using myUnisa enhanced the ability of students to understand more general questions regarding module content and administrative matters. Furthermore, the involvement of tutors in the summative assessment also contributed not only to the improvement of attendance at tutorial classes and discussion classes of lecturers, but also the number of visits to the Economics module website.

40|$|Introduction: In {{transitioning}} from adolescence to adulthood, {{college students}} are faced with significant challenges to their health habits. Time, independence and stress {{have been known to}} result in poor eating and exercise habits which can lead to increased disease risk. Objective: To assess whether an electronic health intervention can improve health habits in college students. Methods: A 24 -week diet and physical activity program was delivered by e-mail to 148 college students. The intervention involved weekly tailored, interactive diet and physical activity goals. The control group received non-diet-non-exercise-related health fact sheets. Baseline, 12 -week, and 24 -week diet and physical activity surveys were completed online. BMI, neck circumference, waist circumference, and percent fat mass (FM%) by bioelectrical impedance analysis were measured at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Results: Students were 18 - 20 years old 70 % female from a diverse college campus (46 % Caucasian, 23 % Asian, 20 % African American, 5 % Hispanic, and 6 % other). At baseline, 23 % were overweight/obese by BMI, 88 % reported consuming 10 % of kcalories from saturated fat, although 91 % met or exceeded 150 minutes/week of moderate-vigorous exercise. Seventy-one percent of students completed all study visits. Repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant treatment by linear time interaction for saturated fat. A significant change from baseline saturated fat intake was detected between the treatment groups at week 24 (mean change ± standard error 0. 7 ± 0. 42 % of kcal for control and - 0. 3 ± 0. 30 % of kcal for intervention). Differences in saturated fat intake between the two treatment groups were more evident in those whose intake exceeded recommendations. BMI, neck circumference, waist circumference, FM%, weekly minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity as well as intake of fruit, vegetables, and added sugar were not significantly different between treatment groups. Conclusion: College students enrolled in an interactive electronic health intervention decreased saturated fat intake compared to control. Furthermore, the decrease observed in the intervention group was mainly due to those whose intake of saturated fat intake was above the recommended 10 % of total kcalories.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research presents the design and evaluation of an intervention that introduces modification of time perceptions {{as one of the}} solutions to promote sustainable behaviours. It is demonstrated in this thesis that unnecessary energy use is often caused by temporal tensions, defined as the relation between actions to be performed and available time. This research proposes {{that it is possible to}} deliberately reduce temporal tensions, and this can motivate people to behave more sustainably. Persuasive technology and human-computer interaction provided the tools needed to manipulate time perceptions and therefore bring about changes in the specific behaviours that result in unnecessary energy usage. Previous studies indicate that behaviours play an important role in energy consumption. From the different domains of energy use that could be examined, cooking was chosen to be the platform where the studies on behaviour change and energy use would take place. How behaviours influence energy use motivated the design of empirical studies to understand behaviours related to domestic energy use and identify what are the determinants of these behaviours. Each determinant was related to a strategy to be included on a behaviour change intervention. A wider survey was developed to understand students acceptance of a set of proposed energy saving techniques, and resulted in a vast volume of information about user preferences and intentions to perform the suggested energy saving behaviours for cooking. It emerged that participants rushed into the cooking tasks without much deliberation, consequently not following preparation procedures and thus using more energy. Information gathered during the first studies also showed that participants behaviours were partially motivated by the need to speed up the cooking process in order to reduce boredom when they were waiting for the food to cook, consequently resulting in extra energy usage. The knowledge gathered from the preceding steps and a literature review informed the design of strategies to modify the non-sustainable behaviours and promote energy saving. A user-centred design process involving an idea generation session and scenario analysis was used to provide a set of strategies to be embedded in an intervention, containing the specific methods to tackle the correspondent determinants of behaviours. The specific needs of the cooking activity indicated that an <b>electronic</b> <b>intervention</b> was an adequate platform to be implemented and tested. Two high resolution working prototypes of the electronic interventions were developed as mobile phone applications. The final study comprised the evaluation of the proposed interventions in improving aspects of the cooking activity, the acceptance of the interventions and effectiveness in promoting energy saving...|$|E

40|$|Systematic quality {{improvement}} (QI) interventions are increasingly used to change complex health care systems. Results of randomized clinical trials can provide quantitative evidence whether QI interventions were effective {{but they do}} not teach us why and how QI was (not) achieved. Qualitative research methods can answer these questions but typically involve only a small group of respondents against high resources. Concept mapping methodology overcomes these drawbacks by integrating results from qualitative group sessions with multivariate statistical analysis to represent ideas of diverse stakeholders visually on maps in an efficient way. This paper aims to describe how to use concept mapping to qualitatively gain insight into barriers and facilitators of an <b>electronic</b> QI <b>intervention</b> and presents experiences with the method from an ongoing case study to evaluate a QI system in the field of cardiac rehabilitation in the Netherland...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} in {{the conceptual}} model {{was that a}} user-driven innovation in presently available information and communication technology infrastructure {{would be able to}} meet patient and health professional users information needs and help them attain better health outcomes. An operational model was created to plan a trial on a sample diabetic population utilizing a randomized control trial design, assigning one randomly selected group of diabetics to receive <b>electronic</b> information <b>intervention</b> and analyse if it would improve their health outcomes in comparison with a matched diabetic population who would only receive regular medical intervention. Diabetes was chosen for this particular trial, as it is a major chronic illness in Malaysia as elsewhere in the world. It is in essence a position paper for how the study concept should be organized to stimulate wider discussion prior to beginning the study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop and evaluate methods for conducting cluster randomised trials in a primary care database that contains electronic patient records for large numbers of family practices. Cluster randomised trials are trials in which the units allocated represent groups of individuals, in this case family practices and their registered patients. Cluster randomised trials often suffer from the limitation that they include too few clusters, leading to problems of insufficient power and only imprecise estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient, a key design parameter. This difficulty might be overcome by utilising databases that already hold electronic patient records for large numbers of practices. The protocol describes one application: a study of antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infection; a second protocol outlines an intervention in a less frequent chronic condition of public health importance, stroke. Methods/Design The objective of the study is to implement a cluster randomised trial to test the effectiveness of an <b>electronic</b> record-based <b>intervention</b> at achieving a reduction in antibiotic prescribing at consultations for respiratory illness in patients aged 18 and 59 years old in intervention family practices as compared with controls. Family practices will be recruited from the practices that presently contribute data to the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Following randomisation, electronic prompts will be installed remotely at intervention practices to promote adherence with evidence-based standards of medical practice. The intervention was developed through qualitative research at non-intervention practices. Data for outcome assessment will be obtained from anonymised electronic patient records that are routinely collected into GPRD. This protocol outlines the proposed study designs, data sources, sample size requirements, analysis methods and dissemination plans. Ethical issues are also discussed. Discussion Results from this study will provide methodological evidence concerning the use of electronic patient records and databases for implementing cluster randomised trials in primary care. The study will also provide substantive findings in respect of <b>electronic</b> record-based <b>interventions</b> to reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary care.

40|$|Background: Alcohol {{is a major}} global {{threat to}} public health. Although the main burden of chronic alcohol-related disease is in adults, its {{foundations}} often lie in adolescence. Alcohol consumption and related harm increase steeply {{from the age of}} 12 until 20 years. Several trials focusing upon young people have reported significant positive effects of brief interventions on a range of alcohol consumption outcomes. A recent review of reviews also suggests that <b>electronic</b> brief <b>interventions</b> (eBIs) using internet and smartphone technologies may markedly reduce alcohol consumption compared with minimal or no intervention controls. Interventions that target non-drinking youth are known to delay the onset of drinking behaviours. Web based alcohol interventions for adolescents also demonstrate significantly greater reductions in consumption and harm among ‘high-risk’ drinkers; however changes in risk status at follow-up for non-drinkers or low-risk drinkers have not been assessed in controlled trials of brief alcohol interventions...|$|R
