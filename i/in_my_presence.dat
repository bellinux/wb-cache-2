500|$|Upon {{return to}} Germany, Gröning {{lived with his}} father-in-law. At the dinner table, they once made [...] "a silly remark about Auschwitz", {{implying}} {{that he was a}} [...] "potential or real murderer," [...] which Gröning said enraged him, banging his fist on the table, demanding: [...] "This word and this connection are never, ever, to be mentioned again <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence,</b> otherwise I'll move out!" [...] Gröning said that this request was respected.|$|E
500|$|In 1905, Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber {{engraved}} the obverse of Roosevelt's inauguration medal, {{while his}} assistant, George T. Morgan, engraved the reverse. [...] Roosevelt disliked the work, and engaged Saint-Gaudens to design an unofficial medal commemorating the inauguration. [...] Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber {{on the question}} of the new coinage; he wrote to his brother, Louis Saint-Gaudens, [...] "Barber is a S.O.A.B. [...] but I had a talk with the President who ordered Secretary Shaw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> to cut Barber's head off if he didn't do our bidding".|$|E
500|$|As the voiture {{rolled through}} the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part {{repeated}} to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me {{as best he could}} while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence.</b> When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.|$|E

2500|$|Duterte has {{repeatedly}} admitted to killing three people {{while he was}} the Mayor of Davao. In December 2015, Duterte recounted shooting three gunmen dead only months into his first mayoral term in 1988 after they had kidnapped and raped a Chinese girl. He justified his actions, saying [...] "they were committing a crime <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> and I was the person in authority under the law". In an interview with BBC on December 16, 2016, he said: [...] "I killed about three of them, because {{there were three of}} them. I don't know how many bullets from my gun went inside their bodies. It happened, and I said, I cannot lie about it".|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} was created using Blake's distinctive tempera technique, {{which he describes}} in the lower right of the panel, beneath the shell gold signature, as [...] "fresco". On the reverse of the panel is written, [...] "The Vision of the Spirit that inhabits {{the body of a}} Flea, and which appeared to the late Mr. Blake, the Designer of the vignettes for Blair Grave and the Book of Job. The Visions first appeared to him <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence,</b> and after wards till he had finished this picture. The Flea drew blood on this." [...] Today the work is in relatively poor condition, partly due to the technique employed by Blake. Areas of the surface have cracked and dulled with age.|$|E
2500|$|George Loddiges' {{tropical}} hothouse range {{made use}} of recently invented curvilinear iron glazing bars and central heating systems, which together with his own inventions, enabled many new species of tropical plant to be introduced into cultivation, or flower {{for the first time}} in Europe. Visiting the hothouses on 30 March 1822, the Quaker pharmacist William Allen, his Cousin Emily Birkbeck and Anna Hanbury noted: We all went to Loddiges Nursery to see the camellias which are now in full bloom and very beautiful ! There is quite a forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a banana tree which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All that I had seen before of the kind appeared nothing to me compared with this. I fancied myself in the and especially at that moment when Mr Loddiges had the kindness to produce, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence,</b> a shower of artificial rain. Such conditions were ideal for tropical orchids, several of which were named in honour of George Loddiges, including Loddiges' dendrobium.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{fault of}} your wanton ways," [...] he accused her harshly. [...] "You have so played {{fast and loose}} with this fellow Wilding that he makes free of your name <b>in</b> <b>my</b> very <b>presence,</b> and puts upon me the need to get myself killed by him to save the family honour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are master here, {{but not of}} me, or my actions, and {{you have}} no right to expect {{obedience}} or respect, for you inspire neither.

2500|$|Later that year, {{there was}} an {{occasion}} when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (丹霄殿), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, [...] "Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before. [...] I did not {{know at the time}} that we would get the chance to feast together." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that was why I retained them. [...] I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun." [...] Emperor Taizong laughed and stated, [...] "Everyone says that Wei is arrogant and careless, but I call him 'delicate'; this shows it." ...|$|E

60|$|It was so with {{my mental}} vision. After the utter {{oblivion}} and darkness {{of a deep}} swoon, consciousness flashed like light on my mind, when I found myself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>presence,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own home. But, almost {{at the very moment}} when I first awakened to the bewildering influence of that sight, a new darkness fell upon my faculties--a darkness, this time, which was not utter oblivion; a peopled darkness, like that which the bandage casts over the opened eyes of the blind.|$|R
50|$|Constable's verse is characterised by fervour and {{richness}} of colour. Of the numerous sonnets he wrote, the twenty-eight of the sonnet sequence Diana, {{and the four}} prefixed to Sir Philip Sidney's An Apology for Poetry, contain his best work. <b>In</b> <b>My</b> lady's <b>presence</b> makes the roses red, {{he is able to}} capture Spenser's charm. His rhyme scheme is mixed Italian and English, like Sidney's, the octave being Italian and the sestet English.|$|R

60|$|Professor Taft and his son, Florizel, {{were both}} at the train to meet Zulime, and both were {{properly}} amazed when I appeared.

60|$|When {{the subject}} of our ages was unluckily started at Mrs. Staveley's, I had {{slipped out of the}} {{difficulty}} easily by assuming the character of the eldest sister--an example of ready tact which my dear stupid Eunice doesn't understand. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>presence,</b> it is needless to say that I kept silence, and left it to him. I was sorry to be obliged to do this. Owing to his sad state of health, he is easily irritated--especially by inquisitive strangers.|$|R

[...] "There are pressing claims calling me to England--friends who may be much <b>in</b> need of <b>my</b> <b>presence.</b> I have been kept away from them too long by unexpected circumstances.

60|$|In {{those days}} of slow communication, I had to wait, not for days, but for weeks, before I {{could expect to}} receive Sir James's answer. His letter only reached me after an unusually long delay. For this, or for some other reason that I cannot divine, I felt so {{strongly}} the foreboding of bad news that I abstained from breaking the seal <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>presence.</b> I waited until I could retire to my own room, and then I opened the letter. My presentiment had not deceived me.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{quite make}} {{out after the}} lapse of so many years just how or when I got to Haverhill, {{or whether it was}} before or after I had been in Salem. There is an apparitional quality <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presences,</b> at this point or that, in the dim past; but I hope that, for the credit of their order, ghosts are not {{commonly}} taken with such trivial things as I was. For instance, in Haverhill I was much interested by the sight of a young man, coming gayly down the steps of the hotel where I lodged, in peg-top trousers so much more peg top than my own that I seemed to be wearing mere spring-bottoms in comparison; and in a day when every one who respected himself had a necktie as narrow as he could get, this youth had one no wider than a shoestring, and red at that, while mine measured almost an inch, and was black. To be sure, he was one of a band of negro minstrels, who were to give a concert that night, and he had a light to excel in fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "That the {{interview}} takes place <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>presence,</b> {{and that at}} the first word from me, you cease questioning my patient, and leave his room." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{found him}} seated with Mistress Pamela at breakfast, beneath {{the shade of}} a wide veranda {{overlooking}} a beautiful and luxuriant garden. The Governor arose as I came forward, looking very much surprised at <b>my</b> boldness <b>in</b> so forcing <b>my</b> <b>presence</b> upon his privacy. As for Mistress Pamela, I beheld her eyes grow wide and her face as white as marble, and thereby knew that she had recognized me upon the instant.|$|R
