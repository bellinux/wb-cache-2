25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of <b>hyalite</b> opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is the {{development}} of the glassmaking in the southern Bohemia´s domains of Buquoy´s genus. This work creates a complex view of an old French family, who came to the Czech land after 1620 and it illustrates its historical, social, economic and finally its art activities. Buquoys during two hundred years interlinked European and local experiences until they completely merged with the Czech culture. I deal with the genealogy of the Buquoys´s family in the introduction. A following chapter is devoted to the historical development of glassmaking in Novohradské hory´s area before Buquoys came to their domains in South Bohemia. I continue with a chronological description of every glassworks, acting on Novohradsko. The main part of my work I devote to the glass itself. Individual chapters deal with glass, which has been produced since the first half of 17 th century until the half of 19 th century. One of the subchapters is dedicated to <b>hyalite</b> glass, unique opaque glass, which contains the most significant one - the black <b>hyalite.</b> This dark enamel with a gloss surface has been created since 1817 in buquoy´s glassworks Jiříkovo Údolí and later in the glassworks Stříbrný Vrch. The production of red <b>hyalite</b> was introduced two years later. In conclusion of my work I remind even the semiprecious glass. A character of this glass is similar to noble nature materials, mostly marble or semi-gemstone. Typical sign of this glass is color, opacity and most of time, even the veined and marble structure of the surface. The main representatives are the lithyalins.

Surface {{areas of}} 'amorphous'-type o als {{measured}} by nitrogen-absorption techniques were not consistent either with {{the surface area}} of the spheres of about 2 o 0 o A diameter observable by electron microscopy or with the thermal dehydration data. This apparent inconsistency an be {{explained in terms of}} a smaller particulate structure of the order of Ioo- 200 A shown by higher resolution electron micrographs. This structure also accounts for a marked shrinkage shown in dilatometer curves of this type of opal. IN an earlier paper (Segnit, Stevens, and Jones, i 965) the part played by water in opaline silica was discussed. In 'amorphous '-type opals it was found that there were anomalies in the relationship between water and hydroxyl content and certain physical properties. Although the surface area of these opals as measured by nitrogen absorp-tion was small (less than o' 5 mS/g) an anomalously high proportion of the water appeared to be bound as surface hydroxyls. Further electron-microscopic examination and supplementary infra-red and dilatometric measurements have led to an explana-tion for these phenomena. Electron-microscopic examination.

40|$|Glass Buttes, a Pliocene silicic {{volcanic}} complex {{within the}} High Lava Plains province of Oregon, was erupted approximately 5. 0 to 5. 8 million years ago.

Basalt flows are interlayered with and onlap the silicic glass. Younger basalt flows, erupted from local vents, overlie silicic glass and onlapping basalts. The eastern end of Glass Buttes is hydrothermally altered at the surface; a weak geothermal anomaly coincides with the altered areas. Alteration, localized by northwest trending normal faults, occurs primarily as opalite replacement of rhyolite glass with associated cinnabar, alunite, clay-rich vein material, hematite, and <b>hyalite.</b> Alteration paragenesis at the surface was defined, and physicochemical conditions during hydrothermal activity were inferred from alteration minerals and assemblages and trace element content of alteration minerals.

40|$|It is {{interesting}} to consider that while man has sought color in minerals {{for tens of thousands}} of years, one of the most brilliant and dramatic color phenomena in minerals has been unknown until recently. This is the phenomenon of fluorescence. Of the roughly 4, 200 mineral species thus far identified, 566 of them (from more than 6, 500 localities) are reported as fluorescent in The Henkel Glossary of Fluorescent Minerals, published in 1989. Some of these fluorescent species (e. g., calcite, <b>hyalite</b> opal) are widespread, while others (e. g., agrellite, benitoite, esperite, tugtupite) are found in only one or a few places in the world. Fluorescence is the visible light produced by certain minerals when they are illuminated by the invisible light rays of an ultraviolet (UV) light source. The term was coined in 1852 by Sir George Stokes (1820 - 1903) after observations on fluorite from Alston Moor, Cumberland, England, by analogy with the term “opalescence ” already attributed to opal. Fluorescence occurs as “activator ” atoms in the fluorescing mineral absorb UV, thereby transferring an electron from a lower vibration band to a less-stable upper (i. e., higher-energy) vibration band.

Despite the ease of synthesizing zeolite X and zeolite Y, the industrial analogues of natural faujasite, it is astonishing that faujasite is so sparse in nature. Low-grade zeolite facies mineralization in the Kaiserstuhl volcanic complex results from subsolidus hydrothermal al-teration of alkaline volcanic rocks. Nine different zeolite species are known from the volcanic complex: analcime, chabazite-Ca, faujasite-Na, faujasite-Mg, natrolite, offretite, phillipsite-K, phillipsite-Ca and thomsonite. New micro-probe data on barrel-shaped offretite from the Limberg area clearly shows that the postulated epitaxial intergrowth of offretite and erionite (Rinaldi 1976) does not occur. Zeolite occurrence {{as well as their}} chemical composition depends on the chemical composition of the host rock, local hydrological features and porosity of the rock.

Pulse delays of {{up to an hour}} were employed for silica samples with slow spin lattice relaxation rates, and nearly fully relaxed spectra (90 – 100 %) were demonstrably achieved for all samples. ^(29) Si NMR spectra consisted of two broad, overlapping peaks at − 111 and − 102 ppm and a smaller peak at − 92 ppm, corresponding to Q^ 4, Q^ 3, and Q^ 2 sites, respectively. The Hawaiian silica coating and silicic acid samples displayed high Q^ 3 and Q^ 2 contents; in particular, the structural Si-OH content of the coating was unusually high for a natural silica (5. 4 ± 0. 4 wt% H_(2) O). Saturation-recovery spectra of the Hawaiian silica with increasing delay times were consistent with “stretched exponential” relaxation behavior and three-dimensional distribution of paramagnetic centers. Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) and Raman spectra of the silica powders indicated fully amorphous structures, and displayed hydrous (SiO_(3) OH) and anhydrous silicate vibrational bands in positions consistent with previous work.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Presentation date: 1999 - 03 - 30 The Absaroka {{volcanic}} province is {{the largest}} of Eocene volcanic fields in the northern Cordillera of the western U. S., and consists of 25, 000 km 2 of lava flows, shallow intrusions, ash-flow tuffs and volcaniclastic deposits. It is aligned with northwest-trending Precambrian lineaments, and includes the remains of at least ten volcanic centers. This study presents 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronological data, and major, trace element and isotopic compositional data which {{are the result of}} detailed mapping and field sampling of four representative volcanic centers, peripheral lava flows, intrusions, and ash-flow tuffs. Age data show that volcanism occurred between 53 and 43 Ma in a general northwest to southeast age progression, and have allowed significant revisions in regional correlations across the volcanic province. Local dike orientations from one volcanic center suggest that volcanism occurred during extensional faulting. Geochemical and Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic data show that mafic lavas are enriched in incompatible elements derived from an ancient source. Mafic rocks (5 % MgO) are characteristically potassic, and are typical products of early eruptions at each of the <b>Hyalite,</b> Crandall, Ishawooa, and Rampart volcanic centers, and not spatially restricted to any one region. Although products of volcanism are broadly similar, volcanic centers exhibit distinct mineralogic, compositional and isotopic characteristics. Least squares calculations based on mineralogical data indicate that shoshonites can be produced from mafic samples by fractionation of olivine and augite t plagioclase. More silicic samples have petrographic features and compositions which indicate they are derived from a mixture of sources including continental crust. Changing chemical and isotopic compositions suggest that early eruptions contain a lithospheric mantle component, with an increasing melt contribution from crustal sources with time.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The feasibility of making meaningful {{measurements of the}} deuterium content of water extracted from hydrous silica has been evaluated {{by a series of}} dehydration and isotope exchange experiments. A new experimental technique, called Differential Isotopic Analysis (D. I. A.), has been developed which allows the isotopic exchange characteristics of water in different sites in hydrous silica to be determined. This method involves the sampling of successive increments of water driven off during heating of the silica and the measurement of [ [...] . ] for these water samples. The isotopic pattern established for the [ [...] . ] values of successively driven-off samples varies markedly, depending on {{the degree to which the}} water in silica has been exchanged with deuterium-rich water in controlled experiments. The fraction of the water or hydroxyl groups that is most resistant to exchange and most difficult to drive off is that water or hydroxyl group most likely to contain the hydrogen which was in equilibrium with the waters from which the silica formed. Granular microcrystalline quartz, the most common constituent of chert, has been found to contain hydroxyl groups particularly suitable for hydrogen isotope analyses. Cherts of a given age consisting of granular microcrystalline quartz free of organic matter yield an approximate linear relationship between [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] of the total oxygen. The line thus defined is parallel to the [ [...] . ] relationship for meteoric waters, but has an intercept which is age-dependent. The isotope data indicate that, for many darts, the diagenetic, transformation of opal to granular microcrystalline quartz occurred in the presence of meteoric waters. The displacement with time of the [ [...] . ] relationship is interpreted as being due to the effect of past climatic temperature changes on the temperature-dependent isotopic fractionation factors for D/H and [ [...] . ]. The variations in [ [...] . ] and D/H ratios of cherts and other forms of hydrous silica have been investigated and have been used to deduce climatic temperature variations for the central and western United States over geologic time. The chert-water oxygen isotope fractionation with temperature was estimated from published experimental data and from the isotopic compositions of cherts which formed at approximately known temperatures. The fractionation is [ [...] . ]. This equation was used to calibrate the temperature dependence of the variation with time of the [ [...] . ] linear relationships for cherts, assuming that the variations are due entirely to climatic temperature fluctuations and that the oceans have not changed isotopically with time. Temperatures deduced for chert-formation indicate that the average past climatic temperatures for the central and western United States decreased from 34 °C to 20 °C through the Paleozoic, increased to 35 ° - 40 °C in the Triassic, and then decreased to the present day value of 13 ° - 15 °C. Temperatures in the Precambrian for this region may have reached over 50 °C at 1. 3 billion years, although temperatures similar to those of the Phanerozoic Era are inferred at 2 billion years and 1. 2 billion years. Extremely cold temperatures deduced for deep ocean water from the oxygen isotopic composition of several samples of opal-CT [ [...] . ] in deep sea sediments indicates the possibility of ice caps at the close of the Cretaceous and at the beginning of the Oligocene. Granular microcrystalline quartz in deep sea sediments often forms during deep burial at elevated peratures and cannot be used to deduce deep ocean temperatures. Cherts are usually not in isotopic equilibrium with their coexisting carbonates, and the somewhat insensitive chert-calcite oxygen isotope fractionation thus cannot be used to obtain meaningful temperatures. Calcitic Crinoid fragments in a chert nodule from the Mississippian Burlington limestone yielded an oxygen isotopic temperature of 25 °C, indicating that fossil fragments encased within chert nodules may be protected from post-depositional exchange with ground waters and thus suitable for isotopic paleo-temperature analysis. Most forms of opal are so hydrous that meaningful [ [...] . ] values cannot be ascertained with existing analytical techniques. <b>Hyalite</b> opal presents the fewest difficulties, since it contains less than 3...|$|E
