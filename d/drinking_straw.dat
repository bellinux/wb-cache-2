25|$|The <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> is a tube {{used for}} {{transferring}} a liquid to the mouth, usually {{a drink from}} one location to another. The first crude forms of drinking straws were made of dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} <b>drinking</b> <b>straw.</b> Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E

It was experimentally derived independently by Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille in 1838 and Gotthilf Heinrich Ludwig Hagen, and published by Poiseuille in 1840–41 and 1846.|$|E
25|$|Using a <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> {{is often}} advised by dentists as the drink {{does not come}} into as much contact with the teeth. It has also been {{suggested}} that brushing teeth right after drinking soft drinks should be avoided as this can result in additional erosion to the teeth due {{to the presence of}} acid.|$|E
40|$|While metal {{spatulas}} are damaged through {{everyday use}} and become discolored and corroded by chemical exposure, <b>drinking</b> <b>straws</b> are inexpensive and disposable, {{reducing the risk}} of cross contamination during laboratory experiments. <b>Drinking</b> <b>straws</b> are also useful because they {{come in a variety of}} sizes; narrow sample containers such as NMR and EPR tubes can easily be filled using small diameter coffee stirrers, while bulk material can be transferred using larger <b>drinking</b> <b>straws.</b> Several types of <b>drinking</b> <b>straws</b> and coffee stirrers were cut at various angles and the amount of material picked up in a single scoop was massed thirty times. Standard deviations of the thirty measurements per straw indicate that approximately the same amount of material will be scooped each time by the same operator...|$|R

25|$|Like other arachnids, spiders {{are unable}} to chew their food, {{so they have a}} mouth part shaped like a short <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> that they use to suck up the {{liquefied}} insides of their prey. However, they are able to eat their own silk to recycle proteins needed in the production of new spider webs. Some spiders, such as the dewdrop spiders (Argyrodes), even eat the silk of other spider species.|$|E
25|$|One of the policemen, Sergeant Murray, {{went with}} Janet Randolph {{to reclaim the}} Randolph child from the neighbor; when they returned, she renewed her {{complaints}} about her husband's drug use and volunteered that there were “items of drug evidence” in the house. Sergeant Murray asked Scott Randolph for permission to search the house; he refused. The sergeant then asked Janet Randolph's consent to search the Randolph house, which she readily gave, and then led him to an upstairs bedroom she identified as Scott's, where the sergeant noticed a section of a <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> with a powder residue he suspected was cocaine. He then left the house to get an evidence bag from his patrol car, and to call the district attorney's office, which instructed him to stop the search and apply for a search warrant. When Sergeant Murray returned to the house, Janet Randolph withdrew her consent to searching the house. The police took the <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> to the police station, along with the arrested occupants. After obtaining a search warrant, {{they returned to the}} Randolph house and seized further evidence of illegal drug use, on the basis of which Scott Randolph was indicted for possession of cocaine.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "", the childhood's {{background}} of Elle is further explained: how she started a blackout in Athens, Ohio that took out three other counties. Elle's mother {{sent her to}} his father, Bob, to New York City to deal with her. Bob asked the help of Charles Deveaux, who recommended taking a fatherly approach, but ended up taking Dr. Zimmerman's advice: treat Elle as any other posthuman and test her abilities. During one of these tests, Bob tried to calm the weeping Elle turning her <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> into gold, but this backfired as it allowed Elle to accidentally shock her father. After this, Elle escaped and Bob enlisted Noah Bennet to go after her. Noah eventually found Elle at an arcade and anticipating her attack, he wore latex gloves. Elle quickly electrified a machine making it toss balls at Noah, so she could escape. When Noah followed Elle through a mini-golf course, she electrified a mini-windmill, making it throw blades at Noah. Finally, Elle was cornered; Noah promised her Bob would be proud if she came back with him. Once back at Primatech, Bob locked Elle up while discussing the situation with Kaito and Noah. Angela brought a young Haitian to mind-wipe Elle to forget what just happened and enjoy her 9th birthday cake.|$|E

500|$|Garnet was at Coughton Court on 6 November when Thomas Bates brought {{news of the}} plot's failure. [...] Catesby {{wanted him}} to help raise support in Wales, where it was thought Catholic support would be more likely, but Garnet was horrified. [...] In a letter to Catesby and Digby, he urged them to abandon their [...] "wicked actions" [...] and follow the pope's advice. He spent weeks on the run but was {{eventually}} arrested on 27 January 1606, at Hindlip Hall. There, for eight days, he and Fr. Edward Oldcorne (later beatified as the Blessed Edward Oldcorne) secreted themselves in a small, cramped space, unable even to stand or stretch their legs. They received sustenance from their protectors through a small <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> hidden within the building's structure, but with no commode or drainage they were eventually forced by [...] "customs of nature which must of necessity be done" [...] to emerge from hiding, and were immediately captured. They were taken first to Holt Castle in Worcestershire, {{and a few days}} later to London. Garnet was still weak from his ordeal, and Salisbury therefore ordered that he be given a good mount; his supplies were paid for by the king. The group was accompanied by a Puritan minister who [...] "ranted at length without interruption", but Garnet's replies remained erudite, brief and clear—much to the minister's disappointment. On his arrival in London he was taken to the Gatehouse Prison in Westminster, already home to many Catholic prisoners, including his nephew, Father Thomas Garnet.|$|E
2500|$|In the 20th century, {{entrepreneurship}} was {{studied by}} Joseph Schumpeter in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek. The term [...] "entrepreneurship" [...] was coined around the 1920s, while the loan from French {{of the word}} entrepreneur dates to the 1850s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is {{willing and able to}} convert a new idea or invention into a successful innovation. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called [...] "the gale of creative destruction" [...] to replace {{in whole or in part}} inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new business models. Thus, creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term economic growth. The idea that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such continues to be debated in academic economics. An alternate description by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a <b>drinking</b> <b>straw</b> that require no special qualities.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{entrepreneur}} is {{a factor}} in microeconomics, and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of Richard Cantillon and Adam Smith in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, but was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics in the last 40 years. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist Joseph Schumpeter in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful innovation. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called [...] "the gale of creative destruction" [...] to replace {{in whole or in part}} inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternate description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a <b>drinking</b> <b>straw.</b>|$|E
