40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to develop reliable, low-cost techniques for joining silicon nitride (Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }) to itself and to metals. For Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } to be widely used in advanced turbomachinery applications, joining techniques must be developed that are reliable, cost-effective, and manufacturable. This project addressed those needs by developing and testing two Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } joining systems; oxynitride glass joining materials and high temperature braze alloys. Extensive measurements were also made of the mechanical properties and oxidation resistance of the braze materials.

Lot of energy is required to refine and make them useful for some means for every Industry. Corrosion on metals can reverse an unnatural process back to a lower state of energy, easily as simple. It eats away metal in outdoor furniture and automotive bodies, leaving the surface with bad appearance {{and if it is}} not treated at right time, eventually it will lead to failure. Corrosion causes rusting the cookware and tarnishing of silver parts. Of greater importance, corrosion takes place on Steel bars in reinforced concrete result in failure of highway section, damage to big buildings, even collapse of towers that may take lives of many and leads to significant loss of resources.

50|$|LPS {{comprises}} a loose {{sleeve of}} polyethylene that completely wraps the pipe, including the bells of any <b>joints.</b> The <b>sleeving</b> inhibits corrosion {{by a number}} of mechanisms. It physically separates the pipe from soil particles, preventing direct galvanic corrosion. By providing an impermeable barrier to ground water, the sleeve also inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the ductile iron surface and limits the availability of electrolytes that would accelerate corrosion. It provides a homogeneous environment along the pipe surface so that corrosion occurs evenly over the pipe. The sleeve also restricts the availability of nutrients which could support sulfate-reducing bacteria, inhibiting microbially induced corrosion. LPS is not designed to be completely water-tight but rather to greatly restrict the movement of water to and from the pipe surface. Water present beneath the sleeve and in contact with the pipe surface is rapidly deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients and forms a stable environment in which limited further corrosion occurs. An improperly installed sleeve that continues to allow the free flow of ground water is not effective in inhibiting corrosion.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of space latticed shell structure using fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) tubular members is a promising practice wherein {{the key issue}} is to join different components together.

During experiments, the failure modes, load-displacement and load-strain relationships were recorded to assess the joint performance. The test results demonstrate that a desirable ultimate load carrying capacity can be achieved by optimising element dimensions and bolt group layout when using normal bolt.

40|$|Hip joint capsular ligaments {{have not}} been studied {{sufficiently}} {{in the past and}} very little is known about their mechanical properties. One of the most recent studies presents data on the two ileofemoral ligaments (medial and lateral) and the ischiofemoral ligament. This data is based on tensile tests that were performed at low strain rates (0. 04 mm/s) In this present study the aim was to generate knowledge on the mechanical properties of the capsular ligaments in the intact human cadaveric hip joint. This way the risk of damaging the ligaments when exercising them is eliminated and chossing the right borders of each ligament becomes redundant. Another advantage of testing the hip joint ligaments in an intact joint is that by reproducing the kinematics of the joint the restraining effect of the ligaments on the joint can be simulated realistically. In this way it is possible to determine the stabilising effect of all hip ligaments together as they surround the hip <b>joint</b> like a <b>sleeve</b> and also the individual contribution of each of the ligaments...|$|R

The column, having square cross-section with side length 0. 5 m, was 3. 7 m heigh. It was subjected to an axial compression of 1700 kN using two externally post-tensioned 47 mm-diameter Dywidag bars. A transverse displacement time-history {{was applied to the}} column cross-section 2. 8 m far from the column-foundation joint using a worm screw jack with nominal loading capacity of 500 kN.

Correspondingly, a 15 % degradation of the base-joint resistance was attained and the drift reached 5. 25 %. At this deformation level, the dowel action involving the connection rebars was significant, leading to a maximum slip within the joint of about 7 mm. The ultimate curvature was about 10 times the yielding curvature. Then, a behaviour factor of about 3. 7 was estimated for use in spectral response analyses based on the Italian Standard...|$|R
40|$|The Rochester bone {{trephine}} is {{a useful}} instrument for performing small joint arthrodesis in the foot. The tech-nique involves harvesting a dowel graft from the iliac crest and then inserting the graft into a recipient bed across the small joints in the foot. Minimal surgical trauma and patient discomfort result from this technique. Three cases are presented to illustrate the usefulness and diversity of this system. The Rochester bone trephine provides an easy means of performing dowel-type, small-joint arthrodesis in the foot (Fig. 1). Two trephines are used. One tre-phine has an inside diameter of 7. 5 mm and is used to harvest bone graft from the anterior iliac crest. The second trephine has an outside diameter of 7. 5 mm and is used to prepare the recipient bed across the smaller joints of the foot for arthrodesis. The donor dowel graft is the same diameter as the recipient core site so that inherent stability is provided when the trephine bone graft is inserted into the recipient area. After locating the joint and plane of the small <b>joint,</b> the <b>sleeve</b> of the small bone trephine is centered over the joint. The cutting trephine is then placed down the sleeve to excise the joint to be arthrodesed. The de-generated articular surface between the hemicylinders of bone can be inspected and identified after the cylin-der of bone has been removed. The larger trephine is used to take bone graft from the anterior iliac crest through a 1 -cm stab incision (Fig. 2). The incision is made approximately 1 inch posterior and inferior to the anterior iliac crest. Three or four bone plugs are easily harvested. The trephine is aimed toward the patient's navel; this positions the trephine transverse to the ilium. The bone graft is then held in the trephine with suction by putting a finger over the air hole at the proximal barrel. These bone plugs are then cleaned of soft tissue and inserted into the recipi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{variety of}} knee {{injuries}} and pathologies may cause a deficit in knee proprioception which {{may increase the}} risk of reinjury or the progression of disease. Stochastic resonance stimulation is a new therapy which has potential benefits for improving proprioceptive function. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if stochastic resonance (SR) stimulation applied with a neoprene sleeve could improve knee proprioception relative to a no-stimulation/no-sleeve condition (control) or a sleeve alone condition in the normal, healthy knee. We hypothesized that SR stimulation when applied with a sleeve would enhance proprioception relative to the control and sleeve alone conditions. Methods Using a cross-over within subject design, twenty-four healthy subjects were tested under four combinations of conditions: electrical stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/no sleeve, and stimulation/no <b>sleeve.</b> <b>Joint</b> position sense (proprioception) was measured as the absolute mean difference between a target knee joint angle and the knee angle reproduced by the subject. Testing was conducted during both partial-weight bearing (PWB) and non-weight bearing (NWB) tasks. Differences in joint position sense between the conditions were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance testing. Results Joint position sense error during the stimulation/sleeve condition (2. 48 Â° Â± 1. 32 Â°) was found to be more accurate (P Conclusion These results suggest that SR electrical stimulation when combined with a neoprene sleeve is an effective modality for enhancement of joint proprioception in the PWB knee. We believe these results suggest the need for further study of the potential of SR stimulation to correct proprioceptive deficits in a clinical population with knee injury/pathology or in subjects at risk of injury because of a proprioceptive deficit. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pultruded {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymers (GFRP) profile is a promising structural member for space latticed shell structures {{because of the}} advantageous properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio (in pultrusion direction), corrosion resistance and lower maintenance. In particular, when tubular profiles are used, a better resistance against local buckling, global buckling and lateral torsional buckling can be achieved compared with open sections. Despite the advantageous characteristics, the design and fabrication of tubular connections {{has been identified as}} a critical issue for the proposed applications due primarily to the geometric constraints of the closed shape, the distinct material properties of FRP, and the threedimensional nature of space latticed shell structures. Until recently, {{only a limited number of}} connection systems have been proposed for FRP space latticed shell structures and there is still a need to develop a simple, economic and versatile joining method. This thesis proposed a bolted <b>sleeve</b> <b>joint</b> (BSJ) for assembling GFRP tubular profiles into space latticed shell structures. In the proposed BSJ, the FRP profile and steel connector are telescoped and clamped using mechanical bolts. The end of the steel connector can be incorporated with compatible end fittings for connection to a nodal joint for space latticed shell structure. The proposed BSJ allows the flexibility in adjusting design parameters such as the bolt group configuration, memb 9 er size and type of fastener, depending on the design requirements. In addition, all connecting elements are commercially available and no advanced techniques are required for the fabrication. The joint performances were investigated at three level, namely joint level, component level and structural level. Stage one Goint level) focused on the joint design and performance under static axial loadings. Four batches of specimens were prepared and tested under static axial tension and compression. Design parameters, including the type of fastener (ordinary bolt or blind bolt), member size, and bolt group layout, were selected and examined. A simple analytical design model was proposed to estimate the joint capacity, showing good agreement with experiment. Design recommendations based on the current investigation were also made for the further improvement of joint performance. Stage two (component level) was an experimental and numerical study on the member capacity of pultruded GFRP square tubular profile with BSJ end conditions. Three batches of specimens assembled with FRP profiles in different lengths and BSJs at both ends were prepared and tested under static axial compression. A detailed 3 D FE model considering bolt geometry, contact behaviour, bolt pretension, initial geometric imperfection and FRP failure criterion, was developed and validated with experimental results, showing good agreement. The relationship between effective length factor and member slenderness was derived based on FEA, and then used in conjunction with existing pultruded GFRP box tubular column design equations to predict the member capacity of structural members with BSJ end conditions. The final stage (structural level) investigated the performance of BSJ at a structural level. An experimental investigation was first conducted to obtain the M- () behaviour of BSJ. It was followed by a structural analysis and design of an FRP domed roof with BSJ modelled by spring elements using FEA. The inputs of the joint rotational stiffness and axial stiffness for the springs were determined from the linear portions of the orresponding experimental curves. The ULS and SLS performance of the FRP domed roof were evaluated on a LRFD basis under ASCE- 07 design loads. Parametric studies were also performed to identify the effects of joint rotational stiffness, axial stiffness and the materials (steel or pultruded GFRP) used for structural members on the structural performance. Design recommendations were also developed based on the structural analysis and the parametric studies. Awards: Vice-Chancellorâ€™s Commendation for Masters Thesis Excellence in 2015...|$|R
