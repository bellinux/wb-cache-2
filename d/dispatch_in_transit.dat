40|$|AbstractThe {{scheduling}} problem of urban bus crew {{is an important}} part of the intelligent <b>dispatching</b> system <b>in</b> public <b>transit.</b> This paper considers impartiality constraint which is on the basis of assurance to meet the time shift of trips and work intensity for the crew, and establishes a crew scheduling model with the objective of minimizing the total idle time. A heuristic procedure using tabu search algorithm is also presented. A new heuristic algorithm with meeting the time shift of trips and work intensity constraints is designed to generate the initial solution and a neighborhood search method with trips exchange and insert strategy based on the ordered sequence is presented. The result shows that the method proposed in this paper can effectively overcome the disadvantage which the total working time of a day for the crew vary significantly, it can thus serve as a useful tool for public transit management department with more reasonable and pertinent assistant decision support...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the impact of radio frequency identification (RFID) practices on supply chain performance. We examined eight variables of RFID applications grouped in two categories: location (supplier’s warehouse, retailer’s central warehouse, retailer’s local warehouse, retailer’s owned stores) and utilisation (standards, transportation, pallet level, specialised software). Given the inherent difficulty in assessing supply chain performance and the widespread use of different performance models, such as the SCOR and balanced scorecard, we developed a list of performance indicators. Factor analysis produced 7 supply chain performance factors: supplier, inventory, distribution, ordering, plan, sales, and forecasting. Empirical data were collected via an online survey administered to 300 retail companies. 130 usable questionnaires were returned, for a 43. 3 % response rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an analytical model that places supply chain performance indicators as dependent variables in a hierarchical regression equation with RFID variables as independent variables. Results found that the implementation of RFID practices significantly affect the supply chain performance in the following areas: supplier, inventory, distribution, plan, sales, and forecasting. RFID can improve the performance of distribution systems, including products <b>dispatched</b> and inventory <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> by 33. 8 % and stock availability by 45. 6 %. This study contributes to both the RFID and the supply chain performance literatures. Limitations and suggestions for further research are also discussed...|$|R

While several languages over the last 20 years have provided multiple dispatch, most object-oriented languages still support only single dispatch — forcing programmers to implement multiple dispatch manually when required. This paper presents an empirical study of the use of multiple <b>dispatch</b> <b>in</b> practice, considering six languages that support multiple dispatch, and also investigating the potential for multiple <b>dispatch</b> <b>in</b> Java programs. We hope that this study will help programmers understand the uses and abuses of multiple dispatch; virtual machine implementors optimise multiple dispatch; and language designers to evaluate the choice of providing multiple <b>dispatch</b> <b>in</b> new programming languages...|$|R
