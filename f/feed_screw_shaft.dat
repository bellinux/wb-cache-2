40|$|Abstract: The air in {{vertical}} {{screw conveyor}} creates flows such as Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flow and turbulent flow {{with the increase of}} rotational speed of <b>screw</b> <b>shaft.</b> The stable helical vortex in TCP flow is beneficial to improve the transporting efficiency of granular materials. This paper described the N-S equations of incompressible steady flow (air) in {{vertical screw conveyor}} and deduced the distribution solution of velocity of stable helical vortex in TCP. And this paper also analyzed the relationship between the Reynolds number Re and parameters such as rotational speed of <b>screw</b> <b>shaft,</b> <b>shaft</b> diameter of <b>screw</b> <b>shaft,</b> <b>screw</b> pitch. Then this paper simulated different flows using FLUENT software and obtains the velocity vector chart and streamline chart with different rotational speed of <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> in vertical <b>screw</b> conveyor. The effect of simulation verified the correctness of theoretical analysis and recommended the critical Reynolds number Rec suitable for appearance of stable helical vortex in TCP flow in the conveyor.

40|$|Objective— To compare acute {{fixation}} {{stability and}} insertion effort of cortex bone screws {{with and without}} a shaft inserted in lag fashion in equine metacarpal (metatarsal, MC(T) III) bone. Methods— Screw types with independent variables of screw diameter (4. 5 or 5. 5 mm) and shaft type (without shaft, with 20 -mm shaft, or with 25 -mm shaft) were studied. Bone specimens cut from distal equine MC(T) III condyles were used. After screw insertion in lag fashion into 2 bone blocks with an instrumented device, shear tests were conducted in a mechanical testing machine. Outcome variables of peak insertion torque, insertion energy, stiffness, yield strength, and displacement at 3 kN of load were compared. Results— The effects of screw design were substantial. <b>Screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> were 30 % to 40 % stiffer and 60 % to 70 % stronger than <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft.</b> <b>Screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> could tolerate 80 to 95 kg more force than <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft</b> before yielding. At 3 kN load, the displacement with <b>screws</b> with <b>shaft</b> was 55 % to 60 % of that with <b>screws</b> without <b>shaft.</b> <b>Screws</b> with a long shaft tended to perform better than those with a short shaft. There {{was no difference in}} the shear stiffness, shear yield strength, or shear displacement between the 2 screw diameters. Although larger diameter screws required more insertion effort, and screws with a short shaft required the most insertion energy, these differences were small. Conclusions— Cortex screws with a long shaft of 4. 5 - or 5. 5 -mm diameter provide better stability in equine MC(T) III condyle bone with less insertion effort compared with those with a short shaft or no shaft.

5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside. [...] The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's threads. When the <b>shaft</b> of the <b>screw</b> is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{there are}} several methods for {{indicating}} wear of the steel ball and <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> components of CNC machining centres. These include wear prediction of the steel ball and <b>screw</b> <b>shaft</b> of the ball screw by using the value of backlash. This value, generally, has to be determined using expensive equipment such as a laser interferometer or a ball bar. In {{order to reduce the}} monitoring cost of ball screw wear, especially steel ball wear, a new monitoring technique is introduced. This technique was developed from a correlation between steel ball wear and the surface roughness of the machined surface of a test piece. In this research, the balls were subjected to artificial wear which were achieved by using a barrel tumbling process. Experimental results indicated that ball wear causes increase in surface roughness of a machined test piece. Employing these results, an equation for estimating steel ball wear was developed. Research results also showed that this new technique can reduce monitoring cost significantly compared with the cost of conventional methods...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{pharmaceutical}} tablets can {{be manufactured}} via three processing technologies: direct compression, dry granulation and wet granulation {{before the final}} compaction process. Dry granulation using roll compaction generally involves production of ribbons, followed by milling to produce granules {{and the production of}} tablets. The mechanical properties of ribbons produced during roll compaction can influence breakage behaviour in a mill and hence the performance of a drug formulation. Therefore it is important to explore critical factors that determine the quality of ribbons. In this study, MCC Avicel PH- 102 was used as the model powder for roll compaction and the critical operating factors affecting ribbon quality were studied. MCC 102 ribbons were manufactured at a range of process conditions (roll speed, <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed and compaction pressure) using the TF mini roll compactor with a serrated die & punch (DPS), grooved roll surface. The key ribbon properties measured are the powder feed ratio (defined as the ratio of <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed to that of roll speed) and mass throughput ratio (defined as the mass of ribbons produced in a given time to that of fines). The porosity of ribbons was observed to depend significantly on powder feed ratio into the compaction zone. Porosity remained constant at a fixed feed ratio irrespective of the absolute roll speed and the <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed conditions used. Mass throughput ratio is another factor that was introduced to describe process efficiency i. e. to draw comparison between the amount of ribbons and fines. The amount of ribbons and fines generated at a given process condition depends significantly on the <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed and the compaction pressure. In addition, ribbon porosity decreased with increasing pressure but there was negligible effect on ribbon porosity when excessively high pressure (> 60 bar) was used. Ribbon porosity was also observed to decrease with increasing <b>feed</b> <b>screw</b> speed but the converse is true with increasing roll speed. In conclusion, the impact of various roll compaction process parameters were critically investigated and a detailed insight into the main factors (powder feed and mass throughput ratios) that govern the behaviour of roll compacted ribbons was provided. In future, the focus is to relate these process properties (and ribbon porosity) to granule size distribution from a milling process...|$|R
