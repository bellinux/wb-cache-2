Special Category, or political, status meant prisoners were treated similarly to prisoners of war; for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.|$|E
50|$|A {{native of}} Belfast, MacAirt first became {{involved}} in Irish republicanism as a boy {{when he joined the}} Fianna Éireann.

5|$|The pro-independence republican party, Sinn Féin, {{received}} overwhelming endorsement in {{the general}} election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (Dáil Éireann) and government.

5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so.

5|$|In January 1981, the Provisional <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Army</b> (IRA) {{planted a}} bomb in the Suvla barrack block at RAF Uxbridge. The device was {{discovered}} and the 35RAF musicians and 15airmen living there were evacuated before it exploded. Following the incident, an enquiry began and security at all RAF stations was reviewed. The following year, many RAF personnel from the station were deployed during the Falklands War.

5|$|In the 1960s the East End was {{the area}} most {{associated}} with gangster activity, most notably {{that of the}} Kray twins.

Two people were killed and thirty-nine injured in one of Mainland Britain's biggest bomb attacks by the Provisional <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Army.</b> This led to the introduction of police checkpoints controlling access to the Isle of Dogs, reminiscent of the City's 'ring of steel'.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Conlon (née Maguire) (20 January 1926 – 19 July 2008) was an Irish {{housewife}} and {{a prominent}} campaigner {{in one of}} the most high-profile miscarriage of justice cases in British legal history.

In 1973 it set up a faction, then when it refused to dissolve in 1974 it was excluded from IS and formed the Workers Power Group.

5000|$|Despite these protestations, RSF {{has been}} proscribed by the United States State Department as {{terrorist}} organisation {{along with the}} Continuity IRA. The State Department states that the CIRA [...] "is a terrorist splinter group formed in 1994 as the clandestine armed wing of Republican Sinn Féin, which split from Sinn Féin in 1986. 'Continuity' refers to the group's belief that it is carrying on the original <b>Irish</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Army's</b> (IRA) policy of being {{the army of the}} Irish Republic. CIRA's alleged aliases, Continuity <b>Army</b> Council and <b>Republican</b> Sinn Féin, were also designated as FTOs." ...|$|R
