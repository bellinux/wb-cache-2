5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Assembly created a new, heavily Republican 6th District in Fulton and Cobb {{counties}} in the wealthy northern suburbs of Atlanta—-an area that Gingrich had never represented. Gingrich sold his home in Carrollton and moved to Marietta in the new 6th. His primary opponent, State Representative Herman Clark, made an <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> of Gingrich's 22 overdraft checks in the House Bank Scandal, and also criticized Gingrich for moving into the district. After a recount, Gingrich prevailed by 980 votes, with a 51% to 49% result. His winning the primary all but assured him of election in November. He was re-elected three times from this district against nominal Democratic opposition.|$|E

In 1983, Avalon Hill took legal action against SSI for copying game mechanics from its board games; Computer Bismarck, among other titles, was involved in the case. The two companies settled the <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> of court. The game was later re-released as part of the company's [...] "SSI classics" [...] line of popular games at discounted prices. One of SSI's later games, Pursuit of the Graf Spee, uses an altered version of Computer Bismarcks core system.|$|E

500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E

Elliot praised the CG cutscenes, but said that [...] "the tired, boxy side streets feel unfinished." [...] However, he further said that the expansive nature of environments balanced this <b>issue</b> <b>out.</b> The environments were praised by Famitsu, which stated that due to the expansive nature of the environments {{and the lack of}} hints concerning quests, new players might take a bit of time getting used to it. It also generally called the game [...] "quite nice".|$|E
500|$|Willkie {{formally}} {{accepted the}} nomination at Elwood on August 17 before {{a crowd of}} at least 150,000, the largest political gathering in U.S. history to that point. It was an extremely hot day, and Willkie, who tried to read his speech from a typed manuscript without enlargement, failed to ignite the crowd. He remained in Rushville, where he owned farmland, over the next month, trying to become more associated with his native state than with Wall Street. He gave interviews to reporters there, and his firm support of Roosevelt's aid to the Allies led Congressman Martin and Senator McNary to support a peacetime draft despite the strident objections of many Republicans and some Democrats. [...] Roosevelt contacted Willkie through intermediaries to ensure the Republican candidate would not make a political <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement; Willkie was supportive of the transfer, though he felt Congress should act, and opposed Roosevelt sending armaments to Britain by executive order.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of John F. Kennedy's death and {{favorable}} economic circumstances, Lyndon Johnson was the favorite candidate {{early on in the}} general election campaign. In light of Nelson Rockefeller's rebuke of Goldwater's political ideology at the Republican Convention, which was televised nationally, the media speculated {{as to whether or not}} Rockefeller would endorse Goldwater in the general election, barring the Goldwater campaign with more negative publicity. In addition to this, Johnson was known for his ability to manipulate the press in order to provide favorable coverage of his own campaign. [...] Johnson, along with the media, who also had a generally unfavorable opinion of Goldwater, portrayed his opponent as a political extremist. Johnson also used Goldwater's speeches to imply that he would willingly wage a nuclear war, quoting Goldwater: [...] "by one impulse act you could press a button and wipe out 300 million people before sun down." [...] In turn, Goldwater defended himself by accusing Johnson of making the accusation indirectly, and contending that the media blew the <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> of proportion.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{never bought}} a slave and {{declined}} on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, [...] "I have, through my whole life, held {{the practice of}} slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived {{for many years in}} times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap." [...] Adams generally tried to keep the <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> of national politics, because of the anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should [...] "sleep for a time." [...] He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution, due to opposition from southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Apple did {{not officially}} {{acknowledge}} this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue {{have been subject}} to censorship. The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported that six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users that this was a hardware issue which could not be repaired, and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> of the box, leading to an employee stating that they were [...] "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem that the customer has on the replacement". The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when it was reported upon by iFixit. On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported that based on data from four [...] "high-traffic" [...] Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the [...] "touch disease" [...] problem.|$|E

500|$|Bowie drew {{criticism}} {{during the}} tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of}} the first rock stars... quite as good as Jagger... He staged a country", but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Station to Station tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of Nazi memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in Stockholm as saying that [...] "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader". Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment. The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called 'Victoria Station incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top Mercedes convertible and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in NME. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave, a contention backed by a young Gary Numan who was among the crowd that day: [...] "Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> it..." [...] The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines [...] "To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading" [...] from Scary Monsters opening track [...] "It's No Game", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.|$|E

Daniel Pipes says that [...] "primarily through the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Whites spread these charges to an international audience."
