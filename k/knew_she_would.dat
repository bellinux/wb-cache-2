Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not win the election she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities.

For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.|$|E

5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} to the jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E

The British women's road team manager Julian Winn said [...] "We were afraid someone might come {{down in front of}} her, so we told her to keep to the left. We <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> chew them up after that." [...] Cooke's victory was the result of meticulous planning, as the team had ridden the course before the race and formulated the winning plan.|$|E

Her brothers were at once supportive, her father encouraged her {{to do what she}} considered her duty, but her mother and only remaining sister begged her to reconsider. To her mother's fears that she would be reviled, Stone said she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be disesteemed and even hated, but she must [...] "pursue that course of conduct which, to me, appears best calculated to promote the highest good of the world.” ...|$|E

Teena and Cindy, now known as [...] "Eve 9" [...] and [...] "Eve 10," [...] end up sharing the psychiatric ward with Eve 6 in the mental hospital. Eventually, a woman wearing a lab coat—identified as Eve 8—comes to the ward.

[...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us."

500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|The filmed pilot episode {{served as}} basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. The expanded role of Brother Justin encouraged {{the creation of}} his sister Iris in a supporting role, for which Amy Madigan was cast. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for {{the addition of the}} cootch (striptease) Dreifuss family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s. Cynthia Ettinger (Rita Sue Dreifuss) had lost her role as Martha Kent in the pilot episode of Smallville before the opportunity for Carnivàle came up and had turned to theater jobs; she chose Carnivàle because of the theater-like experience. Amanda Aday (Dora Mae Dreifuss) <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> join the cast for only a few episodes, but was not told the story reasons at that point. The writers prolonged the character arcs of recurring John Carroll Lynch (Stroud) and K Callan (Eleanor) considerably beyond their original intention. Similarly, Robert Knepper's role as Tommy Dolan was extended from a few episodes to half of both seasons because the writers had liked his performance as an [...] "ambitious man [...] Brother Justin to further his career." ...|$|E

2500|$|Durance first gained fame in 2004, {{after being}} cast as Lois Lane {{on the popular}} CW {{television}} series, Smallville, playing a sassy, street-smart teenage Lois Lane in season four. Executive Producer Kelly Souders recalled hiring Durance stating: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} wonderful actresses who came in for the role, but I remember sitting and watching her tape and everybody was like, 'That’s her.

2500|$|In {{what appears}} to be a dream, Emma wakes up in a car and is greeted by Neal, who tells her that he's just sending her a [...] "long {{distance}} call from an old friend." [...] He explains that he personally isn't in the Underworld, as it is only for those who have unfinished business, and that once they arrive, it's very hard to leave. Neal warns Emma not to go, but she refuses to listen to his advice and he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> and so he tells her he loves her and kisses her goodbye and Emma wakes up. As Emma, Gold, Mary Margaret, David, Henry, Regina, and Robin Hood arrive in the Underworld in their quest to find Hook, the ensemble comes across a brimstone-hued version of Storybrooke. Gold tells them that every soul with unfinished business lives here until it is fulfilled, and since they have arrived that means they are ready to finish it as they were responsible, as Emma sees Cruella's car that serves as an example.|$|E
2500|$|Orlando Brown portrayed Edward [...] "Eddie" [...] Thomas, Aged 14–17. He is Raven's male best friend. He is an {{aspiring}} rapper, {{and is a}} guard on the school basketball team. He is like a [...] "big brother" [...] to Cory Baxter and was commonly portrayed as playful, ambitious, loyal, girl crazy and quick to jump to conclusions. Occasionally, he says [...] "Told ya! Told ya twice!" [...] after he tells Raven not {{to do something that}} they both <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do. Another common catchphrase of his is [...] "Holla!"

In one episode, Eddie and Raven not only start to develop romantic feelings for each other but they also kiss on the lips at two separate times; however, {{by the end of the}} episode, they decide to remain friends (though its strongly implied they're still interested in one another). Eddie has appeared in every episode except Juicer Consequences.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, Lindsey {{is finally}} exposed as the Gloved Hand Killer. When Lindsey tries {{to hide from}} the police, Silas {{contacts}} her and helps her escape. She recognises him from the hospital, and he reveals his true identity to her. Silas tells her that he wants to help her as he, [...] "knew a Lynsey once before", and it is a beautiful name. He expresses a deep admiration for her work so far and offers her the chance to go into hiding with him as he feels that with the right tuition from him, the pair would make an unstoppable force. As Lindsey gives him a willing smile, the two serial killers drive off into the night. Lindsey later calls Silas in desperate need of his help after she attempts to convince Kim to steal her son, JJ from her ex-fiancé, Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Silas replies by saying that he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> return to him, and hangs up the phone with a sinister smile. Silas turns his attention to Kim, using a fake name [...] "Edward" [...] on social media, to lure her in. Believing that he has information on Lindsey's whereabouts, Kim inadvertently goes along with it. Silas tells her he is a retired policeman and uses her as a decoy so that the two killers can go ahead with their dastardly plans. Silas later meets Lindsey at a car park and tells her that he has Kim on side and that the plan is proceeding perfectly: that sooner or later, Lindsey will be reunited with her son and he will finally get another chance to claim the life of Mercedes.|$|E
