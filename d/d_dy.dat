50|$|Afaka is a {{defective}} script. Tone is phonemic but not written. Final consonants (the nasal n) are not written, but long vowels are, {{by adding a}} vowel letter. Prenasalized stops and voiced stops are written with the same letters, and syllables with the vowels u and o are seldom distinguished: The syllables o/u, po/pu, and to/tu have separate letters, but syllables starting with the consonants <b>d,</b> <b>dy,</b> f, g, l, m, n, s, y do not. Thus the Afaka rendition of Ndyuka could also be read as Dyoka. In four cases syllables with e and i are not distinguished (after the consonants m, s, w); a single letter is used for both ba and pa, and another for both u and ku. Several consonants have only one glyph assigned to them. These are ty, which only has a glyph for tya; kw (also kp), which only has ~ kpa; ny, which only has nya (though older records report that letter pulled double duty for nyu); and dy, which only has dyu/dyo. There are no glyphs assigned specifically to the consonant gw ~ gb. The result of these conflations {{is that the only}} syllables {{for which there is no}} ambiguity (except for tone) are those beginning with the consonant t.|$|E

In chapter 1, we recall a theorem due to Deligne that any rank 1 represen-tation {{of the fundamental}} group of an affine curve can appear as a connection on the trivial bundle. Then we make its generalization into two directions: firstly, we show the obstruction of the problem for rank 1 representations is the torsion of H 2 (U, Z) for an affine variety U of any dimension. Secondly, over an affine curve the theorem holds for a representation of any rank. In chapter 2, from the view of Beilinson, Bloch and Esnault, we show the classical decomposition theorems of formal connections in one variable known as the slope decomposition and the Turritin-Levelt decomposition are absolute if the connection is integrable. Finally, in chapter 3, we calculate the determinant of the period integrals for an irregular connection r = <b>d</b> + <b>dy</b> over a Legendre elliptic curve E : y 2 = x(x - 1) (x - lambda) ...|$|R

Two readers independently assessed image quality as well as anatomic and pathologic correlations. Patient comfort was evaluated using a specific score questionnaire. MR-HSG was successfully completed in all patients. In 14 / 16 (87. 4 %) patients, MR-HSG showed bilateral tubal patency with symmetric contrast agent diffusion and a regular tubo-ovarian relationship. One patient (6. 3 %) with monolateral hydrosalpinx presented no contrast agent diffusion in the affected side (monolateral tubal occlusion); in another patient (6. 3 %) the fallopian tube was displaced upward causing loss of the tubo-ovarian anatomical relationship resulting in asymmetric and inadequate contrast agent diffusion. Eight women (50 %) were found to have abnormalities on MR imaging; these abnormalities included multi follicular ovaries (5 cases 31. 1 %), endometrioma (1 case, 6. 3 %), leiomyoma (1 case / 6. 3 %) and endometrial polyp (I case / 6. 3 %).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study electrohydrodynamic {{instability}} (EHDI) in a poorly conducting parallel inviscid fluid {{in the presence}} of an electric field and space variation of electrical conductivity. It is shown that EHDI causes inhomogeniety in the material science processing. This inhomogeniety can be controlled by understanding the nature of EHDI {{in the presence of}} an electric field and a shear due to horizontal basic velocity. The condition for EHDI is determined in terms of the electric number rather than the point of inflexion of the basic velocity profile using both moment and energy methods combined with Galerkin expansion technique. From this analysis, it is shown that a proper choice of electric number controls inhomogeniety by controlling instability of a parallel poorly conducting inviscid fluid.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{introduce}} the basic theoretical tools used in small-x physics, let us start with {{the example of the}} formulation of electroproduction of vector mesons. (An extensive review was given by Besse [1]). The standard theoretical description of this kind of process relies on the so-called dipole factorization, or alternatively the k⊥-factorization of the scattering amplitudeM (see Fig. 1). In both cases, the cross section is written as the convolution in the transverse plane of a function which characterizes the projectile, and another function which describes its interaction with the target. Figure 1 : Schematic representation of dipole factorization (left) and k⊥-factorization (right). (From Ref. [1]). Dipole factorization reads, schematically MλV,λγ = is <b>dy</b> <b>d</b> 2 rΨ∗λV(y, r) Ψλγ (y, r) σ̂(x, r) (1. 1) where the Ψ’s are the wave functions of the photon and of the meson respectively, σ ̂ is the dipole cross section depending on Bjorken-x (when quantum evolution is included; at leading order, the dipole cross section is just given by two-gluon-exchange diagrams and has no x-dependence), and on the dipole size r. s is the squared center-of-mass energy. The k⊥-factorization formula instead reads MλV,λγ = is ∫ d 2 k (2 pi) 2 (k 2) ...|$|R
