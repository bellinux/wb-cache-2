50|$|There was a {{voluntary}} take-back action for thermometers containing mercury {{based on the}} Federal Waste Management Plan 2006, and carried out in close cooperation between the Austrian Chamber of Pharmacists (Österreichische Apothekerkammer), the Federal Ministry of Environment, a private waste disposer, a producer of electronic thermometers and a pharmaceutical distributor. The disposal company supplied each pharmacy (approximately 1,200) with a collection bin and covered the cost of disposal. The pharmaceutical distributor covered the logistical costs for {{the distribution of the}} thermometers. The pharmacies accepted a refund of only 0.50 Euro per thermometer for handling (which is far below their normal margin). The supplier provided the thermometers at a reduced price. The Federal Ministry supported each sold thermometer (covering about 30% of the direct costs) and advertised the project. During the collection period, consumers could bring in a mercury thermometer and buy an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermometer</b> for a subsidised price of 1 Euro. Between October 2007 and January 2008, about 465,000 electronic thermometers were sold and about one million mercury thermometers (together containing about 1 tonne of mercury) were collected.|$|E

There was significant residual heterogeneity in both mean differences and sample standard deviations within the groups using different devices and within age groups.

Central body temperature was measured with an electronic rectal thermometer (SureTemp® Plus 692 <b>Electronic</b> <b>Thermometer,</b> Welch Allyn®), and room temperature was also recorded. The four temperature gradients (°C) were calculated as follows: central-to-toe (central T–toe T), central-to-knee (central T–knee T), toe-to-room (toe T–room T) and knee-to-room (knee T–room T). Outcome at ICU discharge was recorded by the physician at bedside who was blinded to the temperature gradients. Patients were classified as survivors, dead from multiple organ failure (deaths from MOF group) or dead from secondary complications or do-not-resuscitate orders (DNR) (late deaths group). The MOF deaths group consists in patients who had not recovered from MOF secondary from their severe sepsis or septic shock and died following the bacterial injury/invasion.

40|$|Summary: The {{relationship}} between rectal and peripheral-site temperature was investigated to achieve two objectives: 1) {{to evaluate a}} prevailing practice of intersite adjustment by use of an invariant temperature difference; and 2) to develop a statistical method for intersite temperature predictions in the individual child, especially for fever as defined by rectal measurement. Rectal, oral, axillary, left abdomen skin, and forehead skin temperatures (&deg;F) were measured with an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermometer</b> in 257 children. Objective 1 was not achieved because a simple temperature difference between a peripheral site and the rectal site {{could not be used}} to predict rectal temperature reliably. For objective 2, intersite differences met three statistical criteria so that normal distribution theory could be used to derive the probabilities for occurrence of each difference. Accordingly, cumulative probability nomograms were constructed to estimate rectal-site fever from measurements at peripheral sites. This nomogram method produces a clinically reliable prediction of rectal-site fever from temperature measurement at peripheral sites, especially the oral and axillary sites. These predictions offer useful assessments of febrile illness severity when rectal temperature is not available...|$|E
30|$|In summary, we have {{designed}} and demonstrated a hybrid generator including CS-TENGs and RF-EMGs {{with the potential}} to harvest water flow-based blue energy from the environment. The output performance of the CS-TENGs and RF-EMGs was measured under the regular action of the rotary motor, and the key concept and design of our device are to combine the two generators together. Thus, the CS-TENG can harvest low-frequency energy, whereas the RF-EMG produces larger output in a high-frequency range. The generated output from the RF-EMGs can reach a peak voltage of 0.59  V and a peak current of 1.78  mA at 100  rpm. For the CS-TENGs, an output voltage and current of 315.8  V and 44.6 μA, respectively, were achieved at 100  rpm, demonstrating the applicability of the generator in a real environment. Moreover, although the CS-TENGs can directly drive a series of LEDs at low or high rates, the RF-EMGs can only light up all the LEDs at high rates. The magnet pairs that produce the attraction force are used to achieve packaging of the CS-TENG part, protecting it from the external environment. The rectified outputs have also been demonstrated to charge commercial capacitors, whose stored energy can power an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermometer</b> in a self-powered water-temperature sensing system.|$|E

The temperature of the gel blobs was taken with an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermometer</b> (Orion 290 A, Orion Research Inc., Boston, USA) every 10 minutes up to 60 minutes. The mean temperature of the 10 blobs were compared using the student t test.

The rise in temperature reached a plateau after 30 - 40 minutes. The room temperature was 24. 9 degrees C.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} study of the contact resistance of Hall bars in the Quantum Hall Effect regime while increasing the current through the sample. These measurements involve also the longitudinal resistance {{and they have been}} always performed before the breakdown of the Quantum Hall Effect. Our investigations are restricted to the $i= 2 $ plateau which is used in all metrological measurements of the von Klitzing constant $R_K$. A particular care has been taken concerning the configuration of the measurement. Four configurations were used for each Hall bar by reversing the current and the magnetic field polarities. Several samples with different width have been studied and we observed that the critical current for the contact resistance increases with the width of the Hall bar as previously observed for the critical current of the longitudinal resistance. The critical currents exhibit either a linear or a sublinear increase. All our observations are interpreted in the current understanding of the Quantum hall effect brekdown. Our analysis suggests that a heated region appears at the current contact, develops and then extends in the whole sample while increasing the current. Consequently, we propose to use the contact resistance as an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermometer</b> for the Hall fluid. Comment: 27 pages, 14 figures, resubmitted to phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{temperature}} measurement {{in the industrial}} field procedures are available, which do not need auxiliary energy. There are machine glass and bimetal thermometers as well as needle thermometers, which are filled with mercury or gas. The typical measuring error of these technical solutions is not under one per cent of the measuring range final value and rises with increasing mechanical aging {{of the elements of}} the thermometer. Battery-operated electronic thermometers can be used only in applications, where the limited life span and temperature range of the batteries do not represent a problem. A photovoltaic supplied <b>electronic</b> <b>thermometer</b> offers the advantages of an <b>electronic</b> <b>thermometer,</b> without needing a source of auxiliary energy. In cooperation with the ISET a photovoltaic supplied thermometer for Pt 2000 -sensors was developed up to production stage. A microcontroller with very small power requirement operates in the electronic circuit. The small request of supply voltage enable operation with a customized solar module. The thermometer operates already at low level of light and displays the current measured value on a large display in quasi-analog and digital form. A substantial improvement of the application parameters could be achieved in relation to conventional solutions. An point-exact recording of measurement is possible in combination with the fast responsing mode of the thermometer. The long-term stability of the measurement is achieved by the electronic signal conditioning. By the additional digital display the measured value can be read out with high accuracy. A further advantage of the device is the use of only one basic modul for a variety of different measuring ranges. The necessary adjustment takes place by an automatic calibration process during the routine check in production. Integrated diagnostic routines monitor constantly the plausibility of the sensor signal and display a break of the sensor.
