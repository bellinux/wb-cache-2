Vitamin D and calcium supplementation and hormone replacement therapy were emphasized with the goal of preventing osteoporosis.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} decade, {{blogging}} has garnered popularity amongst <b>Iranians,</b> especially <b>females.</b> Seemingly, blog writing has a dualistic role for women (i) {{to express their}} views and; (ii) is a medium for the young and educated females to represent their self- consciousness and identity. This paper intends to analyze blog entries by <b>Iranian</b> <b>female</b> bloggers using Marx's idea of class-consciousness and Gramsci's description of hegemony for this discourse. This descriptive analysis attempts to investigate to what extent blog writing helps women to express (in circumstances or societal milieu where suppression and subjugation is common) and understand their self-consciousness. In addition, this aims to investigate as to does blog writing challenge the dominant ideologies in society? Therefore, firstly, it indicates the Marx's idea of self-consciousness in terms of Class-For-Itself and Class- In- Itself. Secondly, Gramsci's definition of hegemony will be reviewed, and the two views adopted to understand the implications of blog writing by <b>Iranian</b> <b>females</b> will be briefly discussed. This study concludes with a call for further in-depth research on ‘Social Construction of Identity: Weblogs as Forum to Reflex Identity for Iranian Women’...|$|R
