The He 111's <b>flight</b> <b>performance</b> and {{handling}} were impressive although it dropped its wing in the stall. As a result, the passenger variants had their wings reduced from 25m (82ft) to 23m (75ft). The military aircraft - V1, V3 and V5 - spanned just 22.6m (74.1ft).|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause of {{its good}} {{aerodynamic}} performance and excellent controllability, the PADS which using the parachute like a wing {{has been widely}} used. To reach the accurate delivery target, the <b>flight</b> dynamic <b>performance</b> of PADS is very important.

5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better <b>flight</b> <b>performance</b> than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal <b>flight</b> <b>performance</b> and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E
5|$|Testing was, however, able to {{continue}} in the meantime, as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 contract to cover a second flight-test aircraft. Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time in}} May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in <b>flight</b> <b>performance</b> to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of the bugs did seem to have been worked out.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{elements}} of Istiodactylus {{were used to}} model pterosaur wing-mechanics by Ernest H. Hankin and David M. S. Watson in 1914, and by Cherrie D. Bramwell and George R. Whitfield in 1974, but the details of istiodactylid <b>flight</b> <b>performance</b> have not been studied. Witton suggested that istiodactylids would have been powerful fliers, due to an enlarged area for downstroke musculature attachments and well-developed pectoral and upper arm bones, and they probably spent {{much time in the}} air. Istiodactylids had wing-membranes connected to shortened bodies with short legs and long forelimbs, which may have created large wings with a high aspect ratio and low wing loadings. The wings of the istiodactylid Nurhachius have been compared to those of modern soaring birds (that fly with little flapping), and may have been ideal for low-energy soaring, which is necessary when searching for carrion. Flight is very important to birds that scavenge, as it helps them locate, reach, and eat carcasses before they are found by terrestrial carnivores. The wings of istiodactylids seem to have been shorter than those of other ornithocheiroids, which may have been more adapted to oceanic soaring; their wings may have been more suited for taking off and landing. Modern birds that soar inland have shorter and deeper wings than those that soar over the ocean; the wing shape of istiodactylids indicate that they may have preferred terrestrial settings.|$|E

40|$|We {{explored}} {{in the same}} study the two concepts of mental workload and psychological stress and their relationships with piloting activity and heart rate in low experienced pilots. Three low experienced pilots (3 males) performed 12 real flights in visual condition (lasting approximately 60 min) with a single engine piston Socata TB- 20. Results revealed higher mental workload and stress levels for take-off and landing in comparison to other flight segments. Cardiovascular measurements revealed consistent result as the highest heart rate responses (in comparison to a resting heart rate baseline) occurred during take-off (+ 45. 23 %) and landing (+ 29. 90 %). We also found a significant positive correlation between heart rate and mental workload/stress levels. In addition, mental workload and psychological stress levels during the various flight segments were positively correlated. With {{the exception of a}} positive correlation between mental workload and <b>flight</b> <b>performances</b> during the cruise segment only, {{we were not able to}} uncover tangible results regarding the relationship between workload/stress, heart rate and <b>flight</b> <b>performances.</b> This latter aspect is discussed in relation to the Yerkes-Dodson law...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the primary intention to perform air-to-ground missions, the IAF sought to configure the Lavi to perform various other roles, as Israel perceived {{the likelihood of a}} potential sustained conflict under which there would be a need to fight for aerial supremacy against the efforts of multiple neighbouring adversaries to be high. The Lavi was therefore designed to possess both the <b>flight</b> <b>performance</b> and capabilities to perform as an effective supplement to the IAF's own F-15 fleet in carrying out aerial combat missions. As the Lavi was viewed as being relatively easy to fly, the aircraft was also under consideration as an advanced jet trainer as well.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 1941, the {{preliminary}} order {{for development of}} the B-35 Flying Wing bomber was confirmed, including engineering, testing, and most importantly a 60ft (18m) wingspan, one-third scale aircraft, designated N-9M. It was {{to be used in}} gathering data on <b>flight</b> <b>performance</b> and for familiarizing pilots with the program's radical, all-wing design. The first N-9M was ordered in the original contract, but this was later expanded to three test aircraft in early 1943. A fourth was ordered a few months later after a crash of the first N-9M destroyed that airframe; this fourth N-9M incorporated various flight test-derived improvements and upgrades, including different, more powerful engines. The four aircraft were designated N-9M-1, -2, -A, and -B, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The young {{officer was}} sent to Wright Field, Ohio, and {{assigned}} to the Air Materiel Command's Flight Test Division. The world had seen the greatest advances {{in the history of}} aeronautics during the war: the piston engine reached its peak of development, jet propulsion was overturning all previous concepts of airplane design, and planes were flying higher and faster than ever before. The scientific and engineering staff at Wright Field had played a pivotal role in all of these developments. The science of training test pilots had also advanced, and Ridley had to go through the Air Materiel Command <b>Flight</b> <b>Performance</b> School from January through May 1946 before he could be put to work.
