2500|$|BS {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the BLM gene, which encodes for the Bloom syndrome protein, a RecQ helicase. These mutations may be frameshift, missense, non-sense, or mutations of other kinds {{and are likely to}} cause deletions in the gene product. Apart from helicase activity that is common to all RecQ helices, it also acts to prevent inappropriate homologous recombination. During replication of the genome, the two copies of DNA, called sister chromatids, are held together through a structure called the centromere. During this time, the homologous (corresponding) copies are in close physical proximity to each other, allowing them to 'cross' and exchange genetic information, a process called homologous recombination. Defective homologous recombination can cause mutation and <b>genetic</b> <b>instability.</b> [...] Such defective recombination can introduce gaps and breaks within the genome and disrupt the function of genes, possibly causing growth retardation, aging and elevated risk of cancer. [...] It introduces gaps and breaks within the genome and disrupts the function of genes, often causing retardation of growth, aging and elevated risks of cancers. The Bloom syndrome protein interacts with other proteins, such as topoisomerase IIIα and RMI2, and suppresses illegitimate recombination events between sequences that are divergent from strict homology, thus maintaining genome stability. [...] Individuals with BS have a loss-of-function mutation, which means that the illegitimate recombination is no longer suppressed, leading to higher rates of mutation (~10-100 times above normal, depending on cell type).|$|E
40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> {{including}} mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, lead {{to cancer}} and other diseases in humans and {{play an important role}} in evolution. A frequent cause of <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> is double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), which may arise from a wide range of exogeneous and endogeneous cellular factors. Although the repair of DSBs is required, some repair pathways are dangerous because they may destabilize the genome. One such pathway, break-induced replication (BIR), is the mechanism for repairing DSBs that possesses only one repairable end. This situation commonly arises as a result of eroded telomeres or collapsed replication forks. Although BIR plays a positive role in repairing DSBs, it can alternatively be a dangerous source of several types of <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> including loss of heterozygosity, telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase, and non-reciprocal translocations. Also, mutation rates in BIR are about 1000 times higher as compared to normal DNA replication. In addition, micro-homology-mediated BIR (MMBIR), which is a mechanism related to BIR, can generate copy-number variations (CNVs) as well as various complex chromosomal rearrangements. Overall, activation of BIR may contribute to genomic destabilization resulting in substantial biological consequences including those affecting human health...|$|R
40|$|Transgenerational {{epigenetic}} inheritance {{has been}} defined by the study of relatively few loci. We examined a population of recombinant inbred lines with epigenetically mosaic chromosomes consisting of wild-type and CG methylation-depleted segments (epiRILs). Surprisingly, transposons that were immobile in the parental lines displayed stochastic movement in 28 % of the epiRILs. Although analysis after eight generations of inbreeding, supported by genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, identified recombined parental chromosomal segments, these were interspersed with unexpectedly high frequencies of nonparental methylation polymorphism. Hence, epigenetic inheritance in hybrids derived from parents with divergent epigenomes permits long-lasting epi-allelic interactions that violate Mendelian expectations. Such persistently "unstable" epigenetic states complicate linkage-based epigenomic mapping. Thus, future epigenomic analyses should consider possible <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> and alternative mapping strategies...|$|R
40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 2 (DM 2) {{is caused}} by the extreme expansion (from < 30 repeats in normal individuals to ~ 11, 000 for the full mutation in certain patients) of the repeating tetranucleotide CCTG??CAGG sequence in the intron of the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF 9) gene. The <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> of the CCTG??CAGG repeats were investigated to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for these massive expansions. The effects of replication, recombination, repair and transcription on the <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> have been investigated in COS- 7 cells and E. coli model systems. A replication assay was established in COS- 7 cells wherein the CCTG??CAGG repeats cloned proximal to the SV 40 origin of replication resulted in expansions and deletions in a length and orientation-specific manner, whereas the repeats cloned distal to the same origin were comparatively stable. These results fit with our data obtained from biochemical studies on synthetic oligonucleotides since these biochemical studies revealed that the d(CAGG) 26 oligomer had a marked propensity to adopt a hairpin structure as opposed to its complementary d(CCTG) 26 that lacked this capacity. Furthermore, a genetic assay in E. coli was used to monitor the intramolecular frequency of recombination. This assay revealed that the tetranucleotide repeats were indeed hot spots for recombination. Moreover, studies conducted in SOS-repair mutants showed that recombination frequencies were much lower in a SOS?? strain as compared to a SOS+ strain. However, experiments conducted to ascertain the level of induction of the SOS response revealed that the SOS pathway was not stimulated in our studies. These results revealed that although breaks may occur within the repeats, the damage is most likely repaired without induction of the SOS response contrary to previous beliefs. Thus, a complex interplay of replication, recombination, and repair is likely responsible for the expansions observed in DM 2...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Break-induced {{replication}} (BIR) is {{a mechanism}} to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs) that possess only a single end that can find homology in the genome. This situation can result from the collapse of replication forks or telomere erosion. BIR frequently produces various <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> including mutations, loss of heterozygosity, deletions, duplications, and template switching that can result in copy-number variations (CNVs). An important type of genomic rearrangement specifically linked to BIR is half crossovers (HCs), which result from fusions between parts of recombining chromosomes. Because HC formation produces a fused molecule {{as well as a}} broken chromosome fragment, these events could be highly destabilizing. Here I demonstrate that HC formation results from the interruption of BIR caused by a defective replisome or premature onset of mitosis. Additionally, I document the existence of half crossover instability cascades (HCC) that resemble cycles of non-reciprocal translocations (NRTs) previously described in human tumors.

40|$|Substantial {{progress}} has been realized {{in the past several}} years in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the expansions and deletions (<b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities)</b> of repeating tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide repeating sequences associated with a number of hereditary neurological diseases.

Non-B DNA structural elements (hairpins and slipped structures, DNA unwinding elements, tetraplexes, triplexes and sticky DNA) are described.

It has been postulated that deregulation of class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), which modify the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes in activated B cells, {{may be responsible for}} aberrant chromosomal translocations and mutations of non-Ig genes that lead to lymphocyte malignancy. However, the molecular basis for these <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> is not clearly understood. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is shown to be essential and sufficient to induce both CSR and SHM in artificial substrates in fibroblasts as well as B cells.

Point mutations, but not translocations, were massively introduced in expressed T cell receptor (TCR) and c-myc genes in T lymphoma cells.

40|$|The {{influence}} of nucleotide excision repair (NER), the principal in vivo repair system for DNA damages, {{was investigated in}} Escherichia coli with uvrA, uvrB and uvrAuvrB mutants with the triplet repeat sequences (TRS) involved in myotonic dystrophy, the fragile X syndrome and Friedreich's ataxia. (CTG*CAG) 175 was more stable when the (CTG) strand was transcribed than when the (CAG) strand was transcribed in the alternate orientation. A lack of the UvrA protein dramatically increases the instability of this TRS in vivo {{as compared with the}} stability of the same sequence in uvrB mutant, which produces an intact UvrA protein. We propose that transcription transiently dissociates the triplet repeat complementary strands enabling the non-transcribed strand to fold into a hairpin conformation which is then sufficiently stable that replication bypasses the hairpin to give large deletions. If the TRS was not transcribed, fewer deletions were observed. Alternatively, in the uvrA-mutant, the hairpins existing on the lagging strand will suffer bypass DNA synthesis to generate deleted molecules.

HIV+ patients, who have largely lost their T CD 4 + cells, are susceptible to opportunistic infections, which do not normally affect healthy people. It seems that the metabolism of T cells is critical for their differentiation and their consequent functions. After activation, T cells need to undergo clonal expansion, which is a high energy- consuming process. Studies have shown that specific metabolites deprivation or their excess supply affects T CD 4 +cells subsets differentiation. Abnormal induction of subsets of T CD 4 + cells causes some autoimmunity reactions and hyper-sensitivity as well, which may result from imbalance of diet uptake.

40|$|Expansions of {{specific}} DNA triplet repeats are {{the cause of}} {{an increasing number of}} hereditary neurological disorders in humans. In some diseases, such as Huntington's and several spinocerebellar ataxias, the repetitive DNA sequences are translated into long tracts of the same amino acid (usually glutamine), which alters interactions with cellular constituents and leads to the development of disease. For other disorders, including common genetic disorders such as myotonic dystrophy and fragile X syndrome, the DNA repeat is located in noncoding regions of transcribed sequences and disease is probably caused by altered gene expression. In studies in lower organisms, mammalian cells, and transgenic mice, high frequencies of length changes (increases and decreases) occur in long DNA triplet repeats. These observations are similar to other types of repetitive DNA sequences, which also undergo frequent length changes at genomic loci. A variety of processes acting on DNA influence the genetic stability of DNA triplet repeats, including replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. It is not yet known how these diffirent multienzyme systems interact to produce the genetic mutation of expanded repeats. In vitro studies have identified that DNA triplet repeats can adopt several unusual DNA structures, including hairpins, triplexes, quadruplexes, slipped structures, and highly flexible and writhed helices.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that chronic infections with viruses, bacteria and parasites contribute to 17 · 8 % of the global burden of cancer, although only a relatively small proportion of the infection-related cancers can be attributed to helminth infections. These are important because of the high {{number of people who are}} exposed or infected worldwide. Carcinogenesis associated with helminth infections is a complex process, which may involve several different mechanisms, but chronic inflammation is a key feature. Host immune responses and immunopathological processes mediate inflammatory responses and any failure in the control of the immunological components involved in this response can lead to chronic inflammation. This may generate a microenvironment that might be conducive to the initiation and development of cancer. Inflammatory cells generate free radicals and nitrogen species, which can oxidize and damage DNA and lead to <b>genetic</b> <b>instabilities</b> and malignant transformation. Physical damage caused by the parasites, their eggs or secreted products leads to restorative hyperplasia of the damaged tissue. This may promote the propagation of cells, in which genotoxic damage and pre-malignant change has taken place.

Reducing the level of infection and the risk of getting (re) infected will reduce the risk of cancer development later in life.

Multicopy transformants, however, segregated hygr:hygs in a 1 : 2 manner that was not consistent with Mendelian expectations for a chromosomal marker, even though two unrelated auxotrophic nuclear genes were segregating normally.
