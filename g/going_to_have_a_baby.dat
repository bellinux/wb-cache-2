25|$|Stanley later {{questions}} Blanche {{about her}} earlier marriage. Blanche had married {{when she was}} very young, but her husband died, leaving her widowed and alone. The memory of her dead husband causes Blanche some obvious distress. Stanley, worried {{that he has been}} cheated out of an inheritance, demands to know what happened to Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband. For a moment, Stanley seems caught off guard over her proclaimed feelings. Afterwards, he informs Blanche that Stella is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby.</b>|$|E
500|$|Nicole {{had a brief}} {{relationship}} with Penn Graham (Christian Clark) and after he was murdered, she discovered {{that she was pregnant}} with his child. James told Sunrise that viewers could expect a [...] "realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy" [...] and she explained {{that it was important to}} respect the issue. She added [...] "We took it very seriously with the writers, and you do a lot of research and things like that. You can only do your best, I guess!" [...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby,</b> James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E
2500|$|His {{wife was}} always rolling around in pain, and X̱i7lánexw {{says to the}} men, whom he called his grandchildren, [...] "I don't know {{what is wrong with}} my wife grandchildren. The lead man knew what was wrong, for he was the great Transformer. He knows she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby.</b> He tells his two other brothers, [...] "You fellows go across and get that tree bark, those green trees over there." [...] He scraped off the bark and then asked X̱i7lánexw [...] if he had a bowl plate and told him to put three rocks in to boil the water. They took the bark of the willow tree, then gave it to the woman to drink. The lead brother told his younger brothers, [...] "You better take your {{grandfather}} outside", which they did while the oldest brother stayed with X̱i7lánexw 's wife. Not long after, they heard a baby's cry. He fixed the baby up and taught the woman {{how to take care of}} it, and told him about the medicine. He told the man that when he came him, that he had a baby boy. The first baby was a boy, and the next a girl. These two grew up together and married each other. The next baby was a girl, then a boy, and these did the same. This is where all the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh came from.|$|E

Well, now, there ain't anything in this world that sells a book like a pretty cover, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty cover for 'Every Other Week' every time.

60|$|There--in {{front of}} some furniture, stood the young couple, {{the woman who}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby,</b> and the narrow-faced youth.

60|$|Hundreds of times, {{in secret}} maiden speculations about love, the girl Una had surmised {{that it would}} be {{embarrassing}} to meet a man the morning after you had yielded to his caress. It had been perplexing--one of those mysteries of love over which virgins brood between chapters of novels, of which they diffidently whisper to other girls when young married friends are amazingly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby.</b> But she found it natural to smile up at Walter....

60|$|When {{they got}} back to London Mildred began looking for the work she had {{asserted}} was so easy to find; she wanted now to be independent of Philip; and {{she thought of the}} satisfaction with which she would announce to him that she was going into rooms and would take the child with her. But her heart failed her when she came into closer contact with the possibility. She had grown unused to the long hours, {{she did not want to}} be at the beck and call of a manageress, and her dignity revolted at the thought of wearing once more a uniform. She had made out to such of the neighbours as she knew that they were comfortably off: it would be a come-down if they heard that she had to go out and work. Her natural indolence asserted itself. She did not want to leave Philip, and so long as he was willing to provide for her, she did not see why she should. There was no money to throw away, but she got her board and lodging, and he might get better off. His uncle was an old man and might die any day, he would come into a little then, and even as things were, it was better than slaving from morning till night for a few shillings a week. Her efforts relaxed; she kept on reading the advertisement columns of the daily paper merely to show that she wanted to do something if anything that was worth her while presented itself. But panic seized her, and she was afraid that Philip would grow tired of supporting her. She had no hold over him at all now, and she fancied that he only allowed her to stay there because he was fond of the baby. She brooded over it all, and she thought to herself angrily that she would make him pay for all this some day. She could not reconcile herself to the fact that he no longer cared for her. She would make him. She suffered from pique, and sometimes in a curious fashion she desired Philip. He was so cold now that it exasperated her. She thought of him in that way incessantly. She thought that he was treating her very badly, and she did not know what she had done to deserve it. She kept on saying to herself that it was unnatural they should live like that. Then she thought that if things were different and she were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby,</b> he would be sure to marry her. He was funny, but he was a gentleman in every sense of the word, no one could deny that. At last it became an obsession with her, and she made up her mind to force a change in their relations. He never even kissed her now, and she wanted him to: she remembered how ardently he had been used to press her lips. It gave her a curious feeling to think of it. She often looked at his mouth.|$|E
