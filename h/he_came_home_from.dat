According to Kim Gyeong-won, who met Cho {{in the fifth}} grade and took classes with him, Cho finished the three-year program at Poplar Tree Elementary School in one and a half years. Cho was noted for being good at mathematics and English, and teachers pointed to him as an example for other students. At that time, according to Kim, nobody disliked Cho and he [...] "was recognized by friends as a boy of knowledge;... a good dresser who was popular with the girls." [...] Kim added that [...] "I only have good memories about him." [...] An acquaintance noted that [...] "Every time <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school he would cry and throw tantrums saying he never wanted to return to school" [...] when Cho first came to the U.S. in about the second grade.|$|E

Kojima has noted that growing up he was a {{latchkey}} kid, often having to look after himself when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school.

50|$|J. Henry Waugh is an accountant, albeit {{an unhappy}} one. However, each night after <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work, Henry immerses {{himself in a}} world of his choosing: a {{baseball}} league in which every action is ruled by the dice.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Frisingham {{was a rich}} {{widow and}} a distant {{connection}} of Stirling's. She arrived that day, and {{on the following day}} contrived to spend a few minutes alone with Stirling when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! curse him!" [...] {{retorted}} the Jewess fiercely, as a savage, cruel look {{flashed through}} her sunken eyes. [...] "He nearly killed me when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Kecskemét that time--beat {{me like a}} dog--and now [...] . . ." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, though I {{have not}} {{actually}} married him, I have solemnly sworn {{to be his}} wife when <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> abroad to claim me. It would be gross perjury not to fulfil my promise. Besides, no woman can go to church with a man to deliberately solemnize matrimony, and refuse him afterwards, if he does nothing wrong meanwhile.' ...|$|R
60|$|Chester {{went into}} the kitchen one {{afternoon}} when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school, with his lips set and his jaws even squarer than usual. Miss Salome was making some of her famous taffy, and Clemantiny was spinning yarn on the big wheel.|$|E

'If the society,' {{said the}} novice, {{who was an}} ill-looking, one-sided, shambling lad, with sunken eyes set close {{together}} in his head--'if the society would burn his house down--for he's not insured--or beat him as <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> his club at night, or help me to carry off his daughter, and marry her at the Fleet, whether she gave consent or no--' ...|$|R

60|$|It was in {{the late}} spring that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work one night aware of unusual tiredness. There was a keen {{expectancy}} {{in the air as}} he sat down to the table, but he did not notice. He went through the meal in moody silence, mechanically eating what was before him. The children um'd and ah'd and made smacking noises with their mouths. But he was deaf to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what Sir Thomas de Boots said, sir," [...] says Barnes, turning {{round to}} his father. [...] "Don't you {{remember}} when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Bombay? I recollect his saying, at Lady Featherstone's, one dooced hot night, as it seemed to us; I recklect his saying that he felt quite cold. Did you know him in India, Colonel Newcome?

5000|$|Hindley has long, brown hair, and the dark, famous [...] "Earnshaw eyes," [...] {{which also}} belong to Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Linton, and Hareton. When <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> college, <b>he</b> is {{apparently}} a greatly altered man in dress and aspect. He had grown [...] "sparer, and {{had lost his}} colour, and spoke and dressed quite differently."

5000|$|In {{her essay}} {{entitled}} [...] "Why We Love Lindsey," [...] M.S. West {{points out a}} conversation in this episode that illuminates Lindsey's character. Darla asks Lindsey why he always showers when <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work. [...] "You're never dirty," [...] she says. His reply - [...] "I'm always dirty" [...] - gives [...] "insight into Lindsey, or perhaps a clear nod to the fact he doesn't lie to himself, either," [...] West writes.|$|R
60|$|I thought I {{had read}} {{in his face}} {{that he would like}} to speak to me alone. I {{therefore}} resolved to put myself in his way next evening, as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> his work. Having settled this with myself, I fell asleep. That night, for the first time in all those many nights, the candle was taken out of the window, Mr. Peggotty swung in his old hammock in the old boat, and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head.|$|E
60|$|Soon after Greythorpe's visit Mrs. Chudleigh went away, leaving Challoner unpleasantly {{uncertain}} about the course she might take. He was still without news of Blake; {{he could not}} question his son, whose integrity he tried hard to believe in, and he spent a few anxious weeks. Then one evening when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a neighbour's house {{he was told that}} a man who had called to see him some time earlier was in the library. Challoner glanced at the card his servant gave him.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{an admirable}} fitness in your union, and I {{had been able}} [...] to watch how it became closer and easier, in spite of so much to [...] {{separate}} you, in mental habits, in early affinities, and even in [...] the form of fundamental convictions, since <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> your [...] budget, overwhelmed, thirty-eight years ago. I saw all the [...] connections which had their root in social habit fade before the [...] one which took its rise from public life and proved more firm and [...] more enduring than the rest.|$|E
5000|$|Still {{another source}} of {{frustration}} for The Old Man is the dogs that belong to the next door neighbors, the Bumpuses. The Bumpuses own [...] "at least 785 smelly hound dogs" [...] that harass The Old Man whenever <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work. On Christmas Day, the dogs ruin the family's Christmas dinner by romping through their kitchen and eating their turkey. This results in the family having dinner at a Chinese restaurant instead.|$|R

"When <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> shooting, or the farm, if you COULD see dear Thomas {{with me and}} our dear little Bob! as I sit on one knee, {{and baby}} on the other, and as he dances us both about.

6000|$|... "No, we {{are going}} to capture him tonight; or if not tonight, {{tomorrow}} night. Two of the Bow Street officers are going down with me, and we shall have him as <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> one of his expeditions either on the highway or as a house breaker. If he does not go this evening we shall wait until tomorrow, but at any rate, {{the first time that he}} goes out we shall have him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Askew's!" [...] shouted Osborn, {{straightening}} his bent {{shoulders with}} a savage jerk. [...] "This {{is more than}} I can bear.

[...] He stopped and gasped as if his rage were choking him and it was some moments before he went on: [...] "You have given the fellow power to humble us and drag our name in the mud. Can't you imagine how he'll exult? Our honor in Askew's hands! It's unthinkable!" ...|$|E
60|$|Pony {{understood}} {{that his father}} was just making fun about the fourth reader, but was in earnest about his going back to school; and he left the table and threw himself on the lounge, with his face down, and cried. He said he was sick, and his head ached, and he could not go to school; his father said that he hoped his headache would wear off {{in the course of the}} afternoon, but if he was worse they would have the doctor when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school.|$|E
60|$|Susan spoiled Shirley shamelessly that winter. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Queen's every week-end, and Susan had all his {{favourite}} dishes for him, {{in so far}} as {{she could}} evade or wheedle the doctor, and waited on him hand and foot. Though she talked war constantly to everyone else she never mentioned it to him or before him, but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse; and when the German retreat from the Bapaume salient began and continued, Susan's exultation was linked up with something deeper than anything she expressed. Surely the end was in sight--would come now before--anyone else--could go.|$|E

5000|$|But {{though these}} boys [...] "career" [...] around the {{neighbourhood}} {{in a very}} childlike way, they are also aware of and interested in the adult world, as represented by their spying on the narrator’s uncle as <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work and, more importantly, on Mangan’s sister, whose dress “swung as she moved” and whose “soft rope of hair tossed from side to side.” These boys are {{on the brink of}} sexual awareness and, awed by the mystery of the opposite sex, are hungry for knowledge.|$|R
