40|$|Abstract. Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{associated}} with the presence of inflammation. Sialic acid (SA), an acetylated derivative of neuraminic acid, is reported to be a useful biomarker of inflammation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the correlation between SA levels in the serum and synovial fluid (SF) and radiographic severity in patients with knee OA. A total of 234 patients with knee OA were recruited for the study, as well as 20 patients that had suffered a knee injury or fracture (without knee OA) and 160 healthy controls. Radiological grading of OA in the knee was conducted according to the Kellgren‑Lawrence (KL) <b>grading</b> system. <b>SA</b> levels in the serum and SF were measured using Warren's thiobarbituric acid assay. The results demonstrated that knee OA patients exhibited significantly elevated levels of serum SA when compared with the healthy controls, and also signifi-cantly elevated levels of SF SA when compared with the knee fracture patients. Higher SA levels in the SF were identified in knee OA patients with KL grade 4 as compared with patients with KL grade 2 or 3. In addition, OA patients of KL grade 3 had significantly higher SA levels in the SF as compared with patients with KL grade 2 (P< 0. 01). The SA levels in the SF of the knee OA patients positively correlated with the KL grades (r= 0. 353; P< 0. 01). However, there was no significant correlation identified between serum SA levels and KL <b>grade.</b> Therefore, <b>SA</b> levels in the SF positively correlated with the radiographic severity of OA, thus, SA levels in the SF may serve as a biomarker for the progression of OA...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{survival rates}} {{of patients with}} lymphoma in South Australia. DESIGN AND SETTING: De-identified data from the SA Cancer Registry on all patients with lymphoma were analysed, {{as well as the}} subgroup treated at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH). For non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), we used the International Working Formulation (IWF) <b>grading.</b> <b>SA</b> and RAH data on survival rates were compared with those for the whole of Australia and the United States. PATIENTS: All patients diagnosed with lymphoma and treated in SA in 1977 – 2007. OUTCOME MEASURES: 5 -year survival rates for patients with lymphoma, by type of lymphoma and age. RESULTS: Of the total of 8651 patients with lymphoma, 939 were classified as having Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 7712 as having NHL. Of those with NHL, 1805 had low-grade, 3576 intermediate-grade, and 510 high-grade NHL. In another 1821 patients, the data were insufficient to make an IWF grading. There was a substantial increase in 5 -year survival rates for patients with lymphoma between 1977 and 2007 in SA. While the increase in 5 -year survival rates for HL was 7. 6 percentage points, survival rates peaked at 88 %. For NHL, there was an 18. 7 percentage points increase in 5 -year survival rates. The first significant increase of 7 percentage points was associated with the introduction of bone marrow transplantation; this was maintained with the increase in 5 -year survival rates reaching 14 percentage points by 1995 – 1999. Since 1999, there has been a further increase of 5 percentage points in 5 -year survival rates with the introduction of rituximab. CONCLUSION: Outcomes in patients with NHL have improved significantly, most likely because of the use of bone marrow transplantation and rituximab. Hospital- and state-based cancer registry data reflect the reality of population outcomes and the impact of new technologies. Brendon J. Kearney, Luen Bik To, Daniel J. Kearney, David Roder, Colin G.

The term ‘resilience’ refers to pupils’ own views of their potential to learn and succeed in school in a social context, where parents are important as normative actors. Data consists of group interviews with pupils at three schools. By using a narrative analysis, a perspective is adopted that considers the multiple meanings involved when pupils position themselves in their stories about grades and parents. The analysis illustrates how a situated understanding of pupils’ senses of resilience makes family expecta- tions, and the importance of pleasing yourself and others and of adapting to grading systems, important aspects to pupils’ own views of their potential to learn and succeed at school. Home and school stand out as different arenas based on the norm of success, but with different ideas {{about how to deal with}} schoolwork and grades.

40|$|For {{successful}} {{execution of}} the In-Vessel Retention (IVR) and External Reactor Vessel Cooling (ERVC) strategy, defining the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) on the outer surface of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) is a key objective to secure the thermal integrity of the RPV. Since the CHF is strongly affected by surface conditions of the heating material, if any surface treatments are not applied to the RPV outer surface, corrosion can govern the effects on the CHF. Note that natural corrosion occurs continuously for long time on the RPV. In this regard, pool boiling heat transfer experiment under atmospheric pressure with deionized water was conducted with the pre-oxidized RPV material, whose <b>grade</b> is <b>SA</b> 508. The CHF of the bare SA 508 increased by 1. 5 times, as the heating surface is gradually oxidized approaching the CHF. As a result, it became hydrophilic and nano-porous {{with the formation of}} magnetite nanoparticles during nucleate boiling. When the SA 508 was pre-oxidized at 300 °C in dry air, however, the CHF was deteriorated even though the oxidized surface was still hydrophilic. Considering that the thermal properties of the pre- oxidized surface experiences some changes as the crystallized oxide layer forms with the specific thickness, the thermal effusivity of magnetite layer is lowered by 0. 28 times than that of the bare SA 508. Based on the thermal activity-based theory, it may disseminate the effect of lateral heat dissipation, subsequently promotes local dry spot. Consequently, the oxidation behavior of the RPV shows some potential in generating adverse effect on the CHF. Copyright © (2015) by American Nuclear Society All rights reserved.

A gap is identified between the social skill training model and {{a need for a}} theoretical base upon which to formulate further research. This study seeks to evaluate a proposed relationship between the Locus of Control construct and socio-developmental processes that effect social status, and academic achievement in classroom settings. Emphasis is placed upon the academic orientations, social perspectives, and expectations of regular and special education students. Two sociometric rating scales were used to measure Achievement (NA) and Social Acceptability (SA) status. The Intellectual Achievement Response questionnaire (IAR) was used to measure Locus of Control orientation. First quarter grade point averages (GPAs) were utilized as objective measures of academic achievement. The sample consisted of 218 fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth-grade students drawn from a Middle school in southeastern Wisconsin. Twenty-eight special education students participated in this study. They were enrolled in the Speech and Language program, the program for the Emotionally Disturbed, and the Learning Disability program. Age, sex, grade level, achievement, social status, and Locus of Control orientation relationships were hypothesized. Analysis of data revealed a relationship between the Achievement (NA) and Social Acceptability (SA) variables. The Locus of Control (IAR) scores were not found to be related to Achievement (NA), Social Acceptability (<b>SA),</b> <b>grade</b> point average (GPA), sex, class enrollment, or grade level of the students.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The Global Solar Ultraviolet Index (UVI) is {{a health}} {{communication}} tool used {{to inform the}} public about the health risks of excess solar UV radiation and encourage appropriate sun-protection behaviour. Knowledge and understanding of the UVI has been evaluated among adult populations but not among school students. OBJECTIVES. To draw on previously unpublished data from two school-based studies, one in New Zealand (NZ) and the other in South Africa (SA), to investigate and compare students’ knowledge of the UVI and, where possible, report their understanding of UVI. METHODS. Cross-sectional samples of schoolchildren in two countries answered questions on whether they had seen or heard of the UVI and questions aimed at probing their understanding of this measure. RESULTS. Self-report questionnaires were completed by 1 177 students, comprising 472 NZ (264 year 8 (Y 8), 214 year 4 (Y 4) students) and 705 <b>SA</b> <b>grade</b> 7 primary-school students aged 8 - 13 years. More than half of the NZ Y 8 students answered that they had previously heard about or seen the UVI, whereas significantly more SA students and NZ Y 4 students replied that they had neither seen nor heard about the UVI. Among the NZ students who had seen or heard of the UVI, understanding of the tool was fairly good. CONCLUSION. The observed lack of awareness among many students in both countries provides an opportunity to introduce an innovative and age-appropriate UVI communication method that combines level of risk with behavioural responses to UVI categories and focus on personal relevance to the UVI message.

40|$|Hva menes med at noe er ”godt dokumentert”? I hvilken grad kan vi stole på forskningsresultater? Den mest brukte metoden for å vurdere kvalitet på dokumentasjon og styrke på anbefalinger er GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). GRADE brukes i systematiske oversikter og i retningslinjer der man vurderer effekten av og gir anbefalinger om ulike behandlingsalternativer. I GRADE gjøres et klart skille mellom kvaliteten på dokumentasjonen og styrken på anbefalingene. For å vurdere kvaliteten på dokumentasjonen tar GRADE utgangspunkt i en godt utført systematisk oversikt som omfatter den aktuelle problemstillingen. Både randomiserte forsøk og observasjonsstuder kan inngå. GRADE benytter fem kriterier som vurderes for eventuell nedgradering av kvaliteten på dokumentasjonen: studiekvalitet, konsistens mellom studiene, direkthet, presisjon og rapporteringsskjevheter. I tillegg kan observasjonsstudier vurderes for oppgradering ved følgende tre kriterier: sterke assosiasjoner, dose-responseffekter og forvekslingsfaktorer. Alle vurderingene noteres og presenteres sammen med resultatene i oppsummeringstabeller. Vist GE, Sæterdal I, Vandvik PO, Flottorp <b>SA.</b> <b>Grading</b> {{the quality}} of the evidence.

The most commonly used method to grade {{the quality of}} the evidence is GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). GRADE is used in systematic reviews, where the effects of different treatments or options are being compared, and in guidelines with recommendations about the competing options. GRADE makes a clear distinction between {{the quality of the}} evidence and the strength of recommendation. When grading the quality of the evidence with GRADE, the starting point is a well conducted systematic review of research on the question that is being assessed. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies can be included in the evaluation. GRADE uses five criteria to judge for possible downgrading {{of the quality of the}} evidence: risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision and reporting bias. Observational studies may in addition be assessed for possible upgrading of the quality of evidence using the following three criteria: strong association, dose response relationship, and plausible confounding. All the judgments are noted and presented together with the results in tables. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Gasification {{provides}} a proven {{alternative to the}} dependence on petroleum {{for the production of}} high value products such as liquid fuels and chemicals. Syngas, the main product from gasification can be converted to fuels and chemicals via a number of possible synthesis processes. Coal and natural gas are currently the main feedstock used for syngas production. In South Africa (SA), Sasol operates the largest commercial coal-to-liquids conversion process in the world, based on updraft fixed bed gasification of low grade coal to syngas. Co-utilizing alternative and more sustainable feedstock (such as biomass and wastes) with coal in existing coal-based plants offers a realistic approach to reducing the costs and risks associated with setting up dedicated biomass conversion plants. An experimental and modelling investigation was performed to assess the impacts of co-gasifying two of the most commonly available agricultural wastes in SA (sugarcane bagasse and corn residue) with typical low <b>grade</b> <b>SA</b> coals, on the main products of updraft fixed bed gasification, i. e. liquid condensates and syngas. Condensates are produced in the pyrolysis section of the updraft gasifier, whereas syngas is a result of residual char conversion. An experimental set-up that simulates the pyrolysis section of the gasifier was employed to investigate the yield and composition of devolatilized products at industrially relevant conditions of 26 bars and 400 - 600 °C. The results show that about 15 wt% of coal and 70 wt% of biomass are devolatilized during the pyrolysis process. The biomass derived condensates were determined to comprise of significantly higher quantities of oxygenates such as organic acids, phenols, ketones, and alcohols, whereas coal derived hydrocarbon condensates were dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, creosotes and phenols. Results of investigation into the influence of coal-biomass feedstock mix ratio on yields of products from pyrolysis show limited evidence of non-additive or synergistic behaviour on the overall distribution of solid, liquid and gas yields. On the other hand, in terms of the distribution of specific liquid phase hydrocarbons, there was significant evidence in favour of non-additive pyrolysis behaviour, as indicated by the non-additive yield distribution of specific chemicals. Synergistic trends could also be observed in the thermogravimetric (TGA) study of pyrolysis under kinetically controlled non-isothermal conditions. Model free and model fitting kinetic analysis of the TGA data revealed activation energies ranging between 94 - 212 kJ mol- 1 for the biomass fuels and 147 - 377 kJ mol- 1 for coal. Synergistic interactions may be linked to the increased presence of hydrogen in biomass fuels which partially saturates free radicals formed during earlier stages of devolatilization, thereby preventing secondary recombination reactions that would have produced chars, allowing for the increased formation of volatile species instead. Analysis of char obtained from the co-pyrolysis experiments revealed that the fixed carbon and volatile content of the blended chars is is proportional to the percentage of biomass and coal in the mixture. CO 2 reactivity experiments on the chars showed that the addition of biomass to coal did not impose any kinetic limitation on the gasification of blended chars. The blended chars decomposed at approximately the same rate as when coal was gasified alone, even at higher biomass concentrations in the original feedstock blend. Based on these observations, a semi-empirical equilibrium based simulation of syngas production for co-gasification of coalbiomass blends at various mix ratios was developed using ASPEN Plus. The model showed that H 2 /CO ratio was relatively unaffected by biomass addition to the coal fuel mix, whereas syngas heating value and thermal efficiency were negatively affected. Subsequent evaluation of the production cost of syngas at biomass inputs ranging between 0 - 20 wt% of coal reflected the significant additional cost of pretreating biomass (3. 3 % of total capital investment). This resulted in co-gasification derived syngas production costs of ZAR 146 /tonne (ZAR 12. 6 /GJ) at 80 : 20 coalbiomass feedstock ratio, compared to a baseline (coal only) cost of ZAR 130 /tonne (ZAR 10. 7 /GJ). Sensitivity analysis that varied biomass costs from ZAR 0 ZAR 470 revealed that syngas production costs from co-gasification remained significantly higher than baseline costs, even at low to zero prices of the biomass feedstock. This remained the case even after taking account of a carbon tax of up to ZAR 117 /tCO 2. However, for range of carbon tax values suggested by the SA treasury (ZAR 70 tCO 2 to ZAR 200 tCO 2), the avoided carbon tax due to co-feeding biomass can offset between 40 - 96 % of the specific retrofitting cost at 80 : 20 coal-biomass feedstock mass ratio. In summary, this dissertation has showed that in addition to the widely recognized problems of ash fouling and sintering, co-feeding of biomass in existing coal based updraft gasification plants poses some challenges in terms of impacts on condensates and syngas quality, and production costs. Further research is required to investigate the potential in ameliorating some of these impacts by developing new high value product streams (such as acetic acid) from the significant fraction of condensates derived from biomass. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Vergassing bied 'n beproefde alternatief vir die afhanklikheid van petroleum vir die produksie van hoë waarde produkte soos vloeibare brandstof en chemikalieë. Sintese gas, die belangrikste produk van vergassing, kan omgeskakel word na brandstof en chemikalieë deur 'n aantal moontlike sintese prosesse. Steenkool en aardgas is tans die belangrikste grondstowwe wat gebruik word vir sintese gas produksie. In Suid-Afrika (SA) bedryf Sasol die grootste kommersiële steenkool-totvloeistof omskakelingsproses in die wêreld, gebaseer op stygstroom vastebed vergassing van laegraadse steenkool na sintese gas. Die gebruik van alternatiewe en meer volhoubare grondstowwe (soos biomassa en afval) saam met steenkool in die bestaande steenkool-gebaseerde aanlegte bied 'n realistiese benadering tot die vermindering van die koste en risiko's wat verband hou met die oprigting van toegewyde biomassa omskakelingsaanlegte. 'n Eksperimentele en modelleringsondersoek is uitgevoer om die impak van gesamentlike vergassing van twee van die mees algemeen beskikbare landbouafvalprodukte in Suid-Afrika (suikerriet bagasse en mieliereste) met tipiese laegraadse SA steenkool op die vernaamste produkte van stygstroom vastebed vergassing, dws vloeistof kondensate en sintese gas, te evalueer. Kondensate word geproduseer in die piroliese gedeelte van die stygstroomvergasser, terwyl sintese gas 'n resultaat is van die omskakeling van oorblywende houtskool. 'n Eksperimentele opstelling wat die piroliese gedeelte van die vergasser simuleer is gebruik om die opbrengs en die samestelling van produkte waarvan die vlugtige komponente verwyder is by industrie relevante toestande van 26 bar en 400 - 600 °C te ondersoek. Die resultate toon dat ongeveer 15 % (massabasis) van die steenkool en 70 % (massabasis) van die biomassa verlore gaan aan vlugtige komponente tydens die piroliese proses. Daar is vasgestel dat die kondensate afkomstig van biomassa uit aansienlik hoër hoeveelhede suurstofryke verbindings soos organiese sure, fenole, ketone, en alkohole bestaan, terwyl koolwaterstofkondensate afkomstig uit steenkool oorwegend bectaan uit polisikliese aromatise verbindings, kreosote en fenole. Die resultate van die ondersoek na die invloed van die verhouding van steenkool tot biomassa grondstof op piroliese opbrengste toon beperkte bewyse van nie-toevoegende of sinergistiese gedrag op die algehele verspreiding van soliede, vloeistof en gas opbrengste. Aan die ander kant, in terme van die verspreiding van spesifieke vloeibare fase koolwaterstowwe, was daar beduidende bewyse ten gunste van 'n sinergistiese piroliese gedrag. Sinergistiese tendense is ook waargeneem in die termogravimetriese (TGA) studie van piroliese onder kineties beheerde nieisotermiese toestande. Modelvrye en modelpassende kinetiese analise van die TGA data het aan die lig gebring dat aktiveringsenergieë wissel tussen 94 - 212 kJ mol- 1 vir biomassa brandstof en 147 - 377 kJ mol- 1 vir steenkool. Ontleding van die houtskool verkry uit die gesamentlike piroliese eksperimente het aan die lig gebring dat die onmiddellike kenmerke van die gemengde houtskool die geweegde gemiddelde van die individuele waardes vir steenkool en biomassa benader. CO 2 reaktiwiteitseksperimente op die houtskool het getoon dat die byvoeging van biomassa by steenkool nie enige kinetiese beperking op die vergassing van gemengde houtskool plaas nie. Die gemengde houtskool ontbind teen ongeveer dieselfde tempo as wanneer steenkool alleen vergas is, selfs teen hoër biomassa konsentrasies in die oorspronklike grondstofmengsel. Op grond van hierdie waarnemings is 'n semi-empiriese ewewig-gebaseerde simulasie van sintese gas produksie vir gesamentlike vergassing van steenkool-biomassa-mengsels vir verskeie mengverhoudings ontwikkel met behulp van Aspen Plus. Die model het getoon dat die H 2 /CO verhouding relatief min geraak is deur biomassa by die steenkool brandstofmengsel te voeg, terwyl sintese gas se verhittingswaarde en termiese doeltreffendheid negatief geraak is. Daaropvolgende evaluering van die produksiekoste van sintese gas vir biomassa insette wat wissel tussen 0 - 20 % (massabasis) van die hoeveelheid steenkool het die aansienlike addisionele koste van die vooraf behandeling van biomassa (3. 3 % van die totale kapitale belegging) gereflekteer. Dit het gelei tot 'n produksiekoste van ZAR 146 /ton (ZAR 12. 6 /GJ) vir sintese gas afkomstig uit gesamentlike-vergassing van 'n 80 : 20 steebkool-biomassa grondstof mengesl, in vergelyking met 'n basislyn (steenkool) koste van ZAR 130 /ton (ZAR 10. 7 /GJ). Sensitiwiteitsanalise wat biomassa koste van ZAR 0 - ZAR 470 gevarieër het, het aan die lig gebring dat sintese gas produksiekoste van gesamentlike vergassing aansienlik hoër bly as die basislyn koste, selfs teen 'n lae of nul prys van biomassa grondstof. Dit bly die geval selfs nadat koolstof belasting van tot ZAR 117 /tCO 2 in ag geneem is. In opsomming het hierdie verhandeling getoon dat, bykomend tot die wyd-erkende probleme van as besoedeling en sintering, die gesamentlike gebruik van biomassa in bestaande steenkool stygstroom vergassingsaanlegte groot uitdagings inhou in terme van die impak op die kwaliteit van kondensate en sintese gas, asook produksiekoste. Verdere navorsing is nodig om die potensiaal te ondersoek vir die verbetering van sommige van hierdie impakte deur die ontwikkeling van nuwe hoë waarde produkstrome (soos asynsuur) uit die beduidende breukdeel van kondensate wat verkry word uit biomassa...|$|R
