5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a <b>good</b> <b>story</b> to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a <b>good</b> <b>story.</b> The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic {{over the next few}} years.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead as a vehicle for a <b>good</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

Before leaving the Soviet Union, she became friends with the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky, who urged her to write her memoirs; she followed his advice. She met with Zinaida Gippius, Alexander Blok and Valery Bryusov. Her memories of life at court provided rare descriptions of the home life of the Tsar and his family.

500|$|According to Thompson, Lee [...] "arrived on {{set with}} the whole movie in his head". Rather than focus on period details, he wanted his film to {{concentrate}} on telling a <b>good</b> <b>story.</b> He showed the cast a selection of films adapted from classic novels, including Barry Lyndon and The Age of Innocence, which he believed to be [...] "great movies; everybody worships the art work, [...] it's not {{what we want to}} do."

[...] Series creator, Chris Carter convinced Arkin to re-write his story and replace the human with an actual monster. Arkin quickly re-wrote his story, and included elements of the Tulpa myth to create a literal monster. The idea to [...] "marry" [...] Mulder and Scully came from a writers meeting.

500|$|Kindt's art {{style is}} a common area of {{criticism}} for the book.

Reviewer Colin Smith initially felt the art was a weak point the <b>good</b> <b>story</b> could not overcome, but changed his mind after subsequent issues. Later issues continued to receive praise; however, sales for later issues fell until bottoming out with 4706 orders for issue seven. Sales then began to increase, with 5842 orders for issue ten.

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 30, 1910. The film was released in Britain under the title A Quack Hypnotist on April 26, 1913. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theaters include those in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Kansas. Some theaters did not provide the production credits, complicating identification with Selig Polyscope's Hypnotized. The film received a positive review in the Moving Picture World which said, [...] "It is a <b>good</b> <b>story,</b> well told, and the audience seems intensely interested in it." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror offered a review that neither commended or criticized the production in its summary review of the film.|$|E

[...] Tubb, who sold many popular stories to Hamilton, comments that [...] "Authors wrote for Nebula with financial reward taking secondary place; the desire of submitting a <b>good</b> <b>story</b> being of primary importance ... the writers and the contributors felt as if Nebula was 'their' magazine, and all that became a happy, well-integrated family." ...|$|E
