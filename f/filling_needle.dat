40|$|Cell-sized {{lipid bilayer}} {{membrane}} vesicles (giant vesicles, GVs) or semi-vesicles were formed from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine on a platinum electrode under applied electric voltage by electroformation. Micromanipulation of the semi-vesicle by first pressing its membrane with a glass microneedle and then withdrawing the needle left a GV {{in the interior of}} the vesicle. During the process, an aqueous solution of Ficoll that <b>filled</b> the <b>needle</b> was introduced into the newly formed inner vesicle and remained encapsulated. Approximately 50 % of attempted micromanipulation resulted in the formation of an inner daughter vesicle, “microvesiculation”. By repeating the microvesiculation process, multiple inner GVs could be formed in a single parent semi-vesicle. A semi-vesicle with inner GVs could be detached from the electrode by scraping with a microneedle, yielding an oligovesicular vesicle (OVV) with desired inner aqueous contents. Microvesiculation of a GV held on the tip of a glass micropipette was also possible, and this also produced an OVV. Breaking the membrane of the parent semi-vesicle by micromanipulation with a glass needle after microvesiculation, released the inner GVs. This protocol may be used for controlled formation of GVs with desired contents...|$|R

30|$|Each trial {{consisted}} of three separate runs of homogenized milk from the Purdue University Dairy Research and Education Center (W. Lafayette, IN). Three hundred gallons (~ 1136 L) per run were processed using the tubular pasteurizer followed by the MST chamber (Arofikin 2010). Milk was pumped into a mixing vat and inoculated with 1 L of the stored, concentrated P. fluorescens Migula or L. fermentum (4  ×  109 and 1.2  ×  1010 cfu/mL, respectively). Raw milk bacterial load was 5.7  ×  104 (± 1.5  ×  103) cfu/mL. The inoculated milk was then pumped into the holding basin within the pasteurization unit and processed. The duration of each run was approximately 30  min. Samples of milk were collected at 3 time points (10  min intervals) throughout the run, and at locations before processing, after the pasteurizer, and after the MST chamber. Before extraction, sterile sample diaphragms were attached to collecting ports, and were additionally treated with 70  % ethanol.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of arthroscopic airbrush assisted cartilage repair. METHODS: An airbrush device (Baxter) was used to spray both human expanded osteoarthritic chondrocytes and choncrocytes with their pericellular matrix (chondrons) at 1 × 10 (6) cells/ml fibrin glue (Tissucol, Baxter) in vitro. Depth-dependent cell viability was assessed for both methods with confocal microscopy. Constructs were cultured for 21 days to assess matrix production. A controlled human cadaveric study (n = 8) was performed to test the feasibility of the procedure in which defects were filled with either arthroscopic airbrushing or needle extrusion. All knees were subjected to 60 min of continuous passive motion and scored on outline attachment and defect filling. RESULTS: Spraying both chondrocytes and chondrons in fibrin glue resulted in a homogenous cell distribution throughout the scaffold. No difference in viability or matrix production between application methods was found nor between chondrons and chondrocytes. The cadaveric study revealed that airbrushing was highly feasible, and that defect <b>filling</b> through <b>needle</b> extrusion was more difficult to perform based on fibrin glue adhesion and gravity-induced seepage. Defect outline and coverage scores were consistently higher for extrusion, albeit not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Both chondrons and chondrocytes can be evenly distributed in a sprayed fibrin glue scaffold without affecting viability while supporting matrix production. The airbrush technology is feasible, easier to perform than needle extrusion and allows for reproducible arthroscopic filling of cartilage defects...|$|R

They came because Raya felt guilty for what happened even though Bayu had told her that it wasn't her fault, Dodo had been the target of Jendra's men. At the hospital, Raya and Bayu met Bram. The situation was getting intense when Bram held Raya's shoulder. Because of his jealousy, Bayu went back to his office, leaving Raya with Bram. Bram took her out of town to a waterfall and kissed her. Desi, Bayu's fiancée who also works in Target, was jealous of Bayu because he didn't tell her he was going with Raya to the hospital. She was quite suspicious of him because he hadn't decided the date of their wedding. Raya interviewed Jendra at Red Bar. However, during the interview Jendra didn't answer what Raya asked.

40|$|The medial preoptic nucleus (POM) of the quail preoptic area is sexually dimorphic and {{testosterone}} sensitive. Stereotaxic implantation of <b>needles</b> <b>filled</b> with crystalline testosterone {{demonstrated that}} the POM is a critical site of steroid action in the control of copulatory behavior. Only implants located in the POM reliably restored the behavior in castrated birds. Implants around the nucleus weakly activated the behavior; those which were distant by more than 200 microns were totally inactive. Electrolytic lesions confirmed {{the role of the}} POM in the control of copulatory behavior. The percentage of the POM which was lesioned was highly correlated to the behavioral deficit while the absolute size of the lesion was not. Electrolytic lesions in or around POM also significantly decreased the volume of the nucleus suggesting that the afferents and efferents of the nucleus are required for its full development. The total volume of the POM was correlated with the sexual behavior of the birds. The morphological changes in POM observed following exposure to testosterone probably represent the signature of the behavioral effects of the steroid.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of in vivo imaging in mouse models of disease, there are many interesting applications that demand imaging of organs and tissues with submillimeter resolution. Though there are other contributing factors, the spatial resolution in small-animal PET is still largely determined by the detector pixel dimensions. Methods: In this work, a pair of lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) arrays with 0. 5 -mm pixels was coupled to multichannel photomultiplier tubes and evaluated for use as high-resolution PET detectors. Results: Flood histograms demonstrated that most crystals were clearly identifiable. Energy resolution varied from 22 % to 38 %. The coincidence timing resolution was 1. 42 -ns full width at half maximum (FWHM). The intrinsic spatial resolution was 0. 68 -mm FWHM as measured with a 30 -gauge <b>needle</b> <b>filled</b> with F- 18. The improvement in spatial resolution in a tomographic setting is demonstrated using images of a line source phantom reconstructed with filtered backprojection and compared with images obtained from 2 dedicated small-animal PET scanners.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} two approaches, {{microinjection}} and cell localization, {{to analyze the}} biological properties of cellular phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2). As both approaches rely primarily {{on the availability of}} anti-PLA 2 antibodies, methods for obtaining suitable anti-PLA 2 antibodies are also included. The microinjection technique is a valuable tool for the assay of the functional significance of cellular proteins. This technique allows one to modulate the level and/or activity of a particular protein by introducing defined amounts of the protein or antibodies directed against the protein into the cells. In view of the paucity of specific PLA 2 inhibitors, microinjection of inhibitory anti-PLA 2 antibodies makes this approach the method of choice to assay the role of phospholipase A 2 in various cellular processes. The procedure utilizes a glass capillary <b>needle</b> <b>filled</b> with the substance to be injected into the cell, a micromanipulator to place the needle into the cell, and a phase-contrast microscope to allow visualization of the injection process. The analytical potential of microinjection experiments depends on two parameters: (1) the ability to positively identify injected cells, and (2) the availability of a single cell assay that can be monitored visually. For convenience, cells are grown on coverslips, which can then be processed and mounted on slides for observation. In the case of cells that adhere poorly to glass, adhesion and cell growth can be improved by cleaning the coverslips with chromic acid or coating the surface with a positively charged polymer...|$|R

MethodsIn a static environment, consisting of a syringe to which a pressure monitoring kit was connected, experiments were performed to study the influence of the type of device (either needle or catheter) and the effect of the characteristics of the medium on the accuracy and reproducibility of pressure measurements. The pressures obtained with the needle in the different kinds of media were compared with those obtained in blood. Similar experiments were performed using a pressure catheter. Subsequently, pressure measurements were performed in a dynamic and physiological environment. This environment consisted of an artificial circulation in which an aneurysm, constructed of porcine aorta and filled with human aortic thrombus, was mounted. The pressures were compared and analyzed by Bland–Altman plots. ResultsUnder static conditions, the pressure levels obtained by a needle in blood, starch solution and thrombus were similar. Under identical conditions, pressures obtained by a catheter in starch solution were significant lower than the pressures measured in blood (P< 0. 05). Under dynamic pressure conditions the reproducibility of pressures obtained with the needle inserted in the human thrombus was very poor. ConclusionA needle pressure measuring device, inserted into media like human fibrin thrombus, does not yield accurate and reproducible results.

40|$|Suspensory {{ligament}} (SL) {{disease is}} a common source of lameness in the horse. Once injury of the proximal SL is suspected, based on the clinical examination and response to analgesia, diagnostic imaging of the region is often performed. The aim was to describe the presence of ultrasonographic artifacts in the palmar metacarpal area after 20 minutes and at 24 hours after infiltration of local anesthetic solution using the lateral approach. In the present study, SL and other proximal palmar metacarpal structures were ultrasonographically evaluated before and after perineural injection of mepivacaine 2 % in eight forelimbs of four horses. The limbs {{were divided into two}} groups: group 1 : <b>needle</b> not <b>filled</b> with anesthetic (right forelimbs); group 2 : <b>needle</b> <b>filled</b> with anesthetic (left forelimbs). The ultrasonographic examination of the palmar metacarpal structures was performed after 20 minutes and at 24 hours after injection to evaluate qualitative postinjection changes and to perform measures. In the present study, {{there were no significant differences}} in the SL and other palmar metacarpal structures between baseline measurement and pattern and postinjection measurements. No changes in echogenicity or fiber pattern of the tendons and ligaments were found. Alterations consistent with gas echoes were detected in one limb in group 1 at 20 minutes after injection, whereas no gas patterns were visualized at 24 hours. Gas or fluid artifacts, due to local anesthetic infiltration, may be present.

40|$|Authors: Leonie Misquitta, Qin Wei and Bruce M. Paterson This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Targeted Disruption of Gene Function in Drosophila by RNA Interference,” Chapter 19, in [*Drosophila Protocols*]([URL] (eds. Sullivan et al.). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2000. Please note that {{this version of the}} protocol is a 2007 revision. ### INTRODUCTION RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method for determining the role of specific genes during *Drosophila* embryogenesis. This protocol describes a technique by which *Drosophila* embryos can be injected with dsRNA in order to disrupt targeted gene function. The approach is straightforward, utilizing improved methods for injecting the dsRNA directly through the chorion of the embryo. This strategy minimizes problems normally associated with desiccation of the dechorionated embryo and facilitates post-injection analysis of gene expression. ### RELATED INFORMATION The double-stranded RNA needed for RNAi is prepared as in [Preparation of Double-Stranded RNA for *Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi). ]([URL] Embryos are collected shortly before injection (typically, 30 - 60 min prior; see Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi)). This injection technique can also be used for generating transgenic *Drosophila* lines, as in [*Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi) Using a Gal- 4 Inducible Transgene Vector]([URL] (Misquitta et al. 2008). These procedures assume that the investigator has access to a working fly facility and is familiar with basic methods for injection of embryos and the analysis of gene expression in Drosophila embryos. If not, details for these procedures can be found elsewhere; see Ashburner (1989 a,b); for microinjection procedures, see Kiehart et al. (2000). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. dsRNA mixed with filtered food dye, from Step 15 of [Preparation of Double-Stranded RNA for *Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] - Embryos arrayed and dried onto glass slides, from [Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] ### Equipment 1.

To pull the glass capillaries into needles: - i. Set heat at 12. 5 - 13. 0 and set the solenoid at 4 on the needle puller. - ii. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for pulling the needles. - iii. Store freshly-pulled needles horizontally, embedded lightly on a flattened narrow strip of modeling clay placed on the bottom of a 150 -mm covered plastic Petri dish. - Use a pipette (e. g., Eppendorf P 10) fitted with a microtip (e. g., Eppendorf Microloader tips) to back-load the injection needles with 0. 5 - 1. 0 μL of dsRNA mixed with filtered food dye. **Calibrating the Transjector** 3. Set the Transjector to automatic injection. 4. Set the injection pressure (Po) to 450. 5. Set the compensation pressure (Pc) to 570. 6. Set the time of injections to 0. 1 sec. - *If using a different model injector, calibrate the injector according to the manufacturer’s instructions*. **Injecting Embryos** *Based on the volume loaded into the needle (0. 5 - 1. 0 μL), each embryo receives up to 100 - 200 pL of dsRNA. A typical loading, if the needle remains unbroken and unblocked, is good for the injection of approximately 1000 embryos or more*. *Inject the embryos in the posterior end, slightly off-center, because the posterior tip of the chorion is very hard and needles often break in this position. Keep the injection room at 18 °C to slow development*. 7. Break the <b>filled</b> <b>needle</b> against the edge of the slide containing the embryos to create a sharp point, as follows: - i. Move the slide slowly toward the needle tip while simultaneously depressing the “clean” button on the Transjector. - ii. The moment that the slide lightly taps the tip and the tip breaks, a small amount of the dye will leak from the needle tip. Release the “clean” button. - *Dye flow should stop when the “clean” button is no longer depressed. The sample is now ready for injection*. - *If the tip is too large after breakage, the needle will continue to drip dye when the “clean” button is not depressed. Such tips will destroy the embryos during injection*. 8. Bring the needle tip and the posterior tip of the embryo into the same focal plane. Make sure that the needle is positioned off-center with respect to the posterior tip of the embryo (see Fig. 1). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Correct injection position for the embryos. (A) Do not inject the embryos directly in the posterior center of the chorion, as the needles often break at this site due to the apparent increased hardness of the chorion. (B) Embryos are injected in the posterior end, slightly off-center, with much less needle breakage or blockage. *For best results, inject the embryos with the needle at an angle slightly greater than 45 ° relative to the embryo surface in the posterior quarter of the embryo*. 9. Insert the needle just far enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. 10. Inject the RNA into the embryo. A small amount of food dye will appear as a small dot in the posterior end of the embryo. It takes ~ 1 - 5 sec to inject each embryo. 11. After all the embryos on a slide have been injected, place the slide in a covered moist chamber at 18 ºC- 22 ºC until embryogenesis is complete (~ 48 h) or until the desired stage of development is reached. **Collecting Injected Embryos for Analysis** 12. Wash the embryos off the slide into a nylon-mesh collection basket. 13. Transfer the embryos to a microcentrifuge tube. 14. Fix the embryos and stain them using standard protocols; see Ashburner (1989 a,b). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The injection needle becomes blocked. **[Step 10]** - **Solution**: To minimize capillary backflow and blockage, do not push the needle too far into the embryo; insert the needle just far enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. If blockage should occur on the Transjector, immerse the needle tip in a drop of coverslip oil and hold down the “clean” button. When the needle clears, the food coloring will be visible in the oil. If blockage persists, change the needles. - **Problem**: Embryos fail to develop normally. **[Step 11]** -** Solution**: Keep the embryos moist after injection. Punctured embryos need a humid environment or they tend to shrink and dry up. Note that excessive moisture (e. g., embryos floating in water) will also kill the embryos. ### DISCUSSION The microinjector we use is the Eppendorf Transjector. Although primarily used for the injection of cultured cells, the Transjector is easily adapted for the injection of *Drosophila* embryos directly through the chorion. Highly reproducible injection conditions can be defined with regard to the volume of material injected, while preventing backflow of material into the needle, which results in needle blockage. This is accomplished by varying the injection pressure, compensation pressure, and the time of injection. The Transjector was a key factor in being able to routinely inject approximately 500 embryos for each analysis. It also has a useful “clean button” that uses a burst of high-pressure air to clean the needle tip in case of blockage. This greatly reduces the number of times needles need to be changed. In our studies, typical efficiencies for generation of the mutant phenotype in the embryo ranged from 72 % to 86 %, but penetration of the *white* mutation to the adult eye was < 3 % (Misquitta and Paterson 1999). RNAi has also been used in dechorionated embryos to demonstrate that both *frizzled* and *frizzled 2 * were in the *wingless* pathway (Kennerdell and Carthew 1998). However, dechorionated embryos have a much lower survival rate and injection artifacts are more pronounced. To rescue injected transgenic lines, apply a small amount of yeast paste to the slide and transfer the embryos from the paste to food vials. Recent experience has shown that using < 1 mg/mL of dsRNA for dsRNAs longer than 1 kb minimizes needle blockage while 1 mg/mL is suitable for dsRNAs shorter than 1 Kb in length. ### REFERENCES 1.
