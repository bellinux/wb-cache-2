25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.|$|E
500|$|This {{production}} {{was based on}} the first four Fits in the first act, with the second act covering material {{from the rest of the}} series. [...] The show also featured a band, who performed the songs Share and Enjoy, the Krikkit song Under the Ink Black Sky, Marvin's song How <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>The</b> Night, and Marvin, which was a minor hit in 1981.|$|E
60|$|In this dismal way was a {{creature}} of feeling and fancy brought up. Every thing genial and amiable in my nature was repressed and nothing brought out but what was unprofitable and ungracious. I was ardent in my temperament; quick, mercurial, impetuous, formed to be {{a creature}} all love and adoration; but a leaden hand was laid on all my finer qualities. I was taught nothing but fear and hatred. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> my uncle, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> monks, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> convent in which I was immured. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> world, and <b>I</b> almost <b>hated</b> myself, for being, as <b>I</b> supposed, so <b>hating</b> and hateful an animal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> {{title of}} the second album, Queen II, it was so unimaginative. Roger Taylor ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The weary will! If {{you knew}} how <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> subject {{you would not}} ask me. But you must not think <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> it because it has given me nothing." ...|$|R
500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad did {{not respond}} well to the episode, observing that [...] "Argus" [...] would go down 30 Rock history as [...] "one of the worst episodes of the series." [...] One of the {{problems}} he had was that the Jack character bonded with the peacock for the entire episode. [...] "As I've said before, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> episodes where Jack {{is out of control}} or acting goofy or involved in some lame pursuit, and this one of the more lame pursuits." ...|$|E
500|$|The Allman Brothers Band have {{generally}} been {{considered one of the}} pioneering bands in Southern rock, although the group distanced themselves from the term. Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification, which he considered unfair: [...] "I think it's limiting. I'd rather just be known as a progressive rock band from the South. I'm damned proud of who I am and where I'm from, but <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> term 'Southern rock.' I think calling us that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that I don’t think are fair." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1894, {{theatrical}} {{manager and}} actor Henry Irving commissioned Burne-Jones to design sets and costumes for the Lyceum Theatre production of King Arthur by J. Comyns Carr, who was Burne-Jones's patron {{and the director}} of the New Gallery as well as a playwright. The play starred Irving as King Arthur and Ellen Terry as Guinevere, and toured America following its London run. Burne-Jones accepted the commission with some enthusiasm, but was disappointed with much of the final result. He wrote confidentially to his friend Helen Mary Gaskell (known as May), [...] "The armour is good—they have taken pains with it ... Perceval looked the one romantic thing in it ... <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> stage, don't tell—but I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was no marriage," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{was very}} foolish {{to have been}} deceived even for a moment. There was no marriage, and <b>I</b> <b>hated,</b> oh, how <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> man." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made her}} a low bow, and {{answered}} coldly, brusquely almost, for <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> very name of Sforza, and every living thing that bore it.|$|R
6000|$|... "A wire was round me {{that white}} {{night on the}} river when she let him take me from her. Then <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> wire. Alas! hear the end.|$|R
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} whale tails {{suffered}} a bit of a backlash. Trinny Woodall, presenter of BBC1's What Not to Wear, described women who wore thongs showing above their trousers as [...] "disgusting". Jessica Kaminsky wrote in <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>the</b> Gym, a lifestyle commentary, [...] "I hate when girls let their 'whale tails' creep out of their pants." [...] In 2007, religious writer Tamie Bixler Lung wrote, [...] "There is something wrong when Christian guys and girls want to run around with their underwear hanging out the top of their pants, or their thong strap sticking out the back of their low-rise jeans." [...] In 2008, model and reality TV star Jodie Marsh said, [...] "Showing your thong is a bit old now." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Willis {{appeared}} in Manhattan {{to talk about}} his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 18, a user on the weblog Metafilter {{posted a}} thread {{entitled}} [...] "Is {{it possible that}} Kaycee did not exist?", which posited, largely {{on the basis of}} Saundra Mitchell's writings, that Kaycee Nicole might have been a hoax. Commenters in the often-heated thread (even the creator of the thread stated that [...] "I mean, I want it NOT to be true. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> thought that a bunch of people are grieving over somebody who did not existi!" [...] ) made a number of observations about the story of Kaycee, among them that no one had ever met Kaycee in person – not even the internet denizens who had been closest to her [...] – and that no obituary was available in a newspaper, anywhere, for a 19-year-old girl named Kaycee Nicole.|$|E
60|$|And so, monsieur, it goes on, day by day, in {{this hotel}} {{that is a}} Zoological Garden. And every day <b>I</b> <b>'ate</b> <b>the</b> animals the more. But {{especially}} Alexander.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you have}} brought me luck," [...] said Dorn, earnestly. [...] "Indeed I guess my luck has turned. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> {{idea of going}} away with that debt unpaid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So have I--for four months. But that didn't console me in <b>the</b> least. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> man. Will {{you stop}} smiling in that inscrutable way {{and tell me}} what you mean?" ...|$|R
500|$|Judas Priest's [...] "Dissident Aggressor" [...] is {{the first}} cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman {{described}} the track as [...] "more just {{like one of those}} odd songs {{that a lot of people}} didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one". Meanwhile, [...] "Cleanse the Soul" [...] has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: [...] "That's one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [...] <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there." [...] The Slayer boxset Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featured, along with four songs of the album, an early version of the title track, recorded at Hanneman's home.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} in this episode were received {{with a bit}} more enthusiasm than the episode itself. Benigno described them as [...] "decent songs", but though Canning wrote that [...] "Candyman" [...] was [...] "fun", {{he also said that}} the [...] "rest of the music" [...] prevented the episode [...] "from being much better". Indeed, [...] "Candyman" [...] was a favorite of many reviewers: The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman called it [...] "bouncy and fun", Futterman praised the [...] "tight harmonies" [...] and the [...] "diva notes from Mercedes and Santana", and Slezak gave the number an [...] "A" [...] and said he loved the Troubletones [...] "absolutely soaring" [...] in their performance. Hankinson, Hyman, and Chaney singled out the production values of the number—Hyman to call them [...] "amazing"; Chaney to note, as she gave the song an [...] "A−", that the costuming cost for the number would have rivaled the $2,004 budget of West Side Story that had Sue so upset; and Hankinson, although he said it would have been his favorite in a [...] "blind test", to call it [...] "a classic example of the kind of inexplicably elaborate performance <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> most on this show".|$|E
500|$|Monteux {{conducted}} the American premieres of [...] Rimsky-Korsakov's The Golden Cockerel, and Henri Rabaud's Mârouf, savetier du Caire. The American premiere of Petrushka, {{in a new}} production by, and starring, Adolph Bolm, was in an unusual opera-ballet double bill with La traviata. Monteux's performances were well received, but, though he later returned to the Met as a guest, opera did not loom large in his career. He said, [...] "I love conducting opera. The only trouble is that <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of the opera house, where only too often music is the least of many considerations, from staging to the temperaments of the principal singers." [...] Nor was he drawn to further engagements as a ballet conductor: [...] "it offers special problems of fitting in with the dances and the dancers, most of whom, I'm sorry to say, seem to have musical appreciation confined to an ability to count beats." [...] Nonetheless he occasionally conducted ballet performances, and even in his concert performances of the ballet scores he had conducted for Diaghilev he said he always had the dancers in his mind's eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{patience}} with me," [...] I implored her. [...] "I... I am not myself to-day." [...] I sighed ponderously, and fell silent as I watched them ride away. Yet <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> them all; {{and most of}} all <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> dainty, perfumed, golden-headed Cardinal-legate.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Thom Yorke of Radiohead named Aphex Twin as {{his biggest}} influence, saying: [...] "He burns a heavy shadow ... Aphex opened up another world that didn't involve my fucking {{electric}} guitar ... <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> all <b>the</b> music that was around Radiohead at the time, {{it was completely}} fucking meaningless. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Britpop thing and {{what was happening in}} America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he's kind of my age too." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nobody {{bought that}} record... I liked making music, but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> {{performing}} part of it. I think there's a reason most animators are hidden behind giant curtains. They're {{not meant for}} the spotlight." ...|$|R
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kills are an Anglo-American indie {{rock band}} formed by American vocalist Alison [...] "VV" [...] Mosshart and British guitarist Jamie [...] "Hotel" [...] Hince.

60|$|I hoped {{from the}} bottom of my heart all would yet be right. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> thought of going to jail, even if only for a few hours. I knew the stain would cling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Clutches!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> {{way we were}} talking. [...] "Thank {{you very}} much. You forget you are {{speaking}} {{of one of my}} friends. Besides, I can take care of myself." [...] He made no answer.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. Oh, well, Harry had his work. I didn't {{think he}} ought to be robbed of his night's rest for a {{worthless}} creature like you, and <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> idea of a paid nurse looking after you.|$|R

2500|$|During a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, a {{creative}} writing student asked Borges what he regarded as [...] "a writer's duty to his time". Borges replied, [...] "I think a writer's {{duty is to}} be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, I think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> Communists, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> Nazis, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don't want to intrude into them, I'm writing fiction, not fables." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{laughed with}} Sally, but I disclaimed any {{knowledge}} of George's accident. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> thought of Wright, let alone anything concerning the fatal certainty {{that sooner or later}} these cousins of his were to suffer through him.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it could}} be London, or even Budmouth, instead of America," [...] she murmured languidly. [...] "Well, I will think. It is too great a {{thing for me to}} decide offhand. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> heath less--or loved you more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{too much}} for her. She would plague herself with these wretched {{household}} accounts! She knew <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> sound of them. I never let her bring them to me; but little did I think that she cried over them alone!' ...|$|R
