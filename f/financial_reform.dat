5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global <b>financial</b> <b>reform.</b> Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E

40|$|How do <b>ﬁnancial</b> <b>reforms</b> {{affect the}} {{allocation}} of production within an economy and its long-run macroeconomic performance? How does the impact of <b>ﬁnancial</b> <b>reforms</b> interact {{with the effects of}} other policy reforms or the inﬂuence of an economy’s structural characteristics? These are the central themes of this thesis. Chapter 2 examines how <b>ﬁnancial</b> and trade <b>reforms</b> interact in determining {{the allocation of}} production within a general equilibrium heterogeneous ﬁrm trade model. While the two reforms have complementary effects on average productivity, the marginal beneﬁts of trade liberalization for wages and household utility are reduced if much reallocative work has been done through a well-functioning <b>ﬁnancial</b> sector. <b>Financial</b> <b>reforms</b> can spill over internationally via trade channels and greater usage of exports as collateral can enhance the beneﬁts of trade reforms. Chapter 3 analyzes how domestic and international <b>ﬁnancial</b> <b>reforms</b> shift production across ﬁrms and sectors. Using a modiﬁed macro credit multiplier model, changes in credit constraints prompt reallocations in production as ﬁrms respond to adjustments in sectoral relative prices and interest rates. <b>Financial</b> <b>reforms</b> generally lead to higher relative investment by more productive ﬁrms and to increased aggregate productivity. Intra-sectoral reallocations smooth out the steady state comparative static effects of <b>ﬁnancial</b> <b>reforms.</b> Structural features of an economy condition the impact of <b>ﬁnancial</b> <b>reforms.</b> Similarly, the impact of capital account liberalization depends upon the state of domestic <b>ﬁnancial</b> <b>reforms.</b> Recent work has highlighted the potential for “threshold” levels of domestic 3 institutional development above which the potential growth beneﬁts of ﬁnancial openness offset the associated risks. Chapter 4 provides a wide-ranging empirical analysis of potential threshold conditions using parametric and semi-parametric methods. It ﬁnds that there are clearly identiﬁable thresholds in variables such as ﬁnancial depth and institutional quality and that the thresholds are lower for foreign direct investment and portfolio equity liabilities compared to those for debt liabilities.

40|$|This study aims to {{show that}} <b>financial</b> <b>reforms</b> in China {{can be viewed as}} an {{endogenous}} adjustment process responding primarily to economic growth and changes in political constraints. The author's argument is thus against the mainstream view in which <b>financial</b> <b>reforms</b> are regarded as primary policy tools for the promotion of economic growth. Three factors are carefully examined for the explanation of the endogenous characteristics of <b>financial</b> <b>reforms.</b> First, this paper takes a close look at endogenous aspects of Chinese financial repression. The endogenous characters of financial repression explain why <b>financial</b> <b>reforms</b> in China follow an endogenous path. Second, recent developments of legal frameworks are found to have been institutional responses to macroeconomic imbalances, financial disorders, and increased demands for property right protection. Finally, this paper shows that the lack of market infrastructure and various political constraints have been major obstacles for China's capital market development. endogenous financial repression, adaptive legal development, fixed costs, development strategy, political constraints,...|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> Sector <b>Reforms</b> in Developing Countries with Special Reference to Egypt Philip Arestis, The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College ABSTRACT <b>Financial</b> <b>reforms,</b> and <b>financial</b> {{liberalization}} in particular, {{have been}} at the root of many recent cases of financial and banking crises. In several countries <b>financial</b> <b>reforms</b> allowed real interest rates to reach levels exceeding 20 percent per annum in some cases; in other cases, banking and financial crises led to currency crises. National governments either abandoned attempts at implementing financial liberalization (some countries even reimposed controls) or were forced to intervene by nationalizing banks and guaranteeing deposits. This paper draws on this experience to show that the main cause of these crises is the application of a theoretical framework that is predicated on a number of assumptions that are problematic and based on weak empirical foundations. Consequently, it should be no surprise that the reforms were often unsuccessful and in many cases led to severe financial crises. We will also argue that the case of Egypt is particularly interesting in this regard, since although <b>financial</b> <b>reforms</b> have been enacted, the experience has been rather different: there has been no accompanying <b>financial</b> crisis. <b>financial</b> <b>reforms,</b> <b>financial</b> crises, developing countries, Egypt...|$|R

In that, the following variables that proxy <b>financial</b> sector <b>reforms</b> namely treasury bill yield, interest rate spread, market capitalization ratio and currency in circulation ratio (which proxy technological modernization of payment systems) all went against a priori expectation. However, <b>financial</b> <b>reforms</b> had one success story in credit/loans advances to private/public sectors (financial deepening) which posted its correct economic sign. In sum, except for the financial deepening variable it can be safely concluded that <b>financial</b> <b>reforms</b> in Nigeria is yet to positively impact savings mobilization.

25|$|In addition, the County of Tyrol and Duchy of Bavaria {{went to war}} in {{the late}} 15th century. Bavaria demanded money from Tyrol that had been loaned on the {{collateral}} of Tyrolean lands. In 1490, the two nations demanded that Maximilian I step in to mediate the dispute. In response, he assumed control of Tyrol and its debt. Because Tyrol had no law code at this time, the nobility freely expropriated money from the populace, which caused the royal palace in Innsbruck to fester with corruption. After taking control, Maximilian instituted immediate <b>financial</b> <b>reform.</b> In order to symbolize his new wealth and power, he built the Golden Roof, a canopy overlooking the town center of Innsbruck, from which to watch the festivities celebrating his assumption of rule over Tyrol. The canopy is made entirely from golden shingles. Gaining theoretical control of Tyrol for the Habsburgs was of strategic importance because it linked the Swiss Confederacy to the Habsburg-controlled Austrian lands, which facilitated some imperial geographic continuity.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, Metternich had advised Francis that {{convening}} the Hungarian Diet would help get approval for <b>financial</b> <b>reform.</b> In fact, the Diet of 1825 to 1827 saw 300 sessions filled with criticism {{of how the}} Empire had eroded the historic rights of the Kingdom of Hungary's nobility. Metternich complained that it [...] "interfered with [...] time, [...] customs and [...] daily life", as {{he was forced to}} travel to Pressburg (modern day Bratislava) to perform ceremonial duties and to observe. He was alarmed by the growth of Hungarian national sentiment and wary of the growing influence of nationalist István Széchenyi, whom he had met twice in 1825. Back in Vienna, in mid-December, he heard of the death of Tsar Alexander with mixed feelings. He had known the Tsar well and was reminded of his own frailty, although the death potentially wiped the soured diplomatic slate clean. Moreover, he could claim credit for foreseeing the Decembrist liberal revolt the new Tsar Nicholas I had to crush. Now 53, Metternich chose to send Archduke Ferdinand to establish first contact with Nicholas. Metternich was also friendly with the British envoy (the Duke of Wellington) and enlisted his help to charm Nicholas. Despite this, the first 18 months of Nicholas' reign did not go well for Metternich: firstly, the British were chosen over the Austrians to oversee Russian-Ottoman talks; and, as a result, Metternich could exercise no influence over the resulting Akkerman Convention. France too began to drift away from Metternich's non-interventionist position. In August 1826 Russian Foreign Minister Nesselrode rejected a proposal by Metternich to convene a congress to discuss the events that eventually led to the outbreak of civil war in Portugal. The Austrian Foreign Minister accepted this with [...] "surprising resilience".|$|E
