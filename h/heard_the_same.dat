25|$|In {{the film}} X-Men, Magneto is a {{powerful}} mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public {{and the subject of}} a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated all together. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does not get in his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.|$|E

2500|$|After calling at Madras on 13 February, she {{departed}} for Suez; her captain, Captain Kirton, had {{been instructed to}} land at Trincomalee with about £5,000 of Government treasure. Mrs. Inglis had kept a diary of the events during the siege of Lucknow to which she added her account of the wreck:We made good progress all that day (Tuesday). It was eight o'clock, a beautiful night, and we were running along at a great pace. Finding it very hot in the saloon after tea, [...] had come on deck, and {{were sitting on the}} bulwarks behind the wheel. Suddenly we were startled by a loud grating sound something like the letting down of an anchor, and just then saw a large rock close to us. I said, 'We must have touched that.' Several men rushed to the wheel, and then again we <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sound, only louder, and a quivering of the whole ship. She then remained stationary, only heaving backwards and forwards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{showed the}} jury the outfit Saldívar had worn during her alleged rape. He claimed {{that someone had}} purposefully torn holes and shredded the shirt with scissors. On October 13, Rosalinda Gonzalez, the assistant manager of the Days Inn, was called to testify. She told the jury that when Selena arrived in the lobby after being shot, she had asked the singer who shot her. Selena cried out [...] "the girl in room 158". Ruben DeLeon, the motel's salesman, said that Selena told him [...] "Yolanda, Yolanda Saldívar shot me. The one in room 158." [...] Receptionist Shawna Vela testified that she had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> statements but added that Selena had screamed: [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again" [...] before collapsing. Vela told the jury that {{there was so much}} blood that she felt nauseous before calling 911. The last person to be called to testify was paramedic Richard Fredrickson who described, in detail, Selena's condition and a mysterious ring she clutched in her hands. The Quintanilla family were seen sobbing as Fredrickson detailed his attempts to save Selena's life, while Saldívar [...] "stared blankly".|$|E
