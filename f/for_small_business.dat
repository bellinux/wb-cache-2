With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine <b>for</b> <b>small</b> <b>business</b> use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, the Macintosh Classic has the original Macintosh startup sound.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Republican spokesmen for big {{business}} in Congress included Speaker of the House Joe Cannon and Senate Republican Leader Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island. Aldrich introduced the Sixteenth Amendment, which allowed the federal government to collect an income tax; he also set in motion the design of the Federal Reserve System, which began in 1913. Pro-business conservatives supported many Progressive Era reforms, especially those opposed to corruption and inefficiency in government, and called for purification of politics. Conservative Senator John Sherman sponsored the nation's basic anti-trust law in 1890, and conservatives generally supported anti-trust in the name of opposing monopoly and opening up opportunities <b>for</b> <b>small</b> <b>business.</b> The Efficiency Movement attracted many Progressive Republicans, such as Nelson W. Aldrich and later President Herbert Hoover; with its pro-business, quasi-engineering approach to solve social and economic problems. The issues of prohibition and woman suffrage split the conservatives.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals SA is a {{sub-division}} of {{the conservative}} National Party of Australia (formerly the Country Party). First contesting the 1965 election, they have only held two seats: Flinders (1973–1993) and Chaffey (1997–2010). Former member Karlene Maywald, representing the Riverland district of Chaffey, accepted a cabinet position in 2004 {{as part of the}} Rann Labor government, as Minister for the River Murray, Minister for Regional Development, Minister <b>for</b> <b>Small</b> <b>Business,</b> and later Minister for Water Security. This informal ALP-NAT coalition (the first since 1935) caused an uproar, with the federal Liberal member for the SA seat of Sturt, Christopher Pyne, calling for Maywald's expulsion from the Nationals, and Patrick Secker calling for a corruption enquiry into the appointment. Neither eventuated. As the Liberal Party in South Australia is descended from a historical merger from an earlier Country Party, the SA Nationals are not as dominant in rural areas as their eastern state counterparts.|$|E
