500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting".

Referee Dan Miragliotta swung Daley around and pinned him against the fence to subdue him. In an interview at the conclusion of the event, UFC president Dana White announced that he was banishing Daley from the UFC for life. White said, [...] "There's no excuse <b>for</b> that. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> are professional athletes. You don't ever hit a guy blatantly after the bell like that, whether you're frustrated or not." [...] He added, [...] "I don't care if he fights in every show all over the world and becomes the best and everybody thinks he's the pound-for-pound best in the world, he will never fight in the UFC ever again."

[...] "It’s really unfortunate. I hate it <b>for</b> <b>these</b> Axalta <b>guys.</b> Everybody at Hendrick Motorsports worked so hard. They brought a great race car here, brand new and destroyed it.

[...] Mears said he [...] "was going into the corner and I saw him come up all of a sudden. I don’t know. It’s too bad he didn’t put us out of our misery there. We were having a rough start of it. We were just kind of hanging on and actually those guys were going by us. They either blew a right-front (tire) or had something come loose or something and came up into us.” Mears went on to finish 40th.
