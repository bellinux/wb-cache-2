60|$|But {{what most}} {{astonished}} me, and seemed most incredible, was the infernal opinion of Jackson, {{that the man}} had been actually dead when brought on board the ship; and that knowingly, and merely {{for the sake of the}} month's advance, paid into his hand upon the strength of the bill he presented, the body-snatching crimp had knowingly shipped a corpse on board of the Highlander, under the pretense of its being a live body in a drunken trance. And I heard Jackson say, that he had known of such things having been done before. But that a really dead body ever burned in that manner, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> even yet <b>believe.</b> But the sailors seemed familiar with such things; or at least with the stories of such things having happened to others.|$|R
60|$|But {{the houses}} need not both {{be of the}} same composition; they may be {{intended}} as a check on one another. One being supposed democratic, the other will naturally be constituted {{with a view to}} its being some restraint upon the democracy. But its efficacy in this respect wholly depends on the social support which it can command outside the House. An assembly which does not rest on the basis of some great power in the country is ineffectual against one which does. An aristocratic House is only powerful in an aristocratic state of society. The House of Lords was once the strongest power in our Constitution, and the Commons only a checking body; but this was when the barons were almost the only power out of doors. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that, in a really democratic state of society, the House of Lords would be of any practical value as a moderator of democracy. When the force on one side is feeble in comparison with that on the other, the way to give it effect is not to draw both out in line, and muster their strength in open field over against one another. Such tactics would insure the utter defeat of the less powerful. It can only act to advantage by not holding itself apart, and compelling every one to declare himself either with or against it, but taking a position among the crowd rather than in opposition to it, and drawing to itself the elements most capable of allying themselves with it on any given point; not appearing at all as an antagonist body, to provoke a general rally against it, but working as one of the elements in a mixed mass, infusing its leaven, and often making what would be the weaker part the stronger, by the addition of its influence. The really moderating power in a democratic constitution must act in and through the democratic House.|$|E
60|$|And now, {{with regard}} to this tedious war, of which {{from day to day}} we are still, in this month of May, 1862, hearing details which teach us to think that it can hardly as yet be near its end. To what may we rationally look as its result? Of one thing I myself feel tolerably certain, that its result will not be nothing, as some among us have seemed to suppose may be probable. I cannot believe that all this energy {{on the part of the}} North will be of no avail, more than I suppose that Southern {{perseverance}} will be of no avail. There are those among us who say that a secession will at last be accomplished; the North should have yielded to the South at once, and that nothing will be gained by their great expenditure of life and treasure. I can by no means bring myself to agree with these. I also look to the establishment of secession. Seeing how essential and thorough are the points of variance between the North and the South, how unlike the one people is to the other, and how necessary it is that their policies should be different; seeing how deep are their antipathies, and how fixed is each side in the belief of its own rectitude and in the belief also of the other's political baseness, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that the really Southern States will ever again be joined in amicable union with those of the North. They, the States of the Gulf, may be utterly subjugated, and the North may hold over them military power. Georgia and her sisters may for awhile belong to the Union, as one conquered country belongs to another. But I do not think that they will ever act with the Union; and, as I imagine, the Union before long will agree to a separation. I do not mean to prophesy that the result will be thus accomplished. It may be that the South will effect their own independence before they lay down their arms. I think, however, that we may look forward to such independence, whether it be achieved in that way, or in this, or in some other.|$|E
60|$|In {{which of}} these two senses does Mr. Spencer employ the term, when he makes it {{a test of the}} truth of a {{proposition}} that its negation is inconceivable? Until Mr. Spencer expressly stated the contrary, I inferred from the course of his argument, that he meant unbelievable. He has, however, in a paper published in the fifth number of the Fortnightly Review, disclaimed this meaning, and declared that by an inconceivable proposition he means, now and always, “one of which the terms can not, by any effort, be brought before consciousness in that relation which the proposition asserts between them—a proposition of which the subject and predicate offer an insurmountable resistance to union in thought.” We now, therefore, know positively that Mr. Spencer always endeavors to use the word inconceivable in this, its proper, sense: but it may yet be questioned whether his endeavor is always successful; whether the other, and popular use of the word, does not sometimes creep in with its associations, and prevent him from maintaining a clear separation between the two. When, for example, he says, that when I feel cold, I can not conceive that I am not feeling cold, this expression can not be translated into “I can not conceive myself not feeling cold,” for it is evident that I can: the word conceive, therefore, is here used to express the recognition of a matter of fact—the perception of truth or falsehood; which I apprehend to be exactly the meaning of an act of belief, as distinguished from simple conception. Again, Mr. Spencer calls the attempt to conceive something which is inconceivable “an abortive effort to cause the non-existence,” not of a conception or mental representation, but of a belief. There is need, therefore, to revise a considerable part of Mr. Spencer’s language, {{if it is to be}} kept always consistent with his definition of inconceivability. But in truth the point is of little importance; since inconceivability, in Mr. Spencer’s theory, is only a test of truth, inasmuch as it is a test of believability. The inconceivableness of a supposition is the extreme case of its unbelievability. This is the very foundation of Mr. Spencer’s doctrine. The invariability of the belief is with him the real guarantee. The attempt to conceive the negative is made in order to test the inevitableness of the belief. It should be called, an attempt to believe the negative. When Mr. Spencer says that while looking at the sun a man can not conceive that he is looking into darkness, he should have said that a man can not believe that he is doing so. For it is surely possible, in broad daylight, to imagine one’s self looking into darkness.(94) As Mr. Spencer himself says, speaking of the belief of our own existence, “That he might not exist, he can conceive well enough; but that he does not exist, he finds it impossible to conceive,” i.e., to believe. So that the statement resolves itself into this: That I exist, and that I have sensations, I believe, because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> otherwise. And in this case every one will admit that the impossibility is real. Any one’s present sensations, or other states of subjective consciousness, that one person inevitably believes. They are facts known per se: it is impossible to ascend beyond them. Their negative is really unbelievable, and therefore there is never any question about believing it. Mr. Spencer’s theory is not needed for these truths.|$|E

6000|$|Now, my Lords, I am {{ordered by}} the Commons no longer to persist in that declaration; and I, who know nothing in this place, and ought to know nothing in this place, but {{obedience}} to the Commons, do mean, when Mr. Hastings makes that objection (if he shall be advised to make it) against the credit of Rajah Nundcomar, not thus to support that credit; and therefore that objection to the credit of the witness must go unrefuted by me. My Lords, I must admit, perhaps against my private judgment, (but that is of no consideration for your Lordships, when opposed to {{the judgment of the}} House of Commons,) or, at least, not contest, that a first minister of state, in a great kingdom, who had the benefit of the administration, and of the entire and absolute command of a revenue of fifteen hundred thousand pounds a year, had been guilty of a paltry forgery in Calcutta; that this man, who had been guilty of this paltry forgery, had waited for his sentence and his punishment, till a body of English judges, armed with an English statute, came to Calcutta; and that this happened at the very happy nick and moment when he was accusing Mr. Hastings of the bribery with which we now {{in the name of the}} Commons charge him; that it was owing to an entirely fortuitous concurrence of circumstances, in which Mr. Hastings had no share, or that it was owing to something beyond this, something that is rather pious than fortuitous, namely, that, as Mr. Hastings tells you himself, [...] "all persuasions of men were impressed with a superstitious belief that a fortunate influence directed all my actions to their destined ends." [...] I, not being at that time infected with the superstition, and considering what I thought Mr. Hastings's guilt to be, and what I must prove it to be as well as <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> did <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Providence did watch over Mr. Hastings, so as in the nick of time, like a god in a machine, to come down to save him in the moment of his imminent peril and distress: I did not think so, but I must not say so.|$|R

40|$|A lot {{of critics}} have had {{negative}} {{things to say}} about Wordsworth’s negatives. ‘Wordsworth carries his delight in negatives to the point of tiresome mannerisms’, John Jones grumbled. 1 Geoffrey Hartman once blamed ‘a negative’ for Wordsworth’s ‘wavering rhythm’; Roger Sharrock thought there were ‘too many’ of them; Kenneth Johnston has spoken of Wordsworth’s ‘bothersome double negatives’; and for Carey McIntosh, more recently, they can ‘seem verbose’. 2 Such complaints are understandable. Negatives (single or double or even triple: ‘Nor <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> but that…’ 3) make a reader’s life that little bit more difficult, and they also can sound, as Orwell knew, gallingly pompous: ‘banal statements are given an appearance of profundity by means of the not un- formation’. 4 A favourite phrase of Wordsworth’s, ‘not seldom’, once you have stopped to think it through, means ‘not not often’, as though ‘often’ alone would not have been suitably cumbersome. 5 ‘’Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind’ (Prelude IV. 192) sounds patently unyouthful. A ‘track … not untrod before’ (III. 121) should hardly be a remarkable track, you would assume, for having been trod before. ‘Not unwelcome’ (VI. 14) is not especially welcoming. Something ‘not unworthy’ (VI. 154) feels less than worthy, if not quite unworthy. A ‘Mansion not unvisited of old’ (VI. 222) plainly is a mansion visited of old. ‘[T]he end | Was not ignoble’ (I. 343 - 4), Wordsworth says after plundering a bird’s nest, and somehow the claim falls short (unhinged by guilt?) of celebrating a noble end. But often critics who speak negatively about Wordsworth’s negatives (and so perform a kind of double negative) end up saying something positive about them too, as though celebration inevitably infiltrates condemnation. Jones is lead to hail ‘the unmathematical nature of language. If two minuses make a plus, it is a special kind of plus: the negative form can be on its own account heart-piercing’ (p. 204). Hartman speaks elsewhere of ‘the special negativity of Wordsworth’s style’. 6 For Johnston, Wordsworth’s negatives ‘are functional, not sloppy craftsmanship’ (p. 19), and Sharrock {{goes so far as to}} say that ‘the roughness of style … is often a merit’. 7 If such remarks amount to a dubious sort of praise (since something is thought good but not exactly not bad), these critics nonetheless find a power in negativity, style in verbosity, eloquence in roughness. To look again at Wordsworth’s negatives is to be reminded of their ungainliness, for sure, but also of the special kinds of pluses and minuses they make. </p...|$|R
