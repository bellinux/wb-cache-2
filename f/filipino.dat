Some soldiers were then assigned to the Alamo Scouts, the 5217th Reconnaissance Battalion, and to the Philippine Regional Section of Allied Intelligence Bureau. One example was Second Lieutenant Rafael Ileto, a future Vice Chief of Staff in the Philippines, who led a team in the Alamo Scouts. Due to the reassignment of these soldiers, both <b>Filipino</b> Infantry Regiments became smaller than authorized. In response, the 2nd <b>Filipino</b> Infantry Regiment was disbanded and used to bring the 1st <b>Filipino</b> Infantry Regiment to 125% of its standard allocated size. The remaining soldiers of the 2nd <b>Filipino</b> Infantry Regiment who did not join the Regiment formed the 2nd <b>Filipino</b> Infantry Battalion (Separate). During its time at Oro Bay the Regiment was reinforced with Filipinos from Hawaii.
