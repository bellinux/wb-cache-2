5000|$|Cryotips {{are made}} of two {{stainless}} steel hypodermic-needle tubes, such as 18 <b>gauge</b> <b>tube</b> surrounding a 24 <b>gauge</b> <b>tube,</b> soldered together. Like the cryoloop, cooled methanol flows through the inner tube to cool the device. If the investigator chooses to insulate the shaft of the tube, a low-resistance heater-wire can be wrapped around the outer tube except for 2 mm at the tip; passing a direct current through the wire keeps the shaft at normal brain temperature. This ensures localized cooling at the tip, which is inserted into the brain to reach deeper structures, without cooling the overlying structures. More than one microthermocouple is required to measure shaft and tip temperatures. [...] Modified versions of this device use smaller gauge tubing (21 and 30 gauge), and additional tubing is attached to form a y-shaped fork with HFC-134a cooling agent flowing through the double tubing while the fork is under vacuum. The vacuum causes the coolant to flow from the inner tubing into the outer tubing (so the coolant is in between {{the inner and outer}} tubes as well as inside the inner tube). Cryotips are usually used to cool deeper structures of the brain that cannot be thermodynamically cooled from the surface. They are not used much in cortical cooling due to the small volumes that are cooled - investigators cooling cortical tissue are usually interested in larger sections than this device can cool. Cryotips cool tissue volumes of 2 mm3 to 5 mm3. Usually the shaft of the device is insulated or even heated for localized cooling, however, some studies have used uninsulated cryotips to cool surface structures in addition to the deeper sections.|$|E

A typical output of CUGS is an ultrasonic image, in which the horizontal and vertical axes represent the axial and angular position of the part, respectively[1]. The system is currently utilized to <b>gauge</b> <b>tubes</b> as long as 7. 5 m (25 feet) resulting in the acquisition of more than 15, 000, 000 data points, which require up to 60 Mbytes of disk memory on a computer. A Wavelet Transform Image decomposition technique was developed for compression and processing of the ultrasonic images, resulting in a great decrease in time and resources needed to perform such operations. Waveletbased image analysis has two distinct characteristics: multiresolution and high spatial localization[2]. Multiresolution refers to the possibility of obtaining representations of the same image with different resolutions. The high spatial localization properties of the filters used for the wavelet decomposition can also be utilized for the enhancement of features such as erosion pattern without the loss of localization, a problem commonly encountered in Fourier analysis. In the application here discussed, CUGS is utilized to map the wear of the internal surface of steel tubes, before and after exposure to extreme environments involving temperature, pressure, corrosive gases and mechanical forces...|$|R

50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The <b>gauge's</b> Bourdon <b>tube</b> senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|R

50|$|The Bourdon {{pressure}} gauge uses {{the principle that}} a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. Although this change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, and thus involving moderate stresses within the elastic range of easily workable materials, the strain of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil, elastically, as it is pressurized. Eugene Bourdon patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges. Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) {{pressure gauge}}, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry. But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company Schaeffer and Budenberg also manufactured Bourdon <b>tube</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the liquid}} is {{hazardous}} or under pressure, more sophisticated arrangements must be made.

This usually has a patterned backplate to make the magnifying effect of the water in the tube more obvious and so allow for easier reading. In some locomotives where the boiler is operated at very high pressures, the tube itself would be made of metal-reinforced toughened glass. It is important to keep the water at the specified level, otherwise the top of the firebox will be exposed, creating an overheat hazard and causing damage and possibly catastrophic failure.|$|R

50|$|Bourdon <b>tubes</b> measure <b>gauge</b> pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the <b>gauge.</b> The Bourdon <b>tube</b> is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure.

The reason did not lie solely in the much improved Q factor of the unloaded coils. Despite a more than twofold increase in the unloaded Q factor, the loaded coil Q values only increased by 8 %. It would appear, however, that the resistive, dielectric and inductive noise components are all reduced, and hence contribute to the observed improved S/N. The reduction in pure ohmic losses accounts for a quarter of the improved S/N, while the reduced inductive and dielectric losses provide the remaining three quarters. No independent quantification of the two latter noise sources was attempted, although a reduced dielectric contribution is confirmed qualitatively by a reduction in the negative frequency shift of the resonance frequency as a function of increasing coil gauge when the coil is loaded...|$|R

The tests compared the pull-out performance of offset-head roof bolts with that of standard 5 / 8 -inch bolts; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 A second series of 24 tests that compared the pull-out loads obtained by bolts installed with 1 ft of resin (a Short Encapsulation Pull Test or SEPT) to that of fully grouted bolts overcored to leave only 12 inches of grouted bolt, and; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 An investigation into the pressures generated during the installation of fully grouted resin bolts. All of the bolts installed and pulled were overcored and removed from the roof after the pull tests to allow inspection of the resin. The first study {{found that there was}} no significant difference in pullout load between the offset-head bolts and the standard bolts. The second study, comparing the SEPT bolts and the partially-overcored fully grouted bolts, indicated that SEPT can significantly underestimate bolt anchorage grip factor, suggesting that the SEPT is a conservative measure of actual bolt performance. Significant loss of resin to cracks in the roof was observed in the bolts overcored in the SRCM. The third study explored one possible explanation for the resin loss, high pressures generated during bolt installation. These tests employed bolts installed in strain <b>gauged</b> steel <b>tubes.</b> The results confirmed that significant pressures (greater than 4, 000 psi) can be generated during bolt installation. The results of the pressure tests, combined with the observations of resin loss in bolts installed in the SRCM, suggest that under some circumstances resin loss and under-encapsulation could take place and lead to degraded bolt performance. Glove fingering was observed in all recovered bolts to various degrees. The limited comparative data suggested that the effect of glove fingering ranged from slight to moderate. Complete mixing of the resin was observed on all of the 40 bolts recovered (28 fully grouted and 12 SEPT). Australian and U.

These differences are suggested as potential explanations for occasional resin mixing problems noted in Australian resin bolt installations...|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of gun employed, tournament skeet {{shooters}} have a problem. American skeet tournaments consist of at least four events: the 12 ga., the 20 ga., the 28 ga. and the [...]410 bore. These are four different sized shotgun shells (diminishing in size, in the order listed), requiring four different sets of chambers. Historically, that required four different guns, each weighing, balancing and presenting, differently, undermining a shooter's consistency. There is relatively little manufacturer interest in a cure for the problem with pumps and automatics. However, double guns present opportunities. One solution is to build four matched weight sets of barrels to fit one action (a [...] "four barrel set"). This is expensive, but in the 1970s to early 1990s, four barrel sets reigned supreme in American skeet, and they remain thoroughly competitive. Beyond the expense, the principal criticism is that the four barrel set can still present a different sight picture for each gauge, because each barrel set, in diminishing gauge, is narrower than the prior set. [...] The answer was to build barrel inserts for 12 ga. two barrel guns: these allow the shooter to switch out matching sets of full length light weight aluminum tubes (10-12 oz. per set) chambered for 20, 28 and [...]410, in almost any 12 ga. double gun. One could then use one gun to shoot the 20, 28 and [...]410 events with the same weight, balance and sight picture for each of these <b>gauges.</b> However, with <b>tubes</b> removed to shoot 12 ga. rounds, the gun will be 10-12 oz. lighter, and thus will swing faster and kick harder, undermining some of the consistency intrinsic to the concept. The solutions are: to stop shooting 12 ga. rounds at all in tournaments, thus always shooting through the inserts; buying a second, pre-weighted 12 ga. barrel (the latter makes the combination a [...] "two barrel tube set"); or, three, adding removable weights to the 12 ga. barrels when shooting without the sub-gauge tubes, to try to match the weight and balance of the gun when tubed. All three solutions are employed, depending upon shooter preferences and/or resources, and tubed over and under shoguns now dominate American skeet tournaments.|$|R
