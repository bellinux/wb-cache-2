40|$|We find an {{empirical}} regularity that stronger creditor protection reduces {{the volatility of}} stock market prices. We analyze two distinct mechanisms that characterize equity price volatility: <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> and creditor protection. Using a Tobin q model, we demonstrate that weak creditor protection that gives rise to <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> and tightens credit constraints, increases stock price volatility. Empirically, accounting for the probability of financial crises, we find that <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> and weak institutions that tighten credit constraints increase aggregated stock price volatility. ...|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} online: 3 February 2015 The massive use {{of public}} funds in the financial sector and the large costs for taxpayers are often used to justify the idea that public intervention should be limited. This conclusion {{is based on the}} idea that <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> always induce financial institutions to take excessive risk. In this article, we challenge this conventional view and argue that it relies on some specific assumptions made in the existing literature on <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> and on a number of modelling choices. We review the theory of <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> by highlighting and discussing the role that these underlying assumptions play in the assessment of the desirability and effectiveness of <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> and propose a new framework for thinking about them...|$|R

25|$|The Commonwealth Bank Act 1911, {{introduced}} by the Andrew Fisher Labor Government which favoured bank nationalisation, established the Commonwealth Bank of Australia with effect on 22 December 1911.

Fannie Mae and smaller Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump.

25|$|Luna Park reopened in January 1995. In {{the months}} that followed, the park was {{affected}} by poor weather conditions, causing lower than predicted attendance. Legal claims against {{the operation of the}} park and roller coaster were filed by some local residents, and supported by business figures whose tenders for the redevelopment had not been accepted. The newly elected Carr State Government put the park's long-term viability in doubt; first removing the <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> of a $14million loan to the Trust, then dissolving the Trust's board of directors and appointing an administrator. The park was forced to close again on 14 February 1996.|$|E
25|$|For {{repayment}} of the Government loans, {{there was}} a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders {{to have to find}} their own investors to cover the first £15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper studies general-equilibrium e ects of <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> on {{assets in}} a {{stochastic}} growth model. It is shown {{that there is}} an inverted-U relationship between the guaranteed rate of return and price volatility. On the one hand, the initial e ect is that the capitalized value of <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> is larger in states with high prices that are likely to trigger bailouts, which tends to increase price uctuations. On the other hand, a high enough guaranteed rate of return reduces the overall uncertainty associated with assets, which will eventually dampen price movements. It is argued that the volatility-increasing range is the economically most plausible one, so the analysis lends support to the view that explicit or implicit <b>government</b> <b>guarantees</b> can be destabilizing...|$|R
25|$|Ramos {{personally}} {{pushed for}} the speedy approval {{of some of the}} most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent power producers (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to the former president. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were insurance contracts in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government would pay for the loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the power crisis had been considered solved by the end of 1993. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates may rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts that would mean excess power. The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities' IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors create considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions, would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public. It was said that, presidents since Corazon Aquino catered mostly to the needs of big business for power and allowed the private sector to profit from this lucrative industry rather than craft an energy plan that would meet the needs of the Filipinos.|$|E
500|$|In April 1990 Mobutu {{announced}} he would accommodate multi-party politics. Lihau, {{who was at the}} time presiding over a meeting of exiled politicians in Brussels, demanded that before opposition elements return to the country Mobutu's <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> the tolerance of a genuine multi-party system, agree to organise a round table conference for political reconciliation, and begin disbanding state security forces. Lihau did eventually return to the Congo. Once there, he joined the UDPS in endorsing the formation of a [...] "Conference Nationale Souveraine" [...] to discuss political reform in the country. One soon convened, but Lihau protested the large number of delegates summoned by Mobotu to participate, accusing him of trying to stack the representation in his own favor. Throughout the conference's existence Lihau chaired its constitutional commission. At one point during the conference, Lihau denounced the perceived Baluba dominance of the UDPS and joined the Alliance des Bangala, a party with financial support from Mobutu that promoted politicians from Équateur. Eventually the constitutional commission produced a draft recommendation of a federal system that was intended to maintain the national integrity of the Congo while respecting its diversity. The conference disbanded in December 1992 having greatly reinvigorated democratic thought in the country but ultimately failing to enact significant institutional change. Lihau went back to the United States to receive medical treatment.|$|E
500|$|After the 1997 provincial election, Klein {{appointed}} Stelmach Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural development. While he {{held this}} office, his department encouraged {{the establishment of}} feedlots. The opposition parties charged {{that the government was}} not regulating these sufficiently, but Stelmach responded that municipalities had the authority necessary to effectively regulate them. On the Canadian Wheat Board controversy, Stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to the federal body's monopoly on grain sales in the western provinces. Legislatively, Stelmach sponsored five bills while in the Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development portfolio, all of which passed through the legislature. [...] 1997's Meat Inspection Amendment Act required meat inspectors to acquire a search warrant before entering a private dwelling, but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case. It was called by Liberal agriculture critic Ken Nicol [...] "a really good bill". The Livestock and Livestock Products Amendment Act of the same year eliminated <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> of the Livestock Patrons' Assurance Fund, designed to protect cattle producers from payment defaults by livestock dealers, in favour of leaving the Fund entirely {{in the hands of the}} industry. It too was supported by the Liberals, with Nicol calling it [...] "very easy for us to accept". [...] In 1998, Stelmach sponsored the Agriculture Statutes (Penalties) Amendment Act, which overhauled the penalty system for violation of various agricultural statutes, setting maximum fines and leaving the precise amount up to judges on a case by case basis. It also passed with Liberal support, as MLA Ed Gibbons said that it [...] "really makes a lot of sense". Another 1998 bill was the Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Act, which allowed provincial agricultural marketing boards to revise their marketing plans, and was supported by the opposition. [...] Finally, Stelmach initiated the Agriculture Statutes (Livestock Identification) Amendment Act, which allowed the government to delegate the inspection of branding to the cattle industry. The bill was the subject of considerable debate on second reading, but was ultimately supported by the Liberals on the third and final reading.|$|E

2500|$|As Lockheed {{was itself}} in a {{vulnerable}} position, the British government required that the US <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> the bank loans that Lockheed needed to complete the L-1011 project. If Lockheed (which was itself weakened by the difficulties) had failed, the market for the RB211 would have evaporated. Despite some opposition, the US government provided these guarantees. In May 1971, a new company called [...] "Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd." [...] acquired the assets of Rolls-Royce from the Receiver, and shortly afterwards signed a new contract with Lockheed. This revised agreement cancelled penalties for late delivery, and increased the price of each engine by £110,000.|$|E
2500|$|Most coins {{presently}} {{are made}} of a base metal, and their value comes from their status as fiat money. This means {{that the value of}} the coin is decreed by government fiat (law), and thus is determined by the free market only in as much as national currencies are used in domestic trade and also traded internationally on foreign exchange markets. Thus, these coins are monetary tokens, just as paper currency is: they are usually not backed by metal, but rather by some form of <b>government</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Some have suggested that such coins not be considered to be [...] "true coins" [...] (see below). Thus, there is very little economic difference between notes and coins of equivalent face value.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, all the {{refugees}} in Ban Vinai were granted temporary asylum in Thailand {{with the expectation}} that they would either soon return to Laos or be resettled in a third country. [...] Thailand refused to grant Hmong the right to remain in Thailand permanently. However, in the 1980s, many refugees refused to return to Laos and did not seek resettlement to the United States or other countries. [...] They demanded instead that the Lao <b>government</b> <b>guarantee</b> their safe return to Laos and autonomy. Some of the reluctance of the Hmong to resettle was fear of the challenges of moving to an industrial society. In Ban Vinai, the Hmong were able to maintain a semblance of their traditional culture and society. Reluctance was also based on the reported influence of Vang Pao and other leaders urging them to remain in Thailand as a prelude for a return to Laos and the overthrow of the communist government. Some of the Hmong used Ban Vinai as a base for resistance to the government of Laos. The reluctance to resettle began to change in 1985. [...] A younger generation of Hmong was willing to adopt new customs and lifestyles and the Thai government was pressuring refugees to accept resettlement or to be forcibly repatriated to Laos. By 1986, the average length of time residents had lived in the camp was nearly seven years.|$|E
