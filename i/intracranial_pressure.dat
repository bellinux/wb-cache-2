However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{of brain}} ischemia: The {{prevention}} of brain ischemia {{is made by}} decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the skull. This decreases total <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> and facilitates blood perfusion.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by increased <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} {{relation between}} the intraocular and <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures</b> is presented by employing the least square method to fit the existing experiments. Relative analysis here indicates that this modified relation not only {{is better than the}} previous relation by comparing with the existing experimental data but also overcomes the induced singularity in applying the existing mechanical models to compute the mechanical properties of the lamina cribrosa. The present study will be a beneficial help to understanding the relationship between the intraocular and <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures</b> and even glaucomatous developing...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{conduction}} (BC) stimulation can {{be applied}} by vibration to the bony or skin covered skull (osseous BC), or on soft tissue such as the neck (non-osseous BC). The interaction between osseous and non-osseous bone conduction pathways is assessed in this study. The relation between bone vibrations measured at the cochlear promontory and the <b>intracranial</b> sound <b>pressure</b> for stimulation directly on the dura and for stimulation at the mastoid between 0. 2 and 10 kHz was compared. First, for stimulation on the dura, varying the static coupling force of the BC transducer on the dura had only a small effect on promontory vibration. Second, {{the presence or absence}} of intracranial fluid did not affect promontory vibration for stimulation on the dura. Third, stimulation on the mastoid elicited both promontory vibration and <b>intracranial</b> sound <b>pressure.</b> Stimulation on the dura caused <b>intracranial</b> sound <b>pressure</b> to a similar extent above 0. 5 kHz compared to stimulation on the mastoid, while promontory vibration was less by 20 - 40 dB. From these findings, we conclude that <b>intracranial</b> sound <b>pressure</b> (non-osseous BC) only marginally affects bone vibrations measured on the promontory (osseous BC), whereas skull vibrations affect <b>intracranial</b> sound <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{can be both}} {{congenital}} {{or develop}} over time with the thinning of the otic capsule by the persistent pulsations of the <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures</b> against {{the bones of the}} skull. Finally, disease conditions—for example cholesteatoma—can result in a labyrinthine fistula. Traumatic events, with excessive pressure changes to the inner ear such as in scuba diving, head trauma, or an extremely loud noise can lead to rupture and leakage.|$|R
5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and hydration. Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that increases <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{suggested}} in the 18th century that <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> rather than skull damage {{was the cause of}} pathology after TBI. This hypothesis was confirmed around the end of the 19thcentury, and opening the skull to relieve pressure was then proposed as a treatment.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors include}} being {{overweight}} or a recent increase in weight. Tetracycline may also trigger the condition. The diagnosis {{is based on}} symptoms and a high <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> founding during a lumbar puncture with no specific cause found on a brain scan.|$|E
50|$|Invasive {{vascular}} pressure monitors are {{pressure monitoring}} systems designed to acquire pressure information for display and processing. There {{are a variety}} of invasive vascular pressure monitors for trauma, critical care, and operating room applications. These include single pressure, dual pressure, and multi-parameter (i.e. pressure / temperature). The monitors can be used for measurement and follow-up of arterial, central venous, pulmonary arterial, left atrial, right atrial, femoral arterial, umbilical venous, umbilical arterial, and <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures.</b>|$|R
30|$|Cerebral microcirculation after severe {{head injury}} is {{consistently}} reduced from baseline, at the ipsilateral and contralateral {{site of the}} contusion. When normovolemic anemia is superimposed, cerebral microcirculation reaches its nadir with an increase response after autologous transfusion amongst subjects with normal ICP, unlike for subjects with high <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures.</b> The reduction in cerebral microcirculation {{is associated with the}} severe APP staining and the presence of axonal retraction balls, the DAI histological hallmark. Cerebral oxymetry showed a statistically significant increase from ischemic to above-normal values after autologous transfusion.|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the symptoms, for example the combination of headache, signs of raised <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> and focal neurological abnormalities, or when alternative causes of headache and neurological abnormalities, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage, have been excluded.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} {{around the}} brain may rise, causing papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) {{which may be}} experienced as visual obscurations. In severely raised <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> the level of consciousness is decreased, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate falls and the patient assumes an abnormal posture.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
40|$|Blast-induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) {{has emerged as a}} 2 ̆ 2 signature injury 2 ̆ 2 in combat casualty care. Present combat helmets are designed primarily to protect against ballistic and blunt impacts, but the current issue with helmets is protection from primary blast effects. In order to delineate wave interaction and propagation with the combat helmet and human head, a detailed finite element (FE) model of Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) was developed and validated. A series of finite element analyses was undertaken to evaluate blast wave attenuating capability of the ACH by comparing the head/brain responses against blast loadings between the validated FE human head models with and without helmet. The integrated FE helmet/head model was subjected to blast insults at various overpressures (0. 27 - 0. 66 MPa) according to Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s lung iso damage threshold curves. Effectiveness of the helmet with respect to various head orientations was also investigated. The resulting biomechanical responses of the brain to blast threats were compared for the human head with and without the helmet. For all Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s cases, the peak <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures</b> sustained by the head without helmet ranged from 0. 68 - 1. 8 MPa in the coup cortical region. ACH was found to mitigate <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures</b> in the head by 10 - 35...|$|R
5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures.</b> Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|R

5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> as well as {{indicate}} diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges. Although noted by Hippocrates, {{it was only in}} the eighteenth century that Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W.

5|$|The {{cause of}} IIH is not known. The Monro-Kellie rule {{states that the}} <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{determined}} by the amount of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood inside the bony cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the veins that drain blood from the brain.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prognosis of children and adults in whom decompressive craniectomy (DC) was used as a rescue treatment to lower refractory high <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures</b> if maximal conservative therapies failed. Data of DC patients were retrospectively reviewed. Three-month and 1 -year outcomes were evaluated (modified Rankin Score). Twenty-one patients were studied, 8 children and 13 adults. Eleven suffered from traumatic brain swelling, in 10 the primary pathological condition was intracranial hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation bleeding or subarachnoid hemorrhage. All 13 survivors (62 %) had a favorable outcome after 1 year (mRS</= 3), 8 (38 %) lacked any disabilities at all.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ergotamine}} and dihydroergotamine on the cerebral circulation was {{studied in the}} dog, anaesthetized with chloralose, by recording the <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>pressure</b> and the venous outflow from the superior cerebral vein. Under optimal experimental conditions, ergotamine (5 to 10 μg. /kg.) and dihydroergotamine (100 μg. /kg.) gave a marked and long-lasting cerebral vasoconstriction accompanied by a slight hypertension. The cerebral vasoconstriction provoked by ergotamine may be very small and was sometimes absent when the cerebral blood-flow was low. This vasoconstrictor effect is more pronounced the higher the initial <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>pressure</b> and hence the cerebral blood-flow. After the induction of a cerebral vasodilatation by 48 / 80 or strychnine, the vasoconstrictor action of ergotamine was more pronounced. The effect was not observed when CO 2 was employed to modify the <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>pressure.</b> Simultaneous registration of the cerebral, nasal cavity, and kidney vascular responses demonstrated the relative specificity of the action of ergotamine on the cerebral vessels. The small doses of ergotamine used may weaken or abolish the vasoconstrictor action of adrenaline on cerebral vessels. The modification of {{the responses of the}} cerebral circulation which such factors as anaesthesia, respiratory acidosis, and operative trauma can produce have been confirmed and emphasized. The results support the view that the vasoconstrictor action of ergotamine on the cerebral vessels might account for the therapeutic value of this drug in migraine...|$|R
5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation {{as a result of}} rising <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E
40|$|A 50 -year-old {{athletic}} man {{presented with}} two weeks ofdebilitating “sinus ” headache, continuous left nostril drainage, persistent cough, with {{no history of}} head trauma. His nasal discharge was unilateral, worse with coughing or leaning forward (Fig. 1), with one clear drop every 2 – 3 seconds. Analysis demonstrated beta- 2 transferrin, a transferrin iso-form found almost exclusively in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain MRI showed no cribriform or ethmoid sinus fractures. Endoscopy revealed a small bony defect in his left nasal cribriform plate (Fig. 2), with active CSF drainage, causing his rhinorrhea.

5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|Raised <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> if severe or {{threatening}} vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (the pressure within the skull). <b>Intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} findings {{provide evidence for}} Alzheimer's disease-related changes in brain diseases, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus and traumatic brain injury, and in glaucoma {{at the level of}} the retinal ganglion cells. This is a group of diseases that affect central nervous system tissue and are characterized by elevation of <b>intracranial</b> or intraocular <b>pressure</b> and/or local shear stress and strain. This strengthens the possibility that Alzheimer-type changes in these diseases may result at least in part from exposure of central nervous system tissue to elevated mechanical load. As activities or diseases with significant Valsalva effort can generate increased <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures,</b> we hypothesize that individuals who frequently perform strong Valsalva maneuvers (e. g., long hours of repetitive heavy lifting, sequences of blows during the playing of a wind instrument, forceful and repetitive cough, bearing-down efforts during parturition) may be more susceptible to developing Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we discuss three hypotheses about the mechanisms by which extensive use of the Valsalva maneuver might contribute to the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: via mechanical stress-induced events in the hippocampus and/or via changes in the secretory process of the choroid plexus and/or via hemodynamic changes in cerebral blood flow. If confirmed, this hypothesis could have implications in clinical practice...|$|R
