25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote <b>flocculation</b> of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and <b>flocculation</b> is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. <b>Flocculation</b> is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases <b>flocculation.</b> It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} <b>flocculation</b> and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E
25|$|Waters {{exiting the}} <b>flocculation</b> basin may enter the {{sedimentation}} basin, also called a clarifier or settling basin. It {{is a large}} tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the <b>flocculation</b> basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.|$|E
25|$|Coagulation/filtration (also {{known as}} <b>flocculation)</b> removes arsenic by coprecipitation and {{adsorption}} using iron coagulants. Coagulation/filtration using alum is already {{used by some}} utilities to remove suspended solids and may be adjusted to remove arsenic.|$|E
25|$|Alum is used {{to clarify}} water by {{neutralizing}} the electrical double layer surrounding very fine suspended particles, allowing them to flocculate (stick together). After <b>flocculation,</b> the particles will {{be large enough to}} settle and can be removed.|$|E
25|$|In the {{processing}} of fine ceramics, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled <b>flocculation</b> of powders due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to microstructural heterogeneities.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium sulfate is {{referred}} to as papermaker's alum. Although reference to this compound as alum is quite common in industrial communication, it is not regarded as technically correct. Its properties are quite {{different from those of the}} set of alums described above. Most industrial <b>flocculation</b> done with alum is actually aluminium sulfate.|$|E
25|$|Most solids can {{be removed}} using simple {{sedimentation}} techniques with the solids recovered as slurry or sludge. Very fine solids and solids with densities close to the density of water pose special problems. In such case filtration or ultrafiltration may be required. Although, <b>flocculation</b> may be used, using alum salts or the addition of polyelectrolytes.|$|E
25|$|Under certain {{chemical}} conditions (typically in acid-catalyzed sols), the interparticle {{forces have}} sufficient strength to cause considerable aggregation and/or <b>flocculation</b> {{prior to their}} growth. The formation of a more open continuous network of low density polymers exhibits certain advantages with regard to physical properties {{in the formation of}} high performance glass and glass/ceramic components in 2 and 3 dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{winemaking}} {{technique of}} flotation {{was adapted from}} the froth flotation process used in the mining industry for ore refining. In this process, small bubbles of air (or compressed nitrogen) are injected {{into the bottom of}} a tank. As the bubbles rise through the must, grape solids, including phenolic compounds prone to oxidation and browning, will tend to cling to the bubbles, creating a froth that can be removed from the wine. This must be done prior to fermentation, since yeast will inhibit the <b>flocculation</b> involved.|$|E
25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte <b>flocculation</b> is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E
25|$|Multiple light {{scattering}} coupled with vertical scanning {{is the most}} widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilisation phenomena. It works on concentrated dispersions without dilution. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the particles / droplets. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (e.g.Creaming and Sedimentation) and global changes in size (e.g. <b>flocculation,</b> coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E
25|$|Water {{purification}} is {{the process}} of removing undesirable chemicals, biological contaminants, suspended solids and gases from water. The goal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose. Most water is disinfected for human consumption (drinking water), but water purification may also be designed for a variety of other purposes, including fulfilling the requirements of medical, pharmacological, chemical and industrial applications. The methods used include physical processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and distillation; biological processes such as slow sand filters or biologically active carbon; chemical processes such as <b>flocculation</b> and chlorination and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|The Tibitoc water {{production}} plant, {{located in}} the suburbs of Bogota, supplies almost 30% of Bogota's residents. To ensure continuous water supply, a rehabilitation project of the water plant and water mains was carried out. This is a 20-year project that began in 1998. An investment of US$22 million over three years was made by Veolia Water Solutions & Technologies to rehabilitate the entire water treatment process including physical pretreatment, coagulation, <b>flocculation,</b> sand filtration, neutralization and disinfection. Additionally, there was an investment of US$35 million to rehabilitate the Tibitoc water production plant water main lines. Other improvements were made to operating guidelines and the monitoring of the facility.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its early}} days, Sellafield has {{discharged}} low-level radioactive waste into the sea, using a <b>flocculation</b> process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents produced a metal hydroxide flocculant precipitate following {{the addition of}} ammonium hydroxide. The suspension was then transferred to settling tanks where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or supernate, would be discharged to the Irish Sea. In 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) was opened. In EARP {{the effectiveness of the}} process is enhanced by the addition of reagents to remove the remaining soluble radioactive species. EARP was enhanced in 2004 to further reduce the quantities of technetium-99 released to the environment.|$|E
500|$|Two unique {{strains of}} yeast were {{traditionally}} used; one highly flocculent strain that was {{responsible for most of}} the fermentation in the first few days, and the other, a powdery and less flocculant strain, that was slower and finished off the beer in the fermentation vats and in the bottles. [...] Until the end of the 19th century, the breweries that produced Grodziskie used a single strain of yeast that was characterized by low attenuation and early <b>flocculation.</b> [...] However, that strain was lost in the early 20th century. [...] After World War II, yeast was imported from the Groterjan Brewery in Berlin. That [...] yeast was not well suited for producing Grodziskie and was frequently contaminated with spoilage organisms including Lactobacillus. [...] In the 1960s, the state-owned brewery was able to isolate and maintain suitable {{strains of yeast}} that produced the desired characteristics, but only the highly-flocculant strain has been preserved to this day. [...] Without access to the actual yeast used historically, most modern recreations of Grodziskie typically use ale yeasts that do not contribute a significant amount of yeast character to the beer.|$|E
2500|$|In the literature, {{there is}} much debate and {{confusion}} over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculation—where does coagulation end and <b>flocculation</b> begin? [...] In water purification plants, there is usually a high energy, rapid mix unit process (detention time in seconds) where the coagulant chemicals are added followed by <b>flocculation</b> basins (detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes) where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc. [...] In fact, coagulation and <b>flocculation</b> processes are ongoing once the metal salt coagulants are added.|$|E

2500|$|... "Chitosan", a {{commercial}} flocculant, {{more commonly used}} for water purification, is far more expensive. The powdered shells of crustaceans are processed to acquire chitin, a polysaccharide found in the shells, from which chitosan is derived via de-acetylation. Water that is more brackish, or saline requires larger amounts of flocculant. <b>Flocculation</b> is often too expensive for large operations.|$|E
2500|$|When {{particles}} to {{be removed}} do not settle out of solution easily, dissolved air flotation (DAF) is often used. [...] After coagulation and <b>flocculation</b> processes, water flows to DAF tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc. [...] The floating floc blanket {{is removed from the}} surface and clarified water is withdrawn {{from the bottom of the}} DAF tank.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{treatment}} plants that take raw water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs for public drinking water production use conventional filtration technologies. This involves {{a series of}} processes, including coagulation, <b>flocculation,</b> sedimentation, and filtration. Direct filtration, which is typically used to treat water with low particulate levels, includes coagulation and filtration, but not sedimentation. Other common filtration processes, including slow sand filters, [...] diatomaceous earth filters and membranes will remove 99% of Cryptosporidium. Membranes and bag and cartridge filters remove Cryptosporidium [...] product-specifically.|$|E
2500|$|Moringa seed cake, {{obtained}} as {{a byproduct}} of pressing seeds to obtain oil, is used to filter water using <b>flocculation</b> to produce potable water for animal or human consumption. Moringa seeds contain dimeric cationic proteins which absorb and neutralize colloidal charges in turbid water, causing the colloidal particles to clump together, making the suspended particles easier to remove as sludge by either settling or filtration. [...] Moringa seed cake removes most impurities from water. This use {{is of particular interest}} for being nontoxic and sustainable compared to other materials in moringa-growing regions where drinking water is affected by pollutants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{addition}} of inorganic coagulants such as aluminum sulfate (or alum) or iron (III) salts such as iron(III) chloride cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on {{and among the}} particles. [...] Within seconds, negative charges on the particles are neutralized by inorganic coagulants. [...] Also within seconds, metal hydroxide precipitates of the iron and aluminium ions begin to form. [...] These precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as Brownian motion and through induced mixing which is {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>flocculation.</b> [...] The term most often used for the amorphous metal hydroxides is [...] "floc." [...] Large, amorphous aluminum and iron (III) hydroxides adsorb and enmesh particles in suspension and facilitate the removal of particles by subsequent processes of sedimentation and filtration.|$|E
2500|$|Polyelectrolytes {{have many}} applications, mostly related to modifying flow and {{stability}} properties of aqueous solutions and gels. For instance, {{they can be}} used to destabilize a colloidal suspension and to initiate <b>flocculation</b> (precipitation). They {{can also be used to}} impart a surface charge to neutral particles, enabling them to be dispersed in aqueous solution. They are thus often used as thickeners, emulsifiers, conditioners, clarifying agents, and even drag reducers. They are used in water treatment and for oil recovery. Many soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics incorporate polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, they are added to many foods and to concrete mixtures (superplasticizer). Some of the polyelectrolytes that appear on food labels are pectin, carrageenan, alginates, and carboxymethyl cellulose. All but the last [...] are of natural origin. Finally, they are used in a variety of materials, including cement.|$|E
2500|$|Inoculated (or pure cultured) yeasts are {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that have been}} {{identified}} and plated from wineries across the world (including notable producers from well-known wine regions such as Bordeaux, Burgundy, Napa Valley and the Barossa Valley). These strains are tested in laboratories to determine a strain's vigor, sulfur dioxide and alcohol tolerance, production levels of acetic acid and sulfur compounds, ability to re-ferment (positive for sparkling wine but a negative attribute for sweet late-harvest wines), development of surface film on the wine (positive for some Sherry styles but a negative attribute for many other wines), enhancement of a wine's color or certain varietal characteristics by enzymes in the yeast cells and other metabolic products produced by the yeast, foaming and <b>flocculation</b> tendencies, yeasticidal properties (a trait known as [...] "Killer yeast") and tolerance for nutritional deficiencies in a must {{that may lead to}} a stuck fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|Pure {{water has}} a pH close to 7 (neither {{alkaline}} nor acidic). Sea water can have [...] pH values {{that range from}} 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer {{and the influence of}} contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and <b>flocculation</b> processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings. [...] Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) {{does not necessarily mean that}} lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water. [...] The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} protein folding began in 1910 with a famous paper by Harriette Chick and C. J. Martin, {{in which they}} showed that the <b>flocculation</b> of a protein was {{composed}} of two distinct processes: the precipitation of a protein from solution was preceded by another process called denaturation, in which the protein became much less soluble, lost its enzymatic activity and became more chemically reactive. [...] In the mid-1920s, Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky proposed that denaturation was a reversible process, a correct hypothesis that was initially lampooned by some scientists as [...] "unboiling the egg". [...] Anson also suggested that denaturation was a two-state ("all-or-none") process, in which one fundamental molecular transition resulted in the drastic changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity; he further noted that the free energy changes upon denaturation were much smaller than those typically involved in chemical reactions. [...] In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized that denaturation was protein unfolding, a purely conformational change {{that resulted in the}} exposure of amino acid side chains to the solvent. [...] According to this (correct) hypothesis, exposure of aliphatic and reactive side chains to solvent rendered the protein less soluble and more reactive, whereas the loss of a specific conformation caused the loss of enzymatic activity. [...] Although considered plausible, Wu's hypothesis was not immediately accepted, since so little was known of protein structure and enzymology and other factors could account for the changes in solubility, enzymatic activity and chemical reactivity. [...] In the early 1960s, Chris Anfinsen showed that the folding of ribonuclease A was fully reversible with no external cofactors needed, verifying the [...] "thermodynamic hypothesis" [...] of protein folding that the folded state represents the global minimum of free energy for the protein.|$|E
50|$|Three <b>flocculation</b> phenotypes {{have been}} elucidated {{based on the}} zymolectins they produce: Flo1 (Stratford and Assinder, 1991) NewFlo (Stratford and Assinder, 1991) and Mannose Insensitive (MI) (Masy et al., 1992; Dengis and Rouxhet, 1997). These <b>flocculation</b> phenotypes differ {{in the time of}} the onset of <b>flocculation</b> and the sugar {{inhibition}} of <b>flocculation.</b> The genetic control of yeast <b>flocculation</b> has not been extensively studied. Recent reports suggest genes encoding lectin-like proteins exhibit close sequence homology (Jin and Speers, 1991, 1999; Smart, 2001). Furthermore, it seems that FLO genes have interchangeable functions that can compensate for one another (Guo et al., 2000).|$|E
50|$|For emulsions, <b>flocculation</b> {{describes}} clustering {{of individual}} dispersed droplets together, whereby the individual droplets do not lose their identity. <b>Flocculation</b> is thus the initial step leading to further ageing of the emulsion (droplet coalescence {{and the ultimate}} separation of the phases). <b>Flocculation</b> is used in mineral dressing.|$|E
50|$|During <b>flocculation,</b> gentle mixing accelerates {{the rate}} of {{particle}} collision, and the destabilized particles are further aggregated and enmeshed into larger precipitates. <b>Flocculation</b> is affected by several parameters, including mixing speeds, mixing intensity, and mixing time. The product of the mixing intensity and mixing time is used to describe <b>flocculation</b> processes.|$|E
50|$|Wood fibers have a {{tendency}} to attract one another, forming clumps, the effect being called <b>flocculation.</b> <b>Flocculation</b> is lessened by lowering consistency and or by agitating the slurry; however, de-flocculation becomes very difficult at much above 0.5% consistency. Minimizing the degree of <b>flocculation</b> when forming is important to physical properties of paper.|$|E
50|$|SAR allows {{to assess}} the state of <b>flocculation</b> or of {{dispersion}} of clay aggregates in a soil. Sodium and potassium ions facilitate the dispersion of clay particles while calcium and magnesium promote their <b>flocculation.</b> The behaviour of clay aggregates influences the soil structure and affects the permeability of the soil whose directly depends the water infiltration rate. It is important to accurately know the nature and the concentrations of cations at which the <b>flocculation</b> occurs: critical <b>flocculation</b> concentration (CFC). The SAR parameter {{is also used to}} determine the stability of colloids in suspension in water.|$|E
