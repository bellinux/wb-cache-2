40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was {{to find out the}} growers’ perspective towards the problem of <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Hoplocampa testudinea, Klug) as well as its solution, evaluate the suitability of Dutch and Swiss forecasting methods in Swedish environment, and evaluate the efficiency and timing of Quassia extract application with varying concentration of rapeseed oil product Zence 40 against the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly.</b> The <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> was monitored using white sticky traps in two orchards located in Alnarp and Malmö. The forecasting models for emergence of first sawfly (Dutch model) and egg hatch (Swiss model) were combined and used for determining timing of Quassia extract application. The model worked well for forecasting both the first emergence and egg hatch of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly.</b> A field trial was conducted for spraying Quassia extract as a control measure against the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly.</b> The treatments were 1) Petal fall (PF), 2) Day degree low zence (DDL), 3), Day degree high zence (DDH) and 4) Control (C). The dose of Quassia was used at 12 kg per hectare in 400 liters of water. The percentage of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> damage was significantly lower in all treatments compared to control with 3. 8 %, 3. 2 %, 2. 9 % and 9. 9 % damage in treatment 1, 2, 3 and 4. There was no difference in secondary damage between treatments. This could have been influenced by a large aphid infestation at that time. Semi structured face to face interviews were carried out to get deeper understanding of the problem. Older orchards were found to have relatively more infestation compared to new orchards. The growers were interested to continue the work with monitoring and trap catches in the coming season.

The pest is especially troublesome in the apple-growing regions of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Hudson Valley of New York. In the Pacific Northwest, the <b>European</b> <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> appears {{to be limited to}} Vancouver Island. The pest is distributed over the entire continent of Europe but is most common in the north. It is found throughout England but is abundant only in certain localities. The larvae feed on all apple and crabapple varieties but show a preference for early or long-blooming varieties with a heavy set of fruit. Sawflies are primitive hymenopterous insects and are related to bees, wasps, and ants.

40|$|Combined {{production}} of broilers and fruit trees {{is a subject}} often discussed in organic fruit production in Denmark. Very {{little research has been}} carried out on this type of production system. In organic production in Denmark, nearly no pesticides are allowed, so the need for alternative pest control is large. <b>Apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Hoplocampa testudinea) and pear midge (Contarinia pyrivora) cause big crop losses in apples and pears respectively, in unsprayed organic fruit production. Both insects infest fruitlets and cause these to drop prematurely after which the pests pupate in the topsoil. In the present experiment a research orchard with the varieties ‘Discovery’ and ‘Conference’ were used as outdoor area for broilers to minimise the population of sawflies and pear midges, and to reduce the need for weeding and manuring. The trees were kept unsprayed. Fruit yield and fruit quality were assessed at harvest. White sticky traps were placed in the test area in order to measure the occurrence of sawfly over time. The infestation of pear midge was investigated counting the infested fruitlets in clusters on trees at the centre of the plots. The catch of <b>apple</b> <b>sawflies</b> was reduced in the combined apple and broiler production, but no significant effect on the yield or the fruit quality was seen.

We also assessed the efficacy of B. bassiana GHA and Metarhizium brunneum Petch (indigenous strain) against sawfly in the laboratory. Larvae treated with either fungus in the laboratory died faster than control larvae and displayed 49. 4 %- 68. 4 % mycosis. In the field, B. bassiana density remained high in the week after application, during larval descent to the soil. Fungal density decreased to 25 % at 49 d after application and to 0. 4 % after 55 weeks.

Larvae pupating in soil cages in the orchard for 49 d displayed 17 % mycosis. The high efficacy under laboratory conditions was not seen in the field. B. bassiana application resulted in densities above the upper natural background level during the growing season, but reversion to background levels occurred within a year. It remains to be investigated whether this has a detrimental effect on nontarget organisms.

During the PAR project on pest management in Swedish organic apple production on which this thesis is based, several pests and control methods were addressed, focusing mainly on the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Hoplocampa testudinea Klug). An interdisciplinary methodology and PAR approach was employed, including participatory meetings, interviews and field and laboratory experiments.

Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) offered these tools and was applied as a retrospective analytical lens on the PAR project. I analysed the emergence and development of organic apple production in Sweden and formulated a hypothesis on the root causes of disturbances reported in pest management by farmers growing organic apples.

Development from egg to adult took 39. 6 days for females and 38. 0 days for males at 20 °C. This small difference was significant. At 20 °C, the longevity of females that had no opportunity to oviposit was on average 72. 5 days, significantly higher than male longevity (50. 6 days). The longevity of females given access to hosts throughout their lifetime averaged 58. 6 days. Females were able to mate immediately after emergence and copulation lasted on average 21. 7 s.

The life history parameters of <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> and its parasitoid L. ensator were investigated in field and semi-field experiments. Usually, the adult parasitoids emerge in synchrony with the preferred host stage, the second instar sawfly larvae. Parasitoid females carried 120 - 175 eggs, but never laid more than half this number. The mortality of sawfly eggs and larvae varied from 75 and 99 &Eth;The eggs and mining larvae are most vulnerable, as the older larvae survive for 90 n average. Three factors at least determine {{how many of the}} descending larvae become adult sawfly or parasitoid next spring. The failure of descending larvae to construct a cocoon varied from 7 to 31 nd was highest in clay soil. Probably a similar mechanical hindrance prohibited more emerging adults, of both sawfly and L. ensator, from attaining the surface in heavier soils next spring. Relatively more sawfly prepupae than parasitoids died in the cocoon stage, from fungus disease or other causes, but more parasitoids than hosts stayed in prolonged diapause. Mainly due to this last factor, the overall result was a decrease of the parasitoid : host ratio during the first season underground. A life table based on survival rates during various life stages yields a net reproductive rate of up to 2. 4 daughters per female sawfly.
