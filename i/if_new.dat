5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without government subsidies {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s. As a result, the study forecasts that annual sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040, representing 35% of new light duty vehicle sales. In another scenario the study considers that <b>if</b> <b>new</b> carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery electric cars and fuel cell cars will remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid electric cars is projected to grow from 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{interests}} in fashion and culture {{led him to}} make frequent visits to New York City—which he describes as a second home—often for engagements with Armani and particularly because of the city's status as a global fashion capital. He {{was present at the}} World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, having stopped there on his jog, before returning to his hotel after forgetting his camera. It was during this trip that he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which was notable because of the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America. Thorpe later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful New York bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, even promising to continue his career until the games <b>if</b> <b>New</b> York won the hosting rights. Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television. In 2002, he played the lead role in the reality television show Undercover Angels, which imitated the Charlie's Angels series. In the program, Thorpe directed three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it averaged more than a million viewers per episode, it was widely panned by critics. Thorpe has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom Friends.|$|E

25|$|For example, Pascal {{and many}} other {{imperative}} languages have long supported passing subprograms as arguments to other subprograms through the mechanism of function pointers.

And this run-time creation of functions is supported in Smalltalk, JavaScript, and more recently in Scala, Eiffel ("agents"), C# ("delegates") and C++11, among others.|$|E

Additionally, profits from the investments usually returned to the US, with profits frequently exceeding new investment.|$|E

The UK also uses a large proportion of gas-fired power stations, which produce half the CO2 emissions as coal, but there have been recent difficulties in obtaining adequate gas supplies.

25|$|A {{total of}} 38 {{swimming}} events were contested in a 50-metre pool.

25|$|The {{greenhouse}} gas emission reductions are calculated as a percent reduction based on the combined city/highway fuel economy ratings for both the hybrid and non-hybrid model according to the ratings published in EPA's fuel economy guide available online at www.fueleconomy.gov. The score is measured in a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 is the best rating. The scores are assigned in relative terms, then a 10 is assigned to the hybrid with the largest reduction in {{greenhouse gas}} emissions, while a zero is assigned to the hybrid with the smallest reduction. The values assigned to the models are calculated through linear interpolation between the two end points. For purposes of updating the scorecard, <b>if</b> <b>new</b> hybrid models are introduced during the year, the scale has to be re-calculated {{to take account of}} the new arrivals. For the 2011 Scorecard, the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid was rated a 10 while the Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid was rated 0. The Toyota Prius was rated a 9.4.|$|E
25|$|New Bern lies on {{the left}} (southwest) bank of the Neuse River, about 37 miles (60km) above its exit into Pamlico Sound. The river is broad in this vicinity, and is deep enough that vessels that can {{navigate}} the sound can also ply the river. In the colonial era, the town was quite important as a seaport, {{but by the time}} of the Civil War Morehead City and Beaufort had largely supplanted it. Nevertheless, New Bern was still a significant military target, as the railroad (Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad) that connected the coast with the interior passed through the city. A short distance further up, at Goldsboro (spelled Goldsborough in the 19th century), the line crossed the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, noted for keeping the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia supplied throughout the war. Thus, <b>if</b> <b>New</b> Bern were to fall into Federal hands, an important link in the supply chain of that army would be broken.|$|E
