5|$|The methodological {{breakthroughs}} of the neurosciences, {{in particular}} the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the <b>elaboration</b> of increasingly ambitious research programs: {{one of the main}} goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: neural correlate).

40|$|In these studies, we {{examined}} the role of <b>elaborations</b> for subjects learning a procedural skill (viz., using a personal computer) from an instructional text. In Experiment 1, we compared two sources of elaborations: those provided by the author and those generated by learners while reading. In the latter condition, subjects were given advance information about the tasks they were to perform {{so that they would}} generate more specific task-related <b>elaborations</b> while reading. Each source of <b>elaborations</b> facilitated skill performance. This result contrasts with results of the past experiments testing declarative knowledge in which author-provided <b>elaborations</b> were found to hurt performance. In Experiment 2, the author-provided <b>elaborations</b> were classified into those illustrating the syntax of the operating system commands and those explaining basic concepts and their applicability. Syntax <b>elaborations</b> produced significant facilitation for experienced and novice computer users. Concept <b>elaborations</b> produced no reliable improvement...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} six {{experiments}} investigated {{the effect of}} text-provided <b>elaborations</b> and prior knowledge on memory for text. In all experiments, subjects read 28 episodes, half of which were associated with well-known individuals, {{and the other half}} were associated with unknown individuals. In Experiment 1, text-provided <b>elaborations</b> enhanced recall only when the reader did not possess a high level of prior knowledge. The findings from Experiment 1 were hypothesized {{to be the result of}} readers generating relevant <b>elaborations</b> during text comprehension. Experiment 2 supported this hypothesis by providing evidence of self-generated <b>elaborations.</b> Experiment 3 provided evidence that this generation process occurred 2 ̆ 2 on-line. 2 ̆ 2 The results from Experiments 4 and 5 extended these findings by showing that readers with high prior knowledge automatically generate causally relevant <b>elaborations</b> when the sentences have a low relation. The findings of Experiment 6 suggest that distinctive text-provided <b>elaborations</b> are more effective than normal text-provided <b>elaborations</b> only when readers have high prior knowledge...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of a teacher-training program on the <b>elaborations</b> and affective-motivational {{resources}} (i. e., intentions and attitudes toward help seeking, help giving, and achievement goals) of students working on a cooperative task were examined. Participants were teachers from seven primary schools and 24 dyads of sixth-grade students. In general, the program showed moderately positive effects on use of <b>elaborations</b> among the treatment dyads. Dyads with experience in cooperative learning achieved more than dyads without such experience. Mastery- and performance-oriented goals were negatively related to use of high-level <b>elaborations</b> and to student achievement, while use of high-level <b>elaborations</b> was positively related to student achievement...|$|R

5|$|A further <b>elaboration</b> on {{this story}} is {{possibly}} found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.|$|E

Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E

5|$|However, wall {{construction}} continued {{regardless of}} court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, <b>elaboration,</b> and repair {{well into the}} 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection and durability. This change in material {{gave rise to a}} number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead of being able to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site. Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that originally could be done by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone.|$|E

Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E
5|$|The Flemish printer Christopher Plantin {{established}} a reputation publishing {{the works of}} Dutch herbalists Rembert Dodoens and Carolus Clusius and developing a vast library of illustrations. Translations of early Greco-Roman texts published in German by Bock in 1546 as Kreuterbuch were subsequently translated into Dutch as Pemptades by Dodoens (1517–1585) who was a Belgian botanist of world renown. This was an <b>elaboration</b> of his first publication Cruydeboeck (1554). Matthias de Lobel (1538–1616) published his Stirpium Adversaria Nova (1570–1571) and a massive compilation of illustrations while Clusius’s (1526–1609) magnum opus was Rariorum Plantarum Historia of 1601 which was a compilation of his Spanish and Hungarian floras and included over 600 plants that were new to science.|$|E

5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of <b>elaboration</b> then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations {{goes hand in hand with}} the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E
5|$|Indo-European {{parallels}} {{have been}} proposed between myths of Fenrir and the Persian demon Ahriman. The Yashts refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An <b>elaboration</b> of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler Taxmoruw (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, Jamshid, Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (Týr and Fenrir).|$|E
