40|$|The {{project title}} for this thesis is Code Detection Software Quality Tool of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Shopping</b> <b>Cart</b> based on Logic Scoring Preferences Model. This {{project is to}} develop <b>Electronic</b> <b>Shopping</b> <b>Cart</b> Code Detection Tool that will detect {{shopping}} cart code. This tool only can detect PHP files in e-commerce systems. It is because this project focused the research on the e-commerce PHP website. E-commerce PHP website has been chosen for this project is because PHP is a programming language develop for open source and the more important factor here is recently, many system developers applied PHP to develop their systems including e-commerce systems. Logic Scoring Preferences Model is a model {{that will be used}} as a guideline of quality level to be identified and used in the development of this tool. And also that's how the result of code detection will be displayed; according to quality level specified by Logic Scoring Preferences Model (0 = unsatisfactory, 1 = marginal, 2 - satisfactory). To achieve one of these project objectives that are to identify the shopping cart characteristics, data collection has been made such as e-commerce websites observation and comparison. This type of data collection has been used to identify the characteristics normally used in e-commerce website arid to identify the differences of characteristics applied by e-commerce websites. Some interviews with e-commerce expertise also have been conducted in order to gain more information for this project. PHP code review on source code of several open source e-commerce website also have been made to achieve thesecond objective of this project which is to identify the PHP source code of <b>electronic</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> on e-commerce website. The third and the last objectives of this research were achieved by designing and developing this <b>Electronic</b> <b>Shopping</b> <b>Cart</b> Code Detection Too...|$|E
40|$|Even though B 2 B EC is {{becoming}} popular, {{there have been}} not so much studies about performance evaluation methodology for B 2 B systems. In this paper, after analyzing buyer-carts systematically focusing on the buyer’s interactional efforts on the typical buying processes of each buyer-cart, we propose a quantitative performance evaluation model. For this, we categorize buyer-carts in B 2 B EC as s-cart, i-cart, and b-cart depending upon its residing sites�seller, intermediary, and buyer sites. And after proposing the desired features of buyer-carts in B 2 B EC as identification, collection, trashing, ordering, payment, tracking, recording, purchasing decision support, and transmission of records to e-procurement systems, we derive a performance evaluation model by calculating detail sub-processes from the desired features’ viewpoints. By setting variables from interviews of business buyers in 30 listed companies in Korea, we try to evaluate the performance of buyer-carts in B 2 B EC. In this paper, we suggest a new methodology of performance evaluation for B 2 B systems, and show that the b-cart platform is more efficient than other buyer-carts especially in B 2 B EC.

5000|$|In marketing, {{abandonment}} rate {{is a term}} {{associated with}} the use of virtual <b>shopping</b> <b>carts.</b> Also known as [...] "shopping cart abandonment". Although shoppers in brick and mortar stores rarely abandon their carts, abandonment of virtual <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> is quite common. Marketers can count how many of the <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> used in a specified period result in completed sales versus how many are abandoned. The abandonment rate is the ratio of the number of abandoned <b>shopping</b> <b>carts</b> to the number of initiated transactions or to the number of completed transactions. The typical <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> abandonment rate for online retailers varies between 60% and 80%, with an average of 67.91%.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Internet {{technology}} {{has brought about}} a significant impact in doing business. It promotes the new {{way of doing business}} by enabling new system such as electronic commerce (e-commerce) to the worldwide users. Currently, the e-commerce system does not only provide electronic transactions like online payment, <b>electronic</b> <b>cart</b> <b>shopping</b> and ordering, and online tracking, but it must also be able to support a good relationship with their customers by providing a creative way in its business operations. It is because of many organizations having to maintain their customers by serving a good customer satisfaction. Lack understanding of the customers will cause an organization loss their customers and then would loss the company profit. This paper demonstrates the development of e-commerce system by focusing on the use of a Priori algorithm as supported feature in our e-commerce system. The feature is included to increase a good customer relationship management for the proposed system. It is hoped the proposed prototype would illustrate some practical ideas on how much advantages can be benefited from the e-commerce system and customer relationship management...|$|R

40|$|Though several {{industry}} {{reports have}} suggested that the rate of <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> abandonment is high in the mobile channel, the reasons for such abandonment remain relatively unexplored. Drawing on the cognition-affect-behavior (CAB) paradigm, this study aims to provide a conceptual framework explaining why consumers hesitate to use mobile channels for shopping and thus abandon their mobile <b>shopping</b> <b>carts.</b> Results from two studies show that mobile <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> abandonment is positively influenced by emotional ambivalence, a result of consumers' conflicting thoughts. More specifically, emotional ambivalence amplifies consumers' hesitation at the checkout stage, leading to cart abandonment. However, if hesitant consumers are satisfied with the choice process during shopping, {{they are less likely to}} give up their mobile <b>shopping</b> <b>carts.</b> Based on the findings, this mobile channel study provides practical and theoretical implications for marketers and e-cart abandonment researchers, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. People with {{disability}} {{have to face}} a lot {{of problems}} in their day-to-day life due to the flexibility issues. One such issue is using the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> in the grocery stores. Using <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> becomes very difficult, as they have to control the movement of the wheel chair and shopping chair at the same time while placing the grocery in the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart,</b> which is an extra burden on the user. They would have to constantly control the movement of the cart, as there would be lot of obstacles in the store which becomes a very big problem for the user. The aim of my project is to design a device to connect a wheel chair with a <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> The device would be designed {{in such a way that}} the user would be able to connect the wheel chair with the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> sitting in the wheel chair without anyone???s help. This would give them that flexibility to do the things on their own instead of depending on others. This would also help them to place the grocery in the cart easily as the length of the device is smaller than the length of the average arm. The user does not have to apply a lot of effort in controlling the movement of the wheel chair and <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> as the <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> would act just like an extension of the wheel chair, which makes it very easy to control. The device is portable and the cost would also be very cheap as the individual parts used in the device are easily manufactured. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
