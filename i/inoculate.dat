5|$|During World War II, Burnet's {{research}} {{moved to}} influenza and scrub typhus. With {{the outbreak of}} war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the institute. Fearing {{a repeat of the}} massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to <b>inoculate</b> all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from Malaya after the Japanese conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator Dora Lush accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.|$|E

The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and soil aeration due to soil aggregation.|$|E

25|$|The Haskalah {{was always}} a minor force, but the Jewish {{national}} movements which emerged in the 1880s, as well as Socialism, proved much more appealing to the young. Progressive strata condemned Hasidism as a primitive relic, strong, but doomed to disappear, as Eastern European Jewry underwent slow yet steady secularization. The gravity of the situation was attested to by the foundation of Hasidic yeshivas (in the modern, boarding school-equivalent sense) to enculturate the young and preserve their loyalty: The first was established at Nowy Wiśnicz by Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (I) in 1881. These institutions were originally utilized by the Misnagdim to <b>inoculate</b> their youth from Hasidic influence, but now, the latter faced a similar crisis.

25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} is {{also important}} {{in the development of}} herd immunity. For polio to occur in a population, there needs to be an infecting organism (poliovirus), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of transmission. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease, and so on. If {{the vast majority of the}} population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary to <b>inoculate</b> 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through vaccination, then the pathogen will eventually die off.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, {{the disease was}} seen as similar to smallpox, due to its {{analogous}} symptoms. The personal physician of the Pope, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, recommended the slaughter of all infected and exposed animals. This policy was not very popular and used only sparingly {{in the first part}} of the century. Later, it was used successfully in several countries, although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic, and depended on a strong central authority to be effective (something which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic). Because of these downsides, numerous attempts were made to <b>inoculate</b> animals against the disease. These attempts met with varying success, but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th-century Western or Central Europe. Rinderpest was an immense problem, but inoculation was not a valid solution: In many cases, it caused too many losses. Even more importantly, it perpetuated the circulation of the virus in the cattle population. The pioneers of inoculation did contribute significantly to knowledge about infectious diseases. Their experiments confirmed the concepts of those who saw infectious diseases as caused by specific agents, and were the first to recognize maternally derived immunity.|$|E

Bile and feces collected from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens experimentally infected with avian HEV {{were used to}} prepare an avian HEV infectious stock as a 10 % suspension of positive fecal and bile samples in phosphate-buffered saline. The infectivity titer of this infectious stock was determined by <b>inoculating</b> 1 -week-old SPF chickens intravenously with 200 μl of each of serial 10 -fold dilutions (10 − 2 to 10 − 6) of the avian HEV stock (two chickens were <b>inoculated</b> with each dilution).
