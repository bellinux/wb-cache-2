30|$|HOMER has the {{capacity}} to model two control strategies: cycle charging and load following. HOMER chooses the optimal strategy based on factors such as size of the generator and battery bank, the fuel price, the O&M cost of the generators, renewable power penetration in the system, and the properties of the renewable resources. A state of charge (SOC) of 80  % was allowed, while both <b>dispatch</b> strategies––cycle <b>charging</b> and load following options were selected. Minimum renewable energy fraction was not selected for this research. Due to the current state of zero cost on CO 2 emissions in Nigeria, this study did not consider emission constraints.|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{charging}} is {{a technology}} of transmitting power through an air gap to electrical devices {{for the purpose}} of energy replenishment. The recent progress in wireless charging techniques and development of commercial products have provided a promising alternative way to address the energy bottleneck of conventionally portable battery-powered devices. However, the incorporation of wireless charging into the existing wireless communication systems also brings along a series of challenging issues with regard to implementation, scheduling, and power management. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of wireless charging techniques, the developments in technical standards, and their recent advances in network applications. In particular, with regard to network applications, we review the mobile <b>charger</b> <b>dispatch</b> strategies, static <b>charger</b> scheduling strategies and wireless charger deployment strategies. Additionally, we discuss open issues and challenges in implementing wireless charging technologies. Finally, we envision some practical future network applications of wireless charging.

Further <b>charges</b> were also laid for issues at the Alto Jahuel high voltage electrical substation, located south of Santiago, which led to undue delays in recovery of the Metropolitan Region.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Coordinated {{charging}} {{can provide}} efficient charg-ing plans for electric vehicles (EVs) {{to improve the}} overall energy utilization while preventing an electric power system from overloading. However, designing an efficient coordinated charging strategy to route mobile EVs to fast-charging stations for globally optimal energy utilization is very challenging. In this paper, we investigate a special smart grid with enhanced communication capabilities, i. e., a VANET-enhanced smart grid. It exploits vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to support real-time communications among road-side units (RSUs) and highly mobile EVs for collecting real-time vehicle mobility information or <b>dispatching</b> <b>charging</b> decisions. Then, we propose a mobility-aware coordinated charging strategy for EVs, which not only improves the overall energy utilization while avoiding power system overloading, but also addresses the range anxieties of individual EVs by reducing the average travel cost. Specifically, the mobility-incurred travel cost for an EV is considered in two aspects: 1) the travel distance from the current position of the EV to a charging station, and 2) the transmission delay for receiving a charging decision via VANETs. The optimal mobility-aware coordinated EV charging problem is formulated as a time-coupled mixed-integer linear programming problem. By solving this problem based on Lagrange duality and branch-and-bound-based outer approximation techniques, an efficient charging strategy is obtained. To evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed strategy, a realistic suburban scenario is developed in VISSIM to track vehicle mobility through the generated simulation traces, based on which the travel cost of each EV can be accurately calculated. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy considerably outperforms the traditional EV charging strategy without VANETs on the metrics of the overall energy utilization, the average EV travel cost and the number of successfully charged EVs.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in modern society, a number of challenges and opportunities are presenting themselves. For example, how to choose charging station locations to minimize the Distribution Network's (DN) power loss when a large number of EVs are connected to the DN. How impact factors, such as different load patterns, EVs' charging locations and network topology, affect charging station location is becoming vital. In this paper a new charging station location methodology informed by impact factor analysis is proposed by using the Active and Reactive Power <b>Dispatch</b> of <b>charging</b> stations in terms of power loss minimization. Results for the 36 DN with three different scenarios are presented. In addition, a more realistic model based on EV's daily travel patterns is built to illustrate how these impact factors affect charging station location. It is demonstrated that the optimal charging station location in terms of power loss minimization can be found by using the new methodology, and it is not affected by the EVs' charging location and load patterns, it is affect by the network topology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen {{electric}} vehicle (EV) {{arrives at the}} full occupied fixed charging station (FCS), the EV will have a waiting time for quite some time. EV operator could <b>dispatch</b> mobile <b>charging</b> station (MCS) to the overload FCS providing extra charging pole on the FCS. MCS are determined as an {{electric vehicle}} equipped with several charging poles and/or limited energy storage. Dispatched MCS was divided into two categories; MCS_nES and MCS_wES. The MCS_nES was determined as MCS unit equipped with several charging poles without any energy storage. This unit connects the inlet to the power grid and undertake on-grid charging mode to assist the overload FCS. MCS_wES was determined as MCS unit equipped with energy storage so it can undertake off-grid charging to the EV outside FCS without connected to the power grid. The entire algorithm consists of six procedures: request CS location, EV arrival/registration, request MCS, cancel donate MCS, cancel request MCS and charge complete. An internet-base information management system was designed to facilitate the communication between CS server, EV, MCS and FCS. The procedure helps the EVs to improve their waiting time when they are queued in full FCS...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{new unit}} {{commitment}} model which can simulate the interactions among plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), wind power, and demand response (DR). Four PHEV charging scenarios are simulated for the Illinois power system: (1) unconstrained charging, (2) 3 -hour delayed constrained charging, (3) smart charging, and (4) smart charging with DR. The PHEV charging {{is assumed to}} be optimally controlled by the system operator in the latter two scenarios, along with load shifting and shaving enabled by DR programs. The simulation results show that optimally <b>dispatching</b> the PHEV <b>charging</b> load can significantly reduce the total operating cost of the system. With DR programs in place, the operating cost can be further reduced. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles Wind power Demand response...|$|R
25|$|On the {{way back}} from Chersonesos, the navy was hit by a horrible storm which claimed {{thousands}} of victims, but Mauros survived. Not long after the first expedition, he had to return to Chersonesos because sedition in the city had begun anew, and the newly installed Elias had joined the insurgents. Prior to Mauros' arrival, a naval expedition had failed to crush the uprising and its leaders had been murdered. Assessing the size of the rebellion, Justinian <b>dispatched</b> Mauros in <b>charge</b> of a large force complete with siege engines. Mauros had some success with the siege of the city early on, but the arrival of Khazar support for the insurgents caused Mauros to abandon Justinian and he too joined the ranks of his opponents, led by Philippikos Bardanes.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new idea, called 'Interactive Energy', for the dynamic pricing and <b>dispatching</b> of the <b>charging</b> {{services}} of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a micro-grid. In the proposed approach, the customers can choose their recharge time through an interactive application able to indicate different recharge times and related prices in {{function of the}} real time conditions of the micro-grid. The available power at each charging station is conditioned to the grid conditions and the prices change {{as a function of}} the requested energy, power and local renewable energy produced in the micro-grid. In the paper, a statistical model is proposed and applied for analyzing the impact that the proposed system can have on the power grid. The proposed system can gain ground with the ongoing battery improvements: the recharging times for EVs could become comparable to the present fuel stop times at the gas station through the continuous improvement of the battery technologies...|$|R
40|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{large-scale}} implementation of electric vehicles (EVs), {{the exploration of}} a more flexible approach to maintain fair interaction between EVs and the power grid is urgently required. This paper presents an aggregator-based interactive charging management scheme adopting interruptible load (IL) pricing, in which the EV aggregator will respond to the load control command of the grid in an EV interactive mode. Charging managements are carried out according to battery state-of-charge and the EV departure time in EV charging stations. A power-altering charging (PAC) control method is proposed to <b>dispatch</b> the EVs <b>charging</b> fairly in a station and guarantee EV owners’ preferences. The method does not require classical iterative procedures or heavy computations; furthermore, it is beneficial for EVs to depart earlier than expected for reasons beyond keeping homeostatic charging. The proposed scheme, which is tested to charge individual EVs well according to its preference, was implemented {{as part of an}} “EV Beijing” project. The proposed management scheme provides new insight into EV charging strategy and provides another choice to EV users...|$|R
5000|$|On August 19, 2003, two {{fires were}} {{reported}} in the central Cascades about 15 mi apart. The Bear Butte Fire {{was reported in the}} Mount Jefferson Wilderness. Heavy winds prevented smoke jumpers from reaching the fire; however, a helicopter dropped water on it throughout the day. By the end of the day, the fire had burned approximately 1000 acre {{at the north end of}} the wilderness area and on the southwest side of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. The Booth Fire was reported near Henkel Butte. During the day, Forest Service crews battled the blaze with hand tools, pumper trucks, and bulldozers. Aerial tankers also dropped retardant on the fire. Due to heavy smoke, U.S. Route 20 was closed between Santiam Pass and the Black Butte Ranch. By the end of the day, the fire had consumed 1200 acre, and it was still actively burning north of Route 20. Because the two fires were burning out of control, the Forest Service requested a National Type I Incident Management Team be <b>dispatched</b> to take <b>charge</b> of the fire suppression effort.|$|R

30|$|For {{the study}} of EV {{controlled}} charging and related fields, some results have been published. From the perspective of operation benefits of the charging station and by responding to the time-of-use (TOU) price of the grid, [3] uses the control methods of controlled charging to improve the economic benefits of charging stations, {{but it does not}} consider smoothing load fluctuations of the grid, it may result in an additional peak at night. Reference [4] proposes an optimized model for TOU price time-period. It uses the controlled charging of EVs to cut the peak and fill the valley of the power grid load curve, but it does not consider the value of peak-valley price and demand side response. Reference [5] considers reducing the peak-valley difference as the primary goal, taking into account the division of TOU periods and load fluctuations of the local distribution network. It does not consider the influence of the wind, solar and other new energy power on the grid load characteristics. Reference [6] establishes a mathematical model of dispatching EVs and wind power cooperatively, analyses the feasibility of <b>dispatching</b> the EV <b>charging</b> to smooth the load fluctuations and to consume the superfluous wind power at night. However, the paper does not propose specific solutions for controlled charging from the point of demand side response.|$|R
40|$|Through recent {{technology}} {{advances in}} the field of wireless energy transmission Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks have emerged. In this new paradigm for wireless sensor networks a mobile entity called mobile charger (MC) traverses the network and replenishes the dissipated energy of sensors. In this work we first provide a formal definition of the <b>charging</b> <b>dispatch</b> decision problem and prove its computational hardness. We then investigate how to optimise the trade-offs of several critical aspects of the charging process such as: a) the trajectory of the charger; b) the different charging policies; c) the impact of the ratio of the energy the Mobile Charger may deliver to the sensors over the total available energy in the network. In the light of these optimisations, we then study the impact of the charging process to the network lifetime for three characteristic underlying routing protocols; a Greedy protocol, a clustering protocol and an energy balancing protocol. Finally, we propose a mobile charging protocol that locally adapts the circular trajectory of the MC to the energy dissipation rate of each sub-region of the network. We compare this protocol against several MC trajectories for all three routing families by a detailed experimental evaluation. The derived findings demonstrate significant performance gains, both with respect to the no charger case as well as the different charging alternatives; in particular, the performance improvements include the network lifetime, as well as connectivity, coverage and energy balance properties...|$|R
5000|$|The Battle of Stones River or the Battle of Murfreesboro as it {{was known}} in the South was fought from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863, in Middle Tennessee, as the {{culmination}} of the Stones River Campaign. During the battle of Stones River, the Helena Arkansas Artillery, now under the command of Lieutenant Thomas J. Key, was assigned to Brigadier General Lucius E. Polk's 1st Brigade of Major General Patrick R. Cleburne's Division of Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps of the Confederate Army of Tennessee. Lieutenant Key, commanding Calvert's battery, filed his report of the report of the roll of his battery in the battle from the Artillery Camp at Tullahoma, Tenn., January 23, 1863: :On the morning of December 31, 1862, Captain H. Calvert's battery moved forward on the left wing of the Confederate Army, supporting General Polk's brigade. ...a brigade which was concealed in a dark cedar grove and behind large rocks, and to dislodge them Colonel Hill sent to my battery for one piece of artillery, which was immediately <b>dispatched,</b> under <b>charge</b> of Lieutenant Fitzpatrick. After {{the right wing of the}} enemy had been driven a mile, one of their batteries was discovered firing upon General Polk's lines, and immediately my battery rushed in advance of the brigade in open field and engaged the enemy. So soon as we opened upon the enemy's artillery it returned the fire with deadly aim, wounding 1 man and killing 3 horses. My artillery killed the Abolition captain, 1 sergeant, and 2 or 3 cannoneers, and cut down 1 of his caissons and a number of horses. The battery was silenced and made a hasty retreat.... :The next point of attack was near the Nashville and Franklin pike, where the Abolition infantry had ensconced themselves in a dense forest of timber, and were awaiting the advance of our forces to mow them down as they pursued over an open field. This battery began shelling the woods, and routed the Abolitionists in front, but they rallied and renewed the attack on our left, and promptly we turned our guns upon them, and they were hurled back in confusion.... :The fourth place of action was, after we had pursued the enemy's batteries into the clustering cedars, near the railroad, where they were masked....The contest was unequal and desperate. Their rifle guns could throw canister as far as ours could spherical case, and in order to prevent annihilation we were forced to withdraw. :The fifth position was in the field west of the enemy's concentrated artillery, where we fought them until we had exhausted our ammunition, losing in this engagement one of our bravest and most expert No. 1 cannoneers. The enemy turned a triple number of pieces upon us.... :The sixth and last action was near that same intertwined and matted grove of cedars. Here also the contest was unequal. It was in this engagement that Lieutenaut Fitzpatrick lost his left hand by a canister, and a cannoneer's head was shot off, and a number of horses were killed, and one howitzer slightly damaged. Finding that we could not move the enemy from his strong position, and that smooth-bore guns could not cope with Parrott and rifled guns, we withdrew from the contest. :The battery lost 3 men killed, 1 officer and 4 men wounded, 10 horses killed and wounded, and 4 sets of harness....|$|R
50|$|It was a {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} Catholic priesthood in the pioneer days that wherever they found a community, {{no matter how small}} or how widely scattered, wherein they could establish a mission, there the cross was erected and the protecting care of the church spread over the inhabitants. No hardship was accounted too severe and no sacrifice too great to {{stand in the way of}} the propagation of a religion which they believed to declare the voice and will of God. The first information of any Catholics residing in the vicinity of Evansville, was communicated in the fall of 1836, to the Right Rev. Gabriel Brute, first bishop of Vincennes, by Rev. Father Buteux, and the companions of his journey, who lodged on their arrival here, at the Mansion House, then kept by Francis Linck, a citizen well remembered to this day and esteemed by all the older inhabitants of the city. Mr. Linck, born in 1774, was a native of Stockheim, in Wurtemburg, and in 1836 was the only Catholic in Evansville, except perhaps the late John Walsh. In March, 1837, Very Rev. Father De la Hielandiere, vicar-general of the Rev. Bishop, accompanied by Rev. Father Shawe, visited Evansville with a view of establishing a mission, and on the 3rd day of May, following, Rev. Father Anthony Deydier was <b>dispatched</b> to take <b>charge</b> of the mission. Father Deydier was born in France, April 30, 1788, and was ordained a priest at the cathedral of Vincennes, March 25, 1837. Very few knew that he had reached the full strength of his manhood when he took upon himself holy orders, and was placed in charge of the mission in this city. While here he lived a blameless and well spent life, unobtrusive in his deportment, but with a kind word for all. After almost a year's residence at the house of Mr. Linck, in January, 1838, he built a lodge room, 10x15 feet size, at the corner of Fifth and Chestnut streets. Here he made his abode, using his little room as a dwelling and for chapel purposes for about three years. For Sabbath day services larger rooms at the homes of Catholics were occasionally used. He labored heroically among his people, did much missionary work in the country adjacent to Evansville, and in 1838 made a successful trip to the east to raise funds for the erection of a church building. The history of Catholicism in Evansville since that time is the history of a wonderful growth. The worthy priest who stood by the church in its infancy, lived to see it become rich and powerful with a numerous priesthood within the territory where he once labored alone - lived to see a sturdy oak grown from the acorn planted by his hands. When old age and increasing infirmities had impaired his usefulness, he retired from the active ministry and, returning to Vincennes, passed the evening of his life in comparative rest, greatly beloved by all who knew him. His death occurred February 11, 1864.|$|R
