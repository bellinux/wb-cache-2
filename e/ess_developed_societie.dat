40|$|Exploring {{the role}} of credit is vital to {{understanding}} any economy. In {{the past two decades}} historians of many European regions have become increasingly aware that medieval credit, far from being the preserve of merchants, bankers, or monarchs, was actually of basic importance to the ordinary villagers who made up most of the population. This is the first study devoted to credit in rural England in the middle ages. Focusing in particular on seven well-documented villages, it examines in detail some of the many thousands of village credit transactions of this period, identifies the people who performed them, and explores the social relationships brought about by involvement in credit. The evidence comes primarily from inter-peasant debt litigation recorded in the proceedings of manor courts, which were the private legal jurisdictions of landlords. A comparative study which discusses the English evidence alongside findings from other parts of medieval and early modern Europe, it argues that the prevailing view of medieval English credit as a marker of poverty and crisis is inadequate. In fact, the credit networks of the English countryside were surprisingly resilient {{in the face of the}} fourteenth-century crises associated with plague, famine, and economic depression.

40|$|Abstract Background eSS is a rat {{model of}} type 2 {{diabetes}} characterized by fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia and early hypertriglyceridemia. Diabetic symptoms worsen during {{the second year of}} life as insulin release decreases. In 12 -month-old males a diffuse hepatic steatosis was detected. We report the disturbances of lipid metabolism of the model with regard to the diabetic syndrome. Methods The study was conducted in eight 12 -month-old eSS male rats and seven age/weight matched eumetabolic Wistar rats fed with a complete commercial diet al libitum. Fasting plasmatic glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein, and nonesterified fatty acids levels were measured. Very low density and intermediate-density lipoproteins were analyzed and hepatic lipase activity was determined. Results <b>eSS</b> rats <b>developed</b> hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, indicating insulin resistance. Compared with controls, diabetic rats exhibited high plasmatic levels of NEFA, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (Chol) and LDL-Chol while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol values were reduced. eSS rats also displayed TG-rich VLDL and IDL particles without changes in hepatic lipase activity.

Because interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) has been identified as a potent proinflammatory and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) as an antiinflammatory cytokine, we studied the relation between thyroid hormone parameters and these cytokines following BMT. We studied 80 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT. Serum T 3 decreased to nadir at post-BMT 3 weeks. Serum T 4 was the lowest at the post-BMT 3 months.

Purpose The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the psychometric aspects of the Exercise Self-efficacy Scale (ESS) in a type 2 diabetes Dutch Primary care sample. Method Type 2 diabetes patients (n[*]=[*] 322; < 80 years old) filled in the ESS and the short questionnaire to assess health enhancing physical activity (SQUASH). The structural validity of the ESS was assessed by means of principal axis factor analyses and confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, reliability and concurrent validity with the SQUASH outcomes “total” and “leisure time minutes/week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity” were evaluated. T tests and ANOVAs were used to examine ESS scores in subgroups. In addition, a 13 -item version of the <b>ESS</b> was <b>developed.</b> Results Analyses were performed on complete cases (n[*]=[*] 255). Exploratory factor analysis suggested one underlying factor (total explained variance 54 %), with good internal consistency (α[*]=[*] 0. 95). Confirmatory factor analysis showed a poor fit, as did a three-factor model suggested in an earlier research. Therefore, a 13 -item <b>ESS</b> was <b>developed</b> with one underlying factor (total explained variance 59 %) and good internal consistency (α[*]=[*] 0. 95). Both the 18 -item and 13 -item ESS correlated significantly with total and leisure time physical activity.

The objective was to assess an ESS for bloodstream infections (BSIs) in the Calgary Zone for its agreement with traditional medical record review. Methods.

The SREs include exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs), and intronic splicing silencers (ISSs), which are typically {{located near the}} splice sites. However, it is unclear to what extent splicing-driven selective pressure constrains exonic and intronic sequences, especially those distant from the splice sites. Here, we studied the distribution of SREs in human genes in terms of DNA strand-asymmetry patterns. Under a neutral evolution model, each mononucleotide or oligonucleotide should have a symmetric (Chargaff's second parity rule), or weakly asymmetric yet uniform, distribution throughout a pre-mRNA transcript. However, we found that large sets of unbiased, experimentally determined SREs show a distinct strand-asymmetry pattern that is inconsistent with the neutral evolution model, and reflects their functional roles in splicing. ESEs are selected in exons and depleted in introns and vice versa for ESSs. Surprisingly, this trend extends into deep intronic sequences, accounting for {{one third of the}} genome. Selection is detectable even at the mononucleotide level, so that the asymmetric base compositions of exons and introns are predictive of ESEs and <b>ESSs.</b> We <b>developed</b> a method that effectively predicts SREs based on strand asymmetry, expanding the current catalog of SREs.

A major drawback of ESS is that its computational complexity varies widely from O(n 2) to O(n 4) for n × n matrices. Our experimental experience shows that the ESS 2 ̆ 7 s performance is highly related to the optimal confidence levels which indicate the probability of the object 2 ̆ 7 s presence. In particular, when the object {{is not in the}} image, the optimal subwindow scores low and ESS may take a large amount of iterations to converge to the optimal solution and so perform very slow. Addressing this problem, we present two significantly faster methods based on the linear-time Kadane 2 ̆ 7 s Algorithm for 1 D maximum subarray search. The first algorithm is a novel, computationally superior branchand- bound method where the worst case complexity is reduced to O(n 3). Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2006 data set demonstrate that this method is significantly and consistently faster (approximately 30 times faster on average) than the original ESS. Our second algorithm is an approximate algorithm based on alternating search, whose computational complexity is typically O(n 2).
