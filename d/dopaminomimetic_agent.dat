40|$|The role of {{dopamine}} (DA) in {{the control}} of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in basal or cold stimulated conditions was investigated by using pharmacological or neurosurgical tools. The intraventricular injection of DA (5 micrograms/animal) or the subcutaneus (s. c.) injection of a <b>dopaminomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> failed to induce changes of TSH plasma levels in normal or in cold stimulated conditions. The same results were obtained by intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of haloperidol, a blocker of dopaminergic receptors. The complete deafferentation of hypothalamus, which causes degeneration of norepinephrinergic nerve endings and leaves the DA tuberoinfundibular system unaffected, prevented the TSH release evoked by cold exposure. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MpT) (250 mg/kg i. p.), which causes a remarkable reduction of DA in the median eminence (ME) of deafferented animals, was unable to restore the TSH response to cold. Collectively these results {{seem to suggest that}} DA does not play a significative role {{in the control}} of TSH secretion in the rat...|$|E
40|$|Chronic energy-intake {{restriction}} inhibits mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} (MMTV) -induced mammary tumors in C 3 H/Ou mice by greater than 90 %. We {{have shown that}} associated with suppression of mammary tumorigenesis there is a reduction or inhibition of circulating prolactin, MMTV particles expressed, and MMTV mRNA transcription in mammary glands (and in most organs tested). To understand the concerted action of prolactin, energy-consumption level, and MMTV on inducing mammary tumors, experiments were designed to control prolactin and energy levels in order to evaluate their effects on MMTV mRNA expression. Mice on restricted diets were grafted with adenohypophyses, and mice fed ad libitum were treated with the <b>dopaminomimetic</b> <b>agent</b> octahydrobenzo [g]quinoline. Adenohypophyseal grafting significantly increased prolactin in dietary (energy) -restricted mice, and this effect was associated {{with an increase in}} MMTV mRNA expression within the mammary gland; a linear correlation between prolactin levels and MMTV mRNA expression in the mammary gland was found. Conversely, elimination of the nocturnal peak of circulating prolactin by i. p. injection of dopaminomimetic octahydrobenzo [g]quinoline to mice fed ad libitum delayed (by 8 weeks) and reduced (even as long as 25 weeks) mammary gland MMTV mRNA expression. These findings associate prolactin influences with MMTV mRNA production in mice and help explain the link between chronic energy-intake restriction and reduced MMTV gene expression...|$|E
40|$|As with parkinsonism, certain dystonias {{may involve}} {{disturbances}} in dopaminergic neurotransmission. The effects of bromocriptine, 18 - 150 mg/day (mean, 72. 5), were studied in 15 {{patients with a}} variety of dystonic disorders, using a double-blind, crossover format. Of the 13 patients completing several weeks of medication, seven improved more than 10 % and two worsened, on clinical ratings, while five recognized improvement in disability. <b>Dopaminomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> such as bromocriptine, used in the dose range effective for treating parkinsonism, may yield symptomatic improvement with several patterns of dystonia...|$|R
40|$|REM sleep {{deprivation}} (REMSD) results in behavioral {{changes such as}} the appearance of affective aggression induced by apomorphine (APO) and other dopaminergic agents. REMSD modifies dopamine-mediated behavior {{as well as the}} adrenergic receptor sensitivity. This paper evaluates the interaction between these two neurotransmission systems through changes in APO-, DL-DOPA- and fusaric acid (FA) -induced aggressive behavior in REMSD rats pretreated with phentolamine, propranolol, metaraminol, prazosin, clonidine, yohimbine, isoproterenol, butoxamine and maprotiline. Only isoproterenol reduced FA-induced aggressiveness. No specific changes in aggressiveness were noticed with other treatments and not even inhibitors of norepinephrine transmission induced aggressive behavior. It is concluded that norepinephrine had a slight inhibitory action on aggressiveness elicited by <b>dopaminomimetic</b> <b>agents</b> in REMSD rats. Beta-adrenoceptors could be responsible for this effect since only beta-selective drugs reduced aggression. As REMSD reduces beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity, only minor changes in aggressiveness could be observed. It was noted that the three drugs used to induce aggressive behavior elicited different patterns of aggression.
