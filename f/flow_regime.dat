25|$|Shock waves {{can also}} occur in rapid flows of dense {{granular}} materials down inclined channels or slopes. Strong shocks in rapid dense granular flows {{can be studied}} theoretically and analyzed to compare with experimental data. Consider a configuration in which the rapidly moving material down the chute impinges on an obstruction wall erected perpendicular {{at the end of}} a long and steep channel. Impact leads to a sudden change in the <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> from a fast moving supercritical thin layer to a stagnant thick heap. This flow configuration is particularly interesting because it is analogous to some hydraulic and aerodynamic situations associated with <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> changes from supercritical to subcritical flows.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{to natural}} <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> {{over the past}} 30 years has reduced wetland availability, {{has led to a}} decline in extent and {{condition}} of flood dependent vegetation, and has caused a reduction in flora and fauna that require specific flow regimes and water availability.|$|E

30|$|Pressure {{behaviors}} and <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> {{are affected by}} the fracture dimensions (length and height). These effects are not similar for all numbers of hydraulic fractures and all fracture lengths and heights. Fracture length does not affect the <b>flow</b> <b>regimes,</b> but it affects the pressure behaviors. However, fracture height has significant impact on both pressure {{behaviors and}} <b>flow</b> <b>regimes.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> for {{vertical}} wells include single liquid flow, bubble, slug, churn, annular, and mist flow. The possible <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> for horizontal wells usually include dispersed bubble, annular, slug, stratified wavy, and stratified smooth.|$|R
25|$|In fluid dynamics, {{turbulence}} or {{turbulent flow}} is a <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> characterized by chaotic, stochastic property changes. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity {{in space and}} time. The Satellite view of weather around Robinson Crusoe Islands illustrates just one example.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major threat}} facing the {{condition}} of the wetlands in Yanga National Park is habitat loss and fragmentation. Much of this habitat loss is historical, due to the property being used for grazing, but has been exacerbated by changes to <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> and loss of vegetation that traditionally relied on wetting.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} a {{dimensionless}} quantity which characterises {{the magnitude of}} inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number (Re<<1) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> is called Stokes or creeping flow.|$|E
40|$|The hydrologic {{regime is}} an {{important}} determinant of the ecological integrity of a stream. Hydrologic regimes are defined by the magnitude, timing, frequency, rate of change, and duration {{of high and low}} flow events and capture long term patterns of variability and predictability of water movement in a stream. <b>Flow</b> <b>regimes</b> influence many aspects of the biophysical environment in lotic systems; therefore organisms have adapted to natural flow patterns. We investigated how fish have adapted to <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> at both a population and community level. In the first study presented in this thesis, we hypothesized fish exhibit phenotypic divergence to allow them to persist across gradients of hydrologic variability. We combined a comparative field study and mesocosm experiment to investigate the morphological divergence of Campostoma anomalom (central stonerollers) between streams characterized by highly variable, intermittent <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> and streams characterized by relatively stable, groundwater <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> and assessed the plastic effects of one component of <b>flow</b> <b>regimes,</b> magnitude (water velocity), on fish morphology. We observed differences in shape between <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> likely driven by differences in allometric growth patterns, but observed no morphologic plasticity. The second study included in this thesis investigated the relationships between fish traits and hydrologic metrics and determined how traits are spatially auto-correlated within a stream network. We observed complex relationships between fish traits and hydrology; some traits exhibited different responses in different <b>flow</b> <b>regimes.</b> Trait-hydrology relationships were the strongest in groundwater and runoff streams, but very weak in intermittent streams. Spatial factors described more variability in the distribution of fish traits than hydrologic metrics within and between <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> and different types of spatial auto-correlation structured trait patterns across <b>flow</b> <b>regimes.</b> Overall, the results of these studies support the implementation of environmental-flow standards and contribute new considerations to include in the development of ecological-flow relationships...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to delivering higher pollutants {{from the urban}} catchment, increased stormwater flow can lead to stream erosion, encourage weed invasion, and alter natural <b>flow</b> <b>regimes.</b> Native species often rely on such <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> for spawning, juvenile development, and migration.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} {{advances have}} been made in our understanding of the complex flow processes in individual fractures, aided by flow visualization experiments and conceptual modeling efforts. These advances have led to the recognition of several <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> in individual fractures subjected to different initial and boundary conditions. Of these, the most important <b>regimes</b> are film <b>flow,</b> rivulet flow, and sliding of droplets. The existence of such significantly dissimilar <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> has been a major hindrance in the development of self-consistent conceptual models of flow for single fractures that encompass all the <b>flow</b> <b>regimes.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} delineate the existence of the different <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> in individual fractures. For steady-state flow conditions, we developed physical constraints on the different <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> that satisfy minimum energy configurations, which enabled us to segregate the wide range of fracture transmissivity (volumetric flow rate per fracture width) into several <b>flow</b> <b>regimes.</b> These are, in increasing order of flow rate, flow of adsorbed films, flow of sliding drops, rivulet flow, stable film flow, and unstable (turbulent) film flow. The scope of this study is limited to wide-aperture fractures with the flow on the opposing sides of fracture being independent...|$|R

25|$|The earlier {{models of}} the Jameson Cell used orifice plates to {{generate}} the downcomer jet. The new slurry lens design had a smooth, shallow entry angle that created an optimum <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> over the ceramic, reducing wear and extending its life. The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed slurry pump by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air entrainment.|$|E
25|$|An example {{where the}} mere Reynolds number is not {{sufficient}} for similarity of flows (or even the <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> – laminar or turbulent) are bounded flows, i.e. flows that are restricted by walls or other boundaries. A classical {{example of this is}} the Taylor–Couette flow, where the dimensionless ratio of radii of bounding cylinders is also important, and many technical applications where these distinctions play an important role. Principles of these restrictions were developed by Maurice Marie Alfred Couette and Geoffrey Ingram Taylor and developed further by Floris Takens and David Ruelle.|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} the unsteady natural convection in a triangular domain induced by a constant cooling {{at the water}} surface. The study consists of two parts: a scaling analysis and numerical simulations. The scaling analysis for small bottom slopes reveals that three laminar <b>flow</b> <b>regimes,</b> namely conductive, transitional and convective <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> are possible depending on the Rayleigh number. Proper scales have been established to quantify the transient flow development {{in each of these}} <b>flow</b> <b>regimes.</b> The numerical simulation has verified the scaling predictions...|$|R

25|$|Molecular {{distillation}} is {{vacuum distillation}} below {{the pressure of}} 0.01 torr. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above high vacuum, where fluids are in the free molecular <b>flow</b> <b>regime,</b> i.e. the mean free path of molecules {{is comparable to the}} size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.|$|E
25|$|When altered flow regimes have {{impacted}} {{riparian zone}} health, re-establishing natural streamflow {{may be the}} best solution to effectively restore riparian ecosystems. The complete removal of dams and flow-altering structures may be required to fully restore historic conditions, but this is not always realistic or feasible. An alternative to dam removal is for periodic flood pulses consistent with historical magnitude and timing to be simulated by releasing large amounts of water at once instead of maintaining more consistent flows throughout the year. This would allow overbank flooding, which is vital for maintaining the health of many riparian ecosystems. However, simply restoring a more natural <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> also has logistical constraints, as legally appropriated water rights may not include the maintenance of such ecologically important factors. Reductions in groundwater pumping may also help restore riparian ecosystems by reestablishing groundwater levels that favor riparian vegetation; however, this too can be hampered by the fact that groundwater withdrawal regulations do not usually incorporate provisions for riparian protection.|$|E

This reach of the Colorado River is also well known for its status as a Blue Ribbon fishery, thanks to releases of cold, clear water from Glen Canyon Dam that make conditions ideal for introduced rainbow trout. While the river here has been stocked with rainbows since 1964, the implementation of a more stable <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> at Glen Canyon Dam in 1991 has somewhat reduced the average size of fish caught there due to the increased survival rate of young fish and the resulting competition.|$|E

500|$|After an {{environmental}} impact statement in 1991 the Bureau of Reclamation was required to make greater releases to the Trinity River below Lewiston Dam. On December 19, 2000 the Department of the Interior signed a Record of Decision (ROD) officially re-allocating Central Valley Project water for environmental purposes. This modified <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> officially began in water year 2005. Prior to this, annual releases to the Trinity River ranged from , or about [...] each year, {{with the exception of}} occasional flood water discharges. The ROD increases the minimum dam release to [...] or about , even in [...] "critically dry" [...] years, with even greater releases made during years of normal and above average precipitation.. These restrictions would reduce the Trinity River diversions about 28percent on average; however, the impacts on the Central Valley Project as a whole would be far less, only about 1–4percent. In addition, the project will periodically release high flows up to [...] to simulate historic flooding and sediment transport conditions.|$|E

500|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{potential}} wildlife impact of the dam predate the National People's Congress's approval in 1992. This region {{has long been known}} for its rich biodiversity. It is home to 6,388 species of plants, which belong to 238 families and 1508 genera. Of these plant species, 57 percent are endangered. These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines. Already, the percentage of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam has dropped from twenty percent in 1950 to less than ten percent as of 2002, negatively affecting all plant species in this locality. The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species. Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and <b>flow</b> <b>regime.</b> Many other fish are hurt in the turbine blades of the hydroelectric plants as well. This is particularly detrimental to the ecosystem of the region because the Yangtze River basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for twenty-seven percent of all endangered freshwater fish species in China. Other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam, particularly the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin, [...] now extinct. In fact, Government Chinese scholars even claim that the Three Gorges Dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji.|$|E

500|$|Not {{only on the}} San Joaquin River have CVP {{facilities}} wreaked environmental havoc. On the Sacramento River, Red Bluff Diversion Dam in Tehama County, {{while not}} as large or as impacting as Friant Dam, was once a barrier to the migration of anadromous fish. The original fish passage facilities of the dam continually experienced problems {{from the beginning of}} operation in 1966, and introduced species that prey on young smolt often gather {{at the base of the}} dam, which reduced the population of outmigrating juvenile salmon into the Pacific. The Red Bluff Diversion Dam has since been replaced with a fish screen and pumping plant, thus allowing unimpaired passage through Red Bluff. Further upstream, Keswick and Shasta Dams form total barriers to fish migration. Even out of the Central Valley watershed, the CVP's diversion of water from the Trinity River from Lewiston Dam into Whiskeytown Lake has significantly hurt the Klamath River tributary's salmon run. Over three-quarters of the river's flow is diverted through the Clear Creek Tunnel and away from the Trinity River, causing the river below the dam to become warm, silty, shallow and slow-flowing, attributes that hurt young salmon. Furthermore, the Trinity Dam forms a blockade that prevents salmon from reaching about [...] of upriver spawning grounds. In the early years of the 21st century, the Bureau of [...] Reclamation finally began to steadily increase the water flow downstream from Lewiston Dam. While providing less water for the CVP altogether, the new <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> allows operations to meet the line drawn by Reclamation itself in 1952 stating that at least 48% of the river's natural flow must be left untouched in order for Trinity River salmon to survive.
