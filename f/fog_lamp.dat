25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a single lamp. Proponents of the single rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions permit rear {{fog lamps}} to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamp.</b> In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog. If two {{rear fog lamps}} are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E

Finally, there is a discussion of the likely effects of current and improved front <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> on driver behavior and on overall safety. The conclusions are that there is very little evidence for a safety benefit from current front <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> relative to low beams, that there is little reason to expect {{that there would be a}} safety benefit even from improved lamps, and that, in terms of vehicle lighting, the most promising approach to improving safety in fog would be the use of rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamps.</b> In spite of a lack of evidence for safety benefits in <b>fog,</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> are a popular optional form of forward lighting that many drivers apparently value. It may be that their main value is more as supplements to low-beam lighting for all conditions, rather than specifically in fog. Given the uncertainties in our present knowledge about how current <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> and potential new <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> affect vision and safety, it would be beneficial to learn more about those issues before adopting new standards for <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> or retiring the current standards. One approach that seems particularly important would be studies that examine the possibly complex reactions of drivers to <b>fog</b> and <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> in terms of steering behavior, speed control, and decisions about where and when to risk driving in fog. A second area would be to do a more complete analysis than has yet been done of the crash data concerning fog, perhaps focusing specifically on the issue of how fog affects road-departure crashes...|$|R

2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped {{with one or two}} bright red [...] "rear fog lamps", which serve as high-intensity rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a rear <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> is 150 to 300 candela, which is within the range of a U.S. stop lamp (brake light). Rear fog lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them. The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.|$|E
