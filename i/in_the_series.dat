5|$|After {{the release}} of the {{previous}} game in the Mana series, 1999's Legend of Mana, several members of the development team for the game left Square to form a new development studio, Brownie Brown.

Square, in turn, outsourced development of the fifth game in the Mana series to Brownie Brown. The producer for the game was Square's Koichi Ishii, who had directed or designed the previous games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>series.</b> Ishii had served as the director for the original game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>series,</b> Final Fantasy Adventure, which Sword of Mana is a remake of. The remake, in addition to adding enhanced graphics to the original Game Boy title, sought to add elements present in later games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>series,</b> such as the Ring Command menu system, and to expand the game's storyline. It also removed elements from the Final Fantasy series, which had been placed in the original game {{as a part of the}} marketing for the game before its sequels moved to be a distinct series.|$|E
