5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

25|$|Diuresis (production {{of urine}} by the kidney) occurs constantly, {{and as the}} bladder becomes full, afferent firing increases, yet the {{micturition}} reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> begin voiding.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{loosely based}} on a prior White Wolf product, , {{differences}} in the setting themes and core concepts have led critics to question whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> call Awakening a successor to Ascension or a completely different game.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Polish literature {{dates back}} to the 12th century, when Poland's official language was Latin. Within Polish literary customs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> highlight the published works concerning Poland not written by ethnic Poles. The most vivid example is Gallus Anonymus, a foreign monk and the first chronicler who described Poland and its territories.|$|E

25|$|The Battlefield Boundary is {{restricted}} to the immediate flow of battle after {{one side or the}} other has moved to initiate combat. For example, if a unit left its encampments intending to attack the enemy, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> include the encampments and the accompanying approach routes in the Study Area as the initial position of the attacking force. The route of the previous day's march to reach those encampments, however, would not be included.|$|E
25|$|Another serious {{objection}} is {{that workers}} in No Collapse interpretations have produced {{no more than}} elementary models based on the definite existence of specific measuring devices. They have assumed, for example, that the Hilbert space of the universe splits naturally into a tensor product structure compatible with the measurement under consideration. They have also assumed, even when describing the behaviour of macroscopic objects, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> employ models in which only a few dimensions of Hilbert space are used to describe all the relevant behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Meliboeus finds Corydon {{sitting under}} a plane tree, by a stream. Corydon {{explains}} that he is composing a poem/song in honour of the divine emperor. Meliboeus and Corydon discuss whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> compose such a poem in a rustic style. Corydon mentions that his brother, Amyntas, also writes similar poems/songs. This leads Meliboeus to remind Corydon {{that he used to}} tell Amyntas to abandon his compositions and to concentrate on his agricultural duties. However, Corydon says that times have now changed: there is a new divine emperor.|$|E
50|$|A {{controversy}} erupted {{over the}} {{plans of the}} new museum and whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> build <b>it</b> on the archaeological site in Makrygianni neighborhood. Another concern was whether a large modern building would fit well into the landscape.|$|R

25|$|In 1628, {{during the}} {{political}} turmoil {{that culminated in}} his assassination, Buckingham commissioned another masque-like painting from Gerrit van Honthorst, The Liberal Arts presented to King Charles and Henrietta Maria. In this the Duke is cast as Mercury, the patron of the arts, the procession of whom is brought in his train {{to the presence of}} the king and queen in the guise of Apollo and Diana. In this validation of his artistic credentials, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> remember that Buckingham had taken part in the masque Mercury Vindicated at the start of his career in 1615.|$|E
25|$|Many authorities, {{including}} the Rema, note the custom {{that the father}} of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child reaches halakhic adulthood. The Rema rules that if the father is a firstborn himself, the mother should fast on behalf of the child. The Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need not fast. The Magen Avraham rules that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, but he adds that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years.|$|E
25|$|Black History Month often sparks {{an annual}} {{debate about the}} {{continued}} usefulness and fairness of a designated month dedicated {{to the history of}} one race. Criticisms include questions over whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> confine the celebration of Black history to one month, as opposed to integration of Black history into the mainstream education the rest of the year. Another criticism is that contrary to the original inspiration for Black History Month, which was a desire to redress the manner in which American schools failed to represent Black historical figures as anything other than slaves or colonial subjects, Black History Month reduces complex historical figures to overly simplified objects of hero worship. Another criticism is that the celebration is racist.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> later {{revealed}} that Sheena was heavily {{pregnant with her}} second child during the single's release.

25|$|The court {{states the}} test for {{copyright}} infringement as copying an item {{that is the subject}} of a valid copyright, making no mention of improper appropriation of protectible elements. This is in contrast to the 2nd Circuit's prior opinion in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119 (1930), that infringement occurs only when there is copying and improper appropriation. The Nichols court held that appropriation was not improper when the alleged infringer copied only unprotectible elements of the original work. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> look at both protectible and unprotectible elements of a work to determine whether copying has occurred, only the protectible elements are relevant when it comes to determining improper appropriation. The Steinberg court made no attempt to separate the protectable and unprotectable elements of Steinberg's drawing.|$|E
25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E
500|$|There are two popular ways {{to define}} the sum of two natural numbers a and b.

500|$|Due to the {{political}} climate of {{the country at the}} time, on April 1, 2003, Madonna pulled the video and released a statement explaining why: [...] "I have decided not to release my new video. It was filmed before the war started and I do not believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> air it at this time. Due to the volatile state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support and pray for, I do not want to risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video." [...] After pulling the original video, it was then released an edited version that premiered on April 16, 2003 on VH1, immediately after a special program called Madonna Speaks. This version features Madonna singing in front of a backdrop of ever-changing flags of different countries.|$|E
500|$|The Borg drone {{initially}} {{calls himself}} [...] "Third of Five", but ends up referring to and understanding himself as [...] "Hugh" [...] – the name {{given to him}} by La Forge. Hugh discusses how the Borg only wish to learn about other cultures through assimilation, but La Forge counters this argument, discussing aspects of individuality that make them human and unique. In further debates, La Forge finds himself becoming a friend to Hugh, and begins to doubt his previous idea. This is further complicated when Hugh shows elements of individualism. The crew now debate whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice one individual to protect the majority, though Picard is still insistent on destroying the Collective. Crusher and La Forge arrange to have Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who has a similar loathing for the Borg because they destroyed her homeworld, speak to Hugh.|$|E
