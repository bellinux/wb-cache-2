5|$|<b>International</b> <b>regulations</b> for the {{maritime}} industry are promulgated by {{agencies of the}} United Nations, particularly the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization. Flag states adopt these regulations for their ships by ratifying individual treaties. One common criticism against flag of convenience countries is that they allow shipowners to avoid these regulations by not ratifying important treaties or by failing to enforce them.|$|E

Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E
40|$|Studies of <b>international</b> {{environmental}} <b>regulation</b> {{have traditionally}} focused on transboundary pollution {{as the major}} explanation of <b>international</b> <b>regulation.</b> As a consequence, domestic sources of <b>international</b> environmental <b>regulation</b> were neglected. In this paper, the domestic and international sources of <b>international</b> environmental <b>regulation</b> are outlined and their effects tested for the <b>international</b> <b>regulation</b> of acid rain in Europe. In the analysis, the complex interdependence approach and the foreign environmental policy approach represent the major theories {{in the tradition of}} the international sources of <b>international</b> environmental <b>regulation.</b> Among the domestic factors, a range of elite attitudes are evaluated as well as economic and technological factors. The results from the empirical analysis generally shows minor support for those theories which stress the importance of the <b>international</b> sources of <b>regulation,</b> while the cost of regulation and access to technology are more strongly associated with a country's support for <b>international</b> environmental <b>regulation...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems {{has been linked to}} a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling. New <b>international</b> <b>regulations</b> have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E
5|$|With Ujung Kulon as {{the last}} resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an {{advantage}} over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, because any catastrophic diseases or tsunamis could wipe them all out at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter <b>international</b> <b>regulations</b> on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. The banteng cattle also compete with the rhinos for food, so the authorities were considering plans to fence off {{the western part of}} the park to keep the livestock out.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Government's {{attitude}} {{began to}} change again in 1983, when William Ruckelshaus replaced Anne M. Burford as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Under Ruckelshaus and his successor, Lee Thomas, the EPA pushed for an international approach to halocarbon regulations. In 1985 20 nations, including {{most of the major}} CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which established a framework for negotiating <b>international</b> <b>regulations</b> on ozone-depleting substances. That same year, the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole was announced, causing a revival in public attention to the issue. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol. Meanwhile, the halocarbon industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. However, this shift was uneven with DuPont acting more quickly than their European counterparts. DuPont may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer especially as the EPA had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40 million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the U.S. in the next 88 years. The EU shifted its position as well after Germany gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting moves towards regulation. Government and industry in France and the UK tried to defend their CFC producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.|$|E
