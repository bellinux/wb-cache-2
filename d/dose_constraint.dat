40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is {{considering}} a revision of the existing system of radiation protection regulations with respect to ICRP Publication 103. It is expected {{that there will be}} a change in the current NRC regulations to require the implementation of concept of <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> for members of the public and for occupationally-exposed workers at the U. S. nuclear power plants (NPPs). Under the paradigm of regulatory science, the use of <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> is still highly debatable. This study addressed two objectives. The first objective was determining whether or not <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> are necessary for members of the public and occupationally-exposed workers at the U. S. NPPs. The second objective was determining, if <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> were needed, the optimal numerical values of <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> at the U. S. NPPs. To achieve these objectives, several areas were investigated and analyzed: 1) the establishment of a regulatory-science framework; 2) a system of radiation protection which would incorporate the concept of dose constraints; 3) methodologies and regulations for public and occupational dose assessment; 4) approaches to the establishment of dose constraints; 5) the actual doses for members of the public living around NPPs; and 6) the range of doses for occupationally-exposed workers in NPPs. As a result of analysis of exposure data, the annual median and maximum doses to a maximally-exposed individual (MEI) for members of the public were 10 ^- 4 and 10 ^- 1 mSv, respectively. The corresponding annual excess risks (ER) for the median and maximum doses were calculated to be on the order of 10 ^- 8 and 10 ^- 6, respectively. These excess risks are low and should be considered acceptable. For occupationally-exposed workers, the average and maximum measurable doses were 1. 3 mSv and 24. 8 mSv, respectively. The annual excess risks for the average and maximum doses were 10 ^- 5 and 10 ^- 3, respectively. These excess risks are also acceptable from the perspective of occupational risks. This analysis showed that some individuals received relatively higher annual doses than all others. The fraction of the workers in this category was negligible (0. 01 %) and the economic cost of further dose reduction based on <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> will have no net positive benefit. Thus, it is concluded that <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> are not necessary for members of the public or occupationally-exposed workers at the U. S. NPPs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{issues of}} concern for protecting foetuses and breast-fed children of occupationally exposed women in nuclear medicine from unnecessary exposure of ionising radiation. The protection principle is to ensure {{the same level of}} protection for the foetus and child as for the general public. Therefore international radiation protection standards recommend a <b>dose</b> <b>constraint</b> of 1. mSv to a foetus during the remaining time of pregnancy after it is known/declared and a yearly <b>dose</b> <b>constraint</b> of 1. mSv to a breast-fed child. It is not self-evident how to guarantee this level of radiation protection. The exposure situation in nuclear medicine is complex. Exploring existing reported occupational exposure levels suggests great variability between work tasks and facilities. The standards and guidelines found give no detailed advice. Therefore each facility needs to systematically review external and internal exposure levels in order to plan appropriate protection measures and issue their own guidelines and rules. One strategy might be that each facility defines tasks that do not require any restrictions and lists such duties that are not suitable to do when pregnant or breastfeeding, taking also potential exposure levels into consideration. This paper gives examples of such types of work. Information to the staff about the necessity of declaring pregnancy or breastfeeding is of fundamental importance.

Here, we conduct {{a study to}} compare HT and partial-arc VMAT {{in their ability to}} spare organs at risk (OARs) when stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is delivered to treat centrally located early stage non-small-cell lung cancer or lung metastases. METHODS: 12 patients with centrally located lung lesions were randomly chosen. HT, 2 & 8 arc (Smart Arc, Pinnacle v 9. 0) plans were generated to deliver 70 Gy in 10 fractions to the planning target volume (PTV). Target and OAR dose parameters were compared. Each technique's ability to meet <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> was further investigated. RESULTS: HT and VMAT plans generated essentially equivalent PTV coverage and dose conformality indices, while a trend for improved dose homogeneity by increasing from 2 to 8 arcs was observed with VMAT. Increasing the number of arcs with VMAT also led to some improvement in OAR sparing. After normalizing to OAR <b>dose</b> <b>constraints,</b> HT was found to be superior to 2 or 8 -arc VMAT for optimal OAR sparing (meeting all the <b>dose</b> <b>constraints)</b> (p =  0. 0004). All <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> were met in HT plans. Increasing from 2 to 8 arcs could not help achieve optimal OAR sparing for 4 patients. 2 / 4 of them had 3 immediately adjacent structures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{selection}} criteria for helical tomotherapy (HT) based stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to treat early stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) or solitary lung metastases has been established. In this study, we investigate the dosimetric {{selection criteria}} for HT based SABR delivering 70 Gy in 10 fractions to avoid severe toxicity {{in the treatment}} of centrally located lesions when adequate target dose coverage is desired. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 78 HT-SABR plans for solitary lung lesions were created to prescribe 70 Gy in 10 fractions to the planning target volume (PTV). The PTV was set to have ≥ 95 % PTV receiving 70 Gy in each case. The cases for which <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> for ≥ 1 OAR could not be met without compromising the target dose coverage were compared with cases for which all target and OAR <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> were met. RESULTS: There were 23 central lesions for which OAR <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> could not be met without compromising PTV dose coverage. Comparing to cases for which optimal HT-based SABR plans were generated, they were associated with larger tumor size (5. 72 ± 1. 96 cm vs. 3. 74 ± 1. 49 cm, p< 0. 0001), higher lung dose, increased number of immediately adjacent OARs (3. 45 ± 1. 34 vs. 1. 66 ± 0. 81, p< 0. 0001), and shorter distance to the closest OARs (GTV: 0. 26 ± 0. 22 cm vs. 0. 88 ± 0. 54 cm, p< 0. 0001; PTV 0. 19 ± 0. 18 cm vs. 0. 48 ± 0. 36 cm, p =  0. 0001).

The hypothesis was that adequate IMRT planning in oropharyngeal cancer patients is allowing sufficiently low anterior mandibular bone radiation dosages to safely insert endosseous implants. Ten randomly selected patients with oropharyngeal cancer, primarily treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), were included in this study. First, at five determined positions distributed over the anterior mandible, the appropriate radiation dosages were calculated according to the originally arranged fractionated radiation schedule. Second, for each patient an adjusted fractionated radiation schedule was established with an extra <b>dose</b> <b>constraint</b> which allowed a lower dose in the mandible {{taking into account that}} the anterior mandible needs protection against radiation-induced osteoradionecrosis. The goal for the adjusted fractionated radiation schedule was similar as that of the original fractionated radiation schedule, including a desired tumour target dosage of 70 Gy and maximum mean local dosages for organs at risk. The data revealed a considerable and statistically significant, irradiation dose reduction in the anterior mandible without compromising the other constraints. As a result of this study it is strongly advised to maximize <b>dose</b> <b>constraint</b> to the anterior mandible when planning irradiation for oropharyngeal cancer patients, using IMRT.

Between 2003 and 2006, 101 patients with head and neck cancer were treated with IMRT. Audiometry was performed before, short-term, and long-term after treatment. Data were compared to normal hearing levels according to the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO). Statistical analysis was done using repeated measurements. None of the patients received chemotherapy. In 36 patients an audiogram at long-term follow-up (median 7. 6 years) was available. The mean dose to the cochlea was 17. 8 Gy (1. 0 - 66. 6 Gy). A hearing deterioration of 1. 8 dB at Pure Tone Average (PTA) 0. 5 - 1 - 2 kHz (p = 0. 11), 2. 3 dB at PTA 1 - 2 - 4 kHz (p = 0. 02), and 4. 4 dB at PTA 8 - 10 - 12. 5 kHz (p = 0. 01) was found.

We investigated the therapeutic gain of individualized dose prescription with dose escalation based on normal tissue <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> for various hypofractionation schemes delivered with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 38 Stage III NSCLC patients, the dose level of an existing curative treatment plan with standard fractionation (66 Gy) was rescaled based on <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> for the lung, spinal cord, esophagus, brachial plexus, and heart. The effect on tumor total dose (TTD) and biologic tumor effective dose in 2 -Gy fractions (TED) corrected for overall treatment time (OTT) was compared for isotoxic and maximally tolerable schemes given in 15, 20, and 33 fractions. Rescaling was accomplished by altering the dose per fraction and/or the number of fractions while keeping the relative dose distribution of the original treatment plan. RESULTS: For 30 of the 38 patients, dose escalation by individualized hypofractionation yielded therapeutic gain. For the maximally tolerable dose scheme in 33 fractions (MTD(33)), individualized dose escalation resulted in a 2. 5 - 21 % gain in TTD. In the isotoxic schemes, the number of fractions could be reduced with a marginal increase in TED. For the maximally tolerable dose schemes, the TED could be escalated up to 36. 6 %, and for all patients beyond {{the level of the}} isotoxic and the MTD(33) schemes (range, 3. 3 - 36. 6 %). Reduction of the OTT contributed to the therapeutic gain of the shortened schemes.

Meanwhile, {{the result of the}} cancer risk is about 0. 024, that far away the hope of human. RESRAD reveals that the cleanup level of 232 Th is 0. 047 Bq/g in tailings dam soil when the dose limit is 0. 25 mSv/a...|$|E

The EA Assessment concludes that BNFL’s Safety Cases {{fail to make}} an adequate case for continued disposals of LLW at Drigg: • From the EA’s Assessment, the long-term continued use of the Drigg LLW facility is untenable because of likely future coastal erosion mainly due to sea level rise; • The EA Assessment clearly reveals that estimated doses and risks to critical groups both from current Drigg operations and from post closure significantly exceed the legal <b>dose</b> <b>constraint</b> applied today; and Drigg’s days as a LLW site are clearly numbered, and it is {{merely a matter of}} time before Drigg is closed to further LLW disposals. Because of this it is recommended that: • any future Authorisation for use of the site to manage low-level waste must be changed to storage only. The Agency should instruct BNGSL to establish and implement plans for this change of use; • the waste stored there should be packaged using the most up to date methods and facilities built on the site to contain the waste; an...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} coplanar and non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery techniques for stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) to the lung. Methods: For ten patients who had already completed a course of radiation therapy for early stage lung cancer, three new SABR treatment plans were created using (1) a coplanar full arc (FA) technique, (2) a coplanar partial arc technique (PA) and (3) a non-coplanar technique utilising three partial arcs (NCA). These plans were evaluated using planning target volume (PTV) coverage, dose to organs at risk, and high and intermediate <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> as incorporated by radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) 1021. Results: When the FA and PA techniques were compared to the NCA technique, on average the PTV coverage (V) was similar (P = 0. 15); FA (95. 1 %), PA (95. 11 %) and NCA (95. 71 %). The NCA resulted in a better conformity index (CI) of the prescription dose (0. 89) when compared to the FA technique (0. 88, P = 0. 23) and the PA technique (0. 83, P = 0. 06). The NCA technique improved the intermediate <b>dose</b> <b>constraints</b> with a statistically significant difference for the D and R when compared with the FA (P < 0. 03 an...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} the feasibility and {{advantages of a}} hybrid, volumetric arc therapy technique that used two 90 ° coplanar arcs and two three-dimensional conformal tangential beams in the simultaneous-integrated boost radiotherapy of left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery. A total of nine patients with stage I, left-sided breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery were selected for this retrospective study. For each patient, a hybrid arc plan was generated and then compared with two hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans. All plans were optimized using the same objectives and <b>dose</b> <b>constraints.</b> The prescription <b>dose</b> was 50. 4 Gy to the planning target volume with simultaneous boost to 60 Gy to the expanded gross target volume in 28 fractions. The differences among these hybrid plans were analyzed by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The hybrid arc plans achieved the clinical requirements of target dose coverage and normal tissue (NT) <b>dose</b> <b>constraints.</b> It {{was found that the}} hybrid arc plans showed advantages in the conformity index of the expanded gross target volume, the V 5 of the heart, the D 2 of the left ventricle, and the D 2 and V 50. 4 of NTs. The average beam-on time and monitor units of the hybrid arc plans were significantly lower (P < 0. 001) ...|$|R
