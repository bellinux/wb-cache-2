500|$|According to The Irish Times, [...] "Flame & Citron {{has sparked}} an emotive public debate in Denmark that has drawn {{all sorts of}} pseudo-experts out of the {{woodwork}} to debate the portrayal of the period and the two true-life figures". Madsen defended himself saying it was an interpretation that [...] "though it may not correspond absolutely to reality, is somehow more true". Mikkelsen stressed that they were the first [...] "to do the original research, yet we suddenly had a lot of so-called experts telling us how it really was and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> wrong". The actor affirmed not too much is known about the period and they hope it sparks the debate so [...] "people will research and think some more about it".|$|E
500|$|... "August" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by NCIS veteran Dennis Smith. They began shooting the episode {{during the second}} half of September 2009, right after wrapping production on [...] "Of Human Action". Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did. But I feel like it sort of opened us up in terms of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> feeling about the year".|$|E
500|$|Internationalist was {{recorded}} at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American producer Nick DiDia {{for the first}} time. As the band had already prepared [...] "about 30 or 40" [...] songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; [...] "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was {{that he wanted to}} record the band <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at that particular moment, he didn't want to play around too much." [...] As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after. [...] Powderfinger used the extra time to play table tennis, which was the band's recreation of choice during the Internationalist and Odyssey Number Five recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|The band took {{a relaxed}} {{approach}} to recording. For five months, the trio stayed at a Hollywood hotel during the recording sessions, {{where they would}} often play loud music late at night, prompting complaints. The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment: [...] "For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> supposed to behave as Green Day. For the first time, we fully accepted the fact that we're rock stars." [...] American Idiot took ten months to complete, {{at a cost of}} $650,000.

500|$|Millard also noted, [...] "Not a lot {{of songs}} mention the {{foundation}} of what we believe in. The whole idea that Christ was born of a virgin, he died on the cross, he rose again.

He also commented that [...] "the song kind of takes us there, I say 'kind of' because the first line used to be talking about until a child was born, but it was instantly a Christmas song... but it does, the first verse goes through talking about <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> completely separated until the cross, basically." [...] Regarding the chorus of the song, Millard said [...] "the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in, with the tons of voices singing, is the fact that there's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one." ...|$|E

Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to perform them.

[...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|Morello and Cornell {{initially}} disagreed {{over the}} particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: [...] "Tom and I did have communications {{about the fact that}} I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it." [...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren't as conjoined anymore." ...|$|E

Several pictures of Beyoncé arriving on set were shared on social networks by fans. Williams debuted the clip for [...] "Say Yes" [...] on her appearance at Good Morning America on June 18, 2014. Regarding the filming of the video, she stated, [...] "Sometimes the director or production assistants had to say like, 'OK, girls, bring it back home.

500|$|Truces between British and German units can be {{dated to}} early November 1914, {{around the time}} {{opposing}} armies had begun static trench warfare. At this time, both sides' rations were brought {{up to the front}} line after dusk, and soldiers on both sides noted a period of peace while they collected their food. By 1 December, a British soldier could record a friendly visit from a German sergeant one morning [...] "to see <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> getting on". Relations between French and German units were generally more tense, but the same phenomenon began to emerge. In early December, a German surgeon recorded a regular half-hourly truce each evening to recover dead soldiers for burial, during which French and German soldiers exchanged newspapers. This behaviour was often challenged by junior and senior officers; the young Charles de Gaulle wrote on 7 December of the [...] "lamentable" [...] desire of French infantrymen to leave the enemy in peace, while the commander of 10th Army, Victor d'Urbal, wrote of the [...] "unfortunate consequences" [...] when men [...] "become familiar with their neighbours opposite". Other truces could be enforced on both sides by weather conditions, especially when trench lines flooded in low-lying areas, though these often lasted after the weather had cleared.|$|E

[...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that.

They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War, due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly. The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, [...] "were always lagging slightly behind <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> using the character. We were always in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on." [...] Holland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film, and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit. Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to [...] "see what they were doing with it, and that informed where we eventually took it," [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, [...] "to make sure we were all on the same page so that [...] transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a [...] "plan B" [...] should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because [...] "it was very important to us to reintroduce" [...] Spider-Man in the film, adding, [...] "We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man." ...|$|E
