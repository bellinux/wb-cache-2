Heraclitus states that [...] "War {{is the father}} of all, the king of all ... he turns some into slaves and sets others free". Aristotle also <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> stating [...] "the law by which whatever is taken in war is supposed to belong to the victors." [...] He does also state that it might have a few issues though,”For what if the cause of war be unjust?” If the war was because of an unfair or incorrect reason, should the victors of that war be allowed to take the losers as slaves? ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] is a doo-wop style pop shuffle {{song and}} opened the second side of Like a Prayer.

This is followed by the sound from drum machine, as percussion and guitars accompany her voice. During the bridge, Madonna sings the line [...] "Cupid please take your aim at me", as the keyboard sound becomes pronounced. The drum changes its rhythm and Madonna moves into the chorus, [...] "Cherish the joy, of always having you here by my side", accompanied by background vocals and a bass guitar. The second verse continues in the same way, with Madonna singing the line [...] "Romeo and Juliet, they never <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> I bet, So don't underestimate my point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E

500|$|In season seven's [...] "Kara", {{while looking}} into Lex's {{research}} projects, Lois discovers an alien spaceship. Her attempt {{to craft a}} news story out of the situation lands her {{a job at the}} Daily Planet—in the basement alongside her cousin Chloe. While at the Daily Planet, Lois begins a new relationship with her editor Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy) in the episode [...] "Wrath". Their relationship comes under scrutiny from Chloe and Lex in [...] "Blue", with Chloe seeing it as a reason for co-workers to doubt Lois's true ability as a journalist, and Lex believing it will jeopardize the secret of Grant's true identity. In [...] "Gemini", the two finally agree to part ways. In the season eight premiere, Lois believes that Lex is responsible for Chloe's arrest by the Department of Domestic Security, and goes to his mansion to search his files for her location. She eventually discovers Chloe's whereabouts and arrives, alongside Clark, to save her. In [...] "Plastique", Lois takes Clark under her wing—teaching him how to be a reporter—after he accepts an internship at the Daily Planet, sitting at the desk directly across from Lois. Her feelings for Clark become stronger as the season progresses, admitting in the episode [...] "Committed" [...] that she is in love with Clark, and stating to Oliver in the episode [...] "Bride" [...] that she has never <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> about someone before. In the same episode, she almost shares a kiss with Clark before being interrupted by the arrival of Clark's ex-girlfriend Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). In the season eight finale, Lois and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman), Lex Luthor's handpicked successor to LuthorCorp, get into a physical fight at the Daily Planet. During the fight, Lois picks up a Legion ring that falls out of Clark's desk and is instantly transported to another time and place.|$|E

50|$|The Caribbean {{countries}} whose inhabitants {{were the}} most affected were the Greater Antilles islands and other humid islands like Martinique and Trinidad and Tobago. Because Anopheles mosquitoes thrive mostly in areas of humidity and water, the disease was not found on islands such as the Bahamas and Antigua.

The Creoles <b>felt,</b> in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> that diseases such as malaria were prevention tools from their territories being invaded by Europeans.|$|R

50|$|The “Froggy Soundsystem” {{which he}} built himself {{was so big}} that he paid for a lorry to {{transport}} it and he took on two full-time employees to run and maintain the equipment.

It used up to six stacks of A.S.S. speakers, with a four-way crossover and using Matamp, Studio Master and H&H Mosfet power amplifiers. His connection with Mat Mathias resulted {{in the production of}} the Matamp Stereo Supernova mixer (the first in the UK to feature a Crossfader), which alongside the Technics SL-1200MK2 turntables ensured his sound system would become regarded as the best in the UK at the time.|$|R

2500|$|The {{decision}} to exert control {{in every aspect}} of production aside from mastering came from obsession.

Late in the process, he became self-conscious about the honesty of his lyrics. He became obsessive about minor details in the work, making him unable to wholly enjoy it upon its completion.

This inspired and encouraged her more than anything to pursue her ambition {{to be a doctor}} when she grew up as she wants to help others and save lives. This is why she agreed to go with Nyx to fight Thanatos with the other Purifying Ability Compatibles as she <b>felt</b> that <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> {{she would be able to}} save more lives than as a doctor. She has a modest and reserved personality, but she also possesses inner strength and can be severe. It has always been her wish to help others as she, like her parents, always places others before herself. In the second season, she learns how to use a sword. It has been revealed later on in the second season that in order to save Arcadia and Nyx she must sacrifice the life she has as a normal girl among her loving friends and become the Prophesied Queen, protecting Arcadia yet from far away.|$|R

2500|$|A chance {{discussion}} with Diane Samuels {{in the back}} of a taxi one night led to collaboration between the two. Oberman had had difficulty deciding where to transpose Chekhov's narrative, with Samuels offering up the idea of Liverpool, her home town, and the two agreeing on the post-war time frame: [...] "Liverpudlians have their own black sense of humour and comic timing, born out of having their city blown to smithereens during the war". This informed the new Jewish sensibility of the play which was anchored to the tone of Chekhov's original, where the melodrama of the Pozorov family masked the pain and social upheaval all about them. Oberman <b>felt</b> <b>this</b> echoed the <b>way</b> the Jewish community in Britain acted in the wake of the Holocaust: [...] "people that close to the Second World War just didn’t talk about it – a bit like the elephant in the room". The intent of the play was [...] "to take a family who have the Holocaust hanging over them, and still have them laugh and moan and bicker while wondering what's for breakfast".|$|R
