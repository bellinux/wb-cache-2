40|$|Recording of the {{underwater}} call and {{observation of the}} relative behaviour of the river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) living in the Indus River were carried out. All of {{the underwater}} calls emitted by this dolphin were clicks which were continuously emitted. This call was mainly used for echolocation and, when small fishes were thrown into the pond, {{it was observed that}} the repetition rate of clicks emitted by the dolphin searching for bait rapidly became higher. The repetition rate was 30 - 200 /sec. (usually 40 - 100 /sec.) The analyzed patterns were monotonous and the particularly strong frequency band was not constant. The clicks emitted by the Indus River Dolphin were very similar to the call of the dolphin living in the Ganges River, but the stratiformed sound, burst, twitter and whistle which the Ganges River Dolphin emitted were not observed with the Indus River Dolphin. !? 1.

We were surprised to find out, while conducting herpetofaunal surveys at Estacao Biologica de Boraceia (EBB), that the background forest insect-like sound we have been searching for corresponded to calling individuals of the species. Males call during the day at high densities, hidden under the leaf litter. Individuals do not answer playback, seem to move very infrequently, and seem to ignore nearby calling activity. We gathered data on annual and daily vocal activity of the species at EBB, observing a total of 1, 549 calls given by 31 focal individuals in November 2003 and 2005.

40|$|The electrovacuum {{around a}} {{rotating}} massive body with electric charge density {{is described by}} its multipole moments (mass moments, mass-current moments, electric moments, and magnetic moments). A small uncharged test particle orbiting around such a body moves on geodesics if gravitational radiation is ignored. The waves emitted by the small body carry information about the geometry of the central object, and hence, in principle, we can infer all its multipole moments. Due to its axisymmetry the source is characterized now by four families of scalar multipole moments: its mass moments $M_l$, its mass-current moments $S_l$, its electrical moments $E_l$ and its magnetic moments $H_l$, where $l= 0, 1, 2, [...] . $.

40|$|Echolocation {{is a key}} sensory {{modality}} for {{toothed whale}} orientation, navigation, and foraging. However, a more comparative understanding of the biosonar properties of toothed whales is necessary to understand behavioral and evolutionary adaptions. To address this, two free-ranging sympatric delphinid species, Australian humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), were studied. Biosonar clicks from both species were recorded within the same stretch of coastal habitat in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, using a vertical seven element hydrophone array. S. sahulensis used biosonar clicks with a mean source level of 199 ?±? 3 ?dB re 1 ?μPa peak-peak (pp), mean centroid frequency of 106 ?±? 11 kHz, and <b>emitted</b> at interclick <b>intervals</b> (ICIs) of 79 ?±? 33 ?ms. These parameters were similar to click parameters of sympatric T. aduncus, characterized by mean source levels of 204 ?±? 4 ?dB re 1 ?μPa pp, centroid frequency of 112 ?±? 9 kHz, and ICIs of 73 ?±? 29 ?ms. These properties are {{comparable to those of}} other similar sized delphinids and suggest that biosonar parameters are independent of sympatric delphinids and possibly driven by body size.

40|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} is used {{to study}} the kinematics and excitation mechanisms of H 2 and [Fe II] lines in a sample dominated by Seyfert 2 galaxies. The spectra simultaneously cover the JHK bands, allowing us to compare line fluxes <b>emitted</b> in the <b>interval</b> 0. 8 – 2. 4 μm and avoiding aperture and seeing effects. The H 2 lines are systematically narrower than the narrow-line region lines, suggesting that, very likely, the H 2 does not originate from the same parcel of gas that forms the narrow-line region. Emission-line ratios between H 2 lines favour thermal excitation mechanisms for the molecular gas in active galactic nuclei. It was found that non-thermal excitation contributes, at most, 30 per cent of the observed H 2. Thermal excitation is also confirmed by the rather similar vibrational and rotational temperatures in the objects (~ 2000 K). The mass of hotH 2 ranges from 10 2 to 10 3 Mʘ, with nearly half of objects showing values of < 500 Mʘ. It shows that the fraction of molecular mass present in the nuclear region and emitting in the near-infrared {{is a very small}} fraction of the warm molecular mass present in the centre. A diagnostic diagram composed of the line ratios H 2 /Brγ and [Fe II]/Paβ proves to be a useful tool in the near-infrared for separating emission-line objects by their degree of nuclear activity.

50|$|Northern {{goshawks}} normally only vocalize during courtship or the nesting season. Adult goshawks may chatter {{a repeated}} note, varying in speed and volume {{based on the}} context. When calling from a perch, birds often turn their heads slowly from side to side, producing a ventriloquial effect. The male calls a fast, high-pitched kew-kew-kew when delivering food or else a very different croaking guck or chup. The latter sound has been considered by some authors {{similar to that of}} a person snapping the tongue away from the roof the mouth; the males produce it by holding the beak wide open, thrusting the head up and forward, than bringing it down as the sound is <b>emitted,</b> repeated at <b>intervals</b> of five seconds. This call is uttered when the male encounters a female. Two calls have been recorded mainly from brooding females in the race A. g. atricapillus: a recognition scream of short, intense notes (whee-o or hee-ya) which ends in harsh, falsetto tone; then a dismissal call given when the male lingers after delivering food, consisting of a choked, cut-off scream. Meanwhile, the adult female's rapid strident kek-kek-kek expresses alarm or intent to mob towards threatening intruders. This is often done when mobbing a predator such as a great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) and as it progresses the female's voice may lower slightly in pitch and becomes harsh and rasping. As the intensity of her attacks increases, her kakking becomes more rapid and can attain a constant screaming quality. Females often withdraw into the treetops when fatigued, and their calls are then spaced at longer intervals. Males respond to interlopers or predators with a quieter, slower gek gek gek or ep ep ep. A call consisting of kek…kek.kekk kek kek-kek-kek is used mainly by females in advertisement and during pre-laying mutual calling. Both sexes also may engage in kakking during copulation. Vocalizations mainly peak in late courtship/early nesting around late March to April, can begin up to 45 minutes before sunrise, and are more than twice in as frequent in the first three hours of daylight as {{in the rest of the}} day. Occasionally hunting northern goshawks may make shrill screams when pursuing prey, especially if a lengthy chase is undertaken and the prey is already aware of its intended predator.|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} (SSR), that is an evolution of the military identification friend-or-foe systems, is widely used by {{air traffic control service}} providers to localize and identify co-operating aircraft equipped with a standard transponder [1]. The ground SSR installation transmits interrogations, from a rotating, narrow azimuthal beam antenna. The airborne transponders, once they have received an interrogation, transmit at a 1, 090 -MHz carrier a reply signal containing the requested data, i. e., identity (mode A reply) or fight level (mode C reply). Azimuth and range of the aircraft are measured by the interrogator, based on the delay of the reply and on the antenna pointing angle. The current SSR standard is based on the use of selective interrogations and replies and is called mode S: to reduce the interferences, the mode S protocol is based on a message format that includes the unique address of the aircraft. The airborne segment of the SSR is composed of the transponder and a pair of antennas on top and {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. As the aircraft antennas are omnidirectional, many ground stations can receive the replies. This allowed the development of multilateration (MLAT) systems for the aircraft localization based on 1, 090 -MHz signals [2]. A typical MLAT system is composed of a distributed network of 1, 090 -MHz sensors, an interconnecting facility, and a central processor for the fusion of the sensor data. The data fusion relies on the estimation of the signals arrival time at the different stations and on hyperbolic localization. To identify the emitters, the processing is done with mode A replies or mode S replies that contain the emitter identity. A transponder with mode S capability can also transmit a particular downlink format message, called squitter, containing the aircraft's unique address and other information. The squitter signals are not elicited by the SSR interrogation, but they are spontaneously <b>emitted</b> at pseudoperiodical <b>intervals.</b> They are the basis of the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) concept [3]: the ADS-B OUT function periodically transmits information (identity, position, state, etc.) about the aircraft, and the ADS-B IN function receives the messages from nearby traffic. On the airborne side, the ADS-B OUT broadcasts data with onboard equipment using the squitter signals. The airborne ADS-B IN equipment provides to the pilot the traffic scenario, receiving the messages from ground and nearby aircraft ADS-B OUT. Moreover, the ADS-B IN can receive other ground services: the traffic information services-broadcast (TIS-B) and the fight information services-broadcast (FIS-B) [3]. Airport vehicles can be equipped with an ADS-B OUT, a simplified, nonflyable device transmitting 1, 090 -MHz squitter signals containing the identity and the position. As a matter of fact, there are various users of the 1, 090 -MHz channel: 1) SSR transponder replies (modes A, C, S); 2) ADS-B OUT messages; 3) MLAT systems with interrogation capability; and 4) TIS-B.

40|$|X-ray {{binaries}} are binary stellar systems {{containing a}} compact object and a normal companion star which are gravitationally bound and rotate about a common center of mass. The compact object accretes matter from the companion star. The accreted matter {{may have a}} high angular momentum and hence follow a Keplarian orbit about the compact object. It slowly spirals inward as its angular momentum is redistributed via viscous forces and forms an accreting disk before being finally accreted onto the compact object. The compact object that is accreting matter may either be a neutron star or a black hole. X-ray binaries can be broadly classified into two classes depending on {{the mass of the}} companion star. Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) have companion star masses and accrete mass via Roche lobe overﬂow of the companion star. High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) have companion star masses and in these systems the compact object accretes matter from the high velocity stellar winds of the companion star. For the work and results that are presented in the thesis we have studied the orbital evolution, apsidal motion and long term flux variations in High mass X-ray binaries which have a neutron star compact object with very high magnetic field of the order of B ~ 1012 G. Due to the high magnetic field, the accretion disk is disrupted at the Alfven radius where the magnetic field pressure equals the ram pressure of the infalling matter. From that boundary, the flow of the infalling matter will be guided by the magnetic field lines. The infalling matter will follow these lines, finally falling onto the magnetic poles with velocity nearly equal to the free fall velocity and form an accretion column over the magnetic poles. A hot spot is formed at both the magnetic poles and high energy photons are emitted from these regions. Inverse Compton scattering of these photons by high energy electrons in the accretion column can produce hard X-rays. If the optical depth of the accretion column is low, the radiation comes along the magnetic axis forming a pencil beam whereas if the optical depth is high, radiation escapes tangential to the accretion column forming a fan beam. Since the neutron star is rotating about its rotation axis, the radiation beam directed along magnetic axis non-aligned with the rotation axis will sweep across the sky. Whenever this beam of rotating radiation is aligned with the line of sight, a pulse of X-ray radiation is detected. Hence these systems are also called X-ray Binary Pulsars (XBP). These pulses are <b>emitted</b> at equal <b>intervals</b> of time, where the time between the emission of two pulses is the spin period of the neutron star. But since the neutron star is in a binary orbit, the arrival time of pulses as recorded by an observer will be delayed or advanced due to the motion of the neutron star. When the neutron star is moving towards the observer, the pulses arrive faster and when the neutron star is moving away from the observer, the pulses are delayed. These delays or advances of the arrival time of pulses can be measured accurately which allows us to measure the orbital elements (ax sin i, Porb, e, ω, Tω) of the neutron star orbit. The neutron star orbit may evolve with time due to mass loss from the system, mass transfer from the companion star onto the neutron star and due to tidal interaction between the neutron star and the companion star. Gravitational wave radiation may also cause orbital evolution. However, in HMXBs this effect is likely to be much weaker compared to the effect of mass loss, mass exchange and tidal interaction. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) is an X-ray astronomy satellite launched in 1995 by NASA. It has two pointed instruments, the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) and the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE). PCA has a large effective area of 6500 sq cm and works in the energy range of 2 - 60 keV. It has a very good time resolution of 1 microsec. HEXTE observes in the energy range of 15 - 250 keV and has a time resolution of 8 microsec. RXTE also has an All Sky Monitor (ASM) which scans 80 % of the sky in 90 minutes. We have used RXTE-PCA data for timing and spectral studies and ASM data for the long term flux variation studies of Cen X- 3. The thesis presents details of our work, the analysis of the data, results of the analysis and our conclusions from these results. The first chapter of the thesis gives an overview of X-ray binaries, their orbital evolution and the instrument details of RXTE. In the second chapter we have presented our work of timing analysis of three persistent sources, namely Cen X- 3, SMC X- 1 and 4 U 1538 – 52. For the SMC X- 1 system, we have for the first time measured the eccentricity and the angle of periastron (ω). We found that the accuracy of pulse timing analysis is limited by the dependence of pulse proﬁle on orbital phase. The new measurement of the orbit ephemeris of Cen X- 3 when combined with the previous measurements of orbit ephemeris obtained by observations from other X-ray missions, gave an improved measurement of the rate of orbital decay P˙orb/Porb ~ - 1. 8 x 10 − 6 yr− 1. A long observation of SMC X- 1 made by RXTE in 2000 during the high state of SMC X- 1 allowed us to measure the very small orbit eccentricity e ~ 0. 00021 in this system. SMC X- 1 was again observed for a long time by RXTE during 2003 during its low state. The SMC X- 1 pulse fraction depends on the flux state of the source such that the pulse fraction decreases with decrease in the source flux. Thus the 2003 observations of SMC X- 1 have higher error in measurement of pulse arrival times compared to the 2000 observations and could not be used to measure the eccentricity of the orbit. But combining the orbital ephemeris of SMC X- 1 measured using the 2000 and the 2003 observation with the epoch history allowed us to improve the measurement of rate of orbit decay by an order of magnitude compared to previous observations P˙orb/Porb ~ - 3. 4 x 10 − 6 yr− 1. We observed 4 U 1538 – 52 with RXTE under the guest observer program to measure the orbital evolution of this system. From observations of this system with BeppoSAX, a circular orbit similar to the SMC X- 1 system was inferred. 4 U 1538 – 52 was observed with RXTE again in 1997 and analysis of this observation showed it to have eccentric orbit with a marginal evidence for an orbital decay. Our analysis carried out using the 2003 RXTE observation data confirmed that the orbit is eccentric with e ~ 0. 18. But the new orbital ephemeris measured clearly shows that the orbit is not evolving with time as reported earlier. We have derived an upper limit on the rate of change of orbital period of this system to be P˙orb/Porb = 2. 5 x 10 − 6 yr− 1. 4 U 1538 – 52 is similar to SMC X- 1 in many respects, both have similar orbital period of Porb(SMC X - 1) = 3. 89 days and Porb(4 U 1538 - 52) = 3. 72 days and companion star mass. But tidal interactions between the neutron star and the companion star have almost circularised the orbit of SMC X- 1 where as the orbit of 4 U 1538 – 52 is quite eccentric. Therefore we conclude that 4 U 1538 – 52 is a young system and hence the orbit has not circularised by tidal interaction. The neutron star orbit also precesses due to tidal interaction and rotation of the companion star, which causes the longitude of periastron ω to change with time. The rate of change of ω can be measured by comparing the orbital elements of the neutron star orbit measured at different epochs of time. This rate of change of ω {{is directly related to the}} mass distribution of the companion star and hence the apsidal motion constant that are predicted by the theoretical models for stellar structure. Therefore measuring ˙ω will be a direct test for the stellar structure models. But ω can be measured only when the orbit is eccentric and for this purpose the Be-star/X-ray binary pulsars are the most suitable objects. The Be-star/X-ray binary pulsars are transient systems and have wide eccentric orbits of Porb > 10 days. The Be-stars are fast rotating stars with rotational velocity near to the break-up velocity. They eject matter along their equator in a circumstellar disk. When the neutron star intercepts this circumstellar disk during its periastron passage, the rate of mass accretion increases and the system becomes bright in X-rays. These short outburst are called the type-I X-ray bursts. The Be-star also has episodes of high mass ejection when the neutron star may accrete a larger amount of matter and can be seen over several binary orbits. These long duration outbursts are called type-II X-ray bursts. In the third chapter of the the thesis we have reported the analysis and results of three Be-/X-ray binary pulsars we have studied, namely 4 U 0115 + 62, V 0332 + 52 and 2 S 1417 - 624 which were observed by RXTE during their respective type-II bursts. The X-ray pulse profiles of the Be-/X-ray systems evolve as a function of the source flux. Generally a simple single peaked pulse profile is seen during the onset of the outburst, which evolves into a more complex multiple peaked pulse profile as the source flux increases. The pulse profile again returns to the simple single peaked profile as the outburst fades off and the source flux decreases to persistent X-ray flux levels. Also due to varying mass accretion rate, the spin period evolves during the outburst. Both these factors together reduce the accuracy of measuring the arrival time of pulses. Hence we have used the instantaneous spin period measurements to deduce the orbital parameters of these system. The apparent spin period (Pspin) of the neutron star is modified by the radial velocity of the neutron star due to Doppler effect. The radial velocity of neutron star is dependant on the neutron star orbit and hence measurement of the spin period of the neutron star at different orbital phases allows us to determine the orbital elements. 4 U 0115 + 63 was|$|R
