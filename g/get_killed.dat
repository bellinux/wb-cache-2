5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being in grave danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees {{to let him go}} because {{there is a good chance}} that Percy will <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> while on the quest.|$|E
5|$|In Gotham City, {{some time}} after {{defeating}} the Penguin, the crime fighter Batman defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as Two-Face, the alter ego of the former district attorney Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at Wayne Enterprises who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device {{and set up a}} meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor Fred Stickley, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting his invention and begins to send him riddles (Nygma rigs the security cameras to record Stickley committing suicide, as well as a suicide note, which everybody believes but Bruce Wayne doubts this is the truth) A news report reveals how Harvey Dent became Two-Face: when he was prosecuting a mob boss named Sal Maroni, Maroni threw acid on Dent's face, disfiguring half of it. Batman tried to save him, but failed. After the incident, Dent seeks to kill Batman for failing to save him. Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.|$|E

The book Kill or <b>Get</b> <b>Killed,</b> written by Colonel Rex Applegate, {{was based on the}} defendu taught by Sykes and Fairbairn. Both Fairbairn's Get Tough and Appelgate's Kill or <b>Get</b> <b>Killed</b> became classic works on hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, so it does not <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> by the sweetness of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by {{the sweetness of the}} dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E

Parker recommends using the stairs to escape, but the fire exit from the Promenade Room is blocked by a wheelbarrow full of hardened cement.|$|E

25|$|According to the Report of High Level Safety Review Committee of 2012, from 2007–08 to October 2011 {{casualties}} in train accidents accounted for 1,019 deaths and 2,118 injuries. In the same period, 1,600 railway staff {{were killed and}} 8,700 injured. The committee estimates as well that almost 15,000 persons <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> each year by what is called unlawful trespassing. A Daily Telegraph article says that Indian railway officials believe that {{a large proportion of}} bodies found dead on railways died elsewhere and were put on the railway in dishonest attempts to get compensation from the railway authorities and companies.|$|E
25|$|The {{feedback}} from social situations affect a crayfish's {{ability to perform}} a tail flip. Serotonin levels are affected by social status. High levels are associated with aggressive behavior {{and a reduction in}} the frequency of tail flips performed. This is because the excitability of the LGI is decreased. Aggressive dominant males have a moderate reduction in tail flips while the subordinates have a much lower occurrence of tail flips. This presents a paradox since this means that subordinates are more likely to <b>get</b> <b>killed.</b> However, it was found that subordinates are more likely to use non-giant-mediated escape, indicating that the reduction in tail flips and enhancement of non giant escape is adaptive.|$|E
25|$|The comic is set during World War II, and {{the protagonist}} - Ernie Pike - is the narrator, without playing {{an active role}} in the stories. Unlike genre standards, the comic does not show any battles, and neither {{describes}} the war between Allies and Nazis as a conflict between good and evil. Instead, it centers on tragic events involving soldiers of both sides. Generally, those tragedies are misunderstandings that end up badly: characters who go mad, kill their own friends by friendly fire or because they believe them to be traitors, attempt to <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> in a specific way to avoid a more gruesome death, or who must mercy-kill badly hurt comrades, to cite several examples. Oesterheld, thus, utilizes war comics to reflect his personal dislike of war itself. The character never formulates positive or negative opinions about the allies, the nazis or specific events of the war, but about the morality of the soldiers in the anecdotes narrated. The stories take place at multiple locations of World War II, such as the European Theatre, the South Pacific ocean, the North African Campaign and the Eastern Front.|$|E

25|$|The Carol Ferris {{version of}} Star Sapphire appears in , voiced again by Olivia d'Abo but without her accent this time. Her costume here {{is similar to}} the one {{currently}} worn by the Star Sapphires. She is hired to be part of Vandal Savage's Legion of Doom since she is the counterpart to Green Lantern. Her plan is to break Hal Jordan's will by making him believe he had let a hostage (almost identical to Carol) <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> by a terrorist that he could have easily defeated before harm befell her. As Hal mourns the dead girl, Carol walks up to him and berates him for his failure to save the woman and for hurting Carol, driving her into becoming Star Sapphire. Weeping, Hal takes off his ring, becoming a broken man as he continues to mourn the dead woman. When Batman arrives, he reveals that the woman was an android used by Star Sapphire to trick him, and that she had exposed him to the Scarecrow's fear gas in order to break his will, to which Hal dons his ring and becomes Green Lantern once more. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she faces off against him again. As they fight, Hal expresses anger over Carol's plan, saying that he couldn't believe what she did, only for her to coldly remark that he broke her heart, and she would never stop trying to kill him for it. She manages to capture him but he escapes and knock her out. Hal proceeds to take away Carol's Star Sapphire gem, reverting her back to normal, and admits that he keeps hurting her. This version is shown to be able to create both energy blasts and hard constructs. She was the only one to use the non-lethal version of Batman's contingency plans and was the last member to be defeated.|$|E

Farrell, Groves' Deputy for Operations. They became, informally, the [...] "Tinian Joint Chiefs", with decision-making authority over the nuclear mission.

500|$|Dahl {{said that}} the {{original}} novel was [...] "Ian Fleming's worst book, with no plot in it which would even make a movie", and compared it to a travelogue, stating {{that he had to}} create a new plot [...] " [...] I could retain only four or five of the original story's ideas." [...] On creating the plot, Dahl said he [...] "didn't know what the hell Bond was going to do" [...] despite having to deliver the first draft in six weeks, and decided to do a basic plot similar to Dr. No. Dahl was given a free rein on his script, except for the character of Bond and [...] "the girl formula", involving three women for Bond to seduce— an ally and a henchwoman who both <b>get</b> <b>killed,</b> and the main Bond girl. While the third involved a character from the book, Kissy Suzuki, Dahl had to create Aki and Helga Brandt to fulfil the rest.|$|E
500|$|Hardy himself {{admitted}} {{to his family}} that he was [...] "scared to death" [...] when he first arrived overseas, but believed that the soldiers were fed something to make them brave, which he referred to as [...] "brave pills". After a short time in the military, he claimed {{that he was not}} afraid of anything that he experienced from then on. Even in the heat of battle, Hardy professed that he would get [...] "wound up" [...] at times, but never frightened. He recalled many strange experiences with food and drink, such as getting used to drinking green water from canteens and eating hardtacks, which he found to be surprisingly filling. To go with this, there was often little more than small tins of ham or chicken and occasionally coffee to drink and pudding or pie for dessert. Hardy also witnessed many of his friends <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> in action, and relied on his faith in God to get him through the toughest times.|$|E

500|$|Ruby's {{credibility}} builds throughout Season 3. In [...] "Sin City", she restores {{power to}} the Colt for the Winchesters to use in their war against demons. The episode [...] "Malleus Maleficarum" [...] provides her backstory, revealing {{that she had been}} a witch during the Plague who sold her soul to a demon. She confides in Dean that, unlike other demons, she still remembers {{what it is like to}} be human, citing this trait as the reason she is helping the brothers against other demons. She returns in [...] "Jus in Bello" [...] to save the brothers from an attacking horde of demons. Upon learning that they have lost the Colt, she decides to perform a spell that will destroy all the demons in the area, including herself. However, because the spell requires a human virgin's heart, Dean does not allow her to perform it. Although the plan he comes up with instead saves himself and his brother, the people they leave behind <b>get</b> <b>killed</b> by demons pursuing Sam and Dean, which Ruby uses to rebuke the brothers for not listening to her.|$|E
500|$|Schindler's List {{was very}} well {{received}} by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, [...] "They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection." [...] Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, [...] "I certainly wouldn't have done {{as good a job}} as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was." [...] He cited Schindler's List as an influence on his 1995 film Death and the Maiden. The success of Schindler's List led filmmaker Stanley Kubrick to abandon his own Holocaust project, Aryan Papers, which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic. When scriptwriter Frederic Raphael suggested that Schindler's List was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, [...] "Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who <b>get</b> <b>killed.</b> Schindler's List is about 600 who don't." ...|$|E

[...] "Christmas Time This Year" [...] is an anti-war song with a Mexican polka style, with Flaco Jiménez on accordion and Cooder on bajo sexto. Composed as a corrido, the song is about wounded soldiers returning home for Christmas, with dismal lyrics set incongruously to an upbeat Mexican melody. Cooder wrote the song in response to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal and previous stories of neglected soldiers returning from the Iraq War.
