5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> cognitive development or general <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
40|$|<b>Delays</b> <b>in</b> {{construction}} projects are a recurring and global problem, with <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> land acquisition {{considered one of}} the largest contributors of <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> large {{construction projects}} in Vietnam. This research aims to investigate the formation of equity perceptions of land-acquired households and the relationship between equity issues and <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> construction projects. A theoretical model with four propositions, is proposed that links equity issues, comparisons, equity perceptions, and responses of land-acquired communities that cause <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> large construction projects in Vietnam. Using a case study approach, semi-structured interviews of 40 land-acquired households was conducted across two large construction projects in Vietnam. The findings of this research could provide better understanding of the relationship between equity issues and delays, which can help to minimise <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> large construction projects...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine the determinants of <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> Preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. This study was conducted in Sarmi Regency. The population was member of budget board in the House of Representative, budget team from the government agencies and government officials from each work units. There were 60 respondents using a direct survey to collect data. A multiple regressions were employed to empirically test research hypotheses. The research revealed that relation between executive and legislative positively associated with <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. In other words, the better relation between executive and legislative are likely to lower the <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Also, the educational backgrounds positively influence <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. It means that advancement in educational backgrounds are likely to lower <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Another factor was performance indicators which positively associate with <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. This infers that increase in performance indicators will likely to lower <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Meanwhile, commitment was not supported. Key words: <b>Delays</b> <b>in</b> preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditure, relation between executive and legislative, educational backgrounds, performance indicators, preparations of Regional Revenue and Expenditur...|$|R

5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower profile in the media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for <b>DeLay.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E
30|$|Moreover, when {{implementing}} neural networks, {{time delays}} are unavoidably encountered due to delay transmission line, partial element equivalent circuit, integration and communication. The existence of time <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> neural networks frequently {{will lead to}} undesirable complex dynamical behaviors [37 – 39]. As pointed out by Gopalsamy [40], time <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the negative feedback terms will {{have a tendency to}} destabilize a system, which are known as leakage or forgetting delays. Moreover, many biological and artificial neural networks contain inherent discrete time <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> signal transmission, which may cause oscillation and instability. Furthermore, since the neural networks usually are of a spatial nature associated with the presence of an amount of parallel pathway of a variety of axon sizes and lengths, it is desirable to model them by introducing distributed <b>delays.</b> <b>In</b> [40, 41], the stability problem was investigated for RVNNs with the introduction of the leakage <b>delays.</b> <b>In</b> [42, 43], some dynamical behaviors of RVNNs with distributed <b>delays</b> were studied. <b>In</b> [44], the multistability issue of competitive RVNNs with discrete and distributed <b>delays</b> was investigated. <b>In</b> [45, 46], the authors considered the effects of leakage and discrete <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> CVNNs.|$|R

5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} and isolate the major causes of <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> underground lateral development at AngloGold Ashanti (AGA), Obuasi Mine, Ghana. It uses fishbone analysis to identify and present 20 possible causes of <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> lateral development at the mine. By employing Pareto analysis, 7 major causes of delays have been isolated. They are: scoop problems, low compressed air, labour shortages, bad ground, flood, power outages and waste pass getting full. The study concludes that, should management concentrate in minimising the 7 major causes of delays, it will be solving about 80 % of the problems associated with <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> underground lateral development at AGA, Obuasi mine. The study further gives specific recommendations to reduce <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> lateral development at the mine...|$|R

A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and {{a general}} election was called for 3 May.

Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E
30|$|Remark 1 The MSCN (1), which {{contains}} Markovian switching parameters and mixed time-varying <b>delays,</b> <b>in</b> {{this paper is}} more practical than that of [29 – 31]. Although time <b>delays</b> are considered <b>in</b> [29 – 31], Markovian switching cannot be taken to describe the addressed systems. Furthermore, the MSCN (1) {{of this paper is}} clearly different from that of [32, 33]. Their primary differences are mixed time-varying <b>delays.</b> <b>In</b> [32], mixed time-varying delays include node discrete time-varying and distributed time-varying <b>delays.</b> <b>In</b> [33], mixed time-varying delays are comprised of node discrete stochastic time-varying, discrete stochastic time-varying coupling, and distributed time-varying delays.|$|R

30|$|Motivated by {{the results}} {{obtained}} in the aforecited references, we are concerned in this paper with a fuzzy stochastic BAMN (see (2.1)) with discrete <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the leakage terms, time-varying delays, and infinitely distributed <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the drift and diffusion terms. After proving {{the existence of an}} equilibrium state, we focus on proving the mean-square exponential stability of the network under consideration. The main contribution of this work is establishing a mean-square exponential stability property for fuzzy stochastic BAM neural networks incorporating discrete <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> leakage terms and incorporating continuous and infinitely distributed <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the transmission terms. The novelty of our proof is in employing an integral transformation to recover the dissipation mechanism hidden in the leakage terms and to design an elaborate Lyapunov–Krasovskii function to obtain the aforeclaimed mean-square exponential stability.|$|R

5|$|On 10 February 1889, {{the town}} of Sibu was burnt to the ground. This has caused a {{developmental}} <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> Sibu. The first hospital in Sibu was built by the Brooke government in 1912. It was a wooden single-storey building measuring 50 to 60 feet long, with an outpatient department, male and female wards. On 8 March 1928, Sibu was again consumed by a great fire. However, the Tua Pek Kong Temple remained intact. The locals considered this a miracle.|$|E
30|$|The time <b>delay</b> exists {{extensively}} <b>in</b> {{the real}} word networks. It {{is well known}} that the existence in a network may cause instability, poor performances and oscillations. Examples can be found in networks such as application engineering, electrical power networks, physical networks and many other. Thus, synchronization for CDNs with time <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the dynamical nodes and coupling has become a key and significant topic. Synchronization of a class of general CDNs with coupling <b>delays</b> was investigated <b>in</b> [6 – 9]. Li et al. [8], introduced some general CDNs models with time-varying <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> network couplings and time-varying <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> dynamical nodes. Song et al. [10] investigated synchronization of general CDNs with mixed time, where mixed <b>delay</b> appeared <b>in</b> the hybrid coupling term, but not in the isolate systems. Furthermore, Li [11] considered synchronization for delayed CDNs with hybrid coupling, which is made up of constant coupling, discrete delay coupling and distributed-delay coupling, but the discrete and distributed delays are not different values. Up to now, unfortunately, there have only been few papers related to the topic of synchronization of CDNs with mixed time-varying <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the dynamical nodes and time-varying <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> the hybrid coupling, which includes constant coupling, discrete time-varying delay coupling and distributed time-varying delay coupling, simultaneously. So, it is challenging to solve this synchronization problem for CDNs.|$|R
