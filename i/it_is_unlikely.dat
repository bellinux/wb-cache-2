5|$|Ipswich's record home {{attendance}} is 38,010 for a sixth round FA Cup match against Leeds United on 8 March 1975. With {{the introduction of}} regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Maria Theresa ever {{completely}} {{recovered from}} the smallpox attack in 1767, as 18th-century writers asserted. She suffered from shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia and insomnia. She later developed edema.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{that the}} saga writers had {{accurate}} information on {{details of the}} battle beyond the sparse accounts in the surviving poems.

5|$|Obesity {{prevention}} {{programs have been}} found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> to reduce overall health spending.|$|E
5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant {{would be an}} individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across {{the width of the}} straits.

5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution {{and the fact that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E

5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
5|$|According to Tough, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{that the}} {{avoidance}} of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action.

5|$|After the war, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} rose, and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12,000.
