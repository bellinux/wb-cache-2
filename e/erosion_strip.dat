40|$|Two new {{styles of}} {{electrical}} impulse deicers {{has been developed}} and tested in NASA's Icing Research Tunnel. With the Eddy Current Repulsion Deicing Boot (EDB), a thin and flexible spiral coil is encapsulated between two thicknesses of elastomer. The coil, made by an industrial printed circuit board manufacturer, is bonded to the aluminum aircraft leading edge. A capacitor bank is discharged through the coil. Induced eddy currents repel the coil from the aluminum aircraft structure and shed accumulated ice. A second configuration, the Eddy Current Repulsion Deicing-Strip (EDS) uses an outer metal <b>erosion</b> <b>strip</b> fastened over the coil. Opposite flowing eddy currents repel the strip and create the impulse deicing force. The outer strip serves as a surface for the collection and shedding of ice and does not require any structural properties. The EDS is suitable for composite aircraft structures.

5000|$|...Like {{the nearby}} Palisades and Sourland Mountain, Cushetunk Mountain formed {{approximately}} 200 {{million years ago}} around the Triassic/Jurassic boundary as an intrusion of igneous rock, diabase, into local shale and sandstone. The intrusion occurred when the Newark Basin, an aborted rift zone that formed as Pangaea began to break up, was still volcanically active. Originally, {{it was thought that}} Cushetunk Mountain was formed well after the nearby Watchung Mountains, also of volcanic origin. The theory was that the deposition of sediment into the Newark Basin was still occurring after the Watchungs were extruded, which explained how Cushetunk Mountain was able to intrude into strata above the height of the Watchungs. [...] However, it is now known that Cushetunk Mountain, as well as other intrusive bodies in the Newark Basin, are at least 10 million years older than the Watchungs, which implies that erosion and/or uplift must have occurred after Cushetunk Mountain was intruded in order to allow the Watchungs to form at the surface.

40|$|The {{utility of}} the caesium- 137 (137 Cs) technique, for {{estimating}} the effects of wind erosion, was evaluated on the soils of a semi-arid agricultural area near Jerramungup, Western Australia. The past incidence of wind erosion was estimated from field observations of soil profile morphology and an existing remote sensing study. Erosion was limited to sandy surfaced soils (0 - 4 % clay), with a highly significant difference (P < 0. 0001) in 137 Cs values between eroded and non-eroded sandy soils, with mean values of 243 ± 17 and 386 ± 13 Bq m- 2 respectively. Non-eroded soils, with larger clay contents, had a mean 137 Cs scontent of 421 ± 26 Bq m- 2, however, due to considerable variation between replicate samples, this value was {{not significantly different from}} that of the non-eroded sands. Hence, although the technique discriminates between eroded and non-eroded areas, the large variation in 137 Cs values means that from 27 to 96 replicate samples are required to provide statistically valid estimates of 137 Cs loss. The occurrence of around 18 % of the total 137 Cs between 10 and 20 cm depth in these soils, despite cultivation being confined to the surface 9 cm, suggests that leaching of 137 Cs occurs in the sandy soils, although there was no relationship between clay content and 137 Cs value for either eroded or non-eroded soils. In a multiple linear regression, organic carbon content and the mean grain size of the eroded soils explained 35 % of the variation in 137 Cs content. This relationship suggests that both organic carbon and 137 Cs are removed by erosion, with erosion being more prevalent on soils with a finer sand fraction. Clay and silt contents do not vary with depth in the near-surface horizons of the eroded sandy soils, hence it is likely that wind <b>erosion</b> <b>strips</b> the entire surface horizon with its 137 Cscontent, rather than selectively winnowing fine material...|$|R

50|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to reconstruct shapes of intrusions. For instance, Devils Tower in Wyoming was thought to be a volcanic neck, but study has revealed it to be an eroded laccolith. The rock would have had to cool very slowly so as to form the slender pencil-shaped columns of phonolite porphyry seen today. However, <b>erosion</b> has <b>stripped</b> away the overlying and surrounding rock, and so it is impossible to reconstruct the original shape of the igneous intrusion; that rock may not be the remnant of a laccolith. At other localities, such as in the Henry Mountains and other isolated mountain ranges of the Colorado Plateau, some intrusions demonstrably have shapes of laccoliths. The small Barber Hill syenite-stock laccolith in Charlotte, Vermont, has several volcanic trachyte dikes associated with it. Molybdenite is also visible in outcrops on this exposed laccolith. In Big Bend Ranch State Park, at the southwesternmost visible extent of the Ouachita orogeny, lies the Solitario.

(This is, however, no longer used as a formal geological name). The tough sandstone rests conformably upon a basal shale that in turn lies unconformably upon a basement of older (Late Precambrian) rocks (Malmesbury shale/slate and the Cape Granite). The basal shale and the older rocks below it weather much faster than the TMS and for this reason the lower slopes are smoother in all parts, with few outcrops and deeper soil. Millions of years of <b>erosion</b> have <b>stripped</b> all of the TMS from Signal Hill and that is why it looks very rounded compared to its sister peaks. There is a road that runs almost on the contour from the lower cable station on Table Mountain along the mountain to Devil's Peak. As it turns east around the bulk of Devil's Peak the road cuttings expose a few famous geological unconformities, which illustrate very clearly that the Malmesbury rocks were folded, baked, intruded by granite and planed down by millions of years of erosion before the area sank below the ocean and a new sequence of sediments, including the TMS, began to accumulate.|$|R
40|$|Key Points 堏ver {{the past}} decade the {{scientific}} understanding of the dominant sources of contemporary sediment pollution to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has changed dramatically; from models a decade ago which assumed a dominance of hillslope sheet and rill erosion, to multiple lines of empirical evidence which now show that channel network erosion (particularly bank and gully erosion) from savannah grazing land is the dominant sediment source. 堂enches and inset floodplains can account for as much, or more, contemporary fine sediment storage (i. e. on century timescales) as occurs on floodplains. 堔o manage sediment supply to the GBR we need to manage how alluvial sediment stores within the riparian zones of all catchments are remobilized and/or stabilized (i. e. riparian management). 堇rass buffer strips at the paddock scale (which some argue are ineffective sediment and nutrient filters) {{should not be confused}} with riparian buffers, which are essential to managing sediment runoff to the GBR. 堉t is time to re-establish a program similar to the Land and Water Australia Riparian Program - with a specific focus on managing sediment supply to the GBR from riparian lands. Abstract Recent research into the sources of post-European settlement increases in sediment yield to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) indicate that in most catchments the dominant erosion processes contributing elevated sediment are those associated with the sub-surface sources of bank, gully, and scald <b>erosion</b> (<b>stripping</b> of the soil A horizon). Gully erosion is likely to be the dominant sediment source in the major sediment yielding catchments to the GBR like the Burdekin, Fitzroy, Normanby and Herbert catchments, with a large proportion being the alluvial form, where the erosion is occurring into floodplain deposits. By definition the initiation, and potential control of these alluvial gullies, are inherently linked to riparian zone land management. Bank erosion is also a process that is integrally associated with riparian zone processes, and in catchments such as the Normanby is as significant a source as alluvial gully erosion. Evidence from the Normanby also indicates that the deposition of suspended sediment within the macro-channel is far more significant than previously assumed; a sink that to date has not been accounted for in most catchment sediment budgets. Management strategies aimed at managing water quality delivered to the GBRWHA have not focused to the extent that they need to be on sediment sources derived from the riparian zone, nor to the potential of this zone to mitigate sediment delivery through storage. In this paper we present evidence for the critical role of riparian zone management in reducing sediment inputs to the GBR and suggest a targeted program similar to the former Land and Water Australia Riparian Program, should be re-established for managing sediment runoff to the GBR.

A history of exploitation of the Bohnerze for their iron indicates their existence has long been recognized, however, their origin and evolution has remained a source of debate. Petrographical, mineralogical, and geochemical comparison between the Bohnerz and Indian laterite clearly demonstrates that their origin is consistent with the development of a widespread lateritic weathering residuum in southern Germany during the Cretaceous and early Tertiary. The Bohnerz Formation therefore represents the residues of a palaeo-weathering regime, and the last vestiges of a once extensive tropical weathering surface. Moreover the long term geomorphological evolution of the entire region is best explained in terms of a phase of Late Cretaceous - early Tertiary etchplanation which was terminated by <b>erosion</b> and <b>stripping</b> {{as a consequence of the}} climatic change since the later Eocene and early Oligocene.
