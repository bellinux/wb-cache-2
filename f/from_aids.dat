5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death <b>from</b> <b>AIDS</b> are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death <b>from</b> <b>AIDS</b> is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 November 1991, just over 24 hours after issuing that statement, Mercury {{died at the age}} of 45 at his home in Kensington. The {{official}} cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting <b>from</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Mercury's close friend, Dave Clark of The Dave Clark Five, had taken over the bedside vigil when he died. Austin phoned Mercury's parents and sister to break the news of his death, which reached newspaper and television crews by the early hours of 25 November.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died <b>from</b> <b>AIDS,</b> {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E

Several days later, a physician disclosed that Wiggins' health problems were complications of AIDS. Wiggins stated that he had contracted the disease via intravenous drug use. He became the first baseball player known to have died <b>from</b> <b>AIDS.</b>|$|E

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} argued that foreign aid {{leads to a}} virtuous circle in which growth becomes self-reinforcing. We study two versions of this argument, using a modified neoclassical growth model in which the effects of parameter changes and capital accumulation are amplified. Simulations are used to quantify the welfare benefits <b>from</b> <b>aid</b> transfers. We find that, contrary to expectations, amplification makes only a modest difference to the welfare benefits <b>from</b> <b>aid.</b> This is true even when aid allows a faster exit from a vicious circle or poverty trap...|$|R

Later that year, {{he played the}} role of a gay lawyer suffering <b>from</b> <b>AIDS,</b> fighting discrimination in his law firm in the drama Philadelphia. For his performance, Hanks earned his first Academy Award for Best Actor. For his next film, the romantic comedy-drama Forrest Gump (1994), he received a consecutive second Academy Award for Best Actor which made Hanks the first actor since Spencer Tracy in 1938 to achieve this feat. In 1995, he played astronaut Jim Lovell, in Howard-directed historical drama, Apollo 13, and voiced Sheriff Woody in the animated film Toy Story.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death <b>from</b> <b>AIDS</b> is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

Holmstrom, an orphan whose parents had died <b>from</b> <b>AIDS.</b> C.J.'s mother, Rosemary Holmstrom, had been on daytime talk shows in the 1980s discussing {{the death of her}} husband <b>from</b> <b>AIDS,</b> and her own HIV positive status. The Turners helped her and C.J. from that time on, adopting C.J after her death. Turner’s home was flooded and subsequently burned to the ground during Hurricane Sandy.|$|E
