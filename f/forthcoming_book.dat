5|$|In {{view of this}} interest, Darwin {{prepared}} a paper on Catasetum as an extract from his <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book,</b> which was read to the Linnean Society of London on 3 April 1862. Darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of a single species, but as they differed so much from each other, they had been classified as different genera.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1907, Baden-Powell went on an {{extensive}} speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Arthur Pearson, to promote his <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book,</b> Scouting for Boys. He had not simply rewritten his Aids to Scouting; he omitted the military aspects and transferred the techniques (mainly survival) to non-military heroes: backwoodsmen, explorers (and later on, sailors and airmen). He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout method) by which he extended the attractive game to a personal mental education.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} {{the launch of the}} book, Blair {{appeared}} on the series premiere of ITV1's breakfast television programme Daybreak, where he criticised the Dublin protestors as a small minority given undue media attention. Since the book was selling well, and given fears that protesters would also be present at a <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book</b> signing in London on 8 September, he expressed doubts over whether that event was justifiable or worth the inevitable disruption. Later in the day it was confirmed the signing at Waterstones in Piccadilly would not go ahead. A spokesman for Blair announced that a planned launch party for the book scheduled for the Tate Modern would take place despite plans by the Stop the War Coalition to demonstrate. However, the following day this event was also cancelled as a result of threats of disruption by campaigners. In subsequent weeks, a number of media organisations reported that copies of A Journey were being moved from autobiographical sections in bookshops to sections on crime and horror. More than 10,000 people had joined a Facebook page calling for that action.|$|E

25|$|Research by {{historian}} Paul Finkelman {{reveals that}} Marshall owned hundreds of slaves, {{contrary to the}} conventional belief that he owned only {{a dozen or so}} slaves. Marshall also engaged in the buying and selling of slaves throughout his life. As the then Ariel F. Sallows Chair in Human Rights, Finkelman first presented his research at the College of Law, University of Saskatchewan. Finkelman's research will be published in his <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book,</b> Supreme Injustice: Slavery in the Nation’s Highest Court, to be published by the Harvard University Press. Finkelman suggests that Marshall's substantial slave holdings may have influenced him to render judicial decisions in favor of slave owners.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Gurdjieff {{tried to}} {{reconnect}} with his former pupils. Ouspensky was reluctant, but after his death (October 1947), his widow advised his remaining pupils to see Gurdjieff in Paris. J. G. Bennett also visited from England, the first meeting for 25 years. Ouspensky's pupils in England had all thought that Gurdjieff was dead. They discovered he was alive only {{after the death of}} Ouspensky, who had not told them that Gurdjieff was still living. They were overjoyed to hear so, and many of Ouspensky's pupils including Rina Hands, Basil Tilley and Catherine Murphy visited Gurdjieff in Paris.

25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book</b> The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
25|$|Michael Banach, {{the current}} Vatican {{representative}} to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference in Vienna in September 2011 that the Japanese nuclear disaster created new concerns {{about the safety of}} nuclear plants globally. Auxiliary bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said this serious nuclear power incident should be a lesson for Japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects. He called on the worldwide Christian solidarity to provide wide support for this anti-nuclear campaign. Statements from bishops’ conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power.

500|$|Butcher persevered, again setting {{himself to}} the task of {{compiling}} pioneer narratives. [...] He secured the assistance of George B.

[...] To cover the cost of engraving, typesetting, and publishing, he recruited Ephraim Swain Finch, an early settler of Custer County and now a wealthy rancher. [...] Finch, whom Butcher knew through his Populist activities, agreed to underwrite these expenses; moreover, he placed an advertisement in the Custer County Chief, assuring readers that orders for Butcher's <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book</b> would be filled.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, two amateur {{researchers}} named Daniel Dvorak and Matthew Myers proposed Mayfield as {{a suspect}} once again, asserting that they had assembled a convincing circumstantial case that would be detailed in a <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book.</b> [...] They theorized that Mayfield called Himmelsbach not to offer advice, but to establish an alibi; and they challenged Himmelsbach's conclusion that Mayfield {{could not possibly have}} found a phone in time to call the FBI less than four hours after jumping into the wilderness at night. Mayfield denied any involvement, and repeated a previous assertion that the FBI called him five times while the hijacking was still in progress to ask about parachutes, local skydivers, and skydiving techniques. (Himmelsbach said the FBI never called Mayfield.) [...] Mayfield further charged that Dvorak and Myers asked him to play along with their theory, and [...] "we'll all make a lot of money".

500|$|When asked before {{publication}} {{about the}} <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book,</b> Rowling stated {{that she could}} not change the ending even if she wanted. [...] "These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't". She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, [...] "almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel". She has said that the last chapter of the book was written [...] "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the series. Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be [...] "something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar. Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry's mission was over.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley's Rambles both resembles and {{attempts}} to separate itself from other travel narratives of the time. Elizabeth Nitchie, in her description of the text, writes, for example, that there is [...] "little novelty either in what [...] saw or in her account" [...] of the Alps, the Rhine, or Italy, and Moskal notes that Shelley's [...] "book participates in the travel-book convention of museum-going". Although Shelley drew on Murray's famous handbooks and other guidebooks, she specifically attempted to differentiate her work from these. While Murray's guidebooks, for example, were generally apolitical, Shelley argues {{in the preface to}} Rambles that the uniqueness of her work is in its portrayal of the Italian people from [...] "a political point of view". Shelley had sold her publisher on the idea of a travel narrative by describing the <b>forthcoming</b> <b>book</b> as [...] "light" [...] and [...] "amusing", in the style of Samuel Rogers, whose travel narrative of Italy, accompanied by illustrations by J. M. W. Turner, had been a best-seller in the late 1820s. Rogers's text had avoided politics and focused on picturesque and sublime scenery. Although Shelley dedicated Rambles to Rogers, her preface acknowledged the influence of Lady Morgan, whose travel work, Italy (1821), had been vocal in its criticism of Austria's rule over Italy and had been placed on the papal list of prohibited books. To make her politics more palatable to her audience, however, Shelley often uses analyses of literature and art to reiforce her points.|$|E
