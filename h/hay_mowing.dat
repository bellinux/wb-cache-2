5000|$|A {{great number}} of {{haymaking}} songs have been recorded in Lithuania. They are also subcategorized into <b>hay</b> <b>mowing</b> and raking songs. Many songs combine both topics. Hay raking songs are more melancholy than the mowing songs, and they often contain imagery about an orphan girl. Other songs describe all of the tasks associated with haymaking, beginning with the mowing and ending with the feeding of the hay to the animals. Haymaking songs often personify a clover or other beautifully blossoming flower, and often contain references to love. Young peoples' feelings are expressed through {{the images of the}} haymaking process. For example, the song [...] "Ein bernelis per lankelę" [...] (There goes a lad through the field) tells of a brother working in the field with a steel scythe. He plans to mow the clover and adorn his hat with it before enticing the young maiden. In contrast to these love songs are songs focusing on the topic of war. They ruefully sing of the brother who must go off to the great war. Many songs tell off the rounding up of recruits, which shows that these songs are from {{the first half of the}} 19th century.|$|E
40|$|Conventional water {{management}} in the Crau plain needs to be modified to ensure higher irrigation efficiency, better crop production and quality, and reduced environmental impacts. Because experimental approaches to test modifications of {{water management}} are difficult in relation to border irrigation, simulation may provide an alternative. We describe {{the development of a}} conceptual model of the decision-making process that determines the irrigation management of a cropping system, on which a simulation model is to be based. Interviews focused on water management were carried out, to understand how farmers manage their irrigation and how their decisions determine the technical system applied on the farm. These interviews were then analyzed using the "model for action" concept, to generate a conceptual model of the decision system, which is organized as a sequence of decision rules describing irrigation management. This model contains five elements: (1) spatial and temporal factors relevant to decision-making in terms of irrigation and hay cropping; (2) no interaction between the grassland cropping system and the sheep rearing system; (3) five rules to describe irrigation {{management in the}} cropping system; (4) major water distribution constraints; and (5) two inter-related operations, <b>hay</b> <b>mowing</b> and irrigation. The rules for irrigation decision-making are written as: "If Then Else ". This conceptual model was used as the basis of a decision support system that includes models of grass growth and hydrology. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlnus glutinosa (alder) swamp {{woodlands}} are {{in danger}} of disappearing in Europe and, in Norway, several habitats with alder are threatened. Knowledge about the dynamics of alder swamp woodlands is crucial for the conservation and management of this vegetation. Our studied site, Rambjøra, in western Norway encompasses the Rambjøra Landscape Protected Area. We combined information from three sources—recent alder swamp woodland ecology, vegetation history, and agricultural history—to reveal the long-term vegetation dynamics of Rambjøra in relation to land-use. Dynamic changes in the predominance of forest or semi-natural grassland over 2800 years, concurrent with varying anthropogenic disturbances are inferred. At the investigated site, alder swamp woodland developed after forest clearance and changes in the water balance. The abundance of alder swamp woodlands have varied through time, increasing with low-impact land-use and declining with intensified use or abandonment. The highest biodiversity is found in periods with grazing, <b>hay</b> <b>mowing,</b> and probably fodder and fire wood collection. This indicates that agricultural practices of moderate intensity (grazing and hay cutting) {{should be part of the}} future management in order to maintain the biodiversity and meet the objective of the protection of Rambjøra. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining vegetation surveys, pollen records, and land-use history to provide a long-term perspective on vegetation development, and in our case also as an aid when establishing conservation strategies. Our findings need to be considered in future conservation and restoration of ecosystems with alder swamp woodlands...|$|E

In 1910, he was seriously injured when he fell from a <b>hay</b> <b>mow,</b> breaking his collarbone. The injury deprived Baldwin of the full use of his right arm, and he underwent surgery at the University of Michigan Hospital to correct the problem.

5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same <b>hay</b> <b>mow,</b> and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|R

Orenburg {{was chosen as the}} starting point since this was the main base and had connections to the Russian heartland. Additional supplies would be taken by sea to Novo Alexandrovsk and carried east to the main column. 7750 Bashkir carts were mobilized to haul supplies to Orenburg. 10400 camels and 2000 camel drivers were requisitioned from the Kazakhs. This required military force in the case of one tribe. In June Colonel Heke went south with two companies and 1200 carts to explore the route and establish advanced depots. He reached the Emba River on 30 June and sent a smaller group forward to establish the next depot. The Ak Bulak River 100 miles south was chosen and a fort was built there in August. A large amount of <b>hay</b> was <b>mown</b> and reeds and willows were collected for fuel. For 40 kilometers north of Ak Bulak there were salt marshes with no adequate water or grass. By September a fort had been built on the Emba and <b>hay</b> <b>mown.</b> Fort Emba had a garrison of 634 men and Ak Bulak 399. The forts were unhealthy and by December 93 men had died.

Bert Leedy contacted C. V. Kindig and Sons. The Kindigs were responsible for most of Fulton County's round barns. The foundation and lower level walls of concrete were poured in just three days. When completed, the lower level sheltered eight horses, thirty sheep, eight cows, eight calves and eight feeder steers. The upper level <b>hay</b> <b>mow</b> accommodated fifty to sixty loads of hay and ten to twelve loads of straw plus a wheat bin with a capacity of thirty bushels.|$|R

40|$|Maintaining and re-creating species-rich {{semi-natural}} grasslands {{are important}} issues in current agricultural policy in Europe. The seed {{that is required}} for their establishment can be obtained through direct harvesting from semi-natural herbaceous vegetation. To test the efficiency of mechanical seed harvesting on donor Arrhenatherion elatioris grasslands, experiments were performed in northern Italy and eastern Czech Republic. Trials were organized with a randomized block design and involved harvesting as green <b>hay</b> (grass <b>mowing</b> and immediate collection), dry <b>hay</b> (grass <b>mowing</b> and collection after drying on the field), direct combining (grass cutting and threshing at the same combine passage) and seed stripping with pull-type equipment (seed removal without grass cutting with a brush harvester pulled by a tractor). Harvesting was carried out {{at the time of}} maximum ripe standing seed yield (SSY) in the first and second regrowth. The harvested materials were analysed for seed number and weight and compared with the SSY. The species composition and phenology were also surveyed. In all methods, the seed mixture obtained contained the species present as seed at harvest time and was correlated with SSY. However, with regard to the seed number collected, the harvesting efficiency changed in relation to species group (grasses or forbs), individual species, seed maturation and regrowth. The most efficient method was harvesting as green hay (efficiency of approximately 71...|$|R

50|$|Jan and Annetje (Ackerman) Zabriskie {{purchased}} the Johannes Ackerman mill and farm in September 1745, shortly after {{construction of the}} first draw-bridge at the narrows of the Hackensack River. This wooden span was called New Bridge to distinguish it from an older crossing several miles upstream. In 1752, Jan Zabriskie built the oldest part of the Steuben House. Its walls were built with blocks of sandstone cut from the Kinderkamack Ridge - dressed stone on {{the two sides of}} the building facing the roadway and coursed rubble on the other sides. The front door opened into a center-hall. The Zabriskie family grew wealthy from increased trade brought on by the French and Indian War (1756-1763) and doubled the size of their dwelling about 1765, increasing it from five to twelve rooms, warmed by seven fireplaces, and covering it with a fashionable gambrel roof. The gambrel roof has four slopes instead of two, providing more headroom and storage space in the garret (for this reason, many barns used a gambrel roof to increase the size of the <b>hay</b> <b>mow).</b> The Jersey Dutch also adopted the gambrel roof to span the depth of a house that was one-and-a-half to two rooms deep. New Bridge Landing was the business center of the upper Hackensack Valley - the shopping mall of its day. Iron made in stone furnaces along the Ramapo Mountains was carried in ox-carts to New Bridge Landing where it was loaded onto sloops, some as large as 50 ton, for shipment to market. Flour and animal feed was shipped from the mill. All kinds of wares came in from boats returning from the city. This location had an added advantage: because of the wide Hackensack Meadowlands downstream, New Bridge remained the nearest river crossing to Newark Bay until 1790. Overland traffic including farm wagons and stage coaches, going to and from New York City, crossed the river at this spot on their way into the interior parts of the country.|$|R
