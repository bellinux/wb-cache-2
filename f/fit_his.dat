5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} did not <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> {{vision of the}} 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|One of Chapman's first {{decisions}} was {{to bring}} in Sunderland striker Charlie Buchan, recognising Arsenal's lack of goal threat. Arsenal finished second in Chapman's first season, a marked improvement on previous seasons, though finished no higher as the 1920s drew to a close. Chapman continued to reshape his team and buy players to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> desired system. He led Arsenal to their first major trophy, as they beat his former side Huddersfield Town 2–0 in the 1930 FA Cup Final. The team continued to mature and won the 1930–31 First Division title, scoring 127 goals in the process. Chapman won another championship in 1932–33, after Arsenal ended the previous season as league and 1932 FA Cup runners-up.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a {{lap time}} within 107% of the fastest time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} race stewards to be allowed to the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> car with a fifth heat motor generator unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element, Button was later handed ten-place and five-place grid penalties. As he was already due to start {{from the back of the}} grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Khan required five costumes, {{more than any}} other guest star in the entire series. This meant that the staff working on costumes had less time to devote to any one costume. Montalbán's athletic physique was such that when his measurements were passed to them, staff thought there had been a mistake. Costume designer William Ware Theiss found it challenging to produce the outfits in the time allotted, to make the materials seem suitably futuristic and to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> own preferences in design. Two of Khan's outfits re-used previous costumes, while three were specifically created for Montalbán. The production built two new sets for the episode: the decompression chamber in sickbay, and the set on board Botany Bay. A doorframe from that set was later reused as an overhead unit in McCoy's research lab, which appeared later in the series.|$|E

5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
5|$|On lap thirty-one, Buemi {{tried to}} pass Glock on the outside heading into turn three but lost control of his car under braking and rammed {{into the side of}} Glock. Buemi {{sustained}} a broken left, front suspension and front wing damage, causing him to retire. The incident called for the race's third safety car period. During the safety car deployment, most of the drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres. Alonso, who was called in by Ferrari when Vettel changed his strategy, had a pit stop that proved problematic. He arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres. One of his mechanics could not <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut; he was required to fit a spare wheel nut onto the tyre, causing Alonso to be stationary for longer than usual. He lost third place to Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

25|$|White House staffers {{exchanged}} email {{with religious}} advisors about biblical passages, settling on the Book of Job and Psalms 46.

25|$|Holden {{continued}} for thirteen years to <b>fit</b> <b>his</b> engines with stovepipe chimneys, {{and also with}} Thomas Worsdell's capacious cab, with its gracefully curved side-sheets. Although for a time he continued with the Worsdell three-ring boiler barrel, with the dome on the middle ring, before long he designed a two-ring boiler with the dome on the front ring, immediately behind the chimney. He substituted Stephenson link-motion for the Joy valve gear preferred by Worsdell.|$|E
