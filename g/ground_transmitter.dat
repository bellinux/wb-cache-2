40|$|A {{diagnostic}} technique {{to obtain the}} cold-plasma density profile in the magnetosphere is introduced. This method uses satellite measurements of group delay and pulse duration of VLF signals from <b>ground</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{in conjunction with a}} detailed ray-tracing analysis. An iterative method is involved which starts with an approximate density profile, computes the ray paths for that profile, and then compares the properties of the rays that reach the satellite location with the actual satellite measurements. The density profile is then modified to account for any discrepancies between the two results. The same process is repeated with the new profile until one has reasonable agreement between the data and ray-tracing results. This method is applied to the case of an Imp 6 pass, where strong signals from the Siple VLF transmitter were observed for over 25 min. Good agreement is found between the results of the proposed technique and the well-known ground whistler techniques of cold-plasma diagnostics. The results also serve to illustrate the wide diversity of propagation paths from <b>ground</b> <b>transmitters</b> to high-altitude satellites during VLF wave-injection experiments...|$|R

50|$|A {{conceptual}} breakthrough of Jacob and Monod was {{to recognize}} the distinction between regulatory substances and sites where they act to change gene expression. A former soldier, Jacob used the analogy of a bomber that would release its lethal cargo upon receipt of a special radio transmission or signal. A working system requires both a <b>ground</b> <b>transmitter</b> and a receiver in the airplane. Now, suppose that the usual transmitter is broken. This system {{can be made to}} work by introduction of a second, functional transmitter. In contrast, he said, consider a bomber with a defective receiver.

50|$|The ODOP {{system is}} a radar {{interferometer}} tracking system which determines {{the position of a}} vehicle-borne transponder. The <b>ground</b> <b>transmitter</b> radiates a CW signal of 890 MHz to the transponder in the vehicle. The transponder shifts the received signal in frequency by 70 MHz and retransmits it to the receiving stations (R1, R2, R3). The signal from the transponder received at the ground stations contains a 2-way Doppler shift fD which is extracted by mixing the received signal (fi = 960 MHz + fD) with the reference frequency (fR = 960 MHz) derived from the transmitter frequency. Actually, a reference frequency of 53.33 MHz is transmitted over a VHF link to each transmitter station and then multiplied by a factor of 18, yielding 959.94 MHz. When this frequency is combined with the signal received from the transponder, the Doppler shift is obtained with a 60 kHz bias frequency (60 kHz + fD). The UDOP system used a transmitter frequency of 450 MHz which was doubled in the transponder (900 MHz). The higher frequency in the ODOP system (890 MHz versus 450 MHz) is less affected by the ionosphere and the result is increased tracking accuracy.|$|E
