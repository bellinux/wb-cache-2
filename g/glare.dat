5|$|Since Voyager 2s fly-by, the {{brightest}} rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above background noise levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths {{in which the}} <b>glare</b> from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter rings are still far below the visibility threshold.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's <b>glare,</b> is often not visible to telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{impression}} of space within the cockpit {{area and the}} great degree of visual sighting afforded by the Plexiglas panelling were regarded as positive factors, with one important provision in relation to weather conditions. Should either bright sunshine or rainstorms be encountered, the pilot's visibility could be dangerously compromised either by <b>glare</b> throwback or lack of good sighting.|$|E

5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much more difficult to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's <b>glare</b> much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight made it impossible to film. To reduce <b>glare</b> from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|But if {{you were}} here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis.

5|$|Craters of the Moon Campground has 51 sites– none {{of which}} can be {{reserved}} in advance. Camping facilities are basic but do include water, restrooms, charcoal grills, and trash containers. National Park Service rangers present evening programs at the campground amphitheater in the summer. Camping enables visitors to enjoy the park during the evening and morning, when the heat, <b>glare</b> and wind are far less.|$|E
5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense <b>glare</b> during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} <b>glare</b> {{of celebrity}} and the tribulations {{of the season}} forced Bradman to reappraise his life outside the game and to seek a career away from his cricketing fame. Harry Hodgetts, a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control, offered Bradman work as a stockbroker if he would relocate to Adelaide and captain South Australia (SA). Unknown to the public, the SA Cricket Association (SACA) instigated Hodgetts' approach and subsidised Bradman's wage. Although his wife was hesitant about moving, Bradman eventually agreed to the deal in February 1934.|$|E

Workers took down the clock mechanism and clock face, leaving a gaping hole, and then proceeded to lift the clock tower off in one piece. After the protesters had been dispersed, the remainder of the pier was completely dismantled, away from the <b>glare</b> of publicity.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, would be {{difficult}} to detect due to the strong <b>glare</b> of the nearby Sun, and ground-based searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and <b>glare</b> from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|E

5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's <b>glare.</b> At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E
5|$|The first Pe-3s {{were issued}} to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Regiment in the Moscow Military District and the Regiment's {{experiences}} with the aircraft revealed other problems. Firing the guns at night dazzled the pilot and destroyed his night vision and the <b>glare</b> from searchlights through the glazing on the lower nose also blinded the pilot. Crews complained bitterly {{that the lack of}} frontal armor made them vulnerable to defensive fire from German bombers. Flash hiders installed on the guns and curtains covering the windows cured the first problems, but the lack of armor could not be rectified immediately. Many aircraft were also fitted with launchers for four to six RS-82 and RS-132 rockets for ground-attack missions. Another common addition was a launcher for DAG-10 aerial grenades mounted in the tail.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun's <b>glare,</b> a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E

5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected <b>glare</b> of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's <b>glare</b> for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|Some herons, such as {{the black}} heron, adopt an unusual {{position}} while hunting for prey. With their head held down in a hunting position, they sweep their wings forward to meet {{in front of their}} head, thereby forming an umbrella shaped canopy. The primaries and secondaries touch the water, the nape feathers are erected and the tail is drooped, thereby ensuring the canopy is totally enclosed. The bird may take several strides in this position. One theory about the function of this behaviour is that it reduces <b>glare</b> from the water surface, allowing the bird to more easily locate and catch prey. Alternatively, the shade provided by the canopy may attract fish making their capture easier. Some herons adopt a similar behaviour called double-wing feeding in which the wings are swept forward to create an area of shade, though a canopy is not formed.|$|E
