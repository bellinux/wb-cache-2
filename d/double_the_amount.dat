5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} generally favorable reviews, with reviewers liking the story, writing, character designs and music, {{but with some}} criticizing the lack of new gameplay mechanics. Additionally, the Wii version was criticized for using resized graphics from the Nintendo DS version, without any modifications to make them appear better on a larger screen. The Nintendo DS version was a commercial success in North America, with pre-orders being more than <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> Capcom had estimated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the demand}} of the sultan, Transylvania troops {{assisted}} Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia. The sultan also ordered Sigismund to pay <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of the yearly tribute. Balthasar Báthory murdered Sigismund's secretary, Pál Gyulai, on 10December 1592. He also persuaded Sigismund {{to order the}} execution of Gálffy on 8March 1593. That summer, Sigismund went to Kraków in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland. The Holy See had proposed the marriage, which could have enabled Sigismund to rule Poland during {{the absence of the}} king, who was also King of Sweden, but the plan came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to {{some people}} who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{has been}} {{described}} as entertaining, controversial, and politically incorrect. He supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama's appeal to white voters. Ford later apologized for his comments, stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past. Ford's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green. In the beginning of his campaign, Green managed to raise <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of campaign funds Ford raised, and although Ford's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity, because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home. Green was defeated in the primary election by a wide margin. Ford praised Obama's election in November 2008, but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's family for allegedly attempting to profit off Obama's victory.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{scene was}} {{performed}} live; {{because of the}} increased budget — £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> spent on The Quatermass Experiment — Cartier was able to include {{a larger proportion of}} pre-filmed inserts on 35mm film, which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location at the Shell Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.|$|E
5|$|Romney raised $56million during 2011, {{more than}} <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> raised {{by any of}} his Republican opponents, and refrained from {{spending}} his own money on the campaign. He initially pursued a low-key, low-profile strategy. Michele Bachmann staged a brief surge in polls, which preceded a poll surge in September 2011 by Rick Perry who had entered the race the month before. Perry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates. The October 2011 decisions of Chris Christie and Sarah Palin not to run effectively settled the field of candidates. Perry faded after poor performances in those debates, while Herman Cain's 'long-shot' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it.|$|E

5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> needed.|$|E
5|$|Woo {{had over}} 90 days to shoot The Killer which was nearly <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> {{of time that}} the average Hong Kong film {{was shot in the}} late 1980s. Woo went into filming with only a short {{treatment}} for the film and wrote the details of the script while filming. During promotion periods for the film, Woo described the film as a tribute to Martin Scorsese and French director Jean-Pierre Melville. Woo cites Melville's Le Samouraï as an influence on the story. Woo borrows plot elements for the film, including the set-up where Jef enters a nightclub and looks at the female singer. Woo also described the influence of a Japanese film, Narazumono, about a killer (Ken Takakura) who only kills delinquents. When a mob tricks him into killing an innocent person, he swears revenge but then meets a woman who has tuberculosis and wants to go home. The killer promises the woman that he will take her home after getting his revenge.|$|E

25|$|For the {{cantilevered}} floors, Wright and {{his team}} used upside-down T-shaped beams integrated into a monolithic concrete slab which formed both {{the ceiling of the}} space below and provided resistance against compression. The contractor, Walter Hall, also an engineer, produced independent computations and argued for increasing the reinforcing steel in the first floor’s slab. Wright refused the suggestion. While some sources state that <b>the</b> contractor quietly <b>doubled</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of reinforcement, others say that Kaufman's consulting engineers – at Kaufman's request – redrew Wright's reinforcing drawings and <b>doubled</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of steel specified by Wright.|$|R

25|$|Although LPG-powered {{vehicles}} {{are supposed to}} be relatively non-polluting, and do indeed reduce roadside pollution, a 2007 study by Polytechnic University indicated that older LPG taxis emitted at least <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons compared to diesel.

25|$|Oral {{doses of}} heavy {{water in the}} range of several grams, as well as heavy oxygen 18O, are {{routinely}} used in human metabolic experiments. See doubly labeled water testing. Since one in about every 6,400 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, a 50kg human containing 32kg of body water would normally contain enough deuterium (about 1.1g) to make 5.5g of pure heavy water, so roughly this dose is required to <b>double</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of deuterium in the body.|$|E
