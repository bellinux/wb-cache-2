5|$|After marriage, Boyanus had {{to return}} to the Soviet Union for eight years, while Armstrong <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> England.

She was able to visit Boyanus in Leningrad on two occasions, {{and he was able to}} briefly return to London in 1928. Boyanus was finally able to permanently move to England in January 1934, whereupon he became a lecturer in Russian and Phonetics at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London. While working at University College, Armstrong lived in Forest Gate and Church End, Finchley.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

5|$|The Moreno {{family was}} poor, but {{could afford a}} house and some slaves. Ana María Valle y Ramos, Mariano's mother, {{was one of the}} few literate women in Buenos Aires. Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of {{fourteen}} children. Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend Tomás Guido once the family raised the money. The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack; he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> bed for fifteen days on arrival. He had further attacks years later. Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city, after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith's house. Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's father did not authorize a change. Moreno studied laws all the same, and married María in secret to avoid family resistance. They had a single son, named Mariano like the father.|$|E

25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the Lombards in the migration period, from about 700 AD Lüneburg Heath belonged to the Duchy of Saxony, which was conquered by Charlemagne in the 9th century and became part of the Frankish Empire. The resulting close control of the population and the Christianization meant that the rural settlements <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> one place and could no longer move about freely. The land had to be farmed more intensively which led to the heathland spreading.|$|E

At Wigan, he visited many homes to see how people lived, took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned, went down Bryn Hall coal mine, and used the local public library to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{began with}} {{artillery}} fire and cavalry clashes. About 7 a.m., Markow wanted {{to begin to}} attack but changed his orders {{when he saw that}} Polish formations under Poniatowski had moved onto the battle field. Poniatowski forces included two infantry battalions, a cavalry regiment of front guard from Prince Józef Lubomirski, Brigade National Cavalry under command of Stanisław Mokronowski, a division under command of General Wielhorski, and 12 cannons. Kościuszko with his division <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the rear in order to prevent an attack from Levanidov and Dunin corps. Poniatowski sent the Mokronowski brigade on right wing. He backed the artillery. The battalion of infantry regiment of Potocki was in reserve. The division of Wielhorski took position within the forest as second throw.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the proconsul M. Livius {{moved from}} Etruria into Cisalpine Gaul and {{joined forces with}} the Roman {{commander}} there, Sp. Lucretius, blocking Mago’s way to Rome. However, Livius remained on the defensive. Nothing changed dramatically {{in the following year}} (204 BC). Mago remained inactive for the said reasons, the Romans - because of the physical and moral exhaustion from the long war. They were preoccupied with problems such as forcing the Latin colonies, which had refused to provide any more money and soldiers several years before, to do their duty. This facilitated the recruitment of new troops. One of the new consuls, P. Sempronius Tuditanus, was sent against Hannibal in Bruttium. The other, M. Cornelius Cethegus, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Etruria and sever the conspiracy that Mago had formed with a number of rebellious Etrurian towns.|$|E

But Chibnall planned to bring Joe back, and include a major plot twist involving him. As late as January 5, his participation in series two remained unconfirmed. To keep Gravelle's presence a secret, he had to wear glasses and a wig and wear a hoodie while filming on location so that the public and press would not recognise him and link him to the programme. Gravelle also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> a different hotel {{from the rest of the}} cast, and could not socialise with them after filming ended each day.|$|E

The oldest of three sisters, {{including}} Danielle and Elizabeth, she moved with her family to Waldorf, Maryland, soon after her birth. Milian was four years old when she showed an interest in show business, and when her family realized that she was a talented actress, she became determined to pursue an entertainment career. As a child, Milian was [...] "very imaginative and very creative", and watching television and listening to the radio became her life. They inspired her to have fun, and she convinced her parents that she [...] "did not want to be inside the TV", although it took some time to convince them. By the time she was nine years old, Milian had begun auditioning with local talent agencies, shot commercials for Wendy's and Honeycomb, and played the lead role in the musical Annie. Milian's mother noticed her daughter's potential and left her husband and moved to Los Angeles with her three daughters when Milian was 13 years old.

500|$|The heavy {{snowfall}} across Nepal produced landslides and avalanches, {{mostly on}} November10 {{and into the}} following day. Near Gokyo, two avalanches combined and destroyed a lodge housing 25mountain climbers, killing all but one; the survivor was rescued after being trapped for 40hours. The hikers were climbing Gokyo Ri, a mountain [...] southeast of Mount Everest. This marked the deadliest avalanche in Nepal to affect a hiking expedition. Another avalanche killed seven people in Kangchenjunga. With levels reaching {{as high as the}} roofs of houses, the heavy snowfall damaged the roofs of several buildings, including one school, and killed about 100animals. Across the country, the storm killed 63people, 33 of them related to avalanches, including 22foreigners, although the Trekking Workers' Association believed the death toll was higher. Several of the deaths were the result of collapsed houses, while others were the result of people freezing to death. The Mani Rimdu festival likely prevented additional deaths, as over 1,000residents in the hardest hit areas left for the ceremony. After the snowfall, the Nepal government coordinated the largest search and rescue mission in the country's history, utilizing helicopters to rescue 450stranded people, encompassing an area of , before the mission was ended on November15. Several of the rescued people required medical attention. Stranded victims <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the snow for {{a day and a half}} before being spotted and rescued, and inclement weather disrupted efforts.|$|E

[...] After World War II ended, Brooks declined to move back to Paris with Barney, saying she wanted to [...] "get back to [...] painting and painter's life", but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war.

[...] She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry."
