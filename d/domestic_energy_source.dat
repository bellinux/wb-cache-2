Turkish government set targets to fully utilize coal reserves of the country in next decades. However, the country is also in the process of becoming an EU Member State, hence, it is expected that the energy policies have to comply with the EU. Moreover, Turkey ratified Kyoto Protocol in 2009, thus the country should limit CO 2 emission together with other greenhouse gases. The probable obstacles that Turkey may face due to the utilization of coal were determined as CO 2 emissions, lack of technology and application in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and health and safety issues. It is concluded that coal is a very important <b>domestic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> for Turkey but new policies have to be developed and adopted immediately, and more realistic targets for the country should be set accordingly.

Energy poverty in the {{majority}} of the rural households in Kenya is a threat to economic and social development; hence the availability of an affordable and reliable <b>domestic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> is important. This study investigated: the potential resources for biogas for cooking, suitable anaerobic digesters that could be deployed in rural households, and also the viability of a small community biogas business model. Conservative estimates of the business model parameters and sensitivity analysis revealed that there was adequate biogas potential in central and western Kenya while water scarcity affected other regions’ opportunities. Cattle manure was the predominant feedstock, although crop waste has possibilities to contribute to biogas production. Economically and technically, the inflatable tubular digester was found to be the most suitable type for biogas production in rural Kenya. Discounted cash flow analysis of the business model proved a profitable business to supply an affordable household energy at 0. 55 €/Kg of biogas, with projected household savings of 249 € annually. Labor cost was found to have high significance on the feasibility of the business model which was also sensitive to changes in biogas revenues.

40|$|Utah {{is home to}} {{oil shale}} {{resources}} containing roughly 1. 3 trillion barrels of oil equivalent and our nation’s richest oil sands resources. If economically feasible and environmentally responsible means of tapping these resources can be developed, these resources could provide a safe and stable <b>domestic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> for decades to come. In Utah, oil shale and oil sands resources underlay a patchwork of federal, state, private, and tribal lands that are subject to different regulatory schemes and conflicting management objectives. Evaluating the development potential of Utah’s oil shale and oil sands resources requires an understanding of jurisdictional issues and the challenges they present to deployment and efficient utilization of emerging technologies. The jurisdictional patchwork and divergent management requirements inhibit efficient, economic, and environmentally sustainable development. This report examines these barriers to resource development, methods of obtaining access to landlocked resources, and options for consolidating resource ownership. This report also examines recent legislative efforts to wrest control of western public lands from the federal government. If successful, these efforts could dramatically reshape resource control and access, though these efforts appear to fall far short of their stated goals. The unintended consequences of adversarial approaches to obtaining resource access may outweigh their benefits, hardening positions and increasing tensions {{to the detriment of}} overall coordination between resource managers. Federal land exchanges represent a more efficient and mutually beneficial means of consolidating management control and improving management efficiency.

40|$|Interest in {{the concept}} of {{environmental}} security emerged forcefully in the Brundtland Report in 1987, and increased at the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Ten years later, the nexus between environment, development and security was never stronger than at the recent ‘Earth Summit Plus Ten’ in Johannesburg in 2002. The notion of environmental security, however, is hotly contested. Its most common variation is concerned with the impact of environmental stress on societies, which may lead to situations of war within and between societies. Usually, environmental security issues cross nationstate boundaries, and provide an ideal vehicle for the discussion of regional frameworks. This paper critically examines the concept of environmental security within the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). It then introduces one urgent environmental security issue – the production, treatment, transport and storage of nuclear waste – {{within the context of the}} IOR. Whilst many parts of the more affluent world are moving away from nuclear power as an industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is rapidly increasing its nuclear energy profile. Most often, this increase in nuclear profile is evidenced in discourses linked to the nuclear proliferation of weaponry. Because of the IOR’s informal status as ‘Ocean of the South’, the environmental security focus on nuclear power has not been sufficiently explored, as the possibilities of nuclear accidents - whether in mining, power generation, reprocessing, transport or storage - are seen as risks that those ‘less affluent’ are expected to take. With the IOR’s increased nuclear profile, it is critical that environmental security concerns are included alongside the 3 more traditional security concerns of weapons proliferation and possible nuclear war...|$|E
40|$|Many {{households}} {{in developing countries}} rely on biomass (wood, charcoal, agricultural wastes, sawdust, and animal dung) and coal to meet their energy needs. The burning of these fuels in open fires creates environmental problems {{one of which is}} indoor air pollution (IAP). For effective reduction of indoor air pollution in sub-Saharan Africa, it is therefore, important to understand factors that determine the choice and uptake of cleaner fuels for household energy use. This research investigates the salient factors influencing {{households in}} developing countries in choosing fuel types, using the households in peri-urban areas of Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria as a case study. This research used holistic approaches to understand energy issues in the study area and used methods such as questionnaires, interviews, and field observation during data collection. Key findings suggest that underlying socio-cultural contexts of households’ ethnic groups guided wood-fuel harvesting in the peri-urban areas of Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria. Wood fuel continues to be households’ main <b>domestic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> irrespective of their socio-economic status. The open burning of wood fuel causes indoor air pollution as the recorded 24 -hour particulate matter levels was between 42 µg/m 3 – 275 µg/m 3 for indoor kitchens and 48 µg/m 3 – 648 µg/m 3 for outdoor kitchens. The cultural perception of the households that natural aeration blows particulates into buildings hinders them from believing that the open of burning of biomass fuels for domestic activities is the cause of indoor air pollution. Based on the findings of this study, it is argued that the traditional norms and values of the householders, being embedded in their socio-cultural contexts, are vital for understanding energy issues in the global South...|$|E
