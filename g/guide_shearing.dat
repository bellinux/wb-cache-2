A recent theoretical prediction that the phase velocity mass sensitivity of <b>guided</b> <b>shear</b> horizontal {{surface acoustic wave}} devices can be obtained using measurements of phase and group velocity, and that the group velocity is highly sensitive to mass loading, is investigated. Experimental data for a polymer-coated surface-skimming bulk wave device on an ST quartz substrate is presented. Measurements of phase velocity, group velocity, and insertion loss determined by a network analyzer were obtained by systematically increasing the guiding layer thickness. Liquid sensing using poly (ethylene glycol) solutions with increasing densities were performed and phase and group velocities measured.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to explore {{technology}} related {{to the design of}} field-portable, real-time sensors for detection of hazardous compounds in liquid environments [...] specifically the design and function of chemically sensitive polymers as coating materials for <b>guided</b> <b>shear</b> horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensor devices in liquid phase detection. Through fundamental investigation of the interactions of polymer coatings with model analytes, and the effects of physical properties of coating materials on sensor response, insight is gained which may be applied toward the development or selection of coatings that target specific toxins or classes of toxins. Attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used for the investigation of sorption of aqueous solutions of analytes into polymer coatings. A series of simple model polymers: poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), poly(epichlorhydrin) (PECH), and poly(isobutylene) (PIB) films and analytes: aqueous solutions of ethylbenzene, xylenes, toluene, and nitrobenzene were used to evaluate the use of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy as a screening tool for sensor development. The ratios of integrated infrared absorption bands provided a simple and efficient method for predicting trends in partition coefficients. Responses of polymer-coated <b>guided</b> <b>shear</b> horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensor platforms to the series of analytes, using polymer coatings with similar viscoelastic properties, were consistent with ATR-FTIR predictions. Guided SH-SAW sensor responses were linear in all cases with respect to analyte concentration in the tested range. Comparison of ATR-FTIR data with guided SH-SAW sensor data identifies cases where mass loading is not the dominant contribution to the response of the acoustic wave sensor. Changes in polymer viscoelasticity, estimated from the loss of the guided SH-SAW signals, were used to theoretically assess the overall contribution of mass and modulus changes to PIB-coated devices. The theoretical predictions show excellent agreement with the experimental sensor response. ATR-FTIR and UV-Visible spectroscopy were used to investigate the effect of the local environment on the spectral changes of nitrobenzene, 4 -nitrophenol, and 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene. These methods, coupled with computational chemistry, provided additional insight into analyte/polymer interactions...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} the mass {{sensitivity}} of Love wave and layer <b>guided</b> <b>shear</b> horizontal acoustic plate mode (SH-APM) sensors is developed by considering the propagation of shear horizontally polarized acoustic waves in a three layer system. A dispersion equation is derived for this three layer system and this is shown to contain the dispersion equation for the two layer system of the substrate and the guiding layer plus a term involving the third layer, which {{is regarded as a}} perturbing mass layer. This equation is valid for an arbitrary thickness perturbing mass layer. The perturbation, ∆v, of the wave speed for the two-layer system by a thin third layer of density, ρp and thickness ∆h is shown to be equal to the mass per unit area multiplied by a function dependent only on the properties of the substrate and the guiding layer, and the operating frequency of the sensor. The independence of the function from the properties of the third layer means that the mass sensitivity of the bare, two-layer, sensor operated about any thickness of the guiding layer can be deduced from the slope of the numerically or experimentally determined dispersion curve. Formulae are also derived for a Love wave on an infinite thickness substrate describing the change in mass sensitivity due to a change in frequency. The consequences of the various formulae for mass sensing applications are illustrated using numerical calculations with parameters describing a (rigid) PMM...|$|R
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} {{propagating}} waves physically admissible in a tubular section are derived {{to establish their}} dispersion characteristics {{in response to the}} presence of multi-layered viscoelastic coatings. One is the longitudinal wave that propagates in the axial direction. The other two are shear and longitudinal waves along the circumferential direction. To characterize the hollow cylinder with coating layers, wave dispersion and attenuation are studied using the ?global matrix? technique. Since each layer is considered to be perfectly bonded to each other, displacement and strain continuity are imposed as the interfacial boundary conditions. Viscoelastic coating materials such as bitumen and epoxy serve to improve pipeline reliability, but they also dampen and dissipate wave energy. The viscoelastic materials are studied as well. By replacing the real material constants with complex material constants in the characteristic equation, the impact of the viscoelastic coatings on wave dispersion is established. Bisection method is followed to find the real and complex roots of the three characteristic equations derived. Roots thus obtained are manipulated to allow the phase velocity and attenuation dispersion to be plotted against frequency. The dispersion of phase velocity and wave attenuation for coated pipes are evaluated against a baseline model which is the bare, uncoated tubing to establish the propagation characteristics of the <b>guided</b> <b>shear</b> and longitudinal waves in the presence of multiple coating layers.

The physico-chemical characterizations of the multi-layer systems were done by ellipsometry, wettability studies, UV–visible spectroscopy and XPS and shown that the grafting of the molecule is achieved through the preparation of nanometric films. The acoustic properties of the devices were mainly related to the nanometric thickness of the layers, which proved chemisorption of APTES was an efficient method to prepare a chemical acoustic sensor.

40|$|Organophosphate {{pesticides}} (OPs) {{have been}} found as contaminants in surface and ground waters, soil, and agricultural products. Because OPs are toxic compounds, rapid detection/monitoring of OPs in groundwater is necessary to allow for real-time remediation. Detection of OPs in water has already been demonstrated using poly(epichlorohydrin) [PECH] and polyurethane as the sensing layers. However, the response times were relatively long, hindering real-time monitoring. In this work, a hybrid organic/inorganic chemically sensitive layer [bisphenol A-hexamethyltrisiloxane (BPA-HMTS) ] that shows {{a high degree of}} partial selectivity for OPs is synthesized, characterized (in terms of the glass transition temperature, Tg, water stability, sensitivity, selectivity, detection limit, and absorption/response time) for the rapid detection of organophosphate pesticides. Direct chemical sensing in aqueous solutions is performed using <b>guided</b> <b>shear</b> horizontal surface acoustic wave sensor platforms on 36 ° rotated Y-cut LiTaO 3 and 42. 75 ° rotated Y-cut Quartz, respectively. It is shown that, for the same coating thickness, a 60 % reduction in sensor response time is achieved without reduction in sensitivity compared to PECH. Considering the Tg, for the polymers, it is seen that the faster response shown by BPA-HMTS is due to the porous siloxane backbone, HMTS. Kinetic studies for the absorption of OPs (parathion-methyl, parathion, and paraoxon) from aqueous solutions into the BPA-HMTS coating are conducted. The data are analyzed within the context of two absorption models: penetration-limited and diffusion-limited absorptions. It is shown that the absorption process is rate limited by penetration with a concentration independent absorption time constant or mass transfer coefficient. The absorption time constants for parathion-methyl, parathion, and paraoxon are calculated. A limit of detection of 60, 20 and 100 μg/L (ppb) for parathion-methyl, parathion, and paraoxon, respectively, is calculated for the present non-optimized sensor. Concentrations as low as 500 μg/L (ppb) parathion are actually measured. This is much lower than the typical concentrations found on agricultural produce (≥ 10 ppm). Furthermore, sensor signal analysis {{in the form of the}} extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed on-line during the detection process. The sensor response was first represented by a state-space model which includes all relevant contributions to the polymer-coated device response. This allows for the steady-state response and absorption time constant to be extracted on-line well before the steady-state is reached, thus further reducing the time for analyte identification and quantification. It is noted the absorption time constant, often unique to a class of analyte-coating pairs, can be used to improve analyte recognition...|$|R

Thus the development of high sensitivity, cost effective, real-time and portable biosensors is of primary importance. This thesis presents {{the development of a}} ZnO/SiOsub 2 /Si based CMOS compatible biosensor, for the real-time detection of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). In this work, high quality ZnO films were grown on SiOsub 2 /Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition. A protein immobilization procedure for binding the IL- 6 protein to the ZnO active area was developed and the morphology of the bio-molecules was studied using SEM and AFM techniques for the first time. A modified solid-phase Enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was developed to measure the mass of protein bound onto the oxide surface. The study resulted in a mass of 0. 364 pg/ml of IL- 6 bound onto ZnO for an applied mass of 0. 5 ng/ml. A <b>guided</b> <b>shear</b> mode surface acoustic wave (SAW) device in the ZnO/SiOsub 2 /Si system, with ZnO as the guiding layer on a SiOsub 2 /Si substrate, was modeled and fabricated. Two devices, operating at 708 MHz (device A) and 1. 5 GHz (device B) were developed. The mass sensitivities of these devices were calibrated by applying a known copolymer mass in a window area opened in the SAW devices and by measuring the frequency shift due the application of the mass. The maximum mass sensitivity of devices A and B was 4. 162 μm²/pg and 8. 687 (μm²/pg) for ZnO guiding layer thickness of 340 nm and 160 nm respectively. A technique to apply IL- 6 directly onto the SAW sensor surface was developed. For an applied IL- 6 mass ranging from 20 ng/ml - 2 μg/ml, applied in a 20 x 20 μm 2 sensing area, the device measures IL- 6 masses in the range of 1. 2 fg- 76. 45 fg. A proof-of-concept experiment for the biosensor was setup with normal human serum to detect the presence of IL- 6 in trace amounts. The device predicts three times as much IL- 6 mass for normal human serum derived from pooled donors under the age of 55 as compared to that from a donor over the age of 55. This is understood {{to be the result of}} age related increased IL- 6 levels and was independently confirmed through ELISA measurements. The ZnO/SiOsub 2 /Si sensor system therefore enables highly sensitive mass detection of the IL- 6 protein to be realized...|$|R

An alternative to this approach based on <b>guided</b> acoustic <b>shear</b> waves, the socalled Love wave devices, has been proved to allow for increasing gravimetric sensitivity. However, this approach reveals more complicated to implement as the surface on which reactions are achieved {{is the same as the}} one used for electrical connection. As a consequence, a microfluidic set-up must be implemented to prevent unwanted interactions between the corresponding areas (IDTs and propagation path). The main issue when using SAW Sensors for in-liquid biochemical analyses [1 - 4], especially in a commercial objective, is the development of a reliable and reproducible fluidic system [5] meeting the main following requirements: i) low acoustic leakage. ii) chemically inert to biological samples. iii) reproducible fabrication at the wafer scale level. In the present work we explore the use of the SU- 8 epoxy-based photoresist combined with silicon or quartz machined covers for the fabrication of this fluidic circuit. A first structure is fabricated using deep etch lithography, the cover is then glued to the remaining SU- 8 structure using a thin glue layer. The packaging system prevents covering the IDTs with liquids and defines the sensing area in the region in-between the IDTs.

40|$|AbstractSurface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) sensors are electromechanical devices that exploit the piezoelectric effect to induce elastic (acoustic) waves which {{are sensitive to}} small perturbations: for example specific binding and recognition of disease biomarkers. Shear horizontal surface {{acoustic wave}}s (SH-SAWs) are particularly suited to biosample analysis as the wave is not completely radiated and lost into the liquid medium (e. g., blood, saliva) as is the case, for example, in a device implementing Rayleigh waves. Here, using 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) the nature of waves launched on a particular quartz device is investigated {{with respect to the}} cut of the quartz, the addition of gold guiding layers, and the addition of other linear elastic materials of contrasting acoustic properties. It is demonstrated that 3 D FEA analysis showing the device's frequency shift with added guiding layer height reveals a proportional relationship in agreement with the Sauerbrey equation from perturbation theory. It is directly shown, given certain device parameters and a gold <b>guiding</b> layer, that <b>shear</b> horizontally polarized waves are launched on the surface with a dominant mode frequency around 250 MHz.

40|$|SUMMARY. - Seismic {{activity}} {{associated with}} the collision of the continentalpart of the Australian plate with the oceanic Melanesian arcs along Papua NewGuinea and the Banda arc provides an unusual opportunity to study the relativeexcitation of the seismic shear waves Sn and Lg. These waves are produced byearthquakes located along the arcs in the upper 200 km {{of the earth and}} arerecorded by the Australian WWSSN Stations at Charters Towers (CTA) and AliceSprings (ASP). The paths to these stations are predominantly continental. The dataclearly show that for events located at crustal depths, Lg is the predominant phaseon the records and Sn is either absent or very weak. For events deeper than about 50 - 70 km, Sn becomes the predominant phase on the records. These observationsarc in qualitative agreement with the explanations of Sn and Lg as highermodes of surface waves, for the particle displacement amplitudes are maximumwithin the crust for Lg and maximum within the lid of the lithospheric mantlefor Sn. The data suggest that either the crustal wave guide for Lg is moreefficient than that for Sn, or that Lg is more easily excited than Sn. No clearLg is observed from shallow earthquakes when the length of the segment of thepath crossing oceanic structure is greater than about 200 km. Also, widespreadQuaternary volcanism within the « stable » area of central Papua New Guineato the south of the mobile belt does not seem to affect the efficient transmissionof high-frequency (1 Hz) shear energy. The paths from events located along the New Hebrides, Solomon, and NewBritain arcs to Australia traverse oceanic structure, and no Lg is observed fromthese paths. The inefficient propagation of Sn along these paths from bothshallow and intermediate-depth events can be explained as follows: 1) Forthe New Hebrides case, the inefficiency of Sn propagation for paths exceedingabout 20 ° distance is related to the relatively young age (Lower to MiddleEocene) of the suboceanic lithosphere of the Coral Sea. As proposed by CHINN,ISACKS and BARAZANGI (1979), such relatively thin lithosphere is probably not anefficient wave <b>guide</b> for <b>shear</b> energy of about 1 Hz 2). The inefficiency of Snpropagation from events located along the northern Solomon and the New Britainarcs is probably due to anomalous attenuation in the uppermost mantle beneaththe Woodlark basin and beneath southeastern Papua New Guinea. 3) Theinefficiency of Sn propagation from events deeper than about 150 km locatedin the westernmost part of the northerly-dipping Benioff zone of the NewBritain arc could be due either to structural isolation of the nearly verticaldescending segment of the plate in which the events occur, or could be due tostructural complexity of the plates in the region which interrupts the waveguide for Sn to the Australian stations. This structural feature could be theresult of the collision of the Australian plate and the New Britain arc...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} to mass and liquid sensitivity {{for both the}} phase velocity and insertion loss of shear mode acoustic wave sensors based on the dispersion equations for layered systems is outlined. The approach is sufficiently general to allow for viscoelastic guiding layers. An equation for the phase velocity and insertion loss sensitivities is given which depends on {{the slope of the}} complex phase velocity dispersion curves. This equation contains the equivalent of the Sauerbrey and Kanazawa equations for loading of a quartz crystal microbalance by rigid mass and Newtonian liquids, respectively, and also describes surface loading by viscoelastic layers. The theoretical approach can be applied to a four-layer system, with any of the four layers being viscoelastic, so that mass deposition from a liquid can also be modelled. The theoretical dispersion equation based {{approach to}} layer-guided shear horizontal acoustic wave modes on finite substrates presented in this work provides a unified view of Love wave and shear horizontal acoustic plate mode (SH-APM) devices, which have been generally regarded as distinct in sensor research. It is argued that SH-APMs with <b>guiding</b> layers possessing <b>shear</b> acoustic speeds lower than that of the substrate and Love waves are two branches of solution of the same dispersion equation. The layer guided SH-APMs have a phase velocity higher than that of the substrate and the Love waves a phase velocity lower than that of the substrate. Higher-order Love wave modes are continuations of the layer-guided SH-APMs. The generalized concept of SH-APMs and Love waves provides a basis for understanding the change in sensitivity with higher-frequency operation and the relationship between multiple modes in Love wave sensors. It also explains why a relatively thick layer of a high-loss polymer {{can be used as a}} waveguide layer and so extends the range of materials that can be considered experimentally. Moreover, it is predicted that a new type of sensor, a layer-guided SH-APM sensor, can be constructed in a manner analogous to a Love wave device. The sensitivity of such a device is predicted to approach that of a Love wave sensor whilst retaining the advantage of the SH-APM of using the face opposite the one possessing the transducers as the sensing surface...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging enables detailed in vivo study of complex flow through 3 D, time-resolved phase contrast imaging (4 D flow). 4 D flow may reveal previously unknown {{aspects of the}} physiology of intracardiac blood flow, and possibly elucidate pathophysiological processes {{that have yet to}} manifest themselves outside the heart. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the physiological role of intracardiac flow phenomena, in order to better understand the normal function of the heart and provide a backdrop against which future studies into disease processes can be compared. The thesis consists of four studies with the following aims:I) to quantify atrial blood kinetic energy (KE),II) to evaluate the relationship between left ventricular vortex ring formation and myocardial motion,III) to quantify the hemodynamic force exchange between blood and myocardium in both ventricles, andIV) to compare hemodynamic forces in dyssynchronous, failing left ventricles with normal findings. Study I revealed significant differences between left and right atrial KE. Systolic KE was determined to a large extent by atrial volume and the systolic velocity of the atrioventricular plane, which differs between the left and right sides of the heart. Diastolic KE increased more in the left atrium, likely reflecting suction-initiated filling driven by left ventricular recoil. Rotational blood flow KE decay was slower than non-rotational KE decay, indicating a potential enhancement of cardiac function through energy preserving macroscopic flow structures. Study II demonstrated a strong spatiotemporal coupling between the vortex ring boundary and the endocardial boundary, suggesting that the normal development of the left ventricle is <b>guided</b> by the <b>shear</b> layer generated by the vortex ring. The coupling may act as a dynamic optimization mechanism to facilitate fluid transport at varying levels of cardiac output. In contrast, failing ventricles show no connection between the vortex ring and endocardium, suggesting that the adaptive coupling of the myocardium to the shear layer is disrupted. Studies III and IV demonstrated that biventricular hemodynamic forces are similar between healthy hearts regardless of size, and reflect fundamental aspects of flow redirection; this homogenous appearance is significantly altered in heart failure. The findings elucidate a previously unknown ’slingshot’ force that appears to result from contraction of the septum and RV free wall. In left ventricular dyssynchrony, several different hemodynamic force patterns were seen, which could indicate different degrees of detrimental effects on myocardial function and hence predispose to varying treatment response. Together, the findings in the thesis have advanced the knowledge on intracardiac flow at rest. To further validate their physiological importance, it is necessary to evaluate intracardiac flow during physical exercise...|$|R
