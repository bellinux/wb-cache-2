25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|That's {{really hard}} {{because you have}} to gauge the weather each time {{you have to make a}} decision. As for what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> I can't comment. I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making {{decisions}} based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E

60|$|One {{thing more}} remains {{for me to}} write, and then this strange log of a strange cruise will be complete. It <b>happened</b> only <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I am yet fresh from it, and athrill with it and {{with the promise of}} it.|$|R

5000|$|Following President Donald Trump's fist 2020 presidential {{campaign}} rally {{at which he}} referred to [...] "what's <b>happening</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> in Sweden" [...] the Swedish government requested clarification of from the U.S. State Department in regards to Trump's understanding {{of what was going}} on in Sweden. On February 19, the Cabinet of Sweden requested an explanation from the White House and the Swedish Embassy in the United States offered to inform the US administration in the future about Swedish immigration and integration policies. On February 23, the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs referred to discussions about Sweden's refugee policies as [...] "simplistic and occasionally completely inaccurate." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking at the rally, Trump {{defended his}} actions and criticized the media. He {{referred}} to [...] "what's <b>happening</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> in Sweden" [...] while criticizing the asylum policies of several European countries, though no incident had occurred the night before. He was lambasted {{by the press}} and the Swedish government. Reacting to the backlash, Trump later stated that he was referring to a Fox News program aired the previous day, including an interview with Ami Horowitz on Tucker Carlson Tonight. Several days after Trump's explanatory tweet, the website of the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs published a page disputing claims Horowitz made in that interview, as well as related claims about migration and crime in Sweden.|$|R

6000|$|... "Lords, lords," [...] he said, [...] "a {{wonderful}} thing has <b>happened!</b> <b>Last</b> <b>night</b> we {{spoke of the}} Pongo and now behold! an embassy from the Pongo is here; it arrived at sunrise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because of what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> Do {{you imagine}} Mr. Baxter will dare to stir {{from his bed}} after that? If {{ever there was a}} chance of getting this thing finished, it will be to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|He grunted in scorn. [...] "What <b>happened</b> {{over there}} <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> Everybody seems upset by it. I {{want to know}} all about it. You had a sitting, did you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over what happened, or seemed to <b>happen</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I am not at all a superstitious man, or one given to vain imaginings, but I am sure that Savage and I really did see and hear the spirit or the shadow of my wife. Her body {{it could not have}} been as you will admit, though how she could utter, or seem to utter, audible speech without one is more than I can tell. Also I am sure that she is captive upon yonder mountain and came to call me to rescue her. Under these circumstances I feel that it is my duty, as well as my desire, to give up any idea of leaving the country and try to find out the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR MADAME PRATOLUNGO,--I {{regret to}} inform you that nothing <b>happened</b> to me <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> My locks and bolts are in their usual good order; my gold and silver plates are safe in the workshop: and I myself am now eating my breakfast with an uncut throat--Yours ever, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, I hope you'll let what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> pass," [...] {{he said in}} an undertone. [...] "I {{only wanted}} to show you a little of life here, and didn't dream you'd resent it as you did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} the {{sentinels}} know what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and the forest is full of enemies. A poisoned arrow can be sent in the daytime, while he who shoots it remains concealed. Before noon {{we would all be}} dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came in {{haste to}} see how you were, Hortense, and how Robert was too. I was sure you would be both grieved by what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I did not hear till this morning. My uncle told me at breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank God! Never have! And {{after what}} <b>happened</b> to Mary <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> I see {{perfectly}} {{what happened to}} poor Aggie. She had the family throat too. By the way, Mary thinks you are a doctor. Otherwise she wouldn't like your having been in her room." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK. My dear Viv: she wouldn't {{appreciate}} it: the {{two cases}} require different treatment.

60|$|All day {{we watched}} and waited, but nothing <b>happened,</b> and at <b>last</b> <b>night</b> fell, and a {{thousand}} watch-fires twinkled brightly on the slopes, to wane and die one by one like the stars they resembled.

6000|$|... "It's true," [...] said George, {{turning to}} the Count. [...] "The fact is, I had rather a foggy {{recollection}} of what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> I only remembered knocking some one down, and, like you, I jumped {{to the conclusion that}} I must have assaulted His Serene Highness." ...|$|E
6000|$|Next morning Thurston, who {{summoned the}} cook and foreman before him, said: [...] "I want you two to keep what <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> a close secret, and while I cannot tell you much, I {{may say that}} the man who will remain in camp was, as you have no doubt guessed, only the cat's paw of several speculators, whom it wouldn't suit to see our employer, Savine, successful." ...|$|E
60|$|Walter and I are engaged. It <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> when we {{were sitting}} out in the {{moonlight}} under the silver maple on the lawn.

5000|$|... "Willy goes hunting" [...] was one way Tanner Stransky {{described}} this latest outing in Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The scariest/most greatest thing ever <b>happened</b> on <b>last</b> <b>night's</b> Ugly Betty: Wilhelmina wielded a hunting rifle! And no, she wasn't {{using it to}} kill of any of her rivals at Mode. Although, she did threaten Claire with it once. But honestly, who knew Willy was a hunter? Of course, the situation brought about a plethora of great one-liners for the ferocious editrix, which brings us right to the issue at hand. <b>Last</b> <b>night's</b> equally heart-warming (Daniel's love for Betty is so sweet) and sad (poor Cliff!) episode, as usual, was rife with quippy quips and bitey bites." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Failed" [...] did {{not enter}} my mind. I thought, looking at you just now in your clothes on the bed, one might for the moment be deceived into {{thinking}} there was a slight--quite the slightest improvement. There was not quite that'--she hovered for the right word--'that tenseness. Whether or not, whether you desired any such change or didn't, I should have supposed in any case {{it would have been}} better to act as far as possible like any ordinary person. You were certainly in an extraordinarily sound sleep. I was almost alarmed; until I remembered that it was a little after two when I looked up from reading aloud to keep myself awake and discovered that you had only just come home. I had no fire. You know how easily late hours bring on my headaches; a little thought might possibly have suggested that I should be anxious to hear. But no; it seems I cannot profit by experience, Arthur. And even now you have not answered surely a very natural question. You do not recollect, perhaps, exactly what did <b>happen</b> <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> Did you go in the direction even of Widderstone?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll just {{step over}} to Green Gables after tea {{and find out}} from Marilla where he's gone and why," [...] the worthy woman finally concluded. [...] "He doesn't {{generally}} go to town {{this time of year}} and he NEVER visits; if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more; he wasn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor. Yet something must have <b>happened</b> since <b>last</b> <b>night</b> to start him off. I'm clean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{went over}} to Wontner's {{quarters}} to talk things over. The row only <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> and we found him writing letters {{as hard as he}} could to his father--getting up his case for the War Office, you know. He read us some of 'em, but I'm not a good judge of style. We tried to ride him off quietly--apologies and so forth--but it was the milk-punch and mayonnaise that defeated us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you left}} {{me last night}} without a hint at any disagreement. What could have {{occurred}} in the interval to change you so? It must have been something that <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> You have been thinking it over and you have disapproved of my conduct. Was it the mesmerism? Did you blame me for letting that woman exercise her power over you? You know that at the least sign I should have interfered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told me that}} {{a strange}} thing had <b>happened,</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> One of his comrades had {{declared}} {{that he had found}} a giant, standing at the window where the prisoner was. He put his hand upon him, when he was struck down by lightning. No one would have believed his tale at all, {{if it had not been}} that his nose was broken. The other prisoner had been questioned but, as he did not understand Burmese, they could learn nothing from him. Two guards were, in future, to be placed at the back of the house, as well as in the front." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I want {{to clear}} up exactly what <b>happened</b> on <b>last</b> <b>night's</b> X Factor show and post my sincere apologies to anyone who took offence. I made a comment about Danyl {{changing}} the lyrics of his song. It {{was meant to be}} a humorous moment about the fact he has an opportunity to have fun with his song. An openly bisexual singing a song that is lyrically a 'girl's song'. Danyl and I were joking about the very same thing in rehearsals on Friday, so it carried on to the show. I'd like to apologise to anyone that was offended by my comments, it was never my intention. I spoke to Danyl straight after the show <b>last</b> <b>night</b> and he wasn't offended or upset by my comments, and knew exactly what I was saying." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{that must}} be the explanation. After all, the quaintest things <b>happened</b> in dreams. <b>Last</b> <b>night,</b> when he had fallen asleep in his chair, he had dreamed that {{he was sitting in}} a glass case in the museum, making faces at Lord Emsworth, Mr. Peters, and Beach, the butler, who were trying to steal him, under the {{impression}} that he was a scarab of the reign of Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty--a thing he would never have done when awake. Yes; he must certainly have been dreaming.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would buy}} more," [...] he said, freely, [...] "and make my fortune; only, as I {{was one of}} those who <b>happened</b> to spend <b>last</b> <b>night</b> at Sir Adolphus's, people might think I had helped to spread the rumour and produce the slump, in order to buy in at panic rates for my own advantage. A chairman, like Caesar's wife, should be above suspicion. So I shall only buy up just enough, now and again, to let people see I, at least, have no doubt as to the firm future of Cloetedorps." ...|$|R
