5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter {{from the airport to}} their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E

Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E

5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} a wrench. Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a manhole in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they need to move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the manhole. They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the manhole with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Trainor leaning {{on a bed}} reciting the song's lyrics, {{interspersed}} with scenes of dolls and a young girl and boy having a tea party. As the video progresses, Trainor proceeds to fail at her attempt to bake pies, setting a pie on fire. Trainor is then shown scrubbing the <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> The entire video is interspersed with scenes of a singing and dancing barbershop quartet. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} video, Trainor tests potential suitors. The first date cooks her a meal consisting of a small portion of scallops, which fails to impress Trainor. The second potential suitor takes her to a carnival and tries to impress her with his strength, which also fails to impress Trainor. The third date takes her boating, with the boat nearly capsizing and Trainor getting seasick. This also fails to impress Trainor. Finally, Trainor meets Charlie Puth on the online dating service, PlentyofFish. Puth comes to Trainor's home with a carryout pizza, which succeeds in impressing Trainor. The video ends with Trainor smiling and inviting Puth into her home.|$|E

50|$|Between {{the time}} of its {{invention}} in 1860 and its being largely superseded by other hard floor coverings in the 1950s, linoleum was considered to be an excellent, inexpensive material for high-use areas. In {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, it was favoured in hallways and passages, and as a surround for carpet squares. However, most people associate linoleum with its common twentieth century use on <b>kitchen</b> <b>floors.</b> Its water resistance enabled easy maintenance of sanitary conditions and its resilience made standing easier and reduced breakage of dropped china.|$|R

Allen accepted Nilsen's offer to accompany him to Cranley Gardens for a meal. As had been the case with several previous victims, Nilsen stated he could not recall the precise moment he had strangled Allen, but recalled approaching him as he sat eating an omelette with the full intention of murdering him. Allen's body was retained in the bathtub for a total of three days before Nilsen began the task of dissecting his body upon the <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> Nilsen is again known to have informed his employers he was ill and unable to attend work on 9 October 1982 â€” likely in order that he could complete the dissection of Allen's body.|$|E

40|$|We {{characterized}} {{the prevalence of}} cockroach allergen exposure in a nationally representative sample of U. S. homes and assessed risk factors for elevated concentrations. DESIGN: We used data from the National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing, a populationbased cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were residents of 831 U. S. homes in the survey. EVALUATIONS/MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed allergen, questionnaire, and observational data of 831 U. S. homes. RESULTS: Cockroach allergen (Bla g 1) concentrations exceed 2. 0 U/g, a level associated with allergic sensitization, in 11 % of U. S. living room floors and 13 % of <b>kitchen</b> <b>floors.</b> Concentrations exceed 8. 0 U/g, a level associated with asthma morbidity, in 3 % of living room floors and 10 % of <b>kitchen</b> <b>floors.</b> Elevated concentrations were observed in high-rise apartments, urban settings, pre- 1940 constructions, and households with incomes 8. 0 U/g were greatest when roach problems were reported or observed and increased {{with the number of}} cockroaches observed and with indications of recent cockroach activity. CONCLUSIONS: Household cockroach allergen exposure is characterized in a nationally representative context. The allergen is prevalent in many settings, at levels that may contribute to allergic sensitization and asthma morbidity. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: Likelihood of exposure can be assessed by consideration of demographic and household determinants.

She wanted Lennon to live with them both, but he was passed between the Stanley sisters and often ran away to Mimi's, where she would open the door to find Lennon standing there, [...] "his face covered in tears".

500|$|The novel {{opens in}} 1954 {{in the small}} logging {{settlement}} of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed {{the life of a}} young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. [...] "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> of Carl's house, knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{stone is}} used in <b>kitchens,</b> <b>floors,</b> walls, bathrooms, dining rooms, around {{swimming}} pools, building foyers, public areas and facades. Since ancient times, stone has been popular for building and decorative purposes. It has been valued for its strength, durability, and insulation properties. It can be cut, cleft, or sculpted to shape as required, and the variety of natural stone types, textures, and colors provide an exceptionally versatile range of building materials. The porosity and makeup of most stone does, however, leave it prone to certain types of damage if unsealed. Staining {{is the most common}} form of damage. It is the result of oils or other liquids penetrate deeply into the capillary channels and deposit material that is effectively impossible to remove without destroying the stone.|$|R

Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibsonâ€”a recently converted Roman Catholicâ€”asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was or what she was talking about.

[...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand.

Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers.

2500|$|Three clues {{were found}} at the scene. The first was the caliber of bullets. The second was a {{flashlight}} found in the hedge underneath the window that Starks was shot from. The last clue was of bloody prints around the house; shoe-prints on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor,</b> and smudged fingerprints in other places. Sheriff Davis stated that although this murder could not be directly linked to the Phantom because the caliber was a [...]22, [...] "it {{is possible that the}} killer is one and the same man." [...] Those who had been driving in the area near the time of the slaying, along with several men found within the vicinity, were picked up for questioning. Early Saturday morning, bloodhounds were brought in from Hope by the Arkansas State Police. They found two trails that led to the highway before the scent was lost. That night, many officers patrolled lovers' lanes hoping to prevent another attack. By Sunday night, more State Police officers were called in to help in the investigation and to aid in protecting the local civilians. Officers had detained at least twelve suspects but only kept three for further questioning. Forty-seven officers were working around the clock to solve the mysteries. Among them were sheriffs of four counties, Captain Gonzaullas and his staff of Texas Rangers, and Chief Deputy Tillman Johnson. The flashlight was sent to Washington, D.C. for further inspection by the FBI. Meanwhile, Mrs. Starks was showing improvements at Michael Meagher Hospital. The unofficial theory for a motive amongst the majority of the 47 officers was that of [...] "sex mania", because large amounts of money in the home were not taken, nor was Mrs. Starks' purse, which was lying on the bed containing money and jewels, and because nothing was stolen from the home. The title {{on the front page of}} the Texarkana Gazette on Sunday, May 5, 1946 read: [...] "SEX MANIAC HUNTED IN MURDERS".|$|E
