50|$|In 1995, Televisió de Catalunya {{launched}} TVCi, {{a satellite}} channel which broadcast {{a selection of}} programs from TV3, El 33, 3/24 and Esports 3 through the Astra and <b>Hispasat</b> <b>satellites</b> (named TV3cat from June 2009). The channel ceased to broadcast via satellite on 1 May 2012, but it continues to broadcast on Cable TV throughout Spain, especially in the Balearic Islands (via DVB-T) and on the internet.|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the channel}} is {{available}} on the Astra 1KR and <b>Hispasat</b> 1D <b>satellites</b> at 19.2°E and 30°W respectively as part of the Digital + package for Spain only, on the Eutelsat Hot Bird 2 satellite at 13°E for the whole of Europe, and the <b>Hispasat</b> 1C <b>satellite</b> at 30°W for the Americas until March 2006. Afterwards it will only be possible to receive TVE through Spanish packages offered by Dish Network and DirectTV in the Americas.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>Hispasat</b> <b>satellite</b> {{sent into}} orbit was Hispasat 1A, which was {{launched}} on 11 September 1992 on board an Ariane 4 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana.

40|$|Since 1974, CNES, the French National Space Agency, {{has been}} {{involved}} in the geostationary launch and early operations phases (LEOP) of moving satellites from a transfer orbit delivered by a launcher to a geostationary point. During the operations and their preparation, the Flight Dynamics Center (FDC), part of CNES LEOP facilities, {{is in charge of the}} space mechanics aspects. What is noteworthy about the Spanish <b>HISPASAT</b> <b>satellite</b> positioning is that all the operations were performed on the customer's premises, and consequently the FDC was duplicated in Madrid, Spain. The first part of this paper is the FDC presentation: its role, its hardware configuration, and its space dynamics ground control system called MERCATOR. The second part of this paper details the preparation used by the FDC for the HISPASAT mission: hardware and software installation in Madrid, integration with the other entities, and technical and operational qualifications.

40|$|A linearly {{polarized}} flat antenna with broadside beam radiation {{is presented in}} this paper. A rectangular slot array in the upper side of a parallel plate waveguide form the main antenna structure. In previous works, the authors have presented one and dual tilted-beam antennas [1 - 2] for the reception of <b>Hispasat</b> or Astra <b>satellite</b> emissions in the 12 GHz band. The problem of the broadside beam antenna is to avoid the grating lobes.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} that a satellite manufacturing involves is to obtain the geometrical forms and the accurate positions for the different radiofrequency components (reflectors, subreflectors and feeders). CFRP (Carbon Fibber Reinforced Plastics) sandwich structures never are obtained as designed due to the deformations associated to the manufacturing process. So, reflectors, subreflectors and structural components (towers, panels [...] .) have to be measured in order to include their deviations {{in the design of the}} regulation parts. High performance equipment (Co-ordinate Measurement Machines, CAD/CAM Systems and 5 Axis Machine Tool) is used, but it is also necessary to make an integrated and multidisciplinary team. This paper describes how this process was implemented in CASA Space Division during <b>HISPASAT</b> 1 C <b>satellite</b> manufacturing program...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} prototyping of a double-beam linear polarized parallel-plate slot antenna at 12 -GHz band. Each beam is separated 27. 7 /spl deg/ and 27. 3 /spl deg/, respectively, from broadside direction. Two different radiation patterns are generated, exciting the parallel plate from opposite sides. The radiating elements are composed by three parallel slots, the central slot {{is close to the}} resonance, while the side ones are designed to minimize the reflection inside the parallel plate. The length of the slots in the same row is kept constant (periodic walls), and the distance between columns is equal to 0. 7 times the wavelength. The designs of the feeding networks and the design of the array of slots generate both beams, pointing toward <b>Hispasat</b> and Astra <b>satellites</b> simultaneously, at the same frequency band. The feeding networks are two microstrip circuits that excite two linear arrays of 24 patches, placed at both sides of the antenna, and generate both quasi-TEM mode plane waves inside the parallel-plate waveguide, propagating {{from one side to the}} other...|$|R
40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) {{in digital}} {{television}} broadcasting {{has been the}} subject of many studies during the last decade. This has led to the establishment of various standards and recommendations by organisations such as ETSI and the ITU. More than twenty relevant parameters and associated measurement methods have been specified by ETSI for DVB but their interpretation, usage and exploitation are often considered “difficult ” – in that they require a high level of expertise. This article describes how three “synthetic ” parameters (SAE, SDE and SIE) have been developed to make assessment of QoS considerably easier. They could represent the keystone of QoS in digital TV services. Evaluation of DVB service performance (at TS level) Test procedures Within the framework of two European projects – QUOVADIS (QUality Of Video and Audio for DIgital Television Services) [1] and MOSQUITO (Management Of Service QUality In Television Operations) [2], co-ordinated by TDF – field trials have been performed on the experimental/prototype platforms shown in the table below: DVB-S Retevisión satellite earth station (Madrid, Spain) + <b>Hispasat</b> DVB-S GlobeCast <b>satellite</b> earth station (Saint Assise, France) + Eutelsat DVB-T RAI terrestrial platform (Turin, Italy...|$|R
