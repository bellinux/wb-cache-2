5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
50|$|The 15 meter band is {{considered}} a DX band (i.e., used for long-distance communications). Since signals on 15 meters propagate primarily via reflection off of the F-2 layer of the ionosphere, the band is most useful for <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> during daylight hours, especially in years close to the solar maximum. However, the band also sees long-distance openings during solar minima, and into evening hours, and does not require high-power station equipment to make contacts even at these times.|$|E

40|$|We perform decoy-state quantum key {{distribution}} between a low-Earth-orbit satellite and multiple ground stations located in Xinglong, Nanshan, and Graz, which establish satellite-to-ground secure keys with ~kHz rate per passage of the satellite Micius over a ground station. The satellite thus establishes a secure key between itself and, say, Xinglong, and another key between itself and, say, Graz. Then, upon request from the ground command, Micius acts as a trusted relay. It performs bitwise exclusive OR operations between the two keys and relays the result {{to one of the}} ground stations. That way, a secret key is created between China and Europe at locations separated by 7600 km on Earth. These keys are then used for <b>intercontinental</b> quantum-secured <b>communication.</b> This was on the one hand the transmission of images in a one-time pad configuration from China to Austria as well as from Austria to China. Also, a videoconference was performed between the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which also included a 280 km optical ground connection between Xinglong and Beijing.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} memory errors in the quantum repeater scheme for long-range quantum communication. We show that the communication distance is limited in standard operation mode due to memory errors resulting from unavoidable waiting times for classical signals. We show how to overcome these limitations by (i) improving local memory, and (ii) introducing two new operational modes of the quantum repeater. In both operational modes, the repeater is run blindly, i. e. without waiting for classical signals to arrive. In the first scheme, entanglement purification protocols based on one-way classical communication are used allowing to communicate over arbitrary distances. However, the error thresholds for noise in local control operations are very stringent. The second scheme makes use of entanglement purification protocols with two-way classical communication and inherits the favorable error thresholds of the repeater run in standard mode. One can increase the possible communication distance by {{an order of magnitude}} with reasonable overhead in physical resources. We outline the architecture of a quantum repeater that can possibly ensure <b>intercontinental</b> quantum <b>communication.</b> Comment: 19 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables; V 2 : references update...|$|R

Connections from Waterville to Weston-super-Mare in England and Le Havre in France were soon established.

Intense trade with the Roman Empire soon followed, confirmed by the Roman craze for Chinese silk (supplied through the Parthians), even though the Romans thought silk was obtained from trees. This belief was affirmed by Seneca the Younger in his Phaedra and by Virgil in his Georgics. Notably, Pliny the Elder knew better. Speaking of the bombyx or silk moth, he wrote in his Natural Histories [...] "They weave webs, like spiders, that become a luxurious clothing material for women, called silk." [...] The Romans traded spices, glassware, perfumes, and silk.|$|R
50|$|Arriving back in America, {{he decided}} on a Pacific network of railroads and steamships as being the means to make his fortune and develop western trade. Returning briefly to St Petersburg in 1858, he was warned his scheme was premature. Instead and {{coincident}} with {{the failure of the}} telegraph line across the Atlantic, he proposed an intercontinental telegraph line. This line would run through either Canada or the western United States, into British Columbia, the northern British territories, into Russian America (Alaska), over the Bering Strait to Siberia and then along the Amur to Irkutsh and thence Europe. Success of such a scheme, Collins anticipated, would deliver all <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> {{into the hands of the}} Americans.|$|E
50|$|The band is {{most useful}} for inter-continental {{communication}} {{for one or}} two hours before sunset, during the night and {{for one or two}} hours after sunrise. It is extremely useful for short to medium distance contacts from local contacts out to a range of 500-1500 km or more, depending on conditions, during the day. In higher latitudes, daytime <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> is also possible during the short days of winter, for example a good path often opens between Japan and northern Europe in the hours leading up to European midday from late November through late January, with a long path opening to the west coast of the United States and Canada after midday.|$|E
40|$|Failure {{detection}} is {{a fundamental}} building block for ensuring fault tolerance in distributed systems. However, providing accurate and flexible failure detection in off-the-shelf distributed systems is difficult. Practical solutions to failure detection rely on some adaptive mechanism {{to cope with the}} unpredictability of networking conditions. However, while they provide reasonably good accuracy, they also lack the necessary flexibility to provide failure detection as a system-wide service. In particular, traditional solutions take a “one size fits all ” approach, which prevents them from simultaneously supporting several distributed applications with very diverse QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach to adaptive failure detection, called ϕ-failure detector, which ad-dresses the flexibility issue mentioned above. We describe an implementation, and analyze its behavior over <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> links during several weeks. Our experimental results show that our failure detec-tor compares well with other known adaptive failure detection mechanisms, with the considerable advantage tha...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of deep-water gas and oilfields is increasing. Pipelines transport the produced {{oil and gas}} onshore or transfer these between countries through the water. Underwater communication cables on the seafloor are the backbone of our <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> infrastructure. Sea cables transfer electrical energy from offshore production facilities or between countries and continents. This infrastructure of our economics and society can corrode or can get damaged. The status of these offshore pipelines and cables needs to be monitored regularly and damages need to be found and repaired quickly. This paper presents a method to guide an autonomous underwater vehicle with the information from different sensors including cameras, multibeam echo sounder (MBES), sub bottom profilers and magnetic sensors. Our online sensor fusion and tracking algorithms for underwater pipeline and cable inspection are based on probability maps which contain the location and the rating of each pipeline detection from every sensor. With these algorithms, we want to improve the regular pipeline inspection. The proposed system will be tested for its performance in simulation with different pipeline layout scenarios. Other applications for this map based fusion algorithm (beside pipeline and cable inspection) can be the mapping of toxic substances {{in the water column}} and the search of their sources...|$|E
40|$|Detecting {{failures}} is {{a fundamental}} issue for fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Recently, many {{people have come to}} realize that failure detection ought to be provided as some form of generic service, similar to IP address lookup or time synchronization. However, this has not been successful so far. One of the reasons is the difficulty to satisfy several application requirements simultaneously when using classical failure detectors. We present a novel abstraction, called accrual failure detectors, that emphasizes flexibility and expressiveness and can serve as a basic building block to implementing failure detectors in distributed systems. Instead of providing information of a boolean nature (trust vs. suspect), accrual failure detectors output a suspicion level on a continuous scale. The principal merit of this approach is that it favors a nearly complete decoupling between application requirements and the monitoring of the environment. In this paper, we describe an implementation of such an accrual failure detector, that we call the ϕ failure detector. The particularity of the ϕ failure detector is that it dynamically adjusts to current network conditions the scale on which the suspicion level is expressed. We analyzed the behavior of our ϕ failure detector over an <b>intercontinental</b> <b>communication</b> link during several days. Our experimental results show that our ϕ failure detector performs equally well as other known adaptive failure detection mechanisms, with an improved flexibility. I...|$|E
