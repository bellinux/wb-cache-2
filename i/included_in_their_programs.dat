There are different forms and typologies of such movements which have a changing degree of community profile, shared-values and different expectations from the program of housing. When the energy-ambition is <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>programs,</b> and embedded into the values of the community, collective housing carries a potential to be as grassroots movement towards building self-organized energy-efficient district via collective behavior. In this paper, it is conceptualized as Collective Self Organized Housing (CSO). However, in order to build sustainable districts on collective manner requires a design methodology which establishes strong and clear relationships among community, design professionals, suppliers, and municipalities. In this paper, we firstly define CSO design process; secondly review participatory design and concurrent design methodologiesto see their advantages and disadvantages; finally present CSO design methodology...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{importance}} and inclusion of emotional intelligence by agricultural education instructors. Although much research has been conducted about the importance of emotional intelligence in the realm of education, research in the area of emotional intelligence in the agricultural education program is limited. The concept of incorporating emotional intelligence into the agri-science curriculum is not a new idea. The very philosophy of agricultural education lends itself to the development of emotional intelligence. The teachers recognized eight out of the twenty constructs identified through the review of literature as high level success abilities. This means that agricultural education instructors believe these components are important and they are actually including them in their curriculum. Eleven of the twenty emotional intelligence constructs were identified as low level needs. This indicates that teachers do not believe these constructs are important, and therefore do not need to be <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>programs.</b> Only one construct, conflict resolution, was identified as being a critical need.

40|$|Low {{breast cancer}} {{screening}} rates are often found among {{ethnic minority groups}} and those born outside the host country. This is of particular concern for high-risk groups, who should benefit from ongoing trials aimed at optimizing screening strategies for breast, as well as ovarian cancer. Both of these issues are germane for Jewish women in Europe. We systematically review the literature concerning breast cancer early detection practices (BCEDP) among Jewish women, and examine European surveillance studies of high-risk for breast and/or ovarian cancer that had imaging in the surveillance protocol, {{in order to assess}} the likelihood of adequately including women from minority ethnic groups. No studies were found about BCEDP among Jewish women in Europe. Twenty-one research groups from Israel or the US addressed BCEDP among Jewish women. Some Jewish women in the US and Israel, including recent immigrants, are under-screened. Twenty-four research groups reported imaging surveillance of women at increased risk for breast and/or ovarian cancer in Europe. There was a clear benefit to magnetic resonance imaging and/or more intensive screening for women with increased breast cancer risk. Some of these surveillance studies considered ethnic minority groups at high risk, including Jewish women, but none provided adequate outreach to ensure that these groups were <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>programs.</b> The specific screening needs of Jewish and other high-risk ethnic minority groups in Europe have not been met regarding breast and ovarian cancer.

40|$|In {{connection}} with child raising, {{we are more}} and more often hearing words such as feeble parental education, children's indulgence, overprotection, loss of authority, etc. How much are these phenomena present in the family is quite dependent on the parenting style used by parents. Theoretical part of the master's thesis begins with the definition of concepts that help to understand the function of the family and its influence on the child's development. The work focuses primarily on the dysfunctional families, as well as the risk factors that influence the occurrence of problematic behaviour of children. Hereinafter the thesis defines parenting styles and their connection to the development of emotional behavioural disorders and difficulties with children. At the end of the theoretical part there are highlighted characteristics of residential care institutions, children <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>programs,</b> the work of care workers and their influence on education. In the empirical part, the master's thesis identifies the characteristics of the families of children in residential care institutions, which parenting styles did the children receive in residential care institutions in their primary family, as recognized by care workers, and how that influences the educational approaches of care workers. The study uses a descriptive method and a quantitative research approach. A questionnaire is used as a technique of data collection and the research includes care workers employed in residential care institutions with a length of service of more than ten years. The findings show that children in residential care institutions mostly come from families with separated parents who are most often confronted with feeble parental education, unemployment and financial problems. Care workers in these families most often perceive a permissive parenting style, but it is closely followed by other parenting styles. Nevertheless, almost all care workers who participated in the research find that parenting styles have changed over the last ten years and more, and so today permissive and overly indulgent parenting is noticeable in more and more families. In accordance with these findings almost all care workers state that during this period educational approaches in the work with children and their families have changed considerably. Findings from the research could be very important for dealing with problems of children involved in residential care institutions, and for further planning of programs and effective work of care workers. ...|$|E

This paper provides guidance in appropriately adapting toys and the play situation to allow many children with disabilities to engage in meaningful interactions with toys and other play experiences. The paper offers five suggestions for selecting toys for children with special needs to allow positive learning outcomes, including the use of responsive toys and the inclusion of naturally occurring objects as toys. Suggestions for adapting toys relate to toy stabilization, toy extensions, toy attachment, and toy confinement. Suggestions are also offered for the following classroom learning centers: gross motor, fine motor, blocks, art, and dramatic play. The paper concludes by reiterating that selecting age-appropriate toys, adapting toys to children's needs, and designing centers that enhance development, caregivers can build an environment that promotes learning for all children.

The curriculum he developed for the Experiment in Higher Education was similar to another program that was being developed at that time, known as Upward Bound, in that the students were from urban areas with low high school graduation rates. Both programs were designed to help these students enter institutions of higher learning and graduate successfully. Upward Bound students typically showed promise. However, EHE students' test scores were not even on the border line.
