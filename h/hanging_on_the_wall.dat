The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E

25|$|A {{photograph}} taken in 1988, also depicting British Prime Minister David Cameron, {{this time in}} the centre of the group, later emerged. It was found by the student newspaper, VERSA, amongst over a dozen other photographs of the club dated between 1950 and 2010 <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the tailor that is believed to have made the members’ suits, and led to a number of other past members being identified. Gillman and Soame, the photographers who own the copyright to the image, withdrew permission for it to be reproduced. VERSA, which discovered the photographs, commissioned sketches to reproduce the scenes depicted in them.|$|E
25|$|Banda was {{the subject}} of an {{extensive}} cult of personality. Every business building was required to have an official picture of him <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and no poster, clock or picture could be higher than his portrait. Before every film, a video of Banda waving to the people was shown while the anthem played. When Banda visited a city, a contingent of women were expected to greet him at the airport and dance for him. A special cloth, bearing the president's picture, was the required attire for these performances. Houses of worship required government approval to operate, and some faiths such as Jehovah's Witnesses were banned entirely.|$|E
25|$|One of the rioters {{sat in the}} Speaker's chair where Morin {{had been}} sitting {{only a few minutes}} before, and {{declared}} the dissolution of the House. The room was turned upside down while other men entered the room of the Legislative Council. The acts of vandalism that were reported included the destruction of the seats and desks, stamping on the portrait of Louis-Joseph Papineau, that had been <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> next to that of Queen Victoria. Perry claimed to have set fire to the room himself when he hit the gas chandelier suspended on the ceiling with a brick, aiming for the clock that was directly above the Speaker's chair. The clock, whose ticking apparently got on his nerves, was, according to his account, showing 9:40pm when it happened. Other sources, including newspapers of the time, believed the fire to have been started when rioters outside the building started throwing the torches that some of them had carried from the Champ-de-Mars meeting.|$|E

25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a man {{sitting at a}} table upon which is placed a mug of beer. The man, an American according to the title of the work, has his arms crossed and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance for noise, {{to the point}} of refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. He almost never allowed his wife or son to speak and viciously beat them if they did so without permission, particularly forbidding them to speak to or around Genie. Any conversation between them was therefore very quiet and out of Genie's earshot, preventing her from hearing any meaningful amount of language. Her father kept Genie's room extremely dark, and the only available stimuli were the crib, the chair, curtains on each of the windows, three pieces of furniture, and two plastic rain jackets <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> On rare occasions her father allowed her to play with plastic food containers, old spools of thread, TV Guides with many of the illustrations cut out, and the raincoats. The room had two almost entirely blacked-out windows, one which her father left slightly open; although the house was well away from the street and other houses, she could see the side of a neighboring house and a few inches of sky, and occasionally heard environmental sounds or a neighboring child practicing the piano.|$|E
25|$|Passed {{out to the}} {{occasional}} friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli {{had just returned from}} Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor Régis Debray. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution {{he did not have to}} pay.|$|E

On the ground floor {{on each side of the}} staircase are display cabinets holding the city's silver. On the half-landing is a statue of George Canning dated 1832 by Francis Chantrey, and <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> above this is a portrait of Queen ElizabethII by SirEdward Halliday.|$|E
500|$|The Springfield Tar Pits are {{inspired}} by the La Brea Tar Pits located in Hancock Park in Los Angeles, California. The museum {{in the background of}} the scene where Homer sinks into one of the tar pits resembles the George C. Page Museum of the La Brea Discoveries. When Stampy runs away, he passes the Republican National Convention, with people cheering, and then he passes the Democratic National Convention, with people booing. This is a reference to the fact that an elephant is the symbol of the Republican Party. Homer uses Mr. Cleanser, a parody of the detergent brand Mr. Clean, to clean the basement. [...] As Bart cleans, he accidentally scrubs the paint off an American Gothic painting <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> Under the paint is a message signed by the painter, Grant Wood, reading: [...] "If you can read this, you scrubbed too hard." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the term remain unclear.

500|$|... "Le Talisman" [...] {{begins with}} the plot of [...] "Le Dernier Napoléon": A young man named Raphaël de Valentin wagers his last coin and loses, then {{proceeds}} to the river Seine to drown himself. On the way, however, he decides to enter an unusual shop and finds it filled with curiosities from around the world. The elderly shopkeeper leads him {{to a piece of}} shagreen <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> It is inscribed with [...] "Oriental" [...] writing; the old man calls it [...] "Sanskrit", but it is imprecise Arabic. The skin promises to fulfill any wish of its owner, shrinking slightly upon the fulfillment of each desire. The shopkeeper is willing to let Valentin take it without charge, but urges him not to accept the offer. Valentin waves away the shopkeeper's warnings and takes the skin, wishing for a royal banquet, filled with wine, women, and friends. He is immediately met by acquaintances who invite him to such an event; they spend hours eating, drinking, and talking.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Las Meninas relate to earlier works by Velázquez {{in which he}} plays with {{conventions}} of representation. In the Rokeby Venus—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although [...] "often described as looking at herself, [...] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early Christ in the House of Martha and Mary of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are {{clear that this is}} the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of Los Borrachos of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god Bacchus and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early bodegones, the figures look directly at the viewer as if seeking a reaction.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} the first album by the band {{released}} on the Harvest label. The cover artwork shows a Droste effect featuring the group, with a picture <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> showing the same scene, except that the band members have switched positions. The cover of the original LP varies between the British, American/Canadian and Australian releases. The British version has the album Gigi {{leaning against the wall}} immediately above the [...] "Pink Floyd" [...] letters. At a talk given at Borders bookstore in Cambridge on 1 November 2008, as part of the [...] "City Wakes" [...] project, Storm Thorgerson explained that the album was introduced as a red herring to provoke debate, and that it has no intended meaning. On most copies of American and Canadian editions, the Gigi cover is airbrushed to a plain white sleeve, apparently because of copyright concerns, but the earliest American copies do show the Gigi cover, and it was restored for the American remastered CD edition. On the Australian edition, the Gigi cover is completely airbrushed, not even leaving a white square behind. The house used as the location for the front cover of the album is located in Great Shelford, near Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|One {{possible}} {{cause of the}} species decline is climate change.

500|$|The south wall of {{the nave}} shows {{the line of the}} {{original}} roof before it was raised, and contains faint remains of paintings dating from the 19thcentury, which consist of scriptural inscriptions. In the nave is a Jacobean pulpit, designed by Thomas Finch and made in 1601, which was once part of a three-decker pulpit. It was damaged in 1683 by a falling roof beam and was reduced in the 1855 restoration. <b>Hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the nave are a number of Tudor boards which were taken from the ceiling of the south transept in 1964; one of these is dated 1577. In the south aisle is a small painting of The Widow's Mite by Jules Bouvier. A second pulpit, made of stone and dating from the late-14thcentury, is attached to the northeast pier of the crossing. This is designed to appear like a large chalice, and is decorated with panel tracery. The wooden crossing vault was designed by Scott. The roof of the north transept is also wooden, but of Tudor design. In the north {{wall of the}} transept is an aumbry and in the northeast corner is an oven with a chimney, which was used for baking Communion wafers. The transept contains an oak chest dated 1676 and a bench dated 1737. [...] In the east wall of north transept are a piscina and another aumbry.|$|E
500|$|... "Ali's Smile" [...] by William Burroughs is a {{short story}} {{originally}} published by Unicorn in 1971 and later republished in Burroughs's collection of short stories, Exterminator! (1973). At {{the opening of the}} story, Clinch Smith, a former colonial official, is living in an English town overshadowed by a giant slag heap. He is upset when he receives a letter from a Scientologist friend saying that he will [...] "disconnect" [...] from Smith, describing him as a [...] "suppressive person". A kris <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of his room reminds Smith of Ali, whom he had met 30 years ago in Malaya. Ali had been put under a latah spell by an old woman, forcing him to dance in the marketplace. Smith rescued Ali, making the young man his houseboy. Ali returned to the market, however, and ran amok, killing several of the women with the kris. Smith was forced to shoot Ali, and kept the kris as a souvenir. Back in the present, Smith feels compelled to take the kris from the wall and goes to town, where there is a fight going on between hippies and locals, with members of Scientology's Sea Org in the crowd as well. Smith goes on a killing spree with the kris, which seems to have a life of its own. He stabs Lord Westfield, a Home Office official who has asked a private investigator to infiltrate a Scientology organization, a woman, and several Sea Org members, and then a bystander shoots him dead. Police and more combatants prepare to join the fight. As they do so, the slag heap collapses and buries everyone. At the end, the [...] "ghost face" [...] of Ali smiles over all.|$|E

On 16 April 2012 Rita and Emily arrange to visit a convalescing Betty and go to meet Gordon, who has agreed to drive them there. However, when Gordon does arrive, he brings with him the unexpected news that Betty has died, peacefully in her sleep the night before. The residents of the street all gather in the Rovers Return and hold an impromptu memorial to Betty, with all of her old friends reminiscing about her. Gordon, with some persuasion from Emily decides to have his mother buried in Weatherfield after initially contemplating London. It is later revealed that Annie Walker left The Rovers Return to Betty in her will however Betty never acted on this, Gordon assured landlady Stella Price {{that he is not}} interested in the pub and it will remain in her possession. Despite being one of the street's longest serving characters, her funeral was held off-screen. After the wake and lock-up, Stella hung a photo of Betty on the wall over The Rovers Return, for all to see and remember her. This photo was sadly destroyed during the 2013 Rovers Return fire, started by Karl Munro but, following the refurbishment, Rita managed to obtain an identical copy which remains <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> in the same place.|$|E
