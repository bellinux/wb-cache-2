500|$|The {{filming of}} the episode's ending caused a [...] "huge divide among the writing {{staff and the}} {{director}} and the cast". Carell, Kwapis, and the actors wanted the moment when Pam and Jim kiss to [...] "follow the characters and the emotion of the moment" [...] by having the action captured in full by the show's cameramen. The writing staff, on the other hand, wanted Pam and Jim's moment to be private and only heard via the mics; Daniels explained, [...] "The writing staff was itching to do something <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> [...] and have it be a private moment that the doc crew didn't know {{was going to happen}} and so only heard on their mics and came running around the corner to film."

500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> way." ...|$|E

500|$|Stump and Wentz met up for {{the first}} time in several years in early 2012 for a writing session. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a {{creative}} outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. [...] "I know what you need – you need your band," [...] Wentz told Stump. [...] "I think it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> that we haven't really seen each other this year. We paid for each other's houses and you don't know my kid," [...] Wentz remarked. The result, [...] "three or four" [...] new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that [...] "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right." [...] Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form. The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: [...] "We didn't want to come back just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation," [...] said Stump. Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record. Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. As Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had a list of stipulations for rejoining the band. [...] "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music [...] then I don't want to," [...] he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition saying Trohman [...] "needed to be writing more." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird,</b> which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with film critic Christopher Hicks, Boam said that the success of the movie is generally credited to Cronenberg, and that King wouldn't give Boam credit for writing a good script. He said, [...] "It's hard for him to admit that he's not the one who could crack that book. But I think that movie holds together as a real movie.

[...] Frank Zappa said of Vito's freaks: [...] "As soon as they arrived they would make things happen, because they were dancing in a way nobody had seen before, screaming and yelling {{out on the floor}} and doing all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> things.

2500|$|The album's {{earliest}} origins lie in unsuccessful writing sessions between Patrick Stump and Pete Wentz. The two met up {{in early}} 2012 {{to write for}} the first time in nearly four years. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a creative outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. Wentz told Stump [...] "I know what you need – you need your band", and said: [...] "I think it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> that we haven't really seen each other this year.

2500|$|Crumb {{first saw}} the film in February 1972, {{during a visit to}} Los Angeles with fellow {{underground}} cartoonists Spain Rodriguez, S.Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, and Rick Griffin. According to Bakshi, Crumb was dissatisfied with the film. Among his criticisms, he said that he felt that Skip Hinnant was wrong for the voice of Fritz, and said that Bakshi should have voiced the character instead. Crumb later {{said in an interview that}} he felt that the film was [...] "really a reflection of Ralph Bakshi's confusion, you know. There's something real repressed about it. In a way, it's more twisted than my stuff. It's really twisted in some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird,</b> unfunny way.... I didn't like that sex attitude in it very much. It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively." [...] Crumb also criticized the film's condemnation of the radical left, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song [...] "The End", as [...] "red-neck and fascistic" [...] and stated, [...] "They put words into his mouth that I never would have had him say." ...|$|E
2500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, observing the chemistry between Spears and Azalea {{as well as}} praising Spears's dancing and noting a nod to her earlier music videos. Mike Wass for Idolator wrote, [...] "Yes, it lifts product placement to previously unimagined heights and I can’t see an Academy Award in either diva’s future — but it’s {{a hell of a}} lot of fun. And just kooky enough to become a cult classic like the movie it’s loosely based on". Josh Duboff from Vanity Fair described the video as [...] "entertaining and <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird.</b> There’s a lot of big hair; Spears does some endearing waving (and generally seems to be having a good time)". He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, I had so much fun," [...] and meaning it". Kirthana Ramisetti for New York Daily News similarly noted, [...] "The two music stars seemed to have a lot of fun filming their video".|$|E
5000|$|Del Rey {{spoke to}} Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1 about the song, saying: [...] "It's {{probably}} the track that's the most {{different from the}} other tracks on the record.

The rows of tall Lombardy poplars down its lane stood out in stately, purple silhouette against the sky. Behind it, sheltering its garden from the too keen breath of sea winds, was a cloudy fir wood, in which the winds might make all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> and haunting music. Like all woods, it seemed to be holding and enfolding secrets in its recesses,--secrets whose charm is only to be won by entering in and patiently seeking.

While recording, we often got visited by his daughters. No, not that kind! They're really sweet children. Kids in the studio just add to the right atmosphere. You can do great jams with them. That's how [...] "Grace" [...] developed. One of these girls always carried a small money box around. 'Save The Money For The Children', it says. One day, Danny came in drunk and started rambling on a piano, shouting all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> lyrics. So we used the line from the money box and thought: that will do for a B-side. But once we started recording it for real, it became better and better and it's even our new single now! Yeah, things can go truly odd." ...|$|R
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird,</b> too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.'

2500|$|The album {{title is}} a catchphrase used by Ghoulardi, the 1960s horror host alter-ego of Cleveland {{television}} presenter Ernie Anderson. Carney called the title [...] "a shout-out to Ohio", {{the state in}} which he and Auerbach grew up. The title also captured the despondent tone of the record. Auerbach said, [...] "We liked the association with Ghoulardi, this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weird</b> freak from Ohio from the early 60s – that was a phrase he used to use. And then {{so much of the}} album was lyrically melancholy and introspective and personal, so it was very blue. I guess it just made sense." [...] Carney explained the original context in which Ghoulardi used the phrase: [...] "It's [...] way of telling people to fuck off." [...] The cover art, which features an image of a blue and magenta spiral, was designed by Michael Carney, the group's art director and Patrick's brother. After selecting the title, Patrick said the group began [...] "referencing early '60s sci-fi, shows like The Outer Limits and Twilight Zone" [...] for the art direction, due to Ghoulardi's association with the genre. The album's artwork was influenced by Carney's interest in mind control; the subject drew his attention after he feuded on Twitter with fans of pop star Justin Bieber. Director Harmony Korine subsequently recommended Carney watch the 1985 film The Peanut Butter Solution, in which a teacher uses mind control on students to make them build paintbrushes. The film inspired the hypnotism wheel on the cover and in the album's promotional videos.|$|E
