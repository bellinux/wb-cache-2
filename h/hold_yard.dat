50|$|In 1907 the {{construction}} of <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> was authorised. They were located {{to the east of}} the main line, north of the Eketahuna station yard {{on the other side of}} Alfredton Road. This space was divided into three parts and was a short distance from the existing stockyards at the north end of the station yard on the south side of the road. The water supply was extended to the <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> in 1928 using the Departmentâ€™s own water source, and a pen suitable for holding pigs was added in 1930.|$|R
50|$|The <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> at the {{entrance}} of the shed is important as a means of keeping cows moving into the shed. Most yards have a powered gate that ensures that the cows are kept close to the shed.|$|R
50|$|The Ballarat Gaol, {{a former}} maximum {{security}} prison for males, females and children, {{is located in}} Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. Replacing temporary structures including prison hulks in the Bay of Port Phillip and <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> in Ballarat, the gaol operated between 1862 and 1965.|$|R
50|$|The {{abattoir}} {{was closed}} in 1994; the jetty itself was previously dismantled in the 1960s.

In the 1970s there were several companies operating container terminals, with rail transfer to larger <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> at Chullora. Container handling moved out of White Bay in late 2004, relocating to Darling Harbour.|$|R
50|$|Peachester Public Dip {{demonstrates}} the principal {{characteristics of a}} plunge cattle dip used to combat cattle tick {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. These characteristics include the rectilinear dip formed in concrete with a stepped concrete ramp up from the dip; a timber-framed, gabled roof clad in corrugated iron sheeting and posts of the associated <b>holding</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
50|$|A dairy complex survives at {{the eastern}} end of this built up area and this {{comprises}} a number of interconnected open shed with corrugated iron roofs supported on timber posts. <b>Holding</b> <b>yards</b> abutting the dairy also survive. Sections of the cattle dip and several other outbuildings along with extensive early fencing and shelters survive on this southern side of the approach road.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} divided into two sections, the Halford {{homestead}} is on the Black Flag area and is split from the other part by Carbine Station. The second area contains another homestead along with <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> and shearing sheds. The station contains many native trees including black oak, salmon gum and gimlet with underbrush such as wattle, blue bush and salt bush.|$|R
50|$|The {{abattoir}} {{was closed}} in 1994 with the jetty itself dismantled in the 1960s. All {{that remains of}} the former jetty are the pylons which extend between 200 - 300 metres out to sea. The chimney is the only remaining part of the large complex of buildings which included offices, <b>holding</b> <b>yards,</b> freezer and chiller facilities. The chimney is listed in the State Register of Heritage Places.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{abutting}} {{the curved}} {{wall of the}} woolshed {{is a series of}} timber let-out pens. The pens lead into [...] "counting-out" [...] yards that surround the curved face of the shearing shed. The larger series of <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> extending beyond the [...] "counting-out" [...] yards are not included in the heritage boundary. A large timber forcing-up ramp gives access from the yards into the central opening of the woolshed.|$|R
50|$|The {{central core}} of the cattle yards {{comprises}} crushes for de-horning, cutting, drafting, dipping, and branding. Surrounding the stock working facilities of the central core, are the receiving, forcing and <b>holding</b> <b>yards.</b> The de-horning and cutting crush, cattle dip and stock loading ramp are in better condition than most sections of the yards, possibly through having remained in use and repair until {{the closure of the}} station. The loading ramp was built in the early 1960s and is the most recent structure. The most substantial feature of the yards is the cattle dip, which is of the conventional design and construction. The dip was built during the O'Beirne's tenure and is the earliest surviving structure within the yards. The walls of the dip are of concrete with concrete rendered steps and pit. Bush timber uprights and rafters support a corrugated iron roof that covers the dip itself. Steps lead out of the dip to a concrete-surfaced draining and pound yard. Beyond the dip is a large circular <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> over 50 metres in diameter which forms a significant feature of the stockyards.|$|R
50|$|The Isis Downs Woolshed Complex is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a large, early twentieth century shearing operation, comprising shearing shed (completed with mechanical shearing motors and wool presses), <b>holding</b> <b>yards,</b> powerhouse (with an extensive array of associated machinery and infrastructure) and bale hoist. The place was and {{remains one of the}} largest and most intact early twentieth century shearing complexes in Queensland, of exceptional value in contributing to our understanding of early mechanised shearing in Queensland.|$|R
50|$|The Isis Downs Woolshed {{complex is}} located on the Isisford-Blackall Road {{approximately}} 20 kilometres east of the township of Isisford, within the homestead complex of the Isis Downs Station. The complex consists of the shearing shed (completed with mechanical shearing motors and wool presses), <b>holding</b> <b>yards,</b> powerhouse (with an extensive array of machinery and infrastructure) and a stand-alone bale hoist, located in close proximity to each other, and which were used conjointly to clip and process the fleeces.|$|R
50|$|Narrower logs {{were also}} {{processed}} through the frame saw. Vertical saws {{contained within the}} frame cut a number of boards simultaneously, with the feed grips of the frame adjusting automatically to the taper of the log. A planing machine for further processing was originally located in the north-eastern corner of the mill, but was later removed. Once cut to the desired specification, the sawn timber was transported on trolleys aligned to rail lines into the <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> at {{the eastern end of}} the mill to season.|$|R

50|$|Gepps Cross (pronounced 'Jepps Cross') is {{a suburb}} and major road {{intersection}} {{in the north}} of Adelaide, South Australia. Gepps Cross is traditionally seen {{as the end of the}} inner suburbs and the start of the outer northern suburbs, as it was home to a major abattoir (now closed) with <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> and other open space. It is the first significant open space encountered after the North Parklands. It retains the open nature, even with warehouses, a velodrome, hockey stadium, Adelaide Raiders - a Croatian soccer club and karate training facilities.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with three platform faces: the main station platform was used for down trains, whilst {{the far side of}} an island platform served the up trains. A double track ran through the station, with a third line splaying out {{to the other side of}} the island before merging once again with the line to Tunbridge Wells. Four sets of goods sidings lay to the north of the main station serving a carriage dock, blacksmith's shop and stable. The extensive goods yard and generous facilities did not, however, see much use, and the Southern Railway used the station as a collection point for empty wagons and, at one point, as a <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> for Tunbridge-bound trains.|$|R
50|$|Minilya {{later was}} passed onto Brockman's brother, Julius, who {{put on the}} market in 1894. At this time Minilya {{encompassed}} an area of 200000 acre and was stocked with 22,000 sheep and 50 horses. Minilya was divided into eight main paddocks which were mostly fenced and watered by tanks, wells and dams. A substantial five-bedroom homestead had been built along with outbuildings including a kitchen, stables, store, dairy and meat house. A new iron shearing shed along with a Farrer wool press, <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> for 10,000 sheep and accommodation for 25 shearers were also included. It was later acquired by pastoralist and politician Donald Norman McLeod in 1899. By 1911 McLeod had a flock of 42,684 sheep running at Minilya and shearing produced 954 bales of wool.|$|R
50|$|When {{the loading}} race was {{destroyed}} in a shunting accident in 1955 it was proposed to close the station to all goods traffic {{on account of the}} low volume handled there. This move was delayed, at first by a desire to retain the loop for train crossing purposes should that be required by a change in traffic patterns brought about by the Rimutaka Tunnel, and later by objections from local farmers. The farmers wanted to construct a permanent cattle yard and extend the existing sheep <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> to increase their throughput at the station. The Department was agreeable to the proposal on the understanding that goods traffic at the station would increase, and supplied the materials to the farmers who carried out the work, completed in 1959.|$|R
2500|$|In {{herringbone}} {{and parallel}} parlors, the milker generally milks one row at a time. The milker will move {{a row of}} cows from the <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> into the milking parlor, and milk each cow in that row. Once all of the milking machines {{have been removed from}} the milked row, the milker releases the cows to their feed. A new group of cows is then loaded into the now vacant side and the process repeats until all cows are milked. Depending {{on the size of the}} milking parlor, which normally is the bottleneck, these rows of cows can range from four to sixty at a time. The benefits of a herringbone parlour are easy maintenance, the durability, stability, and improved safety for animals and humans when compared to tie stall ...|$|R
5000|$|Regular rail {{services}} to Mungana ceased in 1958 and only extended beyond Chillagoe {{when they were}} required for cattle. The end of rail services was the final blow to Mungana and by 1959 it had shrunk to a hotel, store, post office and seven residents. A new metal cattle <b>holding</b> <b>yard</b> for road haulage {{were built in the}} 1970s and the old wooden cattle yards became derelict. Today the Mungana Township is completely abandoned and has become a tourism destination, although some mining leases have been recently reactivated over parts of the site and a new [...] "drive" [...] zinc mine is being established. The powder magazine and detonator shed are the only extant buildings but substantial remnants of the rail network, building foundations, stock trucking yards, and mining operations and cemetery survive.|$|R
50|$|For bees, their forage or {{food supply}} {{consists}} of nectar and pollen from blooming plants within flight range. The forage sources for honey bees {{are an important}} consideration for beekeepers. In order to determine where to locate hives for maximum honey production and brood one must consider the off-season. If there are no honey flows the bees {{may have to be}} fed. Bees that are used for pollination are usually fed in the <b>holding</b> <b>yards.</b> Forage is also significant for pollination management with other bee species.Nectar contains sugars that are the primary source of energy for the bees' wing muscles and for heat for honey bee colonies for winter. Pollen provides the protein and trace minerals that are mostly fed to the brood in order to replace bees lost in the normal course of life cycle and colony activity.|$|R
50|$|In the {{far west}} of the {{national}} park, the gibber plains are replaced by sandhills of the Strzelecki Desert. Cameron Corner is a remote but popular tourist destination where the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland meet. Also {{in this part of}} the park is Fort Grey - the fourth camp ground and a heritage site. The <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> visible here and a remnant from the explorer Charles Sturt. The fort is a stockade that was built to protect Sturt's supplies and prevent the exploration party's sheep from wandering away. While searching for a fabled inland sea, Captain Charles Sturt, after whom the park is named, spent a year in the area. Fort Grey is sited on the edge of the ephemeral, and Ramsar-listed, Lake Pinaroo - an important breeding and drought refuge for waterbirds when it contains water.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} a three-bore buttressed tunnel with ten pairs of {{boarding}} and deboarding accesses. It is 148 meters long in total, but the boarding platform spans only 100 meters. The {{walls of the}} station are covered with brown and gold, anodized, aluminum mouldings. The single lobby under VinohradskÃ¡ Avenue is 5.6 meters underground. The lobby {{is connected to the}} street by three exits with escalators and to the platform by one long tunnel with escalators running in both directions. Behind the station are two <b>hold</b> <b>yards</b> and one reverse track capable of storing an entire train. Extension of the A-line to the StraÅ¡nickÃ¡ Station was achieved by boring tunnels from these auxiliary spaces. The reverse track is still used for reversing and storing trains even though the Å½elivskÃ©ho Station is no longer the terminus of the line. The construction of the station in 1980 cost approximately 301 million Czech crowns.|$|R

At the Brisbane Abattoirs, drafting and weighing, followed by unloading, {{had the greatest}} potential to inflict injury to cattle. Agonistic behaviour (butting) showed {{a significant difference in}} initiation rate between horned (0 - 36 per animal) or hornless (0 - 91 per animal) cattle. Most butting occurred in the <b>holding</b> <b>yards</b> and involved the neck (47. 2 %) and flank (37. 8 %) regions more often than the hindquarters (25. 0 %). During unloading, drafting and weighing, cattle frequently came into heavy contact with solid objects, particularly on the back (33. 1 % of contacts) and upper hindquarters (25. 4 %). Shading behaviour differed between British and Brahman-type cattle, with 41 % of British-breeds seeking shade, whereas only 6. 5 % of Brahman-type cattle sought shade. Problem areas in saleyards are the unloading, drafting and weighing yards, where stockhandlers and casual labourers move cattle. These workers may, by rough and abusive handling, exacerbate behaviour which leads to damage to cattle...|$|R
