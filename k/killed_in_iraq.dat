5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E

25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that this might be the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen who were <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret {{the decision to}} go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E

She envisioned herself as a possible figurehead for humanitarian work, along the lines of Diana, Princess of Wales.

500|$|The {{majority}} of {{media coverage of}} the event was deferential. Most major news organizations broadcast the various events live multiple times; during the week, the cable channel C-SPAN broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the funeral ceremonies. A few complained, however, that the television coverage was excessive and preempted coverage of other events. CBS News anchor Dan Rather was quoted as saying: [...] "Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president, life does go on. There is other news, like the reality of Iraq. It got very short shrift this weekend." [...] Throughout the week, media experts reported that the national mourning, televised nearly non-stop on many television networks, provided Americans welcome respite from unhappy reports that American troops were being <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan, giving them a sense of good news they had been desperate for since the September 11 attacks.|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{returned}} to Westboro Baptist Church for a follow-up documentary {{four years after}} making The Most Hated Family in America, to investigate the departure of {{several members of the}} Phelps family since his last visit. The film, America's Most Hated Family in Crisis, was first broadcast on BBC Two on 3 April 2011. Theroux's return was prompted by an email he received from a young member of the church he had interviewed previously, who had since left and been disfellowed. The US Supreme Court case of Snyder v. Phelps, heard following the suing of Westboro Baptist Church for distress caused by the picketing of the funeral of a US Marine <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> formed the background to the new film. Theroux was interested in the ambivalent attitude of church members towards his first film, and stated that [...] "the new documentary feels quite different than the original [...] though still funny, a little darker and stranger".|$|E

This episode garnered much buzz online and resulted in a failed campaign for Zach Gilford to get an Emmy nomination in the guest actor category; however, the episode did get an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. After this emotionally charged episode, Matt abruptly moves to Chicago without saying goodbye to his girlfriend or best friend. He returns briefly in the finale and makes amends with both Julie and Landry, who ends up flying back to Chicago with Matt.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the Melbourne, Australia newspaper, The Age, Larry Schwartz {{selected}} the documentary as [...] "Critic's Choice". Schwartz {{was critical of}} Theroux's lack of detachment from his subject matter, [...] "He repeatedly distances himself from the church, expressing his disapproval of their views. But so concerned is he, he seems almost evangelical in his determination to show them the error of their ways." [...] The documentary was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald among [...] "The week's best", and critic Greg Hassall characterised it as, [...] "Disturbing, perplexing and very entertaining." [...] The Australia newspaper MX highlighted the documentary favorably, in its column, [...] "Best in show". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun selected The Most Hated Family in America as his [...] "Top Choice" [...] recommendation. Adams wrote, [...] "A truly disturbing, disgusting and sad documentary. The repellent Shirley Phelps is the outspoken nutbag who got publicity by calling Heath Ledger a 'fag enabler' after his death. This jaw-dropping doco infiltrates Phelps' only-in-America church where her 11 spooky kids regularly picket funerals of US soldiers <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> – they believe God killed them to show his hatred of how 'depraved' America now is." ...|$|E
