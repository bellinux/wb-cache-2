25|$|Many paranormal romances rely on {{the blend}} of {{contemporary}} American life with the existence of supernatural or magically empowered beings, human or otherwise; sometimes the larger culture {{is aware of the}} magical in its midst, sometimes it <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their alternative worlds than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance. Others develop the alternate reality meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} {{strong sense of}} folk faith {{is found in the}} tribal parts of Burma. In this instance, there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> type of divine being, and folk religion is practised entirely separately from Buddhism. In these tribal societies all nats are traditionally viewed as harmful, unlike in other villages where nats are invited to partake in festivals. Instead of adorning these nats with offerings and food, the most effort is put into fending evil spirits off. These tribes just merely want to be left alone, undisturbed by the malicious spirits.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2005, the Lucian Blaga Lyceum, a {{high school}} with Romanian as its {{language}} of instruction, was registered as a Transnistrian non-governmental establishment. The registration of six Romanian language schools {{has been the subject}} of negotiations with the government since 2000. The tension increased in the summer of 2004, when the Transnistrian authorities forcibly closed the schools that used the Moldovan language in the Latin script. According to the official PMR view, this is considered as Romanian. Moldovan, written in the Cyrillic script, is one of the three official languages in the PMR; Romanian <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Some</b> economic measures and counter-measures were taken on both banks of the Dniester.|$|E

25|$|For example, in act 1, scene 2, the {{scenario}} is that Jenny and other girls are walking to Mahagonny. The music is surprisingly simple; {{just a simple}} solo with a short chorus and sparse orchestration. The music <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> baroque contrapuntal scheme, {{nor is it a}} Romantic forest of sound; rather, the music is very easy to listen to. This music setting matches with the idea of making music accessible to the public, and not just for educated artists. The music style also displays influences from popular music. During this time, American jazz was a sensation in Europe; since opera is set in America, {{it is not surprising that}} the tune and the beat have a jazz influence. The orchestration, also includes such non-classical instruments as a saxophone, a decidedly jazz instrument. By using a jazz style in the music, Weill immediately associates the action as happening in America. In addition to making a relatively exotic sound, Weill manages to incorporate the jazz style in the song without making it seem incongruous; the American and European music are seamlessly joined under Weill's hands.|$|E
500|$|Journalists and pundits {{reviewing}} the final unanimously {{agreed with the}} outcome of the match. Matt Dickinson wrote in The Times of 6 May 2002: [...] "The force is with Arsenal, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> ethereal presence, rather a brutish will to win derived from both triumphs and disappointments." [...] The Daily Telegraph football correspondent Henry Winter was strongly critical of Ranieri's selection-making and suggested Chelsea's failure was partly down to Hasselbaink's lack of fitness, as there was no attacking threat. In contrast he commended Wenger's tactics – [...] "The decision by Arsenal's intelligent manager to deploy Parlour through the middle was a spectacular success," [...] and praised their players' mental strength and resilience. The Guardians David Lacey also lauded Parlour's show in midfield, ranking his goal {{as one of the best}} in Cup final history. Although he agreed with the media consensus that the final was a drab affair and Arsenal's performance was not to their standard, he picked out several high-quality moments that the losing finalists failed to match, one in particular a timed-ball from Vieira. Glenn Moore of The Independent observed how Wenger turned his team of also-rans into winners, noting the manager's decision to play Adams [...] "bore fruit" [...] as the defence dealt with Chelsea's increasing second-half pressure. Football pundit Alan Hansen called Arsenal his team of the season and believed their win was built on the experience of Adams and Seaman; of the former he wrote: [...] "Adams was also able to operate with the confidence that his goalkeeper was never going to make any mistakes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{position}} can {{be stated}} as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> nonphysical world of consciousness, mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection {{is a kind}} of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this {{is the heart of the}} argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a person's genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> quaint antiquarian resurrection, but an opera that can work for today's audiences on stage." [...] Blyth is less wholehearted in his support. In 1984, he wrote [...] "The libretto is impossibly awkward, its language stilted, many of its musical structures ill-considered, but much is enjoyable in its own right as much as for the enjoyment in discovering seeds of future triumphs." [...] But fifteen years later he was writing that the work's interest lay only in its evidence of the mature composer, [...] "on its own account it's a bit of a bore." ...|$|E

2500|$|To further promote [...] "A.K.A.", Lopez shot teaser videos {{for some}} tracks of the album. The first was [...] "Emotions", {{followed}} by [...] "Worry No More" [...] and [...] "Booty".

Zayda Rivera of New York Daily News further explained the storyline: [...] "Her voluptuous backside takes center stage in the music video as Lopez displays her own take on the dancing craze while instructing other women on just how to move it." [...] Rivera also commented that the video [...] "quickly confirmed why she's dominated dance in pop music since her big break as a Fly Girl on the hit ’90s sketch comedy series 'In Living Color'."

2500|$|In December 1989, the Bible Broadcasting Network {{terminated}} MacArthur's Grace to You program. In {{explaining that}} step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings {{on the blood}} of Christ, and [...] "Lordship Salvation." [...] Davey called these teachings [...] "confusing." [...] In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a, [...] "....drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position {{that we could not}} adhere to," [...] and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election [...] "....convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism...." [...] MacArthur preaches [...] "Salvation" [...] by election of God's sovereignty. However, the term [...] "Hyper-Calvinism" [...] is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical [...] "Hyper-Calvinism" [...] position that only the [...] "Elect" [...] may be offered the Gospel (compare with the historical teaching of all Protestant denominations, including MacArthur, of the free offer of the gospel). This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of the Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement {{that it is not the}} literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on The Cross, a view that he espoused in an article titled, [...] "Not His Bleeding, but His Dying," [...] published in the May 1976 issue of the Grace to You family paper that is distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.|$|E

2500|$|Lisa Evans, an {{attorney}} for the environmental group Earthjustice (headquartered in Oakland, CA), spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue. She also blamed the industry for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases. She stated that [...] "The saddest thing is this is entirely avoidable. These people in these communities don't have to be in harm's way. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>some</b> complicated problem like nuclear waste. This is something the utilities know how to do." [...] Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, told The New York Times that the ash should have been buried in lined landfills to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater (as recommended in a 2006 EPA report), and stated that [...] "I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site." [...] Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, on-site the week of the spill, acknowledged that the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA’s own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells.“Believe me, there will be a full-bore look at this to understand the causes of this thing and to try to make sure it never happens again,” he said. Concern has also been expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site. The site may be slated as a Superfund site, although no decision regarding this has yet been made. On December 27, 2008 the TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although Stephen Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Chris Irwin of United Mountain Defense told The Tennessean newspaper that they believe the TVA knows what is in it, due to the TVA having tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese. Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it is believed that the area of the spill may contain [...] "hot spots" [...] of higher toxicity.|$|E
