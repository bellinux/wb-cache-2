40|$|Current organ {{preservation}} strategies subject graft vasculature {{to severe}} hypoxia (PO 2 approximately 20 Torr), potentially compromising vascular function and limiting successful transplantation. Previous work {{has shown that}} cAMP modulates endothelial cell (EC) antithrombogenicity, barrier function, and leukocyte/EC interactions, and that hypoxia suppresses EC cAMP levels. To explore the possible benefits of cAMP analogs/agonists in organ preservation, we used a rat heterotopic cardiac transplant model; dibutyryl cAMP added to preservation solutions {{was associated with a}} time- and dose-dependent increase in the duration of cold storage associated with successful graft function. Preservation was also enhanced by 8 -bromo-cAMP, the Sp isomer of adenosine 3 ', 5 'monophosphorothioate, and types III (<b>indolidan)</b> and IV (rolipram) phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Neither butyrate alone nor 8 -bromoadenosine were effective, and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase antagonist Rp isomer of adenosine 3 ', 5 'monophosphorothioate prevented preservation enhancement induced by 8 -bromo-cAMP. Grafts stored with dibutyryl cAMP demonstrated a 5. 5 -fold increase in blood flow and a 3. 2 -fold decreased neutrophil infiltration after transplantation. To explore the role of cAMP in another cell type critical for vascular homeostasis, vascular smooth muscle cells were subjected to hypoxia, causing a time-dependent decline in cAMP levels. Although adenylate cyclase activity was unchanged, diminished oxygen tensions were associated with enhanced phosphodiesterase activity (59 and 30 % increase in soluble types III and IV activity, respectively). These data suggest that hypoxia or graft ischemia disrupt vascular homeostasis, at least in part, by perturbing the cAMP second messenger pathway. Supplementation of this pathway provides a new approach for enhancing cardiac preservation, promoting myocardial function, and maintaining vascular homeostatic properties...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that cGMP and cAMP reduce the endothelial permeability for fluids and macromolecules when the endothelial permeability is increased by thrombin. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which cGMP improves the endothelial barrier function and examined whether nitric oxide (NO) can serve as an endogenous modulator of endothelial barrier function. Thrombin increased the passage of macromolecules through human umbilical vein and human aortic endothelial cell monolayers and concomitantly increased [Ca] 2 + in vitro. Inhibition of these increases by the intracellular Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA indicated that cytoplasmic Ca 2 + elevation contributes to the thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase activators 8 - bromo-cGMP (8 -Br-cGMP) and 8 -(4 -chlorophenylthio) cGMP (8 -PCPT-cGMP) decreased the thrombin-induced passage of macromolecules. Two pathways accounted for this observation. Activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by 8 -PCPT-cGMP decreased the accumulation of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + in aortic endothelial cells and hence reduced the thrombin-induced increase in permeability. On the other hand, in umbilical vein endothelial cells, cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE III) activity was mainly responsible for the cGMP-dependent reduction of endothelial permeability. The PDE III inhibitors <b>Indolidan</b> (LY 195115) and SKF 94120 decreased the thrombin-induced increase in permeability by 50 % in these cells. Thrombin treatment increased cGMP formation in the majority of, but not all, cell cultures. Inhibition of NO production by N(G) -nitro-L- arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) enhanced the thrombin-induced increase in permeability, which was restricted to those cell cultures that displayed an increased cGMP formation after addition of thrombin. Simultaneous elevation of the endothelial cGMP concentration by atrial natriuretic factor, sodium nitroprusside, or 8 -Br-cGMP prevented the additional increase in permeability induced by L-NAME. These data indicate that cGMP reduces thrombin-induced endothelial permeability by inhibition of the thrombin-induced Ca 2 + accumulation and/or by inhibition of cAMP degradation by PDE III. The relative contribution of these mechanisms differs in aortic and umbilical vein endothelial cells. NO can act in vitro as an endogenous permeability- counteracting agent by raising cGMP in endothelial cells of large vessels.
