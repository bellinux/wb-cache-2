40|$|AbstractWe {{proposed}} operating HMD by BMI {{to speed}} up operation and to enhance the convenience in wearable device equipping HMD. But {{it is difficult to}} reflect user's thought direct on operation at this stage. In order to realize it, we need to identify a kind of human's brain signal when human thinks about moving object. So our study verifies whether it is possible to identify by imaging direction in data that we investigate cerebral blood flow changes in using NIRS when subject thinks about moving object. Identification was using neural network. The average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4 direction in Total-Hb, the average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4 direction in Oxy-Hb, the average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4 direction in Deoxy-Hb are 32. 25 %, 36. 0 % and 37. 0 %, respectively. The average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, up and down, in Total-Hb, the average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, up and down, in Oxy-Hb, the average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, up and down, in Deoxy-Hb are 63. 5 %, 62. 0 % and 62. 5 %, respectively.

5|$|Of noble birth, Cuthbert {{is first}} {{recorded}} as the Abbot of Lyminge, {{from where he}} was elevated to the See of Hereford in 736. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the Cuthbert who was Bishop of Hereford with the Cuthbert who became archbishop, however, comes from Florence of Worcester and other post-Conquest sources. The contemporary record in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Cuthbert was consecrated archbishop, where if he had been Bishop of Hereford, he would have been translated. No consecration is needed when a bishop is translated from one see to another.

5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> these cases may prevent complications.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the relative frequencies <b>of</b> correct <b>identifications</b> <b>of</b> variations in the fit of conventional rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses and reverse geometry lenses (RGL) from fluorescein pattern analysis by orthokeratology (ortho-k) practitioners and non-ortho-k practitioners and to determine whether fluorescein pattern analysis is sensitive for assessing ortho-k lens fittings. Methods: Slides of fluorescein patterns of different lens fittings were shown to the practitioners, who were asked to identify the ideal, flatter, flattest, steeper and steepest lens fittings. Results: Observed frequencies <b>of</b> correct <b>identifications</b> <b>of</b> most of the conventional RGP lens fittingss were not significantly different from the expected frequencies for both groups of practitioners. The observed frequencies <b>of</b> correct <b>identifications</b> <b>of</b> all of the RGL fittings were either not significantly different or were lower than the expected frequencies. Conclusion: The relative frequencies <b>of</b> correct <b>identifications</b> <b>of</b> fluorescein patterns of both conventional RGP lens and RGL fittings by experienced ortho-k practitioners were not different from those by non-experienced ortho-k practitioners. Practitioners from the two groups were not always able to diagnose conventional RGP lens and RGL fittings adequately from fluorescein pattern analysis alone. Fluorescein pattern analysis alone may not be sufficiently sensitive for assessing ortho-k lens fitting. School of Optometr...|$|R

Doubts about the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the archaeological site were first raised by Robert M. Carmack, who realised that the supposed Poqomam capital was not located within the Poqomam linguistic area but rather within the linguistic area of the Kaqchikels. The Poqomam who were settled in the new colonial settlement of Mixco by the Spanish had a long history of fine polychrome ceramic production, but no evidence of such production had been recovered during archaeological investigations, and the ruins were considered too distant from colonial Mixco.|$|E
