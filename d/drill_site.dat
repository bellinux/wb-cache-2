But, the high accumulation rate has resulted in relatively rapid ice flow (flow-induced layer thinning and diffusion of isotopes), Dye 3 1979 cannot be used for annual layer counting much more than 8 kyr back in time.|$|E

This well immediately produced over , giving the company confidence to continue. On 31 January 1944, the company name was changed from California-Arabian Standard Oil Co. to Arabian American Oil Co. (or Aramco). In 1948, Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as Exxon) purchased 30% and Socony Vacuum (later Mobil) purchased 10% of the company, with SoCal and Texaco retaining 30% each. The newcomers were also shareholders in the Iraq Petroleum Co. and {{had to get the}} restrictions of the Red Line Agreement lifted in order to be free to enter into this arrangement.|$|E
500|$|The brittle ice zone {{typically}} returns poorer quality samples {{than for}} the rest of the core. [...] Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. [...] Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. [...] In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. [...] Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. [...] Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1m lengths in the hole. [...] Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the <b>drill</b> <b>site</b> for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.|$|E

2500|$|In 1946, {{the company}} decided on one last {{drilling}} program {{from east to}} west in Alberta. [...] The wells would be “wildcats” - exploratory wells drilled in search of new fields. The first <b>drill</b> <b>site</b> was Leduc No. 1 in a field on the farm of Mike Turta, 15 kilometres west of Leduc and about 50 kilometres south of Edmonton. [...] Located on a weak seismic anomaly, the well was a rank wildcat. [...] No drilling of any kind had taken place within an 80-kilometre radius.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} {{spawned a}} generation of safety regulations that require the industry to designate hazardous drilling targets as [...] "critical wells" [...] and to use elaborate safety precautions at the <b>drill</b> <b>site.</b> The new regulations imposed much more stringent drilling procedures at critical wells, required specialized safety features on drilling and other equipment, and forced companies to develop detailed emergency response plans before beginning to drill. Combined, these additional costs can range from $250,000 to $500,000 for a single deep sour gas well. Thus, the indirect costs of the blowout have probably been {{on the order of}} $1 billion.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the allocation of teams to complete a set of time duration predefined borehole investigation jobs. An algorithm was developed, to output which team does which jobs and when. Initially, filtering the job list was done to group similar type of jobs together. Clustering the two dimensional <b>drilling</b> <b>sites</b> to a given number of teams were done to separate the jobs among the drilling teams. The total service time duration differences of the outcome <b>drilling</b> <b>site</b> clusters were minimized to a given accepted difference level by iteratively shifting jobs from the cluster, which has maximum total service time duration. The distance matrix of each <b>drilling</b> <b>site</b> locations cluster was modified by adding the ‘office location’ and replacing ‘big M’ values for main diagonal distances of each outcome cluster and, sent through the Hungarian method. The graphical representations of obtained sub routes were taken {{as a guide for}} designing of the shortest path of each clustered <b>drilling</b> <b>sites.</b> The developed algorithm was shown better optimization over the traditional practice of ‘instant team allocation for the nearest location’...|$|R

50|$|Drillships {{have the}} {{functional}} ability of semi-submersible drilling rigs and {{also have a}} few unique features that separate them from all others. First being the ship-shaped design. A drillship has greater mobility and can move quickly under its own propulsion from <b>drill</b> <b>site</b> to <b>drill</b> <b>site</b> in contrast to semi-submersibles and jackup barges and platforms. Drillships {{have the ability to}} save time sailing between oilfields worldwide. A drillship takes 20 days to move from the Gulf of Mexico to the Offshore Angola. Whereas, a semi-submersible drilling unit must be towed and takes 70 days.Drillship construction cost is much higher than that of a semi-submersible. But although mobility comes at a high price, the drillship owners can charge higher day rates and get the benefit of lower idle times between assignments.|$|E

After meetings with then Energy Minister, Ken Hughes, Jansen and Hughes discussed the importance of appropriate urban drilling policies for all Albertans, which takes into account air and water quality, pollution, and appropriate emergency evacuation routes. Jansen sponsored the urban drilling review motion, which was later passed in April 2013, to determine whether adequate policy was in place regarding urban community <b>drilling</b> <b>sites.</b> Jansen also successfully identified three possible alternative drilling locations.
