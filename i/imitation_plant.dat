Examples have been found of jungle scenes with wild animals and exotic <b>plants.</b> <b>Imitation</b> windows (trompe l'oeil) were sometimes painted to make the rooms seem less confined.|$|R
50|$|The gold wreaths were {{probably}} made in local workshops in inner Thrace and were modeled on Greek jewelry. They {{belong to the}} classic type dated to {{the second half of}} the fourth century BC and early third century BC. They were designed to be true <b>imitations</b> of the <b>plant</b> species.|$|R
40|$|Halophytic {{plants are}} more {{susceptible}} for oxidative stress and damage due to high contents of salt and minerals inside these plants. Therefore, self defence against this oxidative stress appeared in the high phenolics particularly, flavonoids content are abundant in these plants. Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Limoniastrum guyonianum and Anabasis articulate are three of halophytic plants growing in Mediterranean coast of Libya and most of North African countries, were taken as example for estimating the phenolic and flavonoids contents as well as antioxidant evaluation in order to understanding the effect of habitat of these <b>plant</b> <b>imitation</b> on the by-products production. Our present work suggested that, there are high relations between the qualitative and quantitative constituent of these halophytic plants which growing near {{to each other in}} the same environment...|$|R
40|$|Deliverable 7. 1 {{reports the}} lay-out and the {{objectives}} of the experimental setups for individual module testing and integrated system testing of the sweet-pepper harvesting robot. Testing environments and conditions for laboratory test as well as for greenhouse experiments are defined and described. The laboratory environment and conditions are created to mimic the end-user greenhouse. This includes <b>imitation</b> sweet-pepper <b>plant</b> parts and an indoor rail system. The laboratory setup is created to be more controlled and has less variance than a real greenhouse. Further on performance indicators are specified for all hard- and software modules. Modules to be tested can be categorized in hardware (trolley, manipulator, end-effector, cameras, illumination, depth sensor) and software (GUI, state machine, motion planning, fruit detection, ripeness determination, obstacle detection). For the integrated system performance indicators were selected based on measures known from the predecessor project Crops. These measures include next to others the overall harvest success rate, fruit damage rate and cycle time. Different test scenarios for both laboratory and greenhouse conditions are defined to be able to obtain quantitative data of the performance of individual modules and also of the integrated system. For the modules of the advanced system more detailed information will become available later in the project and after the evaluation {{of the results of the}} basic system. Upcoming deliverables of work package 7 will therefore contain a special section describing the reviewed and updated test plan and the performance measures for these modules...|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} {{literally}} his hand, indeed, {{that he tried}} at first; for the earliest decoration upon paleolithic pottery is made by pressing the fingers into the clay so as to produce a couple of deep parallel furrows, which is the sole attempt at ornament on M. Joly's Nabrigas specimen; while the urns and drinking-cups taken from our English long barrows are adorned with really pretty and effective patterns, produced by pressing {{the tip of the}} finger and the nail into the plastic material. It is wonderful what capital and varied results you can get with no more recondite graver than the human finger-nail, sometimes turned front downward, sometimes back downward, and sometimes used to egg up the moist clay into small jagged and relieved designs. Most of these patterns are more or less plaitlike in arrangement, evidently suggested to the mind of the potter by the primitive marks of the old basketwork. But, as time went on, the early artist learned to press into his service new implements, pieces of wood, bone scrapers, and the flint knife itself, with which he incised more regular patterns, straight or zigzag lines, rows of dots, squares and triangles, concentric circles, and even the mystic cross and swastika, the sacred symbols of yet unborn and undreamt-of religions. As yet, there was no direct <b>imitation</b> of <b>plant</b> or animal forms; once only, on a single specimen from a Swiss lake dwelling, are the stem and veins of a leaf dimly figured on the handiwork of the European prehistoric potter. Ornament in its pure form, as pattern merely, had begun to exist; imitative work as such was yet unknown, or almost unknown, to the eastern hemisphere.|$|R
40|$|Insect pheromones offer {{potential}} for managing pests of crop plants. Volatility and instability are problems for deployment in agriculture {{but could be}} solved by expressing genes for the biosynthesis of pheromones in the crop plants. This has now been achieved by genetically engineering a hexaploid variety of wheat to release (E) -?-farnesene (E?f), the alarm pheromone for many pest aphids, using a synthetic gene based on a sequence from peppermint with a plastid targeting amino acid sequence, {{with or without a}} gene for biosynthesis of the precursor farnesyl diphosphate. Pure E?f was produced in stably transformed wheat lines with no other detectable phenotype but requiring targeting of the gene produced to the plastid. In laboratory behavioural assays, three species of cereal aphids were repelled and foraging was increased for a parasitic natural enemy. Although these studies show considerable {{potential for}} aphid control, field trials employing the single and double constructs showed no reduction in aphids or increase in parasitism. Insect numbers were low and climatic conditions erratic suggesting the need for further trials or a closer <b>imitation,</b> in the <b>plant,</b> of alarm pheromone release. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Quite surprisingly, historians {{know little}} about Hippocrates, the {{physician}} {{often referred to as}} "the father of medicine". However, we do know that he was a strong advocate of the use of medicinal plants to prevent and cure diseases. He recorded between three hundred and four hundred plant remedies in his writing and during the middle ages herbal remedies were passed down from generation to generation. Although the church emphasized faith healing over other forms of healing, Christian monks would preserve many of the early Greek and Roman medical texts, later growing their own herbs in the monasteries. By the time the colonizers settled in the new world, they brought with them some knowledge of herbal medicine. This in turn was shared with the Native Americans and other indigenous peoples of the new world who practiced ethnobotanical rituals as a daily and integral part of their lives. Most recently beginning in the 1800 's, while chemical drugs became popular with the medical establishment and those who could afford it, herbal medicine continued to be practiced by those who could not afford the later or who were strong believers in natural medicine. While chemotherapy has brought us many life-saving drugs, today nearly fifty percent of commonly used drugs are either plant derivatives or contain the equivalent of a chemical <b>imitation</b> of a <b>plant</b> compound. Indeed Digitalis, Aspirin, Reserpine, Quinine, Tetracycline and the ever useful Penicillin are all members of this list. In fact according to the World Health Organization, herbal medicine today is still the primary source of health care for approximately eighty percent of the worlds population...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{peak surface}} shear stress {Mathematical expression} {{on the ground}} beneath {{vegetation}} canopies {{is responsible for the}} onset of particle entrainment and its precise and accurate prediction is essential when modelling soil, snow or sand erosion. This study investigates shear-stress partitioning, i. e. the fraction of the total fluid stress on the entire canopy that acts directly on the surface, for live vegetation canopies (plant species: Lolium perenne) using measurements in a controlled wind-tunnel environment. Rigid, non-porous wooden blocks instead of the plants were additionally tested for the purpose of comparison since previous wind-tunnel studies used exclusively artificial <b>plant</b> <b>imitations</b> for their experiments on shear-stress partitioning. The drag partitioning model presented by Raupach (Boundary-Layer Meteorol 60 : 375 - 395, 1992) and Raupach et al. (J Geophys Res 98 : 3023 - 3029, 1993), which allows the prediction of the total shear stress t on the entire canopy as well as the peak {Mathematical expression} and the average {Mathematical expression} shear-stress ratios, is tested against measurements to determine the model parameters and the model's ability to account for shape differences of various roughness elements. It was found that the constant c, needed to determine the total stress t and which was unspecified to date, can be assumed a value of about c = 0. 27. Values for the model parameter m, which accounts for the difference between the spatial surface average {Mathematical expression} and the peak {Mathematical expression} shear stress, are difficult to determine because m {{is a function of the}} roughness density, the wind velocity and the roughness element shape. A new definition for a parameter a is suggested as a substitute for m. This a parameter is found to be more closely universal and solely a function of the roughness element shape. It is able to predict the peak surface shear stress accurately. Finally, a method is presented to determine the new a parameter for different kinds of roughness elements...|$|R
