60|$|The cook smiled, but faintly. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> {{but the old}} man’s gaze sent all {{the ideas}} out of his head.|$|E
60|$|While the Kalidah {{was making}} good its escape Cap'n Bill took his pipe {{from his pocket}} and filled it with tobacco and lighted it. Then, as he puffed out the smoke, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what could be done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me {{what you}} have done to him," [...] she wailed. [...] "Tell {{me what you}} have done." [...] Redwood took her hand and led her to the sofa, while <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a {{satisfactory}} line of defence.|$|E
50|$|This {{second issue}} focuses on Spider-Man as <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{a gift to}} give to Mary Jane Watson for Valentine's Day. The story was written by Tom Beland and with art by Cory Walker and Cliff Rathburn.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{can come}} in with your {{habitual}} truthfulness where Dan wouldn't know what to do, poor fellow. You'll have the moral courage to come {{right to the point}} when he would like to shillyshally, and you can be frank while <b>he's</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how <b>to</b> make y-e-s spell no." ...|$|R
60|$|Herbert made {{no reply}} to this, but his {{expression}} suggested that <b>he</b> was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|R
60|$|A bitter ache {{filled his}} heart at the remembrance of her treachery. The baseness {{of it all}} was so appalling. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> if he had ever wronged her; {{wondered}} if perhaps she loved someone else, and wished him out of her way.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> to imagine, {{to argue}} with himself. Treacherous and false himself, he at once {{suspected}} treachery. He imagined that some sycophant, hanging to the Pompadour's skirts, had succeeded in winning her good graces sufficiently {{to be allowed to}} do this errand for her, instead of himself.|$|E
60|$|That was strange. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how {{it could}} be. But the dusk, {{deepening}} in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts. The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts {{to be done for}} the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began to hum tunelessly.|$|E
60|$|All of {{this book}} is {{interesting}} {{on account of the}} sorcerer's methods and the attractiveness of some of his characters and the repulsiveness of the rest, but no part of it is so much so as are the chapters wherein <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> thinks he sets forth the causes which led to Shelley's desertion of his wife in 1814.|$|R
60|$|Dick did {{not answer}} for some time. <b>He</b> was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it out. Presently, he reined in his horse suddenly.|$|R
5000|$|The leader shouts out [...] "Fire on the mountain!" [...] All {{the players}} respond with [...] "Fire!" [...] but stay lying down. Then the leader shouts out [...] "Fire on the river!" [...] Again the players reply with [...] "Fire" [...] {{but do not}} jump up. This {{continues}} on with the leader changing the last word of the phrase. <b>He</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of as many different places for the fire.|$|R
60|$|Huddled up in {{a corner}} of the cabin <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Tredgold and Stobell were strangely silent, and even the voice of Brisket had ceased. The {{suspense}} became unbearable. Then suddenly a faint creaking and straining of timbers apprised him of the fact that the Fair Emily was under way.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{his head}} grew clearer. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> How long had he? Not {{more than twenty}} minutes at the outside. Well, death was sure and he would meet it bravely. But to wait--to wait helplessly! He should go; mad with the horror of it before those endless minutes would have passed! ...|$|E
60|$|So Soames went {{steadily}} on {{with his}} defence. Yet it would be idle to say that his mind was at ease. He was suffering {{from a sense of}} impending trouble, that had haunted him for some time past. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it physical--a condition of his liver--but knew that it was not.|$|E
6000|$|Hal did not reply. <b>He</b> was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> What was Ferris' {{object in}} telling Hardwick {{he had been}} {{mentioned}} {{in connection with the}} matter? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorry," [...] he said presently, with an effort. <b>He</b> seemed <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> [...] "The last," [...] he murmured, [...] "the last of this silly universe. What a mess--" ...|$|R
50|$|The eldest {{brother of}} the family. He's a 25-year-old romance novelist who likes to dress in women's clothing. He claims his {{feminine}} side to be because of his job requires a woman and <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of how they would feel in situations. He seems the most closest and cuddliest {{when it comes to}} his little sister. He is overprotective of her. He doesn't like cats. In volume 7, Masashi is confessed by Sakura which causes huge commotions and troubles in the family. Masashi's first love was Fumiko-san who is Sakura-chan's mother.|$|R
60|$|Once {{he found}} himself {{wondering}} why he was risking his life to avenge or rescue this girl whom he hated so. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that {{it was for the}} ransom--yes, that was it, the ransom. If he found her alive, and rescued her he should claim the lion's share of the booty.|$|E
60|$|He {{followed}} her, but {{she kept}} nimbly ahead of him until they came {{out into the open}} golf course. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> but failed. Never in his orderly life had anything so precipitate happened to him. He caught up with her, devoured her with his eyes, and beheld in marriage a delirium.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. Bill {{gathered}} {{that the}} other was looking on the interview as terminated, {{and that she was}} expecting him to go, and he had not begun to say what he wanted to say. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a way of introducing the subject of Claire that should not seem too abrupt.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} more to be said on either side, and yet <b>he</b> lingered, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> over any {{circumstance}} which might lend a clew {{in the search for}} Margaret and of the mysterious Mr. Lithgow.|$|R
50|$|Reflecting back on {{his career}} and its three knee surgeries, Sampson {{admitted}} that he had attempted to come back too quickly from them, and said that <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what could have been.|$|R
60|$|As Kirk had endeavoured {{temporarily}} {{to forget}} Ruth, so had <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Mamie. It {{was the only}} thing he was ashamed of in the whole affair, the shock he must have given her.|$|R
60|$|Above all now {{he wanted}} to be cool and calculating, to curb the {{excitement}} which the Latin blood in him called forth at every mention of the loved one's name. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Percy, of his calmness, his easy banter with an enemy; he resolved to act as Percy would act under these circumstances.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{where he}} had put the matches, and remembered there were some on the widow-sill. The room was so dark {{that he could not}} see the foot of the bed, and in his fatuity he had barricaded himself in the room with the loathsome reptile which was to work the brown man’s vengeance.|$|E
60|$|It {{presently}} forced itself upon Denton's {{mind that}} this remarkable conversation was being repeated in indignant tones to more sympathetic hearers, and that it gave rise to astonishment and ironical laughter. They looked at Denton with manifestly enhanced interest. A curious perception of isolation dawned upon him. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of his press and its unfamiliar peculiarities....|$|E
5000|$|When {{he comes}} to, {{he finds the}} [...] "retired optometrist" [...] dead, also with an ice pick in his neck. The room has been searched and is in disarray. From the kind of {{containers}} that have been opened, it seems that someone {{was looking for a}} small object. As Marlowe surveys the scene, <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a spot that the killer may have missed. He remembers the optometrist's toupee, which is now fixed to the dead man's head. He removes the toupee and finds a claim check for the Bay City Camera Shop. He keeps the claim check and notifies the Los Angeles police of the murder.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{out some}} plan to {{distract}} her attention {{he heard a}} wild cry from across the clearing. He looked and saw a black warrior standing beneath the very tree {{in which he had}} killed the murderer of Kala an hour before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you any {{difficulties}} about doctrines--about the Articles?" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>trying</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{the question}} simply for Fred's sake.|$|R
6000|$|The cat {{was out of}} the bag now. Hopkins {{realized}} that Merrick had some knowledge or at least suspicion of this plot. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> what to do, and {{it occurred to him that}} if his visitor positively knew anything he would not act in this absurd manner, but come straight to the point. So he ignored the speech, merely saying: ...|$|E
60|$|Spotty {{knew that}} Billy Mink was {{making fun of}} him, but he is too good-natured to lose his temper over a little thing like that. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{something}} smart to say in reply, but Spotty is a slow thinker {{as well as a}} slow walker, and before he could think of anything, Billy was talking once more.|$|E
60|$|The {{pawnbroker}} made no reply. The {{suggestion of}} poisoning {{was a welcome}} one. It was preferable to the sinister hintings of the brown man. But {{even if it had}} been poisoned it was a very singular coincidence, unless indeed the Burmese had himself poisoned it <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> whether it could have been possible for his visitor to have administered poison undetected.|$|E
60|$|They passed {{several of}} the little stone and log houses, and women greeted them as they went by and {{children}} peered shyly from the doors. <b>He</b> kept <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of something <b>to</b> say, and, failing in that, determined to have one good look under the hood before he left her.|$|R
6000|$|He had the dismaying thought, [...] "I'll {{never play}} the mouth-organ to her again.... We won't ever {{sit in the}} rose-arbor while I play the mouth-organ to her. Where is she? Yes! Yes! This is her hand." [...] <b>He</b> was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> now. Something said to him, sharply, [...] "Suicide is wicked." ...|$|R
50|$|In Injustice: Gods Among Uss prequel comic, {{when the}} Justice League come {{to remove the}} {{patients}} of Arkham, only to be resisted by Batman and Nightwing, the Riddler watches the argument between the heroes in silence. He {{was about to make}} a riddle but Cyborg orders him to be silent. Cyborg next plans to remove him but is stopped by Batman when he activates a virus he had uploaded into Cyborg years ago. Riddler is freed by Harley Quinn alongside all the other inmates to attack the heroes. The Riddler is seen about to crush Batmans head with a large rock but hesitates as <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a riddle to say before committing the act, allowing the Green Arrow to knock him out with a boxing glove arrow, before being beaten down by Robin.|$|R
