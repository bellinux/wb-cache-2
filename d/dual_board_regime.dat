Our results are robust across a number of econometric models that control for different types of market valuation proxies and endogeneity problems. Our findings offer empirical support for agency theory, which suggests that independent DBLS increases the capacity of the board to effectively advise, monitor and discipline top management, and thereby improving market valuation.

40|$|My thesis {{attempts}} to search {{evidence on the}} performance of the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> and its impact on Hong Kong’s economy. Three sets of related questions have been set up and carefully investigated in my empirical models. Chapter 2 investigates output growth and inflation rate in order to compare the historical performance of free-floating and currency <b>board</b> <b>regimes</b> for Hong Kong. I apply some advanced econometrics tools to identify my structural VAR models and offer appropriate analysis. My first empirical model suggests that output returns to a steady state much faster in a flexible exchange rate regime than in a fixed exchange rate regime after an aggregate demand shock. My evidence offers an essential answer to the question on why the recovering process of Hong Kong from the Asian financial crisis lasted longer compared with the other Asian countries with a flexible exchange rate regime. Furthermore, my counter-factual analysis suggests that a free-floating regime may generate much smaller output variance in Hong Kong and deliver higher output and price levels to Hong Kong. Chapter 3 investigates the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> from 1984 to 2007, by considering some important variables which have significant impacts on Hong Kong’s economy. For instance my empirical models attempt to examine the economic relationships with the US economy under the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> and the close economic relationships with China under a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement with Mainland China. My models emphasises the importance of entrepot trade for Hong Kong’s economy. Evidence shows that those exogenous variables have significant impacts on Hong Kong’s economy, and they are one of the important factors when considering the choice of exchange rate regimes. My empirical evidence indicates some new findings which contradict existing studies which conclude that the Chinese economy is much less significant than the US economy in explaining Hong Kong’s output variance. Chapter 4 examines the real effective exchange rate misalignment of the two economies, Hong Kong and Singapore, and offers new policy implications on the choice of exchange rate regimes. Entrepot trades are essential to both economies. While the literature has paid little attention to such an important character and shown evidence of larger scale REER misalignment in Hong Kong compared with Singapore, my model reveals that including such an important variable has remarkably improved the model and offered strikingly different conclusions. I have applied Vector Error Correction Modelling and the Johansson Method in identifying the empirical models. Evidence suggests that Hong Kong performs well in terms of small real exchange rate misalignment even under its currency broad regime. My thesis indicates that although there are limitations in the currency broad regime in terms of relatively slow recovery from external demand shocks and relatively larger output variance, the regime is still a preferable choice for Hong Kong, especially when we consider the close economic link with Mainland China and the United States. Moreover, there is no evidence in my models to suggest that the real exchange rate misalignment was significantly larger in the case of Hong Kong’s currency <b>board</b> <b>regime.</b> Thesis (Ph.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{monetary}} policy actions through which the central banks in the Sub-Saharan African countries have searched to eliminate the negative impacts of the shocks facing their economies. We compare two types of monetary policy regimes: a currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> (in the CFA zone countries) and an inflation targeting policy regime (in Ghana and South Africa). We compare the properties of both policies when the central banks respond to three negative shocks hitting the economies: a recessionary demand shock, a supply shock increasing inflation and a negative fiscal shock. We propose an FPAS model (forecasting and monetary policy analysis system) that extends the usual FPAS models used in the literature to evaluate the impact of several policies in response to different types of exogenous shocks. We find that both policies are inappropriate to help the economies exiting from the effects of negative demand shocks (the adjustment relies mainly on fiscal policy), both are essential when negative shocks to primary balance occur (fiscal policy aggravates the negative effects of the shocks), while inflation targeting dominates the currency <b>board</b> <b>regime</b> as a strategy to cope with positive shocks to inflation...|$|R
