60|$|I CONFESS that I was {{considerably}} startled by this fresh {{proof of the}} practical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, however, {{that the whole thing}} was a pre-arranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me <b>in</b> was past <b>my</b> <b>comprehension.</b> When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.|$|R

Here {{is a young man}} wishing to pay his addresses to you, with everything to recommend him: not merely situation in life, fortune, and character, but with more than common agreeableness, with address and conversation pleasing to everybody. And he is not an acquaintance of to-day; you have now known him some time. His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend, and he has been doing that for your brother, which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there been no other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on. He has done it already." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify how we grasp the concept of "play in early {{childhood}} through examining two episodes from the author's experience. The analysis is based on some phenomenological theories, especially those of J. Henriot, M. Merleau-Ponty and F. Kummel. Findings are as follows. First, "play" exists when we name a child's behavior "play" or recognize it to be "play" Second, the above-mentioned action is not only useful but also a cause of "misunderstanding" <b>in</b> <b>my</b> process of <b>comprehension.</b> Third, when I grasp a child's experience, it synchronously transforms my existence. Finally, it is necessary to break away from a tendency of closed perception in order to transcend this misunderstanding and reach a new understanding...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has indicated the importance of real life texts in providing learners with meaningful reading materials and activities that may equip them with skills to respond well to their personal, social and cognitive needs. This paper intends to share the practices of using such materials <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Elementary Reading <b>Comprehension</b> course I did last semester (March- June 2015). In selecting the materials from various sources, I used Haliday‘s functions of language as a reference by assessing whether a text is (1) instrumental, (2) regulatory, (3) interactional, (4) personal, (5) heurisitic, (6) imaginative, or (7) informative. The paper describes the use of internet-based authentic materials to promote e-learning and mobile-learning that enhances ubiquitous learning. This way, the students are actively engaged and more well prepared to critically comprehend the materials, present their views and interpretations, ask and answer questions as well as make connection of (1) text to self, (2) text to world, and text to other text(s), individually or collaboratively. In this way, the learning experiences embrace the four big Cs of education namely: Critical thinking, Collaboration, Communication and Creativity...|$|R
