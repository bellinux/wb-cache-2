40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{nutrient}} solution concentration on potato plant growth and minituber yield were determined in a sand closed hydroponic system. Minitubers and micropropagated plantlets of the cv. 'Macaca' were used. Treatments were five nutrient solution concentrations at electrical conductivities (EC) of 1. 0 (T 1), 2. 2 (T 2), 3. 4 (T 3), 4. 7 (T 4) and 5. 8 dS m- 1 (T 5). The split plot randomised experimental design was used with three replications.

However, higher dry mass of minitubers was found with micropropagated plantlets compared to minitubers. The concentration of the nutrient solution did not affect minituber number.

Temperature can strongly influence bacterial populations. Addition of benefical micro-organisms leads to increase plant resilience against diseases.
