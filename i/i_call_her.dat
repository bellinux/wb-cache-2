2500|$|In 2004 author Naomi Wolf {{wrote an}} article for New York Magazine accusing Harold Bloom of a sexual [...] "encroachment" [...] {{more than two decades}} earlier, by {{touching}} her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a [...] "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, [...] "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge." [...] When asked about the allegations in 2015, Bloom stated, [...] "I refuse to even use the name of this person. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter. When she came to the door of my house unbidden, my youngest son turned her away. Once, I was walking up to campus, and she fell in with me and said, 'May I walk with you, Professor Bloom?' I said nothing." ...|$|E

6000|$|He paused--his {{emotions}} for {{the instant}} bereft him of speech. After an interval, he muttered {{to himself in}} a low, moaning voice--'I <b>called</b> <b>her</b> harlot! My pure, innocent child! <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> harlot--I <b>called</b> <b>her</b> harlot!' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> {{from where}} <b>I</b> stood--"Annabel Lee!" [...] She {{lifted her head}} and shook back her hair, and gazed at me startled and intent. I went nearer.|$|R

6000|$|... "Indeed, I don't wonder. She is so {{good and}} patient. Such a dear thing! Mary and <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> the bright spot in our parish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> silly. She {{is not very}} wise; but she has no pretensions--absolutely none--so that one is not struck with {{anything}} incongruous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's faint to-day--tired--nothing more--" [...] Thus did I lie, alas for me [...] . <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> at her {{chamber door}} As one who scarce had {{strength}} to be.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{not talk}} to me, Jonathan, like that," [...] she said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> cross-grained I mean that she is running counter to her own happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Haverley!" [...] {{repeated}} Miss Panney, [...] "she's {{nothing but}} a girl, with her hair down her back and her skirts a foot from the ground. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> a child." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Libby, [...] "that's what I thought. Better {{take my hand}} again," [...] and he secured that of Mrs. Maynard, who {{continued}} her descent. [...] "I suppose I don't understand her exactly. Perhaps {{she did n't like}} my not <b>calling</b> <b>her</b> Doctor. <b>I</b> did n't <b>call</b> <b>her</b> anything. <b>I</b> suppose she thought I was dodging it. I was.

6000|$|... "Mother's too proud: {{she wants}} to do {{everything}} herself. That's why <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> to wait on you, sir.

6000|$|... "That's no good," [...] {{said the}} young man, restlessly. [...] "I've tried it. Only {{the other day}} <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> 'a saucy little kipper,' {{and the way she}} went on, anybody would have thought I'd insulted her. Can't see a joke, I s'pose. Where is she now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There you are, you see," [...] said Tom with sombre triumph; [...] "you oughtn't to {{have noticed}} {{a thing like}} that. It oughtn't to matter to you what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her.</b> I always {{think of her as}} Dolly." ...|$|E

60|$|On our way upstairs, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> {{attention}} to the sudden disappearance of Mrs. Crupp's pitfalls, and also to the prints of recent footsteps.

6000|$|... "Oh yes, you must, Jeff. You've no {{idea what}} a sweet girl she has become. I am quite charmed with her--so modest, and unselfish, and clever, and good, and--and, in short, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> the four F's, for she is fair, fragile, fervent, and funny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well,' said Bounderby. 'I {{was born}} in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me. Do I excuse her for it? No. Have I ever excused her for it? Not I. What do <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> for it? <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>her</b> {{probably}} the very worst woman that ever lived in the world, except my drunken grandmother. There's no family pride about me, there's no imaginative sentimental humbug about me. I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour, what I should call her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping. So, with this man. He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond, that's what he is, in English.' ...|$|E
60|$|There came no response, {{and after}} some moments, {{becoming}} alarmed, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> to <b>her</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Simply {{because it}} seemed a meanness to play the spy on her in <b>her</b> solitude, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> name. But her start of {{surprise}} was mere feigning.

6000|$|As I {{had been}} discoursing about Mary's charms Schneider listened with much {{complacency}} and attention: when I spoke about her fortune, his interest redoubled; and when <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>her</b> father an aristocrat, the worthy ex-Jesuit gave a grin of satisfaction, {{which was really}} quite terrible. O fool that I was to trust him so far! ...|$|R
