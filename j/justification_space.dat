The scientific consequences of these space activities have been to revolutionize the study of the solar system, to open the high-energy (x-ray, gamma ray, and cosmic ray) window to astrophysical observation, and to significantly influence the study of Earth itself, especially its atmosphere. Nevertheless, scientific research in itself never has been the principal <b>justification</b> for <b>space</b> expenditures...|$|R

Land prices are increasing in the percentage of subdivision acreage developers are required to keep in forest, suggesting that forest conservation regulations increase the amounts of forested open space that developers provide. Benefits from open-space amenities remain largely internal to the subdivision, so that land market incentives mitigate the <b>justification</b> for open <b>space</b> preservation policies. Consistent with theoretical predictions that zoning promotes sprawl, we find that minimum-lot-size zoning constrains developers of closer-in subdivisions where public sewers are available. ...|$|R

If she does not provide <b>justification,</b> her message <b>space</b> is restricted, but the message is costless. I show that the principal justifies her evaluation to the agent if the evaluation indicates bad performance. The justification assures the agent that the principal has not distorted the evaluation downwards. In equilibrium, the wage increases in the agent s performance, when the principal justifies her evaluation. For good performance, however, the principal pays a constant high wage without justification...|$|R

It included modern features like automatic word wrap, full-screen editing, dual-column printing, search and replace, undo, block editing and even a print preview feature that allowed users to view a printable page by scrolling across the screen. Printing attributes were set directly into the document using control characters. This allowed direct changes to formatting such as margins, <b>spacing,</b> <b>justification,</b> etc. AtariWriter has only one menu, the main menu, which featured creating and editing documents, file directory, file management and printing.|$|R
40|$|Agro-environmental {{governance}} {{associated with}} the issue of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea Region relies on accountability as a central norm to secure legitimacy of transnational cooperation. However, owing to the coexistence of different traditions of governance the implementation of nutrient reduction targets requires negotiation between competing definitions of accountability. This paper presents results from an empirical analysis of the implementability of nutrient reduction targets in one riparian state, namely Denmark, focusing on the government’s Green Growth Strategy. It charts the policy adaptation route to explore how stakeholders mobilise claims within different sense-making perspectives on governance in order to seek to keep each other accountable. Based on the findings, an analytical framework is derived which helps identify where professionals in agro-environmental governance may more explicitly address the subtle ways in which accountability is created and undermined through different modes of <b>justification</b> in <b>spaces</b> of ambiguity between competing governance traditions. In relation to the wider accountability literature, it is demonstrated how it is possible to apply theory and methods from the most recent multi-stakeholder school in natural resource governance research to broaden the work within social and environmental accounting to focus more explicitly on the totality of stakeholder interactions rather than single organisations...|$|R

The root of the current essay is modelled by a professional experience, what I got hold of in the Regional Penalty Institution of Youthfuls in Pécs, where as an expectant librarian I lead on therapy for the prisoners. Bibliotherapy has got many targets: healing of psychical problems, expansion of personality, developement of self-knowledge, social talents, empathy and tolerance, construction of community and recreation. The principle of bibliotherapy is that reading could help in, can help the reader begin to investigate and explore aspects of themselves, to listen to their peers, to increase their ability to communicate ideas and feelings to men of authority who they thought would never listen to them, and to engage in dialogue in a democratic agent where all ideas are valid. My conviction is, this method has an increasingly <b>justification</b> in <b>space</b> of profession, social and education. In my essay I tried to set out and present what role could the bibliotherapy have in the services of library on strength of my experiences and non-fiction, and what positive effects could the bibliotherapy have, in my case in an exspecially and closed clime, like the prison...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} main {{approaches}} within the AI community to constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and constraint optimisation problems (COP) : Domainfiltering, Tree-search, and Repair-based methods. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present an algorithm, no-good backmarking, that unifies these techniques. It is repair-based and guarantees to find a solution (optimal) to a CSP (COP), if one exists. The no-good backmarking algorithm is a development of an approach called nogood <b>justifications.</b> The search <b>space</b> of the proposed algorithm is controlled by a backmarking strategy which records generic patterns of partial labels that are found to be inconsistent. Variables that contribute to inconsistencies are re-labelled in the spirit of dependency directed backjumping. The proposed method accepts a re-labelling if it reduces the number of conflicts (or the cost) of the current label. Repair-based methods, of which this is an example, have been shown to be useful for large combinatorial optim [...] ...|$|R

For low power devices with advanced power management features and more stringent power budgets, power-aware testing {{is even more}} mandatory. Effective and efficient test set postprocessing techniques based on X-identification and power-aware X-filling have been proposed for external and embedded deterministic test. This work proposes a novel X-filling algorithm for combinational and broadcast-scan-based test compression schemes which have great practical significance. The algorithm ensures compressibility of test cubes using a SAT-based check. Compared to methods based on topological <b>justification,</b> the solution <b>space</b> of the compressed test vector is not pruned early during the search. Thus, this method allows much more precise low-power X-filling of test vectors. Experiments on benchmark and industrial circuits show the applicability to capture-power reduction during scan testing...|$|R

25|$|The en dash – {{always with}} spaces in running text when, as {{discussed}} in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the not spaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated {{by the use of}} thin spaces, hair spaces, or even zero-width spaces {{on the sides of the}} em dash. This provides the appearance of a not spaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full <b>justification,</b> the adjacent <b>spaces</b> may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.|$|R
30|$|The {{opportunity}} to rebel is strongly {{linked to the}} strength of the insurgent organisation, which affects whether recruitment mechanisms, arms [52], information [3], and logistical capacity make it possible to rebel in an organised or meaningful way. The strength of an insurgent organisation increases in the presence of weak government institutions, limited in their ability to identify and neutralise insurgent agents [2, 3, 49, 53]. Demographic precursors for insurgency establish conditions of instability that can be exploited by insurgent groups to provide political <b>justifications</b> and normative <b>space</b> for rebellion. An existing territorial dispute can evolve into an enduring ethnic or sectarian rivalry, providing the fault-lines for civil conflict and increased fractionalisation [54]. The presence of foreign military forces staging an intervention can inhibit the power of any party to achieve significant political progress through force of arms, paradoxically often making conflict longer-lasting and more intractable [55]. A recent previous civil war can ensure that the population has both lurking hostilities and access to weapons. The Balkan wars are one example of the facilitating effect that weapons-saturation has upon making participation in civil wars feasible [56]. A supportive foreign diaspora can make funding insurgent activities easier, while the social exclusion of certain groups makes conflict increasingly easier to justify and prosecute as the excluded group grows in size.|$|R
40|$|Realization of {{the full}} {{potential}} of photorefractive materials in device technology is seriously impeded by our inability to achieve controlled formation of critical defects during single crystal growth and by difficulties in meeting the required degree of compositional uniformity on a micro-scale over macroscopic dimensions. The exact nature and origin of the critical defects which control photorefractivity could not as yet be identified because of gravitational interference. There exists, however, strong evidence that the density of defect formation and their spatial distribution are adversely affected by gravitational interference which precludes the establishment of quantifiable and controllable heat and mass transfer conditions during crystal growth. The current, NASA sponsored research at MIT is directed at establishing {{a basis for the}} development of a comprehensive approach to the optimization of property control during melt growth of photorefractive materials, making use of the m-g environment, provided in the International Space Station. The objectives to be pursued in m-g research on photorefractive BSO (Bi 12 SiO 20) are: (a) identification of the x-level(s) responsible for photorefractivity in undoped BSO; (b) development of approaches leading to the control of x-level formation at uniform spatial distribution; (c) development of doping and processing procedures for optimization of the critical, application specific parameters, spectral response, sensitivity, response time and matrix stability. The presentation will focus on: the rationale for the <b>justification</b> of the <b>space</b> experiment, ground-based development efforts, design considerations for the space experiments, strategic plan of the space experiments, and approaches to the quantitative analysis of the space experiments...|$|R
40|$|Minimum parking {{requirements}} {{are the norm}} for urban and suburban development in the United States (Davidson and Dolnick (2002)). The <b>justification</b> for parking <b>space</b> requirements is that overflow parking will occupy nearby street or off-street parking. Shoup (1999) and Willson (1995) provides cases where {{there is reason to}} believe that parking space requirements have forced parcel developers to place more parking than they would in the absence of parking requirements. If the effect of parking minimums is to significantly increase the land area devoted to parking, then the increase in impervious surfaces would likely cause water quality degradation, increased flooding, and decreased groundwater recharge. However, to our knowledge the existing literature does not test the effect of parking minimums on the amount of lot space devoted to parking beyond a few case studies. This paper tests the hypothesis that parking space requirements cause an oversupply of parking by examining the implicit marginal value of land allocated to parking spaces. This is an indirect test of the effects of parking requirements that is similar to Glaeser and Gyourko (2003). A simple theoretical model shows that the marginal value of additional parking to the sale price should be equal to the cost of land plus the cost of parking construction. We estimate the marginal values of parking and lot area with spatial methods using a large data set from the Los Angeles area non-residential property sales and find that for most of the property types the marginal value of parking is significantly below that of the parcel area. This evidence supports the contention that minimum parking requirements significantly increase the amount of parcel area devoted to parking. ...|$|R
40|$|The second {{parliament}} {{constitutes an}} important landmark {{in the political}} development of New Zealand, for with it cabinet government, that heritage of the English parliamentary system came into being; as in England, not by legislative enactment, but as a convention of the constitution. The fact that the inauguration of responsible government marked the vindication of the principles for which the first parliament had struggled, must serve as a <b>justification</b> for the <b>space</b> occupied in this history by the story of those struggles. The establishment of responsible government must necessarily occupy an important place in any history of the second parliament, {{and in order to}} understand the importance of this development, some account of the events which had preceded it is necessary. The main original sources from which the material for this account has been gathered are the “Parliamentary Debates” of 1856 - 58 and 1858 - 60, compiled at a later date from speeches of members and other available material; and the unpublished Journal of Henry Sewell. Sewell was, as a member of the partially responsible ministry of the first parliament, leader of the first short-lived responsible ministry of the second parliament and a member of the Stafford ministry, and was thus in a position to give an account of all the more important parliamentary happenings from inside. His journal is particularly valuable for the light which it throws upon the events of the time and the interesting character sketches which it gives us of the more important men in the parliamentary sphere. Another work which has furnished important information is Saunder’s “History of New Zealand”. Saunders also was a member of New Zealand parliaments almost continuously from 1861 - 96. Much space has been devoted to the subject of native affairs, but that may be justified by the fact that, in view of the seriousness of the native situation, a great deal of the time of the parliament was actually spend in the discussion in the native war, which occupied the time of the parliament during practically the whole of the last session, it is necessary to know something of the situation among the natives, which had led to the establishment of the “Maori King” movement and the land league, and of the native feud in Taranaki which was closely connected with the question of land sales. The treatment of the subject throughout has been topical rather than chronological, and although it has been impossible to deal with all the subjects which were discussed by the parliament or all the measures which were placed upon the statue books, an attempt has been made to follow the course of the more important movements and those most likely to affect the subsequent development of the colon...|$|R
