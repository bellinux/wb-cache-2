This study, based on analyses of flow cytometry data, Feulgen microdensitometry data, chromosome counts, and stomatal length measurements, was performed to determine whether polyploidy could be responsible {{for some of the}} intraspecific phenotypic variation observed. Vanilla planifolia exhibited an important variation in somatic chromosome number in root cells, as well as endoreplication as revealed by flow cytometry. Nevertheless, the 2 C-values of the 50 accessions studied segregated into three distinct groups averaging 5. 03 pg (for most accessions), 7. 67 pg (for the 'Stérile' phenotypes), and 10. 00 pg (for the 'Grosse Vanille' phenotypes). For the three groups, chromosome numbers varied from 16 to 32, 16 to 38, and 22 to 54 chromosomes per cell, respectively. The stomatal length showed a significant variation from 37. 75 microm to 48. 25 microm. Given that 2 C-values, mean chromosome numbers, and stomatal lengths were positively correlated and that 'Stérile' and 'Grosse Vanille' accessions were indistinguishable from 'Classique' accessions using molecular markers, the occurrence of recent autotriploid and autotetraploid types in Reunion Island is supported. This is the first report showing evidence of a recent autopolyploidy in V. planifolia contributing to the phenotypic variation observed in this species...|$|E
40|$|L-tyrosine (L-Tyr) is a conditionally {{indispensable}} {{amino acid}} for Equids. The biologic role of L-Tyr is ubiquitous, {{being involved in}} the production of hair and skin pigments. The white donkeys of Asinara <b>island</b> <b>display</b> a peculiar white coat, with life-long hypopigmentation of skin, hairs and eyes. Our results underline how the white phenotype is due to a disorder of melanin biosynthesis, detected in skin biopsies and on hair bulbs through immunohistochemical and enzymatic assays. The metabolic pathway of L-Tyr is compatible with the clinical frame of ocular-cutaneous albinism (OCA). The enzymatic activity in hair bulbs for the conversion of L-Tyr to L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenilalanine (L-DOPA) tested negative, but positive for L-DOPA conversion into eumelanin in the 100 % of the Asinara ’s white donkey. This is the case of a negative-tyrosinase albinism, which contemporarily excludes dietary deficiencies of phenylalanine (Phe) or L-Tyr and potential incapability of Tyr intestinal uptake or Tyr conversion from Phe. The tyrosinase (TYR) residual activity positively and significantly (P= 0. 012) correlates (P= 0. 897) with the albino phenotype of the Asinara ’s white donkey. These results definitely point to the fact that Asinara ’s white donkey population owes its phenotype to TYR residual activity, thus on genetic basis. From a comparative point of view, the albino form of the Asinara ’s white donkeys is similar to the human OCA type 1, from which however differs for positively testing to L-DOPA conversion, upon incubation of hair bulbs in L-DOPA solutions...|$|E

The introduction presents an overview of recent debates on nation, gender and identity within the context of contemporary Cuban literary history and feminist theory. Chapter one examines the textual and discursive techniques Daína Chaviano deploys in Fábulas de una abuela extraterrestre and El hombre, la hembra y el hambre to expose and denounce dominant discourses on nation and gender. In her insular and Diaspora narratives, Chaviano borrows from and contests various literary works and traditions to rewrite Cuban history and the Canon and 2 ̆ 2 talk back 2 ̆ 2 to those who have sought to construct and silence women. Chapter two investigates the ways Zoé Valdés deconstructs Cuban history and its national icons in order to represent Cubanness. Whereas the first part explores the narrative techniques Valdés and Dulce María Loynaz apply in their novels Sangre azul and Jardín, to contest traditional notions of nation and gender, the second part analyzes La nada cotidiana and elucidates how this text debunks Cuba 2 ̆ 7 s revolutionary icons. Chapter three examines the narrative and discursive strategies Yanitzia Canetti utilizes in Al otro lado and Novelita Rosa to represent and undermine gender and national identity.

40|$|Modern {{chemical}} sediments {{display a}} distinctive {{rare earth element}} + yttrium (REE + Y) pattern involving depleted LREE, positive La/La*(SN), Eu/Eu*(SN), and Y(SN) anomalies (SN = shale normalised) that is related to precipitation from circumneutral to high pH waters with solution complexation of the REEs dominated by carbonate ions. This is often interpreted as reflecting precipitation from surface waters (usually marine). The oldest broadly accepted chemical sediments are c. 3, 700 Ma amphibolite facies banded iron-formation (BIF) units in the Isua supracrustal belt, Greenland. Isua BIFs, including the BIF international reference material IF-G are {{generally considered to be}} seawater precipitates, and display these REE + Y patterns (Bolhar et al. in Earth Planet Sci Lett 222 : 43 - 60, 2004). Greenland Eoarchaean BIF metamorphosed up to granulite facies from several localities in the vicinity of Akilia (<b>island),</b> <b>display</b> REE + Y patterns identical to Isua BIF, consistent with an origin by chemical sedimentation from seawater and a paucity of clastic input. Furthermore, the much-debated magnetite-bearing siliceous unit of 2 ̆ 2 earliest life 2 ̆ 2 rocks (sample G 91 / 26) from Akilia has the same REE + Y pattern. This suggests that sample G 91 / 26 is also a chemical sediment, contrary to previous assertions (Bolhar et al. in Earth Planet Sci Lett 222 : 43 - 60, 2004), and including suggestions that the Akilia unit containing G 91 / 26 consists entirely of silica-penetrated, metasomatised, mafic rock (Fedo and Whitehouse 2002 a). Integration of our trace element data with those of Bolhar et al. (Earth Planet Sci Lett 222 : 43 - 60, 2004) demonstrates that Eoarchaean siliceous rocks in Greenland, with ages from 3. 6 to 3. 85 Ga, have diverse trace element signatures. There are now geographically-dispersed, widespread examples with Isua BIF-like REE + Y signatures, that are interpreted as chemically unaltered, albeit metamorphosed, chemical sediments. Other samples retain remnants of LREE depletion but are beginning to lose the distinct La, Eu and Y positive anomalies and are interpreted as metasomatised chemical sediments. Finally there are some siliceous samples with completely different trace element patterns that are interpreted as rocks of non-sedimentary origin, and include metasomatised mafic rocks. The positive La/La*(SN), Eu/Eu*(SN) and Y(SN) anomalies found in Isua BIFs and other Eoarchaean Greenland samples, such as G 91 / 26 from Akilia, suggests that the processes of carbonate ion complexation controlling the REE - Y patterns were already established in the hydrosphere {{at the start of the}} sedimentary record 3, 600 - 3, 850 Ma ago. This is in accord with the presence of Eoarchaean siderite-bearing marbles of sedimentary origin, and suggests that CO(2) may have been a significant greenhouse gas at that time...|$|E
40|$|On {{the large}} sand mass of Bribie Island, the {{sedimentary}} evolution related to sea level changes {{has resulted in}} marked spatial variations of aquifer properties. The main influence on groundwater behaviour is the induration of layers within the sandy sequences that comprise the island. The degree of induration controls vertical flows between the perched watertable and the underlying semi-confined regional aquifer. To identify heterogeneity within the indurated zone, an analysis of bore hydrographs was undertaken. The analysis shows that separate sections of the hydrological profile across the <b>island</b> <b>display</b> distinct unconfined or confined behaviour depending {{on the degree of}} hydrological discontinuity in the sandrock horizon. A two-dimensional (2 -D) hydrogeologic conceptual model of Bribie Island is developed for the numerical modelling process. The two-aquifer system separated by the indurated layer ("coffee rock") is incorporated into the groundwater model. The indurated layer is spatially variable in thickness, continuity and permeability. An evaluation of the recharge and drainage parameters is conducted for improvement of model accuracy, using MODFLOW software to solve the quasi three-dimensional (3 -D) flow model. The evapotranspiration (ET) parameter is tested due to the important role it has in the water balance of Bribie Island. The groundwater extraction and wastewater infiltration rates are evaluated separately for model input. Average hydraulic conductivities initially used in the numerical model for each aquifer do not match measured heads adequately. During initial model development, pilot point parameterisation of hydraulic conductivities was conducted providing a more complex distribution of the parameter and a better fit to observed water levels. Using spatial interpolation techniques, a gradual and realistic distribution of hydraulic properties is achieved rather than sharp changes between facies-related sedimentary sequences. The resultant visualisation of hydraulic conductivities supports the outcomes of the analysis of water level profiles. The model interprets and adjusts for the effects of the aquifer heterogeneity in respect to the hydraulic conductivity parameter. Areas of unconfined aquifer behaviour correspond to zones of higher hydraulic conductivities and are interpreted as regions of higher permeability due to a lesser degree of induration. Such zones of greater groundwater flow were found in the south of the island, the central swale and the northwest coastline, which act as connections to the basal aquifer enabling preferred recharge to it. Calibration is conducted in respect of the hydraulic conductivity, drainage and ET parameters. The calibration of simulated to observed hydraulic heads (objective function of 2. 96 and correlation of 0. 993) for the two layers achieved a close fit. The groundwater study demonstrates that both a statistical approach and numerical modelling are important in testing and refining the conceptual model. The modified conceptual model {{can be used as a}} basis for the construction of an improved and more reliable numerical model. The integration of geological information and spatial variability of aquifer parameters to produce a quasi three-dimensional model based on a two-aquifer conceptual model is a significant innovation of the modelling approach to Bribie Island. This approach contributes to a clearer understanding of the hydrogeological processes within the island. The investigation has contributed to a better understanding of the effects of broad and finer scale heterogeneities on groundwater dynamics in large sand mass...|$|E
