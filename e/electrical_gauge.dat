The major issues with the current roof stability monitoring system in underground coal mines include lackof systematic real time data recording scheme and using electrical sensing components that are notintrinsically safe in underground explosive workplace. Although an advanced system based on fibre opticsensing (FOS) technologies have increasingly drawn attention by mining industry, their applications in coalmines are still challenged by a number of factors, such as the survivability in large strain range, appropriatefibre encapsulation and installation methods and minimisation of measurement errors due to the straintransfer loss.

Primarily, our research is focused on determining seismic rock properties (i. e., wave velocities and attenuation) of real and artificial 50 mm diameter brine-CO 2 -bearing sandstone and sand samples that are representative host rocks of real CCS scenarios. Accordingly, we have integrated into a new triaxial cell system both an ultrasonic pulse-echo method for accurate velocity (± 0. 3 %) and attenuation (± 0. 1 dB cm- 1) measurements, and an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method to monitor homogeneity of pore fluid distribution within the samples.

40|$|Meehan, ChristopherCompacted soil {{is a vital}} {{element in}} the {{construction}} of any civil engineering project. Measurements of in-situ soil density and moisture content are commonly used in the residential, commercial, and transportation industries to control the process of soil compaction. Various methods currently exist to monitor compaction in soils for construction projects. The nuclear density gauge is currently the most commonly utilized test device for this purpose; however, there are strict regulations with respect to the handling, transport, and storage of this device because it contains radioactive material. A relatively new non-nuclear alternative is the <b>electrical</b> density <b>gauge</b> (EDG), which uses a series of electrical measurements in conjunction with calibrated soil models to infer in-situ soil density and moisture content. Two approaches currently exist for building soil models with the electrical density gauge: the first is calibration with in-situ measurements of density and water content provided by the nuclear density gauge, sand cone test, or an equivalent in-situ density test, and the second is calibration with "large mold" Proctor-type tests. In this study, both calibration methods were evaluated. Additionally, field compaction conditions were simulated in a "large" box where EDG tests and three common in-situ density tests (nuclear density gauge, sand cone, and drive cylinder) were performed to provide comparative results. In addition, the effect of temperature on EDG electrical measurements was explored using the "large-molds" and alternative temperature correction and calibration procedures were investigated as well. The findings from this study provide guidance for interpreting the results from future <b>electrical</b> density <b>gauge</b> studies, and are useful for engineers that may be considering the use of this technology for compaction control.

Experimental stress analysis over {{years has been}} playing an increasingly important role in aiding engineering product designers to produce not only efficient, economic designs but also in substantial reductions in weight and yet aid in easier manufacturing of the products. <b>Electrical</b> resistance strain <b>gauges</b> are a remarkable device which is small, lightweight, linear, precise and fairly inexpensive {{is used as a}} sensor in wide variety of applications. Load cell transducer is the most prevalent sensor which uses <b>electrical</b> strain <b>gauges.</b> In a load cell, the unknown, load is measured by sensing the strain developed in a mechanical member. Since the load is linearly related to the strain as long as the mechanical member remains elastic, the load cell can be calibrated so that the output signal is proportional to the load. The Thermal coefficient of expansion of unknown material may be determined with the strain gauges by mounting two half bridges resistances on the known material and unknown material respectively.
