40|$|The mining {{industry}} plays {{a vital role}} in the South African economy as well as supporting various sectors of the economy, for example the transport services, consulting and financial services, steel and material inputs, and electricity and water usage. The future success of the {{mining industry}} requires certainty on numerous regulatory issues, one of which is taxation. In this study the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> available to the South African mining sector were compared to those offered to the mining industry in Australia, which has the third largest mining sector in the world, in order to determine which of the two systems is more advantageous. The history of mining and the current taxation legislation applicable to the mining sector in South Africa was briefly discussed and analysed to provide an understanding of this industry. Australia recently introduced new taxation legislation and incentive scheme for the mining sector, namely the Exploration Development Incentive, effective from 1 July 2014. This was explained and analysed. The comparison of the <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> between the two countries led to the conclusion that South Africa offers better <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> in respect of corporate <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> rate, prospecting, research and development, tax incentives and interest. Australian mining companies are better off with regard to capital expenditure, capital gains tax and mining rehabilitation. The <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> received by both countries in respect of depreciation, royalties and tax losses are very similar. From this comparison it seems evident that while both countries offer substantial <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> to the mining industry, the South African mining industry currently enjoys an advantageous situation.

This paper examines the efficiency cost of providing child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits.</b> A representative agent model is used to show how the efficiency cost of providing child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> depends on labor supply and fertility elasticities. The model reveals that cross-price substitution effect for labor supply and children is of primary importance in calculating the efficiency cost. However, there are no estimates of this parameter in the literature. This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to estimate this parameter. The estimated cross-price substitution effect implies that children and time spent outside of employment are complements. This implies that the full cost of providing child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits</b> is larger than the reported <b>tax</b> expenditure. fertility, <b>income</b> <b>tax,</b> child <b>tax</b> <b>benefits,</b> female labor supply...|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} we {{assess the impact of}} the Working <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Benefit</b> (WITB) on labour supply, GDP and income {{distribution}} in Canada, using a general equilibrium microsimulation model. We also estimate labour supply and demand elasticities using survey data to ensure that households’ behaviour is properly captured in the model. Simulation results show that the WITB affects particularly labour market participation of low- and medium-skilled lone-parents families. These positive effects on labour supply translate into higher after-tax incomes leading to a decline in low-income rates and low-income gaps. Our findings suggest that enhancing the WITB could provide additional income support to working Canadian families while reducing work disincentives for those trapped behind the welfare wall.|$|R
