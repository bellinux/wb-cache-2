2500|$|A usual {{course of}} ECT {{involves}} multiple administrations, typically given {{two or three}} times per week until the patient is no longer suffering symptoms. ECT is administered under anesthetic with a muscle relaxant. Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the <b>electrical</b> <b>waveform</b> of the stimulus. These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. Placement can be bilateral, in which the electric current is passed across the whole brain, or unilateral, in which the current is passed across one hemisphere of the brain. Bilateral placement seems to have greater efficacy than unilateral, but also carries greater risk of memory loss. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive maintenance ECT.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} {{difference between the}} two techniques is that the time lens requires the input signal to be subjected to high amount of dispersion before further processing. For <b>electrical</b> <b>waveforms,</b> the electronic devices that have the required characteristics: (1) high dispersion to loss ratio, (2) uniform dispersion, and (3) broad bandwidths, do not exist. This renders time lens not suitable for slowing down wideband <b>electrical</b> <b>waveforms.</b> In contrast, PTS does not have such a requirement. It was developed specifically for slowing down <b>electrical</b> <b>waveforms</b> and enable high speed digitizers.|$|R

Advances in technology have produced laser-pulse-shaping systems where the laser temporal profile can be specified in advance and controlled to {{a high degree of}} accu-racy. 1 – 3 A pulse-shaping system has been in operation on OMEGA for several years. Temporally shaped optical pulses can be produced by applying shaped <b>electrical</b> <b>waveforms</b> to a dual-channel integrated-optics modulator. 1 – 3 These shaped <b>electrical</b> <b>waveforms</b> are sent to the optical modulator syn-chronized with the passage through the modulator of an optical pulse from a single-longitudinal-mode (SLM) laser. 4 The optical pulse exiting the modulator is then shaped in accor-dance with the voltage-dependent transfer function of the modulator. Hence, the electrical-waveform generator is an important component in any optical-pulse-shaping system incorporating optical modulators. This article discusses a greatly simplified pulse-shaping system based on an aperture-coupled-stripline (ACSL) electrical-waveform generator under development for OMEGA, and compares its many advantages over the existing OMEGA pulse-shaping system...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} techniques and device configurations are available for determining the Doppler shift. All use a photodetector (typically an avalanche photodiode) to convert the light into an <b>electrical</b> <b>waveform</b> for analysis. In most devices, the original laser light {{is divided into two}} beams. In one general LDV class, the two beams are made to intersect at their focal points where they interfere and generate a set of straight fringes. The sensor is then aligned to the flow such that the fringes are perpendicular to the flow direction. As particles pass through the fringes, the Doppler-shifted light is collected into the photodetector. In another general LDV class, one beam is used as a reference and the other is Doppler-scattered. Both beams are then collected onto the photodetector where optical heterodyne detection is used to extract the Doppler signal.|$|E

5000|$|A {{digital pattern}} {{generator}} {{is a piece}} of electronic test equipment or software used to generate digital electronics stimuli. Digital electronics stimuli are a specific kind of <b>electrical</b> <b>waveform</b> varying between two conventional voltages that correspond to two logic states ("low state" [...] and [...] "high state", [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1"). The main purpose of a digital pattern generator is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device.

Digital pattern generators are sometimes referred to as [...] "pulse generator" [...] or [...] "pulse pattern generator" [...] which may be able to function as digital pattern generators as well. Hence, the distinction between the two types of equipment may not be clear. A digital pattern generator is a source of synchronous digital stimulus; the generated signal is interesting for testing digital electronics at logic level - this is why they are also called [...] "logic source".

40|$|Although the cochlea is an {{amplifier}} and {{a remarkably}} sensitive and finely tuned detector of sounds, it also produces conspicuous mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>waveform</b> distortions. These distortions reflect nonlinear mechanical interactions within the cochlea. By allowing one tone to suppress another (masking effect), {{they contribute to}} speech intelligibility. Tones can also combine to produce sounds with frequencies not present in the acoustic stimulus. These sounds compose the otoacoustic emissions that are extensively used to screen hearing in newborns. Because both cochlear amplification and distortion originate from the outer hair cells-one of {{the two types of}} sensory receptor cells-it has been speculated that they stem from a common mechanism. Here we show that the nonlinearity underlying cochlear waveform distortions relies on the presence of stereocilin, a protein defective in a recessive form of human deafness. Stereocilin was detected in association with horizontal top connectors, lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the outer hair cell's hair bundle. These links were absent in stereocilin-null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf. At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced and both acoustic and <b>electrical</b> <b>waveform</b> distortions were completely lacking. From this unique functional situation, we conclude that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a deflection-dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic nonlinear behaviour of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel...|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} (ES) {{is effective}} in enhancing bone healing, however the best <b>electrical</b> <b>waveform,</b> mode of application and mechanisms remains unclear. We recently reported the in vitro differential healing response of a novel <b>electrical</b> <b>waveform</b> called degenerate sine wave (DW) compared {{to other forms of}} ES. This study further explores this original observation on osteoblast cells. Here, we electrically stimulated SaOS- 2 osteoblast-like cells with DW in an in vitro ES chamber (referred to as 'DW stimulation') and compared the intracellular effects to capacitive coupling (CC) stimulation. ES lasted for 4 h, followed by an incubation period of 20 h and subsequent ES for 4 additional hours. Cytotoxicity, proliferation, differentiation and mineralisation of the osteoblast-like cells were evaluated to determine the cell maturation process. DW significantly enhanced the differentiation of cells when compared to CC stimulation with increased alkaline phosphatase and collagen I gene expression by quantitative real time- polymerase chain reaction analysis (p< 0. 01). Moreover, DW significantly increased the mineralisation of cells compared to CC stimulation. Furthermore the transcription of osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein (p< 0. 05) was also up regulated by DW. However, ES did not augment the proliferation of cells. Translational analysis by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting showed increased collagen I, osteocalcin and osteonectin expression after DW than CC stimulation. In summary, we have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} DW stimulation in an in vitro ES chamber has a significant effect on maturation of osteoblast-like cells compared to CC stimulation of the same magnitude...|$|E
