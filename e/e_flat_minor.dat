5000|$|Lockwood also discerns a {{precedent}} set by Mozart involving formal structure: an Introduzione; i.e. Beethoven's scene forms a separable initial section of an opera having {{some degree of}} integrity of both plot and harmonic plan; Lockwood calls the Introduzione a [...] "miniplay". Three of Mozart's operas begin with such an Introduzione: Don Giovanni, Così fan tutte, and The Magic Flute. Beethoven's Introduzione has a harmonic structure echoing that of The Magic Flute.

30|$|This is {{followed}} by a chain of cadences, which drives the key from G <b>flat</b> <b>minor,</b> a tritone relationship to tonic, with <b>E</b> <b>flat</b> acting as a flat six, an enharmonically augmented fifth again acting as a six chord, which then resolves to G major and returns to tonic. There are four measures, which are driven by plagal cadences, which end with authentic cadences. All sequential material is varied to avoid repetition. These serve a dual purpose, they appear to be chord clusters and exude all the color of them, yet we feel the underlying driving force of cadential resolution.|$|R
