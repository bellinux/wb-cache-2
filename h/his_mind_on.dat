However, the Australian skipper changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> {{the morning}} of the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of {{exploiting}} a wet wicket. Johnston had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on similar surfaces. He showed his credentials by taking a match total of 9/183 from 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory by eight wickets. England elected to bat first and after strike bowler Ray Lindwall broke down on the first day, the burden on Johnston grew.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{was exposed}} to {{multiple}} influences through his life. As an undergraduate student of Howison, he learned about philosophy and religion. At Yale and later at Wundt's lab, he switched to experimental psychology and studied perception, memory and emotion. His exposure to World War I, serving in the Army then, focused <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> issues {{of war and peace}} and international relations. Stratton's later work reflected these elements of his experience. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E

However, after Hersholt adjusted his appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, Stroheim changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the spot. With the exception of Gowland, Stroheim shot extensive screen tests {{of all the other}} actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer Paul Ivano. A scene from the Goldwyn film Souls for Sale is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of Stroheim directing Greed, but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.|$|E

At the amphitheater, Arhys changes <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the silhouette of someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E
5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge {{starting}} on 10 June with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, with eight innings victories. It was thought that Bradman would play a specialist leg spinner, but he changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston, a left-arm paceman and orthodox spinner, was played {{in the hope of}} exploiting a wet wicket. This was the only change from the teams that Australia had fielded in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting apart from some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour, as the surface of the pitch had become moist following overnight rain, assisting seam bowling. Australia's selection policy meant that their reserve opener Brown would bat out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, while Neil Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.|$|E
5|$|Bill Johnstona {{left arm}} bowler who could bowl both pace and spinwas not {{initially}} in Bradman's {{plan for the}} First Test at Trent Bridge. However, Bradman changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the morning when rain was forecast. Johnston was played {{in the hope of}} exploiting a wet wicket; he had previously taken match-winning figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively on rain-affected surfaces. In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool would not have the endurance required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match. Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the only difference between the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC. Johnston subsequently cemented his position by taking nine wickets in the matchthe most among the Australians. Johnson, the only specialist spinner chosen, took 1/85.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, news of Henry's {{death had}} reached Stephen of Blois, {{conveniently}} placed in Boulogne, {{and he left}} for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December {{and over the next}} week he began to seize power in England. The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return, and his brother, Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, delivered the support of the Church to Stephen. Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> his deathbed. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.|$|E
5|$|During the Ashes tour, Johnston roomed with Doug Ring {{who was a}} {{teammate}} in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams. As Ring was a leg-spin bowler, he and Johnston were in direct competition for {{a place in the}} eleven. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. When Johnston was omitted in favour of Ring, it appeared he would not be in Bradman's Test plans. Bradman changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the morning of the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. He showed his credentials by bowling a total of 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory. England batted first and with strike bowler Ray Lindwall breaking down on the first day, Johnston removed Bill Edrich and Joe Hardstaff junior in one over to leave England at 4/46. He returned later in the innings to take 5/36 from 25 overs as England were bowled out for 165. After scoring an unbeaten 17 in a last-wicket partnership of 33, Johnston bowled 59 overs in the second innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Henry's precise {{motivations and}} {{intentions}} {{over the coming}} years are not widely agreed on. Henry himself, {{at least in the}} early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum ("Defence of the Seven Sacraments") earned him the title of Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) from Pope Leo X. The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms. It is not clear exactly when Henry changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20:21, an impediment Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack. In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet were lost. Henry sent his secretary, William Knight, to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull. Knight was unsuccessful; the Pope could not be misled so easily.|$|E

5|$|Lenin had {{not wanted}} {{to return to the}} Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the issue of the Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tour}} matches was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which fielded a team {{composed}} almost entirely of Test players. In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests, Australia fielded their full-strength team and won by an innings. The difference in Australia's team for the First Test was the omission of leg spinner Colin McCool, who had been struggling from a torn callus on his spinning finger, which prevented him from bowling long spells. It was thought that Bradman would play another leg spinnerDoug Ringin McCool's place, but the Australian captain changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>on</b> the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston was played {{in the hope of}} exploiting a wet wicket. In previous rain-affected matches on the tour, Johnston had been highly effective, taking match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively. Bill Brown, the reserve opener, played out of position in the middle-order, as he had against Worcestershire and the MCC. Aside from Brown and Johnston's inclusion, Australia's team was the same as that which started the previous Ashes series in 1946–47, which they won 3–0.|$|E
