5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} In the Lounge was also created. This includes the same 9 original tracks, although <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> order. It {{does not include}} the two indie songs; however, it does feature Rich Ragsdale's NOLF title theme, as well as remixes of 6 of the original songs, by Gabriel Mann.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Strauss {{works that}} are {{performed}} today may once have existed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed {{much of the}} original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This {{may also have been}} fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer.|$|E
25|$|This formula {{has been}} long-time {{attributed}} to Almkvist and Meurman who derived it in 1990s. However, it was recently reported that this identity, albeit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> form, was first obtained by Carl Malmsten in 1846.|$|E

25|$|Alternating {{between the}} two {{variants}} of the semi-implicit Euler method leads in one simplification to the Störmer-Verlet integration and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> simplification to the leapfrog integration, increasing both {{the order of the}} error and the order of preservation of energy.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 10: The 10th bridge {{takes us}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> direction. The Bishop wishes every citizen {{to return to}} his {{starting}} point. This is an Euler circuit and requires that all nodes be of even degree. After the solution of the 9th bridge, the red and the orange nodes have odd degree, so their parity must be changed by adding a new edge between them.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{with the}} other centres {{along the length of}} the road, there is a much larger gap between Hanwell and the next centre, Southall. Southall Broadway has a mix of shops in both the style of Ealing Broadway and of West Ealing; however, as the areas is {{predominantly}} populated by Asians, they are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> vein. This is another very congested part of the road (like Ealing Broadway), because it is very popular as a shopping area for the public and tourists.|$|E
25|$|Here, {{rather than}} the two straps that cross around Artemis A's chest, only one strap crosses over the figure's right {{shoulder}} and under her left arm, supporting part of the quiver that is still intact. The quiver itself was cast separately {{from the rest of}} the statue and had to be reattached to the statue at some point in antiquity, setting the quiver <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> position than it had been originally. The quiver strap itself is also elaborate; it is decorated with a meander and dot pattern with silver inlay.|$|E

25|$|The present-day Armenian {{coat of arms}} has {{its origins}} with the {{establishment}} of the First Republic of Armenia in 1918. In that year, an early variation of the coat of arms was adopted. The symbols on this earlier version were placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> order and the eagle and lion have their tongues out, giving them a more menacing look. Only Mount Ararat (along with Little Ararat) are depicted while Noah's Ark is absent. The coat of arms was designed by architect and member of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts Alexander Tamanian and artist Hakob Kojoyan.|$|E
25|$|The color {{variations}} in the mimicked substrate and animal skin are similar. Depending on the species, the skin of cuttlefish responds to substrate changes in distinctive ways. By changing naturalistic backgrounds, the camouflage responses of different species can be measured. Sepia officinalis changes color to match the substrate by disruptive patterning (contrast {{to break up the}} outline), where as S. pharanonis matches the substrate by blending in. Although camouflage is achieved in different ways, and in an absence of color vision, both species change their skin colors to match the substrate. Cuttlefish adapt their own camouflage pattern in ways that are specific for a particular habitat. An animal could settle in the sand and appear one way, with another animal a few feet away <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> microhabitat, settled in algae for example, will be camouflaged quite differently.|$|E
25|$|Spherical {{aberration}} {{occurs because}} spherical surfaces {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. Spherical aberration causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called aspheric lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the manufacturing cost for such lenses. Spherical aberration can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a plano-convex lens, which is used to focus a collimated beam, produces a sharper focal spot when used with the convex side towards the beam source.|$|E

25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the door by lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears {{in response to the}} prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E
25|$|After one saros, the Moon {{will have}} {{completed}} roughly an integer number of lunar orbit cycles and synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (241, 223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical: the Moon {{will have the}} same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. In addition, because the saros is close to 18 years in length (about 11 days longer), the earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation (same season). Given the date of an eclipse, one saros later a nearly identical eclipse can be predicted. During this 18-year period, about 40 other solar and lunar eclipses take place, but with a somewhat different geometry. One saros equaling 18.03 years is not equal to a perfect integer number of lunar orbits (earth revolutions with respect to the fixed stars of 27.32166 days sidereal month), therefore, even though the relative geometry of the Earth–Sun–Moon system will be nearly identical after a saros, the Moon will be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>different</b> position with respect to the stars for each eclipse in a Saros series. The axis of rotation of the Earth–Moon system exhibits a precession period of 18.59992 years.|$|E
