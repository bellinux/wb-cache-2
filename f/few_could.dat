As a result, the British East India Company increased the tax to 3.25 rupees a maund, and the wholesale price of salt increased from 1.25 to about 4 rupees a maund.

25|$|Two subfamilies {{of storm}} petrel were {{traditionally}} recognized. The Oceanitinae, or austral storm-petrels, were mostly found in southern waters (though the Wilson's storm petrel regularly migrates into the northern hemisphere); {{there were seven}} species in five genera. The Hydrobatinae, or northern storm petrels, were the two genera Hydrobates and Oceanodroma. They were largely restricted to the northern hemisphere, although a <b>few</b> <b>could</b> visit or breed a short distance beyond the equator.|$|E

Fox Sports Arizona (or FS Arizona) is currently seen in 2.8million households in Arizona and New Mexico.

However, the newly energized Kentucky baseball faithful saw the Cats crash out of the SEC tournament early and fail to make it out of the regionals of the NCAA tournament at home.|$|E

Babell's transcription of arias from Handel's opera Rinaldo includes 'Vo' far guerra', which Handel intended as a showpiece for his harpsichord playing and is quite remarkable in its virtuosity; Babell's transcription was made from his memory of how Handel improvised in performances. In 1894, Friedrich Chrysander published Babell's piano reduction of Rinaldo in the Händel-Gesellschaft volume 48.|$|E
25|$|The specialists {{fell into}} three categories. First there were species describers, then specialists in species {{recognition}} and then specialists in gross taxonomy. There were however considerable degrees of overlap. Also then, as now, <b>few</b> <b>could</b> entirely resist {{the lure of}} groups other than their own, and this was especially true of those in small countries where they were the sole 'expert', and many famous specialists in one order also worked on others. Hence, for instance, many works which began as butterfly faunas were completed as general regional works, often collaboratively.|$|E

After two interceptions by MLB Cato June that set up two touchdowns, an interception and a fumble recovery by CB Nick Harper that also set up two touchdown scores, the Colts scored all 45 of their points in three quarters, and held the Rams to just 11 points in those quarters.|$|E
25|$|During the 17th century, {{adherents of}} Roman Catholicism tended to {{diminish}} since only a <b>few</b> <b>could</b> afford the penalties exacted by the government. Lanherne, the Cornish {{home of the}} Arundells in Mawgan in Pydar, {{was the most important}} centre, while the religious census of 1671 recorded recusants also in the parishes of Treneglos, Cardinham, Newlyn East and St Ervan. In the Civil War the recusants were firmly of Royalist sympathies since they had more to fear from a Parliament opposed to prelacy and popery. Sir John Arundell (born ca. 1625) fought gallantly for King Charles in the Cornish campaign, which he joined in 1644, and continued to live at Lanherne until his death in 1701.|$|E
25|$|Sui Generis began {{shifting}} from their classic acoustic rock {{to a more}} electric and visceral sound. Also, stirring in the Argentine underground were new bands with a radically different sound from either acoustic or heavy rock: influenced by some of acoustic rock's more experimental works (such as Arco Iris and their phenomenal Agitor Lucens V with its world music influences), by Tango music and also by British progressive rock. This would be the blueprint of Argentine progressive rock that would bloom into {{the apex of the}} movement in 1975. As that year began <b>few</b> <b>could</b> foresee what a watershed it would become not just in Argentine rock history, but the country's too.|$|E

There were daily avalanche checks during the shoot, and {{a significant amount of}} time was spent sitting and waiting for the right conditions to film. For this scene, Core and members of his crew roped down cliffs to record the snowboarders from the best possible angles. At some point, Core had to give Xavier the camera and he had to shoot other people. He admitted that because Rue and Jones were so fast, <b>few</b> <b>could</b> keep up with them. During filming a particular sequence, a Class 4 avalanche was triggered.|$|E
25|$|The {{education}} reform efforts of women like Davies and the Langham group slowly made inroads. Queen's College (1848) and Bedford College (1849) in London began {{to offer some}} education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations, and achieved partial success in 1865. She published The Higher Education of Women a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became Girton College, Cambridge in 1869, Newnham College, Cambridge in 1871, and Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, <b>few</b> <b>could</b> {{take advantage of them}} and life for female students was still difficult.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select <b>few</b> <b>could</b> afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends were obviously identifiable.|$|E
