5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|After {{extensive}} testimony, Justice Spicer {{ruled on}} November 30 {{that there was}} not enough evidence to indict the men. He said the evidence <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil. Though the Earps and Holliday were free, their reputations had been tarnished. The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge.|$|E
5|$|Although a new {{station at}} 10th Avenue and 41st Street {{was part of}} the {{original}} plan, the intermediate station was eliminated in October 2007 due to cost overruns, leaving the terminal station at Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street as the only new station on the extension. The MTA <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 10th Avenue station could be included in the project if funding were found. The station {{was not included in the}} original (2007) contract award, but was listed as a $450 million option. In late December 2007, reports <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> postponed station might be partially built if the City of New York and the MTA agreed on the additional financing for the station shell. In February 2009, the MTA announced that it would build the station if the agency received sufficient funds from the federal economic stimulus package. In June 2010, the city announced it was seeking funding to assess the feasibility of constructing the station at a later date using a two-platform, two-entrance model without an underground connecting passage.|$|E

5|$|Austerlitz and the {{subsequent}} Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austrian army needed reform. Napoleon had offered Charles the Austrian throne after Austerlitz, an act that aroused deep suspicion from Charles' brother, Austrian emperor Francis II. Even though Charles was allowed to spearhead the reforms of the Austrian army, Francis kept the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), a military advisory board, to oversee the activities of Charles as supreme commander.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site.

5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the {{buoyancy}} of water to support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> large body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 2011, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests {{said that}} the {{proposal}} for according tiger reserve status for the Sathyamangalam Reserve Forests is under consideration. He said that studies using camera traps indicated there could be 19 to 25 tigers in Sathyamangalam forests. A 2011 camera trap tiger density study conducted by World Wildlife Fund <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary is home to at least 25 tigers. In the same year, a DNA based project initiated by the state forest department collected 150 samples of pugmarks from Sathyamangalam forests and 69 of them were found positive for tigers by tests conducted at the Center for Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. The findings also <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> region is home {{to as many as}} 30 tigers.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 2008, the Victoria Cross, Military Medal and {{campaign}} medals awarded to Ingram were sold at auction by Sotheby's of Melbourne for an approximate hammer price of A$383,760.

30|$|I {{checked the}} press {{releases}} for several DVA disclosures and constructed respective binary variables (see similar: Baumker et al. 2014). Ment, <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quarterly earnings press release mentions DVAs. Sign <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains {{information on the}} DVAs’ sign (i.e., whether DVAs are positive or negative). Size <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains the DVAs’ size as an absolute or per share figure. 3 Due <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains information explaining that DVAs stem from a change in debt value or from a change in credit risk. Dir <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains directional information on DVAs. For example, in firm-quarters with negative DVAs, Dir <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains <b>the</b> information <b>that</b> <b>the</b> negative DVAs stem from an increase in own debt’s value and/or that they stem from {{a decrease in the}} firm’s own credit risk. According to experimental evidence, this information helps investors unravel the criticized “counterintuitiveness” of DVAs (Gaynor et al. 2011).|$|R
