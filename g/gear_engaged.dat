25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to engage and disengage the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|E

50|$|Some 1950s-era James {{motorcycles}} {{were built}} using Villiers engines that utilized a preselector gearbox.

50|$|Note {{that the}} axle {{of the planet}} gear {{is tied to the}} axle of the sun gear by a link that freely rotates around the axis of the sun gear and keeps the planet <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> with the sun gear but does not {{contribute}} to the drive torque. This link appears, at first sight, to be similar to a crank but the drive is not transmitted through it. Thus, it did not contravene the crank patent.|$|E

50|$|A safety pinion was an {{alternate}} means of protection, {{used with the}} going barrel. In this, the centre wheel pinion, which the barrel <b>gear</b> <b>engages,</b> was attached to its shaft with a reverse screw thread.

2500|$|When the {{floor-mounted}} {{gear selector}} lever is in position D, the DSG works in fully automatic mode, with {{emphasis placed on}} gear shifts programmed to deliver maximum fuel economy.

As an example, on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, sixth <b>gear</b> will be <b>engaged</b> around , when initially using the DSG transmission with the default ECU adaptation; although with an [...] "aggressive" [...] or [...] "sporty" [...] driving style, the adaptive shift pattern will increase the vehicle speed at which sixth <b>gear</b> <b>engages.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of the R16, {{and later}} Renault 5, design {{is that the}} two back wheel axle shafts are not in-line. The left wheelbase is 70 mm (2.76 in) longer than the right wheelbase, to accommodate the torsion bar suspension. This and the soft front seats gives the car a particularly smooth ride even over big bumps. The suspension has the longest travel on a car of this size; if the handbrake is applied and reverse <b>gear</b> <b>engaged,</b> the rear bumper will raise about one foot.|$|E
50|$|The special pedal cranks allowed both pedals to {{be rotated}} forward so that the pedals would form motorcycle-style {{footrests}} in normal operation. To engage the pedals, the left-hand pedal crank could be rotated forward and locked and a drive <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> allowing the user to pedal. A short chain connected the pedal drive to the main engine-chain drive system. Pedalling was hard work for the rider: there was no freewheel and the pedal gearing was very low. The engine could be started with pedal drive engaged, causing the pedals to rotate under engine power when the bike was in gear. In practice, the cam and shaft arrangement to engage the pedals frequently seized (in normal operation, a rider would very rarely engage pedal-drive as it was less tiring to push than to pedal).|$|E
5000|$|Advanced driving, {{as agreed}} by the Driving Instructors' Association (DIA), Driving Standards Agency, Institute of Advanced Motorists, Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents is defined as [...] "The ability to control the {{position}} and {{speed of the vehicle}} safely, systematically and smoothly using road and traffic conditions to make reasonable progress unobtrusively, with skill and responsibility. This requires a positive but courteous attitude and a high standard of driving competence based on concentration, effective all round observation, anticipation and planning co-ordinated with good handling skills.

500|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the [...] diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three [...] diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small <b>gears</b> <b>engage</b> the central <b>gear,</b> which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller <b>gears</b> <b>engage</b> the large ring gears {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|R
50|$|Some {{gas turbine}} engines and diesel engines, {{particularly}} on trucks, use a pneumatic self-starter. In ground vehicles the system {{consists of a}} geared turbine, an air compressor and a pressure tank.

50|$|The {{spur gear}} design of reverse gear {{represents}} some compromises (less robust, unsynchronized engagement and loud noise) which are acceptable {{due to the}} relatively small amount of driving {{that takes place in}} reverse. The gearbox of the classic SAAB 900 is a notable example of a gearbox with a helical reverse <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> in the same unsynchronized manner as the spur gears described above. Its design allows reverse to share cogs with first gear, and is exceptionally quiet, but results in difficult engagement and unreliable operation. However, many modern transmissions now include a reverse gear synchronizer and helical gearing, especially in applications which use three shafts as part of the transmission implementation instead of the conventional dual input and output shafts (usually to permit a shorter gearbox for the number of gears provided), since the third shaft inherently provides the option to reverse output rotation while still allowing permanently meshing gears.|$|E
50|$|Two early {{improvements}} were suspension {{wheels and}} rim gearing. Suspension wheels are {{constructed in the}} same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a notched wheel to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft rotation was geared up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by William Fairburn can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the Portland Basin Canal Warehouse.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of {{pure electric vehicles}} have shown that pure electric vehicles equipped with two-speed or multi-speed gearbox possess higher energy efficiency by ensuring the drive motor operates at its peak performance range. This article presents the design, analysis, and control of a two-speed automatic mechanical transmission for pure electric vehicles.

The drive motor’s torque control strategy before shifting, speed governing control strategy before engaging, shift actuator’s control strategy during <b>gear</b> <b>engaging,</b> and drive motor’s torque recovery strategy after shift process are proposed and implemented with a prototype. To validate the performance of the two-speed gearbox, a test bed was developed based on dSPACE that emulates various operation conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{method to}} {{transform}} vehicle driving condition to engine operation mode {{is to use}} vehicle road load under neutral gear and mechanical efficiency of drivetrain. But this method requires additional measurement of efficiency of drivetrain on a test rig.

This study suggests new method to calculate engine operation mode for prescribed driving mode such as NEDC using vehicle coastdown test under <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> condition without measurement of mechanical efficiency of drivetrain. Coastdown test was done under neutral and <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> condition for comparison and also trial to extract mechanical loss of drivetrain was carried out.

In this paper, it is done by formulatinga driving mission of a heavy-duty truck as an optimal control problem and solving it using dynamic programming. The vehicle model includes an engine and a gearbox with parameters based on measurements in test cells. The dynamic programming algorithm is solved by considering four specifictypes of transitions: transitions between the same gear, coastingin neutral gear, coasting with a <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> with no fuel injection and transitions involving gear changes.

40|$|Thin-rim gears {{are often}} used in {{applications}} where light weight and compact design are demanded. Since the gear rim is more rigid {{in the area of}} the gear web, this influences the load as well as the contact stress distribution along the tooth face width. Conventional standard procedures for gear design assume uniform rigidity along the face width and therefore are not fully applicable to the thinrim gears tooth contact stress calculation. The objective of this paper is to evaluate effect of web arrangement on a thin-rim gear tooth contact stresses using advanced engineering tools for a numeric analysis. Three-dimensional parametric finite element model of thin-rim <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> with a solid gear is created. The gear pair contact position is chosen to load the thin-rim gear (the wheel) at the highest point of single tooth contact assuming small sliding and dry frictionless contact. Commercial finite element package Abaqus/Standard is used to determine contact stresses assuming small displacement hypothesis. The material is considered homogenous and isotropic with a linear elastic behavior. Obtained tooth contact stress contour lines as well as the maximum tooth contact stress values for various thin-rim gear web arrangements are presented...|$|E

40|$|Global {{navigation}} satellite systems, {{such as the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) are nowadays widespread in the consumer and professional fields. To guarantee the desired accuracy, availability, integrity and robustness performance, {{it is necessary to}} add to GPS receivers aiding systems, like extra sensors, which can be expensive. In order to reduce the expenses, a low-cost alternative aiding system is here presented. The main idea is to extract the information needed to support the GPS services from an easily measurable signal as the one provided by the power supply of a car. This signal has a frequency component related to the rpm speed of the engine, thus {{it can be used to}} estimate the speed, and related states, when the GPS service is unavailable for some reason. Unfortunately, the frequency component isequal to the speed measured by the GPS up to a scale factor dependent on the <b>gear</b> <b>engaged,</b> so it is necessary to estimate over time these scale factors in order to use the information. In this thesis project we implemented an off-line system which leads to the estimation over time of the scale factors. A sensor fusion solution has been used: training data consisting only of speed measurement provided by the GPS and measurements of the signal of interest are processed through a bench of five Kalman Filters (one for each gear) which leads to the estimation of the scale factors. Three measurement campaigns with three different cars have been conducted in order to collect an exhaustive amount of datasets necessary to calibrate and then validate the system...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Automotive transmission rattle is the noise generated due to impacts between manual transmissions meshing gear teeth {{in the presence of}} backlash. It {{is considered to be a}} Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomenon and is originated due to combustion irregularities (engine order vibrations), especially in diesel vehicles. This thesis focuses in the case of creep rattle for the MMT 6 Ford Getrag transmission (six speeds plus reverse) with a DW 10 b, 4 -cylinder, 4 -stroke, 2. 0 litres diesel engine. This particular rattle condition is fundamentally similar to any other where an engaged gear is pertained (drive, over-run or float), with the 1 st or 2 nd <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> at a very low engine speed. The numerical models include an initial single degree of freedom (DoF) simulation. It comprises either of the engaged gear pair under Hertzian contact conditions or of a loose gear pair under hydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Once the validity of this model is established and correlated with the results obtained from a single gear pair test rig, simulations of increasing complexity can be envisaged. A 7 DoF numerical model is, therefore, developed. The Hertzian contact model still prevails for the engaged gear pair, whereas an analytical hydrodynamic solution is implemented for the remaining 6 loose gear wheels and Petrov s law is applied to the needle bearings retaining the gear wheels. With the aim of accommodating a fully lubricated model of all the tribological conjunctions, an analytical elastohydrodynamic (EHL) Grubin type algorithm is employed. Also, the energy equation is analytically solved for hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic conjunctions, based on the assumptions dictated by the Peclet number. Therefore, under hydrodynamic conditions, the energy equation is governed by viscous heating and convective cooling, whereas in the EHL conjunctions the governing terms are viscous and compressive heating, together with conductive cooling. The retaining needle bearings follow the same heat generation mechanism as journal bearings. The effective viscosity, as obtained from the Houpert s equation accounting for pressure and thermal effects, is fundamental for the study of the friction in the contact. The hydrodynamic contacts are only governed by viscous friction, whereas EHL conjunctions exhibit asperity iv interactions as well as viscous effects. The results obtained from this new 7 DoF model are then compared to the experimental measurements taken from the vehicle tests and various purpose-built drivetrain rigs. A metric named Impulsion Ratio is hereby introduced, aiming to shed some light into the predictions obtained by the various models presented. This metric is the ratio of driving over resistive forces acting on each individual gear wheel. Its use is tested to predict single or double-sided rattle scenarios and, therefore, ascertaining higher and lower rattle levels. The 13 DoF model from which these conclusions were obtained includes shafts planar translation and rocking moments. The rolling element bearings supporting the shafts are, therefore, modelled to capture the inherent frequencies arising from their motion. The final model introduces the effects of transient thermo-elastohydrodynamics. This 7 DoF dynamic model accounts for a numerical solution of Reynolds equation with Elrod s cavitation algorithm for simultaneous teeth in mesh. The results obtained validate the previously used Grubin assumption by comparing the predicted central film thickness along the full mesh of one tooth. Also, the effect of starved input conditions and thermal and isothermal solutions are studied...|$|E
