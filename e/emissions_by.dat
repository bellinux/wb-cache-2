5|$|The UK {{government}} {{has set a}} target to generate 10% of the UK's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government's aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020. It has additionally signed up to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol, which requires a reduction of greenhouse gas <b>emissions</b> <b>by</b> 12.5% of 1990 levels by 2008–12 and a reduction of CO2 <b>emissions</b> <b>by</b> 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. Regional and local authorities are required {{to contribute to the}} delivery of these national targets. The East Riding has an above-average potential to generate renewable electricity for Local Authorities in the region due its large wind energy potential. The East Riding of Yorkshire is set a target of 41MW by 2010, and a target for 2021 of 148MW for installed grid-connected renewable energy.

Despite this, in 2006 the power station was revealed as having the fourth highest CO2 emissions in the north of England, for producing 2,685,512 tonnes of CO2 per year.

5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide <b>emissions</b> <b>by</b> 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the third}} prototype, several design {{improvements}} were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke <b>emissions</b> <b>by</b> the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The vertical tail fin was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare equipment bay in the tip. The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased {{maximum take-off weight}} and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF had selected Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, the winner of which {{was expected to be}} finalised in 2006.

40|$|Abstract [...] Methane <b>emission</b> <b>by</b> termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki was {{investigated}} in relation to termite caste, population size and volume of test containers. Workers constantly emitted methane within the first 72 hr, whereas emission rates of soldiers gradually decreased after 6 hr test duration. Workers and soldiers showed maximum emission rates of 0. 75 and 0. 019 nmol/termite/hour, respectively, and {{no significant differences were}} observed regardless of test container volume when five or more individuals were served for measuring methane <b>emission</b> <b>by</b> workers. In addition, no conspicuous relationships between the volume of test containers and methane emission of workers were observed. Those findings suggested that physiological changes of termites through the year might be major factors which affected the methane <b>emission</b> <b>by</b> termites...|$|R
