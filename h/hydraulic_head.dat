25|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>head</b> is a {{directly}} measurable {{property that}} can take on any value (because of the arbitrary datum involved in the z term); ψ can be measured with a pressure transducer (this value can be negative, e.g., suction, but is positive in saturated aquifers), and z can be measured relative to a surveyed datum (typically {{the top of the}} well casing). Commonly, in wells tapping unconfined aquifers the water level in a well is used as a proxy for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>head,</b> assuming there is no vertical gradient of pressure. Often only changes in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>head</b> through time are needed, so the constant elevation head term can be left out (Δh = Δψ).|$|E

25|$|Upgrading of {{the first}} Activated Sludge plant to use the 'Simplex' system took place between 1970 and 1973.

Effluent from the Activated Sludge plant was raised up {{to the level of the}} tanks by screw pumps, and the increased <b>hydraulic</b> <b>head</b> improved their performance. The upgrade also included five primary settlement tanks and eight sludge consolidation tanks.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{testing program}} {{was conducted to}} quantify leakage through a geomembrane liner system when subjected to high <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads.</b> Leakage through geomembranes is mainly due {{to the presence of}} defects, which may occur during installation and operation. Previous studies focused on leakage through landfill liners (i. e., low <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads)</b> have led to analytical models and simplified equations to estimate and predict the leakage rate through a geomembrane lining system. However, available methods used to estimate leakage are limited to a range of head that is experienced in landfills. The results of the experimental program presented herein are compared to available analytical models. A simplified equation was developed using an analytical model to predict leakage rates for a range of conditions representative of dams, including representative <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> and soil <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity of the soil. The new equation is compared with data from the experimental program and also with existing models.

40|$|In this study, a {{stochastic}} {{finite element}} method is used to solve an inverse problem in groundwater flow. The adjoint states method combined with cokriging method is used to estimate the distribution of hydraulic conductivities {{in an area where}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> and <b>hydraulic</b> conductivities are measured at some locations. This method starts with obtaining the expected <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> in the entire study domain at different times. Then, the adjoint states at different times are calculated. Using both calculated values as input, the Jacobians that are needed for the development of covariance matrices of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> at different times and the cross-covariance matrices between <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> at different times and hydraulic conductivities in the aquifer are calculated. Using the maximum likelihood estimate method (MLE), which utilizes all covariance and cross-covariance matrices obtained from the previous step, the statistical parameters (mean, variance, and correlation scale) of the model are estimated. Using the statistical parameter values and all observed values of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> at different times and all measured hydraulic conductivities, the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the entire study domain is estimated. An attempt is made in this thesis to verify the computer program by utilizing two hypothetical problems as verification cases. In some parts of the aquifer, mostly at locations around the observation wells, the resulting hydraulic conductivity distributions have the same pattern with the "true" distribution patterns in both cases of verification. The values of L 2 -norms calculated by using the "true" and estimated values of log hydraulic conductivity are 0. 18 and 0. 57 for Case 1 and 2, respectively. Data from two field problems are analyzed as an application of the computer program. The estimated values of hydraulic conductivity are found to be within the range of the observed values given in the original reports. These applications can be considered {{as a part of the}} validation of the method. Considering the results of both case studies, it appears that the computer program developed in this study can be used with reasonable success to estimate the hydraulic conductivity distribution in real aquifers. As will be explained in the discussion of the results, however, the effect of zonation needs to be investigated further. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ensemble}} Kalman filter (EnKF) allows assimilating newly {{available data}} in transient groundwater and other earth system models through real-time Bayesian updating of system states (e. g., <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads)</b> and parameters (e. g., hydraulic conductivities). Assimilating data in groundwater transient stochastic flow equations via the traditional EnKF entails computationally intensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

40|$|International audienceExperimental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> and {{electrical}} (self-potential) signals {{associated with a}} pumping test were used in an inverse model to estimate the transmissivity distribution of a real aquifer. Several works {{reported in the literature}} show that there is a relatively good linear relationship between the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> in the aquifer {{and electrical}} signals measured at the ground surface. In this experimental test field, first, the current coupling coefficient was determined by the best fit between experimental and modeled self-potential signals {{at the end of the}} pumping phase. Soon afterward, with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> obtained from the self-potential signals, the transmissivity distribution of the aquifer was conditioned by means an inverse model based on the successive linear estimator (SLE). To further substantiate the estimated T field from the SLE analysis, we analyzed the drawdown rate, the derivative of the drawdown with respect to the ln(t), because the drawdown rate is highly sensitive to the variability in the transmissivity field. In our opinion, these results show that self-potential signals allow the monitoring of subsurface flow in the course of pumping experiments, and that electrical potentials serve as a good complement to piezometric observations to condition and characterize the transmissivity distribution of an aquife...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Water extractions {{in coastal}} areas {{have to deal}} with salt water {{intrusion}} and lowering of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> in valuable ecosystems. Therefore, sustainable management of fresh water resources in these areas is crucial. This is illustrated here with two water extractions in the western Belgian coastal plain which extract groundwater from a phreatic dune aquifer. One water extraction faced problems with salt water intrusion, while lowering of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> was an issue for both. To remedy the salt water intrusion, it was found that decreasing the extraction rate was the only solution. To offset this and to increase <b>hydraulic</b> <b>heads</b> around both extractions, it was decided to artificially recharge the aquifer of the second extraction with tertiary treated wastewater. By taking these interventions, the combined production capacity of the water extractions was increased with 56 % whereas 27 % less water was extracted from the dune aquifer itself. Extraction history and the effects of interventions are illustrated for both water extractions with water quality data and fresh water head observations. A more detailed insight in groundwater flow and fresh–salt water distribution in the aquifer is provided by simulating the evolution of the water extractions with a 3 D density dependent groundwater flow model...|$|R
