Since this time, both Simon and Menander {{have been considered}} as 'proto-Gnostic'. Irenaeus (died ca. 202 CE) wrote Against Heresies (c. 180–185 CE), which identifies Simon Magus from Flavia Neapolis in Samaria as the <b>inceptor</b> of Gnosticism. From Samaria he charted an apparent spread of the teachings of Simon through the ancient 'knowers' into the teachings of Valentinus and other, contemporary Gnostic sects. Hippolytus (170 – 235 CE) wrote the seven-volume Refutation Against all Heresies, of which only fragments are known. Thirty-three of the groups he reported on are considered Gnostic by modern scholars, including 'the foreigners' and 'the Seth people'. Hippolytus further presents individual teachers such as Simon, Valentinus, Secundus, Ptolemy, Heracleon, Marcus and Colorbasus. Tertullian (c. 155–230) from Carthage wrote Adversus Valentinianos ('Against the Valentinians'), c.206, as well as five books around 207–208 chronicling and refuting the teachings of Marcion.|$|E

6000|$|The {{students}} of the Northern nations mock, of course, at these revellers, thumbs are bitten, threats exchanged, and we shall see what comes of the quarrel. But the hall bells chime half-past noon; it is dinner-time in Oxford, and Stoke, as he throws off his mask (larva) and vine-leaves, mutters to himself the equivalent for [...] "there WILL be a row about this." [...] There will, indeed, for the penalty is not [...] "crossing at the buttery," [...] nor [...] "gating," [...] but--excommunication! (Munim. Academ., i. 18.) Dinner {{is not a very}} quiet affair, for the Catte's men have had to fight for their beer in the public streets with some Canterbury College fellows who were set on by their Warden, of all people, to commit this violence (ut vi et violentia raperent cerevisiam aliorum scholarum in vico): however, Catte's has had the best of it, and there is beer in plenty. It is possible, however, that fish is scarce, for certain [...] "forestallers" [...] (regratarii) have been buying up salmon and soles, and refusing to sell them at less than double the proper price. On the whole, however, there a rude abundance of meat and bread; indeed, Stoke may have fared better in Catte's than the modern undergraduate does in the hall of the college protected by St. Catherine. After dinner there would be lecture in Lent, but we are not in Lent. A young man's fancy lightly turns to the Beaumont, north of the modern Beaumont Street, where there are wide playing-fields, and space for archery, foot-ball, stool-ball, and other sports. Stoke rushes out of hall, and runs upstairs into the camera of Roger de Freshfield, a reading man, but a good fellow. He knocks and enters, and finds Freshfield over his favourite work, the Posterior Analytics, and a pottle of strawberries. [...] "Come down to the Beaumont, old man," [...] he says, [...] "and play pyked staffe." [...] Roger is disinclined to move, he MUST finish the Posterior Analytics. Stoke lounges about, in the eternal fashion of undergraduates after luncheon, and picking up the Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (then quite a new book), clinches his argument in favour of pyke and staffe with a quotation: [...] "You will perhaps see a stiff-necked youth lounging sluggishly in his study [...] . He is not ashamed to eat fruit and cheese over an open book, and to transfer his cup from side to side upon it." [...] Thus addressed, Roger lays aside his Analytics, and the pair walk down by Balliol, to the Beaumont, where pyked staffe, or sword and buckler, is played. At the Beaumont they find two men who say that [...] "sword and buckler can be played sofft and ffayre," [...] that is, without hard hitting, and with one of these Stoke begins to fence. Alas! a dispute arose about a stroke, the by-standers interfered, and Stoke's opponent drew his hanger (extraxit cultellum vocatum hangere), and hit one John Felerd over the sconce. On this the Proctors come up, and the assailant is put in Bocardo, while Stoke goes off to a [...] "pass-supper" [...] given by an <b>inceptor,</b> who has just taken his degree. These suppers were not voluntary entertainments, but enforced by law. At supper the talk ranges over University gossip, they tell of the scholar who lately tried to raise the devil in Grope Lane, and was pleased by the gentlemanly manner of the foul fiend. They speak of the Queen's man, who has just been plucked for maintaining that Ego currit, or ego est currens, is as good Latin as ego curro. Then the party breaks up, and Stoke goes towards Merton, with some undergraduates of that college, Bridlington, Alderberk, and Lymby. At the corner of Grope Lane, out come many men of the Northern nations, armed with shields, and bows and arrows. Stoke and his friends run into Merton for weapons, and [...] "standing in a window of that hall, shot divers arrows, and one that Bridlington shot hit Henry de l'Isle, and David Kirkby unmercifully perished, for after John de Benton had given him a dangerous wound in the head with his faulchion, came Will de la Hyde and wounded him in the knee with his sword." ...|$|E

40|$|Notably in {{training}} flights, mechanical linkages between pilot’s and copilot’s controls {{are crucial to}} the pilot’s situation awareness and to takeover control maneuvers.

40|$|Passive sidesticks {{have been}} used in modern {{fly-by-wire}} (FBW) commercial airplanes since the late 1980 s. These passive sidesticks typically do not feature a mechanical coupling between them, therefore the pilot's and copilot's sidesticks move independently. This characteristic disabled the pilot monitoring (PM) to perceive the control inputs of the pilot flying (PF). This can lead to problems of awareness in abnormal situations. The development of active <b>inceptors</b> technology made it possible to electronically couple two sidesticks emulating a mechanical coupling. This research focuses on the benefits of coupled sidesticks to the situation awareness of the PM. A scenario based on the available data of an accident occurred in 2009 was synthesized.

40|$|The {{coupling}} of rotorcraft dynamics {{with the}} dynamics {{of one of the}} main systems devoted to its control, the pilot, may lead to several peculiar phenomena, known as Rotorcraft-Pilot Couplings (RPCs), all characterized by an abnormal behavior that may jeopardize flight safety. Among these phenomena, there is a special class of couplings which is dominated by the biodynamic behavior of the pilot's limbs that close the loop between the vibrations and the control <b>inceptors</b> in the cockpit. Leveraging robust stability analysis, the inherently uncertain pilot biodynamics can be treated as the uncertain portion of a feedback system, making analytical, numerical or graphical determination of proneness to RPC possible by comparing robust stability margins of helicopter models with experimental Biodynamic Feedthrough (BDFT) data. The application of the proposed approach to collective bounce is exemplified using simple analytical helicopter and pilot models. The approach is also applied to detailed helicopter models and experimental BDFT measurement data...|$|R

40|$|Pilot {{assistance}} systems or their functions {{can help the}} pilot to easier perform a safe and effective 24 h all weather operation {{by a combination of}} advanced visual cueing and intelligent control augmentation. This classical two dimensional optimization problem can be extended by a third dimension, namely tactile cueing. With increasing level of control augmentation for helicopters, driven by fly-by-wire technology, also their handling qualities (flying qualities) are tailored by using advanced control modes like attitude command or translational rate command. To get fully access to the overall active rotorcraft, also the pilot <b>inceptors</b> are considered to exhibit active features, which are the dynamic force-displacement characteristics. This allows the adaptation of these characteristics to the control law and control modes, and in addition tactile cueing or feedback in an integrated approach. This reduces the workload and increases the situational awareness.

Four test pilots flew multiple runs on seven different experimental courses. Three predominant effects were discovered in the testing of the RTI: 1. Unintentional binding along the control axis resulted in difficulties with precision power setting, 2. Confusion in which way to move the throttle grip was present during RTI transition modes, and 3.
