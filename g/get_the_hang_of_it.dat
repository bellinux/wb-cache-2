2500|$|The PC {{version of}} the game {{received}} praise for its faithful reproduction of gameplay from the console versions. [...] The addition of keyboard and mouse gameplay received mixed views from critics. [...] Game Revolution's Josh Laddin felt that the keyboard controls were frustrating and said, [...] "the keyboard controls aren't as intuitive as a gamepad." [...] However Marko Djordjevic of GameFocus disagreed and stated, [...] "once you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> [...] it feels exactly as youâ€™d expect." [...] Djordjevic further appreciated that the cooperative gameplay was ported over from the console versions.|$|E

'If you haven't a {{taste that}} way,' said Revere between his puffs of his cheroot, 'you'll {{never be able}} to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but remember, Bobby, 't isn't the best drill, though drill is nearly everything, that hauls a Regiment through Hell and out on the other side.

60|$|Between Iffley and Oxford is {{the most}} {{difficult}} bit of the river I know. You want to be born on that bit of water, to understand it. I have been over it a fairish number of times, but I {{have never been able to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The man who could row a straight course from Oxford to Iffley ought to be able to live comfortably, under one roof, with his wife, his mother-in-law, his elder sister, and the old servant who was in the family when he was a baby.|$|E
60|$|I loved him; I couldn't help it; but the family--why, {{they could}} hardly speak {{of him with}} patience. To this day I regret his loss, and wish I had him back; but they--it is {{different}} with them. He was a native, and came from Surat. Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his birthplace and Manuel's, and fifteen hundred between their ways and characters and dispositions. I only liked Manuel, but I loved Satan. This latter's real name was intensely Indian. I could not quite <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder. It was too long for handy use, anyway; so I reduced it.|$|E
6000|$|I said: [...] "Oh, hang my wooden head, it ain't any use!--it ain't any use to try--I can't {{understand}} anything. <b>The</b> plainer you <b>get</b> it <b>the</b> more I can't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R

60|$|If I {{had time}} to run around and talk, I would do it; for there is much {{politics}} agoing, {{and it would be}} interesting if a body could <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It is Christian and Jew by the horns--the advantage with the superior man, as usual--the superior man being the Jew every time and in all countries. Land, Joe, what chance would the Christian have in a country where there were 3 Jews to 10 Christians! Oh, not the shade of a shadow of a chance. The difference between the brain of the average Christian and that of the average Jew--certainly in Europe--is about the difference between a tadpole's and an Archbishop's. It's a marvelous, race--by long odds the most marvelous that the world has produced, I suppose.|$|E

6000|$|... "We two," [...] he went on, after a pause, [...] "are {{among the}} most {{fortunate}} people alive. We are both rich and easily rich. That gives us freedoms few people have. We have {{a vision of the}} whole world in which we live. It's in a mess--but that is by the way. The mass of mankind never gets enough education to have even a glimpse of the world as a whole. They never get a chance to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It is really possible for us to do things that will matter in the world. All our time is our own; all our abilities we are free to use. Most people, most intelligent and educated people, are caught in cages of pecuniary necessity; they are tied to tasks they can't leave, they are driven and compelled and limited by circumstances they can never master. But we, if we have tasks, have tasks of our own choosing. We may not like the world, but anyhow we are free to do our best to alter it. If I were a clerk in Hoxton and you were a city typist, then we MIGHT swear." ...|$|E

60|$|On this howling stormy Sunday, on a Scotch mountainside, I don't {{know what}} I {{can do better}} than give you a little old-world news. I have had none of yours in some time; but I venture to {{interpret}} that as a good sign and to believe that peace and plenty hovers over Quincy Street. I shall continue in this happy faith and in the belief that you are gently putting forth your strength again, until the contrary is proved. Behold me in Scotland and very well pleased to be here. I am staying with the Clarks, of whom you have heard me speak and than whom there could not be a more tenderly hospitable couple. Sir John caresses me like a brother, and her ladyship supervises me like a mother.... I have been here for four or five days and I feel that I have done a very good thing in coming to Scotland. Once you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hang</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and apprehend the type, it is a most beautiful and admirable little country--fit, for 'distinction' etc., to make up a trio with Italy and Greece. There is a little very good company in the house, including my brilliant friend Lady Hamilton Gordon, and every day has brought with it some pretty entertainment. I wish I could relate these episodes in detail; but I shall probably do a little of it in mercenary print. On the first day I went to some Highland sports, given by Lord Huntly, and to a sumptuous lunch, in a coquettish marquee, which formed an episode of the same. The next day I spent roaming over the moors and hills, in company with a remarkably nice young fellow staying in the house, Sidney Holland, grandson of the late Sir Henry (his father married a daughter of Sir Chas. Trevelyan, sister of my friend Mrs. Dugdale). Nothing can be more breezy and glorious than a ramble on these purple hills and a lounge in the sun-warmed heather. The real way to enjoy them is of course supposed to be with an eye to the grouse and partridges; but this is, happily, little of a shooting house, though Holland keeps the table--one of the best in England (or rather in Scotland, which is saying more)--supplied with game. The next day I took part in a cavalcade across the hills to see a ruined castle; and in the evening, if you please, stiff and sore as I was, and am still, with my exploits in the saddle, which had been sufficiently honourable, I went to a ball fifteen miles distant. The ball was given by a certain old Mr. Cunliffe Brooks, a great proprietor hereabouts and possessor of a shooting-lodge with a ball-room; a fact which sufficiently illustrates the luxury of these Anglo-Scotch arrangements. At the ball was the famous beauty Mrs. Langtry, who was staying in the house and who is probably for the moment the most celebrated woman in England. She is in sooth divinely handsome and it was 'extremely odd' to see her dancing a Highland reel (which she had been practising for three days) with young Lord Huntly, who is a very handsome fellow and who in his kilt and tartan, leaping and hooting and romping, opposite to this London divinity, offered a vivid reminder of ancient Caledonian barbarism and of the roughness which lurks in all British amusements and only wants a pretext to explode. We came home from our ball (where I took out two young ladies who had gone with us for a polka apiece) at four a.m., and I found it difficult on that morning, at breakfast, to comply with that rigid punctuality which is the custom of the house.... Today our fine weather has come to an end and we are closely involved in a ferocious wet tornado. But I am glad of the rest and quiet, and I have just bolted out of the library to escape the 'morning service,' read by the worthy Nevin, the American Episcopal chaplain in Rome, who is staying here, to which the dumb and decent servants are trooping in. I am fast becoming a good enough Englishman to respect inveterately my own habits and do, wherever I may be, only exactly what I want. This is the secret of prosperity here--provided of course one has a certain number of sociable and conformable habits, and civil inclinations, as a starting-point. After that, the more positive your idiosyncrasies the more positive the convenience. But it is drawing toward lunch, and I can't carry my personality quite so far as to be late for that.|$|E

50|$|An ex-pole vaulter, Nielsen got {{her to try}} {{the pole}} vault. At {{the time it was}} not an {{official}} event for women. She reluctantly gave it a try to appease her coach.

5000|$|Jeff Silva of Expandable Computer News, who {{rated the}} Coleco version 7 out of 10, praised {{the sound and}} graphics, and wrote that the game, [...] "in its simplicity, captures {{perfectly}} the one-dimensional themes of the original TV show.
