And that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|E

"We {{have not}} got any fuse," [...] Stanley said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> take a {{narrow strip of}} cloth, moisten it, and rub {{gunpowder}} into it; let it dry, and then roll it up, {{it would be all}} right.

But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could show that the man might very easily {{have been out of}} the house,--that he had {{certainly}} provided himself with means of getting out of the house secretly,--the coat would be of service.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{will take}} the story simply as it stands we shall see easily enough. For it is all simple and natural enough. Jacob and Esau, we shall see, were men of like passions with ourselves; men as we are, mixed up of good and evil, {{sometimes}} right and sometimes wrong: and God rewarded them when they did right, and punished them when they did wrong, just as he does with us now.|$|E

It will need a whole day for your mother and the maids to see to Albert's clothes, and that all is decent and in order. To-day is Monday, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> say that Albert will arrive there on Thursday by noon it will do very well. Will you be ready by that time, Edgar?" ...|$|E

To me you all seem to be working and {{thinking}} on very narrow lines. Your object seems to be the securing of small individual benefits for your individual constituents. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> get to work together in this country, there must be something more national in our aspirations. That is all I have to say for the present. As I think you know, I intend to make a pronouncement of my own views at Manchester." ...|$|E

In the first place, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can pull Gregory up now we shall save him from involving himself irretrievably. After all, perhaps, you owe him the effort. Then I think that we all owe something to Harry, and we can, at least, endeavor {{to carry out his}} wishes.

6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] he said, {{addressing}} us, [...] "I {{think that}} we should do well to try {{to get out of this}} place. Eliminating a great deal of the marvelous with which we seem to have come in touch here, it is still obvious that we find ourselves in very peculiar and unhealthy surroundings. I mean mentally unhealthy, indeed <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> stay here much longer we shall probably go off our heads. Now that boat on the deck remains sound and seaworthy. Why should not we provision her and take our chance? We know more or less which way to steer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no opinion, messieurs. I {{know nothing}} of the manners of the court, {{and if you think}} that {{tomorrow}} morning will be quite soon enough for us to deliver the despatches I am quite willing to fall in with your view. It is certainly a long ride, and as we marched hither we found that the roads were very bad, and certainly where the army has passed they are so cut up by the artillery and wagons that they are sure to be quite unfit for going at racing speed. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> present ourselves at the palace early in the morning, we shall have done all that can be expected of us." ...|$|E

"It makes none {{with the}} lower class of the people," [...] Von Aert agreed; [...] "but {{when we have to}} deal with people who have {{influential}} friends it is always best to be able to prove a case completely. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> get the names of those for whom the letters are meant we can utilize the boy again. We will send him to deliver the letters in person, as I believe he was intended to do. He may receive answers to take back to Holland; but even if he does not the fact that these people should have received such letters without at once denouncing the bearer and communicating the contents to us, will be quite sufficient proof of their guilt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Helen; 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she {{had been}} there, and I at home, I should have listened for her sake, besides that Mrs. Staunton was our own mamma's dearest friend.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'At Piteni, Matama, Nupani, Analogo, I {{can talk}} {{somewhat}} to the people, who are Polynesians, and speak a dialect {{connected with the}} Maori of New Zealand. I {{think that the people}} of Indeni (the native name for Santa Cruz) are also more than half Polynesians; but I don't know a single sentence of their language properly. I can say nothing about it. They destroy and distort their organs of pronunciation by excessive use of the betel-nut and pepper leaf and lime, so that no word is articulately pronounced. It is very hard to catch the sounds they make amidst the hubbub on deck or the crowds on shore; yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had two or three lads quietly with us at Norfolk Island, we should soon make out something.|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} put; but I was not perhaps so entirely ignorant as he {{imagined}} {{of the nature}} of that special knowledge, or shall we say faculty, which he claimed. I take it to be cunning--the cunning of a wild animal with a man's brain--and a small, an infinitesimal, dose of something else which eludes us. But that something else is not of a spiritual nature: the gipsy has no such thing in him; the soul growths are rooted in the social instinct, and are developed in those in whom that instinct is strong. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> analyse that dose of something else, we will find that it is still the animal's cunning, a special, a sublimated cunning, the fine flower of his whole nature, and that it has nothing mysterious in it. He is a parasite, but free and as well able to exist free as the fox or jackal; but the parasitism pays him well, and he has followed it so long in his intercourse with social man that it has come to be like an instinct, or secret knowledge, and {{is nothing more than a}} marvellously keen penetration which reveals to him the character and degree of credulity and other mental weaknesses of his subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{own that}} I am {{somewhat}} of your opinion, Paolo. My father brought me up a Protestant like yourself, and when I was quite young I {{had a very}} dreary time of it while he was away, living as I did {{in the house of}} a Huguenot pastor. After that I attended the Protestant services in the barracks, for all the officers and almost all the men are Protestants, and, of course, were allowed to have their own services; but the minister, who was a Scotchman, knew better than to make his discourses too lengthy; for if he did, there was a shuffling of jackboots on the stone floor and a clanking of sabres that warned him that the patience of the soldiers was exhausted. In our own glen my father has told me that the ministers are as long winded as those of Geneva; but, as he said, soldiers are a restless people, and it is one thing for men who regard their Sunday gathering as the chief event in the week to listen to lengthy discourses, but quite another for soldiers, either in the field or a city like Paris, to do so. However, if we do not find Geneva to our taste, {{there is no reason why}} we should tarry there, as Zurich lies on the other end of the lake, and Zurich is Catholic, or at any rate largely so, and Calvinist doctrines have never flourished there. But, on the other hand, the sympathies of Geneva have generally been with France, while those of Zurich are with Austria; therefore <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> like not Geneva we will go to Lyons, where, as an officer of Viscount Turenne's, I am sure to be well received." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{you were}} to hear my scheme you might take an {{interest}} in it. There is no use in hating people--if you hate anything, you should hate what produced them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can love}} you as {{honestly}} and as firmly as a younger one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you could bring {{yourself to be}} my wife, you would find {{that you would not}} be treated badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Bickley; {{but then}} I have always {{understood}} that the devil is beyond conversion because he is beyond repentance. You see, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> old scoundrel was not the devil himself, at any rate {{he was a bit}} of him, and, if I am right, I am not ashamed to have failed in his case." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again, {{he was a}} {{lover of}} nature. The quality which we should call mystery in a painting, and which belongs so {{particularly}} to the aspect of the external world and to its influence upon our feelings, was one which he was never weary of attempting to reproduce in his books. The seeming significance of nature's appearances, their unchanging strangeness to the senses, and the thrilling response which they waken {{in the mind of}} man, continued to surprise and stimulate his spirits. It appeared to him, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could only write near enough to the facts, and yet with no pedestrian calm, but ardently, we might transfer the glamour of reality direct upon our pages; and that, if it were once thus captured and expressed, a new and instructive relation might appear between men's thoughts and the phenomena of nature. This was the eagle that he pursued all his life long, like a schoolboy with a butterfly net. Hear him to a friend: [...] "Let me suggest a theme for you - to state to yourself precisely and completely what that walk over the mountains amounted to for you, returning to this essay again and again until you are satisfied that all that was important in your experience is in it. Don't suppose that you can tell it precisely the first dozen times you try, but at 'em again; especially when, after a sufficient pause you suspect that you are touching the heart or summit of the matter, reiterate your blows there, and account for the mountain to yourself. Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long while to make it short." [...] Such was the method, not consistent for a man whose meanings were to [...] "drop from him as a stone falls to the ground." [...] Perhaps the most successful work that Thoreau ever accomplished in this direction {{is to be found in}} the passages relating to fish in the WEEK. These are remarkable for a vivid truth of impression and a happy suitability of language, not frequently surpassed.|$|E
6000|$|... only <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> look far enough, {{we shall}} {{find that it}} is not {{intelligence}} itself, but the immediate act and effort of a laborious, struggling, and imperfect intellectual faculty, with which high moral emotion is inconsistent; and that though we cannot, while we feel deeply, reason shrewdly, yet I doubt if, except when we feel deeply, we can ever comprehend fully; so that it is only the climbing and mole-like piercing, and not the sitting upon their central throne, nor emergence into light, of the intellectual faculties which the full heart feeling allows not. Hence, therefore, in the indications of the countenance, they are only the hard cut lines, and rigid settings, and wasted hollows, that speak of past effort and painfulness of mental application, which are inconsistent with expression of moral feeling, for all these are of infelicitous augury; but not the full and serene development of habitual command in the look, and solemn thought in the brow, only these, in their unison with the signs of emotion, become softened and gradually confounded with a serenity and authority of nobler origin. But of the sweetness which that higher serenity (of happiness,) and the dignity which that higher authority (of Divine law, and not human reason,) can and must stamp on the features, it would be futile to speak here at length, for I suppose that both are acknowledged on all hands, and that there is not any beauty but theirs to which men pay long obedience: at all events, if not by sympathy discovered, it is not in words explicable with what divine lines and lights the exercise of godliness and charity will mould and gild the hardest and coldest countenance, neither to what darkness their departure will consign the loveliest. For there is not any virtue the exercise of which, even momentarily, will not impress a new fairness upon the features, neither on them only, but on the whole body, both the intelligence and the moral faculties have operation, for even all the movement and gestures, however slight, are different in their modes according to the mind that governs them, and on the gentleness and decision of just feeling there follows a grace of action, and through continuance of this a grace of form, which by no discipline may be taught or attained.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a very}} trying {{moment for}} us all, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had, any of us, had our choice, we should have {{preferred}} {{to be in her}} place rather than our own. We miserably did what we could to comfort her, and we at last silenced her with I do not know what pretences. The affair was quite too much for me, and I made a feint of having heard the children calling me, and I went out into the hall. I felt that there was a sort of indecency in my witnessing that poor young thing's emotion; women might see it, but a man ought not. Perhaps old Hasketh felt the same; he followed me out, and when we were beyond hearing, even if he had spoken aloud, he dropped his voice to a thick murmur and said, [...] "This has all been a mistake. We have {{had to get out of}} it with the girl the best we could; and we don't dare to let her know that Tedham isn't coming back any more. You noticed from what she said that my wife tried to make believe it might be well if he didn't; but she had to drop that; it set the girl wild. She hasn't got anything but the one idea: that she and her father belong to each other, and that they must be together for the rest of their lives. A curious thing about it is," [...] and Hasketh sank his voice still lower to say this, [...] "that she thinks that if he's taken the punishment that was put upon him he has atoned for what he did; and if any one tries to make him suffer more he does worse than Tedham did, and he's flying in the face of Providence. Perhaps it's so. I'm afraid," [...] Hasketh continued, with the satisfaction men take in blaming their wives under the cover of sympathy, [...] "that Mrs. Hasketh is going to feel it more and more, as time goes on, unless Tedham turns up. I was never in favor of trying to have the child forget him, or be separated from him in any way. That kind of thing can't be made to work, and I don't suppose, when you come to boil it down, that it's essentially right. This universe, I take it, isn't an accident in any particular, and if she's his daughter it's because she was meant to be, and to bear and share with him. You see it was a great mistake not to prepare the child for it sooner, and tell her just when Tedham would be out, so that if she wanted to see him she could. She thinks she ought to have been there at the prison waiting to speak to him the first one. I thought it was a mistake to have her away, and I guess that's the way Mrs. Hasketh looks at it herself, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the same}} time, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Mr. Dryfoos felt a {{personal}} censure in Mr. Lindau's questions concerning his {{suppression of the}} strike among his workmen, he {{had a right to}} resent it." ...|$|R
60|$|I rose obediently. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had {{not been}} there my father would have struck her. He was almost {{speechless}} with fury. He poured himself out another glass of brandy with shaking fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Clyffurde abruptly, [...] "I am not sure. Thank {{you very}} much. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you don't object to my {{somewhat}} morose company I {{would like a}} lift as far as Grenoble." ...|$|R
