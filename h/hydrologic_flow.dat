Although the overall difference was significantly positive, calculations on the 30 m DEMs sometimes produced straight-line paths that were longer than the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flow</b> paths, apparently due to inaccuracies in the data.

The very different results produced at the three scales demonstrate that using the finest-grained elevation data may substantially improve placement of BMPs intended to mitigate for heavy animal use areas. The use of 30 m DEMs for this purpose should be avoided.

40|$|Abstract: WEHY model takes a new {{approach}} to the modeling of hydrologic processes in order to account for the effect of heterogeneity within natural watersheds. Toward this purpose, the point-scale conservation equations for various hydrologic processes were upscaled in order to obtain their ensemble averaged forms at the scale of the computational grid areas. Over hillslopes these grid areas correspond to areas along a complete transect of a hillslope. The resulting upscaled conservation equations, although they are fundamentally one-dimensional, have the lateral source/sink terms that link them dynamically to other hydrologic component processes. In this manner, these upscaled equations possess the dynamic interaction feature of the standard point scale two dimensional hydrologic conservation equations. A significant computational economy is achieved by the capability of the upscaled equations to compute <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows</b> over large transactional grid areas versus the necessity of computing <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows</b> over small grid areas by point-scale equations in order to account for the effect of environmental heterogeneity on flows. The emerging parameters in the upscaled hydrologic conservation equations are areal averages and areal variances/covariances of the original point-scale parameters, thereby quantifying the spatial variation of the original point-scale parameters over a computational grid area, and, thus, the effect of land heterogeneity on <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows.</b> Also, by requiring only areal average and areal variance/covariance of paramete...|$|R

40|$|Wildland fire is {{a natural}} {{disturbance}} that affects the distribution and abun-dance of native fishes in the Rocky Mountain West (Rieman and others 2003). Fire can remove riparian vegetation, increasing direct solar radiation to the stream surface and leading to warmer summer water temperatures (fig. 1). Fire can also consume vegetation and organic biomass on the forest floor, chang-ing <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows,</b> stream qual-ity, and fish habitat suitability. Many native fish species, such as bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), have evolved with fire, and their populations are resilient to fire’s effects given adequate con-nectivity to robust population segments elsewhere in a basin. This resiliency, however, has been reduced in many watersheds through stream habitat loss and degradation and the invasion of nonnative fishes (e. g., brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, and brown trout, Salmo trutta) that better tol-erate warmer water temperatures and threaten native fish persistence through displacement and hybrid-ization.

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{weathering}} incongruency during soil formation from rock controls local carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems, {{as well as}} the evolution of <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flow</b> paths. Prior studies of basalt weathering, including those that have quantified the dynamics of well-mixed, bench-scale laboratory reactors or characterized the structure and integrated response of field systems, indicate a strong influence of system scale on weathering rate and trajectory. For example, integrated catchment response tends to produce lower weathering rates than do well mixed reactors, but the mechanisms underlying these disparities remain unclear. Here we present pore water geochemistry and physical sensor data gathered during two controlled rainfall-runoff events on a large-scale convergent model hillslope mantled with 1 m uniform depth of granular basaltic porous media. The dense sampler and sensor array (1488 samplers and sensors embedded in 330 m(3) of basalt) showed that rainfall-induced dissolution of basaltic glass produced supersaturation of pore waters with respect to multiple secondary solids including allophane, gibbsite, ferrihydrite, birnessite and calcite. The spatial distribution of saturation state was heterogeneous, suggesting an accumulation of solutes leading to precipitation of secondary solids along <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flow</b> paths.

Diving parameters were recorded using pressure-sensitive time-depth recorders for turtles residing within a free flowing versus regulated reach. Maximum submergence time recorded for El. albagula (greater than 3 hours) is among the longest recorded for a voluntarily diving vertebrate, and is attributed to the turtle 2 ̆ 7 s ability to respire aquatically. Median dive times logged for El. albagula within the regulated reach (6. 7 min) were threefold longer than values recorded for turtles residing within a naturally flowing creek (1. 9 min), with discrepancies in dive duration possibly due to the variable <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows</b> recorded below the weir. No correlation was observed between dive duration and subsequent surfacing intervals, suggesting that dives remained aerobic throughout the study.

Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as stream bank buffers are intended to intercept sediment moving from heavy-use areas toward the stream. The placement of BMPs on a farm is generally based on untested assumptions about flow paths. Most often, a straight-line distance from the heavy-use area to the stream {{is assumed to be}} correct. Our objective was to compare the straight-line path to <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flow</b> paths calculated from fine-, medium- and coarse-grained Digital Elevation Models (DEMs; 1 m, 10 m, 30 m) for 471 mapped heavy-use points within 100 m of the stream.

We anticipated that the flow path distance would be longer than the straight-line distance in all cases, that the finest resolution would lead to the most accurate measurement, but that the difference might not be great enough to justify the increased costs. Understanding the changes in path length and direction calculated using more complex methods and higher-resolution source data will enable us to make recommendations on methods to be used in developing conservation management plans.

Here we review {{some of the major}} scientific and technological advances in ecohydrology as related to understanding the mechanisms by which plant–water relations influence water fluxes at ecosystem, watershed and landscape scales. Important Findings We identify several cross-cutting themes related to the role of plant– water relations in the ecohydrological literature, including the contrasting dynamics of water-limited and water-abundant ecosystems, transferring information about water fluxes across scales, understanding spatiotemporal heterogeneity and complexity, ecohydrological triggers associated with threshold behavior and shifts between alternative stable states and the need for long-term data sets at multiple scales. We then show how these themes are embedded within three key research areas where improved understanding of the linkages between plant–water relations and the hydrologic cycle have led to important advances in the field of ecohydrology: upscaling water fluxes from the leaf to the watershed and landscape, effects of plant–soil interactions on soil moisture dynamics and controls exerted by plant water use patterns and mechanisms on streamflow regime. In particular, we highlight several pressing environmental challenges facing society today where ecohydrology can contribute to the scientific knowledge for developing sound management and policy solutions.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} in New England salt marshes have altered <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows</b> in various ways, but unintended consequences from {{some types of}} habitat modifications have received little attention. Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but {{the effects of these}} hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh’s ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated soils, marsh subsidence, and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion...|$|R

The establishment of biomass plantations on wastelands is likely to affect local livelihoods and surrounding ecosystems by influencing <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows</b> and processes such as erosion. We analyzed the technical feasibility for cultivating Jatropha on degraded waste lands in India using a water balance approach. More specifically, an assessment was made for a wasteland located in the Velchal watershed, Andhra Pradesh, India, which recently was converted to a biofuel plantation with Jatropha. The previous land-use, in this case grazing, could continue in the Jatropha plantations. Several desirable effects occurred as a result of the land-use conversion: non-productive soil evaporation was reduced as a larger share of the precipitation was channeled to productive plant transpiration and groundwater recharge, and at the same time a more stable (less erosive) runoff resulted in reduced soil erosion and improved downstream water conditions. A win-win situation between improved land productivity and soil carbon content was observed for the Jatropha plantations. Results did not show a negative impact on the blue water generation after introducing Jatropha on waste lands. Using parameterized and validated hydrological model “Soil and Water Assessment Tool” we assumed the impact of Jatropha cultivation on 13. 4 million ha of wastelands (15 % of the total wasteland area) in seven states of India.

The maximum depth of measured water-content change at a specific site is a function of surface storage capacity, the timing and magnitude of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the degree of saturation of surficial materials overlying fractured bedrock. Measured water-content profiles for the four zones indicated that the potential for net infiltration is higher when evapotranspiration is low (i. e winter, cloudy periods), where surface concentration of water is likely to occur (i. e. depressions, channels), where surface storage capacity is low, and where fractured bedrock is close to the surface...|$|E

It relates to the dissolved and solid loads of the two main rivers of French Guiana, the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, running on the Guiana Shield and draining respectively 64 230 and 24 630 km(2). The low coefficient of variation of the average annual flows of the two rivers indicates an inter-annual hydrological stability probably related to the immediate vicinity of the Atlantic Ocean. The sedimentary load is mainly composed of quartz and kaolinite. The total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations are among the world's lowest values; they range from 1 to 130 mg l(- 1) during the hydrological cycle, with averages of 22 and 12 mg l(- 1), for the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, respectively. The seasonal variability of these values is significantly higher than that of <b>hydrologic</b> <b>flows,</b> but without simple relationship with the discharge. Water chemical composition of the two rivers indicates a very weak mineralization, very similar to that found in the Amazonian rivers running on the Brazilian and Guianese shields, and in the Congo River and its tributaries in the Central African Shield. Seasonal variations are observed in both basins; they correspond to higher concentrations during low water stage (from October to February) and to more diluted water during the flood, from April to July.

The following discussion summarizes progress made on the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work for this Subcontract Details of this work and all data acquired by Hydro Geo Chem for this Subcontract have, been systematically organized in logbooks and - laboratory notebooks (Appendices A and B). These documents have been structured to make it easy to trace the analytical history of a sample, from time of receipt to the final analytical results. The current status of this work and its relevance for the Yucca Mountain Project are described in a LANL report co-authored by Hydro Geo Chem staff...|$|R
