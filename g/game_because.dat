5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} to defend against opponents who play a long ball <b>game</b> <b>because</b> he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E

5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} <b>game</b> <b>because</b> he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being {{hit in the head}} two days prior.

Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{the rushing}} success of its {{previous}} drive, Virginia Tech used fullback Josh Oglesby {{in tandem with}} Williams, who also figured prominently in the team's second possession of the half.
