However, the Fifth Circuit decided that her case was moot, in McCorvey v. Hill.

25|$|Agreeing {{with the}} Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal {{held that the}} {{mandatory}} death penalty satisfied the reasonable classification test {{used to assess the}} constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in Ong Ah Chuan, the Court found that the 15-gram differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could not be said to be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a wholesale dealer operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely <b>harm</b> <b>suffered</b> by society {{as a result of the}} offender's crime.|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish Inquisition {{had been}} {{established}} in part to prevent conversos from engaging in Jewish practices, which, as Christians, {{they were supposed to}} have given up. However this remedy for securing the orthodoxy of conversos was eventually deemed inadequate since the main justification the monarchy gave for formally expelling all Jews from Spain was the [...] "great <b>harm</b> <b>suffered</b> by Christians (i.e., conversos) from the contact, intercourse and communication which they have with the Jews, who always attempt in various ways to seduce faithful Christians from our Holy Catholic Faith". The Alhambra Decree, issued in January 1492, ordered the expulsion. Historic accounts of the numbers of Jews who left Spain have been vastly exaggerated by early accounts and historians: Juan de Mariana speaks of 800,000 people, and Don Isaac Abravanel of 300,000. Modern estimates, based on careful examination of official documents and population estimates of communities, are much lower: Henry Kamen estimates that, of a population of approximately 80,000 Jews and 200,000 conversos, about 40,000 chose emigration. The Jews of the kingdom of Castile emigrated mainly to Portugal (whence they were expelled in 1497) and to North Africa. However, according to Kamen, the Jews of the kingdom of Aragon went [...] "to adjacent Christian lands, mainly to Italy", rather than to Muslim lands as is often assumed. Although the vast majority of conversos simply assimilated into the Catholic dominant culture, a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present {{as a result of the}} Alhambra Decree.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the pursuit of gender equality rights before the European Court of Human Rights from a comparative perspective. Drawing on material from case reports {{from a number of}} European countries, this article investigates the application of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the non-discrimination provision) to instances of gender discrimination. Using a theoretical framework of `intersectionality, this article suggests that many cases that arguably have a gender component to them are not viewed as such by the European Court of Human Rights. Instead, they are treated as generic claims raising other civil or political rights and are thereby stripped of their important gender dimension. Two recent cases of the Court brought against Bulgaria (MC and Bevacqua) are, however, celebrated for a more gender specific analysis of the `private <b>harms</b> <b>suffered</b> by the victims in these cases...|$|R
40|$|We {{incorporate}} normative motivations {{into the}} economic model of accidents and tort rules. The social norm {{is that one}} should avoid harming others and should compensate if nevertheless harm is caused. To some extent, this is internalized through intrinsic moral concerns; moreover, those thought not {{to adhere to the}} norm are met with social disapproval. Moral and reputational concerns are not strong enough, however, for injurers to willingly compensate their victims. Absent legal liability, normative concerns induce precautions to prevent harm but precautions are then socially inefficient. By contrast, perfectly enforced legal liability crowds out informal incentives completely (e. g., individuals causing <b>harm</b> <b>suffer</b> no stigma) but precautions are then socially efficient. Under imperfectly enforced legal liability, formal legal sanctions and normative concerns are complements and interact to induce more precautions than under no-liability. Intrinsic motivations, social norms, esteem, strict liability, negligence, crowding out...|$|R
40|$|Society’s greater {{awareness}} of the incidence of and damage caused by {{child abuse and neglect}} has led to the enactment in most Australian states and territories of legislation requiring teachers, among others, to report suspicions of abuse.

This article considers whether the common law provides an avenue for recovery of damages in such circumstances.

40|$|Much of women’s {{experiences}} {{during and}} following periods of extensive violence are informed by pre-existing, peacetime, inequalities. The specific gendered <b>harms</b> <b>suffered</b> by women, such as sexual violence and exploitation, {{are grounded in}} understandings of gendered roles in society and the perceived links between reproduction and community. Thus, as the growing body of feminist research into processes of transitional justice show, women have vital stakes in post-conflict transformation, rather than reconstruction (Chinking and Charlesworth 2006 cited in Reilly 2007, Ní Aoláin 2012). Likewise, the (often far less visible) expectation that women sustain their caring roles in the everyday of war – providing food, shelter, and care for dependents, or soldiers, in often desperate contexts – constitutes specifically gendered experiences associated with existing inequalities and expectations (Reilly 2007). With this knowledge in mind, it is increasingly obvious that for women periods of societal transition have to aim for {{the transformation of the}} underlying inequalities that provided the conditions in which these specifically gendered harms were possible...|$|R
40|$|Ethical {{issues of}} justice and human rights are central to {{countries}} emerging from conflict. Yet involving women in transitional justice processes rarely is articulated in ethical terms.

Women and men often experience conflict and injustices differently which may require different responses to redress <b>harms</b> <b>suffered.</b> Timor-Leste is used as a case study. The paper explores whether hybrid traditional and formal justice systems can address women’s justice claims in principle and specifically, when applied to Timor-Leste. The paper maintains that customary justice practices can be combined with conventional ones, but only when both practices adhere to international human rights conventions, which rarely happens where patriarchal practices are entrenched. The conclusion addresses what might be done to create gender-responsive justice systems given that they are crucial in building environments that are conducive to sustainable peace and security...|$|R
40|$|The {{success or}} failure of slavery reparations will depend on causation. Many criticisms of reparations have focused on the {{attenuated}} nature of the harm, suggesting that modern claimants are not connected to slaves, that modern payers are not connected to slave owners, and that <b>harms</b> <b>suffered</b> by modern Blacks cannot be connected to slavery. This Article examines these attenuation concerns and finds that they come in three related but distinct varieties: Victim attenuation, wrongdoer attenuation, and act attenuation. These three components, defined in this Article, show themselves in a number of interrelated arguments. The Article then discusses how ideas about causation from the mass tort context can help address the problems of attenuation in slavery reparations. Mass tort cases have developed novel methods of showing causation, such as statistical evidence and market share liability, and these tools can be used in the reparations context. These concepts, if used within the reparations context, could help overcome attenuation...|$|R
