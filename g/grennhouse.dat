40|$|This study offers {{in first}} place, a careful {{analysis}} of the legislation about renewable energy sources, and, in particurlar, energy production from them. The theme is developped on international level, through the origins of this recent branch of the law. Beginning from international policies about reductions of <b>grennhouse</b> gases - which are the real fulcrum {{for the development of}} renewable energy sources - communitary and national legislation on energy production from renewable energy sources is then analyzed. Successively, focus is given to problems related to some particular types of renewable energy sources, that is, biomasses of agricultural origin indeed. The correct legislational framwork is analyzed for biomasses and for their belongings to goods or wastes when used for energy production, also {{as a consequence of the}} so called “Nitrati Directive”. The problem is faced not only on communitary and national level, but also on local one...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to apply the {{instrument}} of geographic information system (GIS) to evaluate the impacts of climatic changes on the geografic distribuition of quarantine pests in Brazil, based on scenarios of greenhouse gas emitions of the Forth Assesment Report Reports of the IPCC. Towards the economic importance of brazilian agriculture and the imminent threat of climatic changes and the possible consequences on the phytossanitary dynamics on crops, became necessary the study of spatial and temporal distribuition simulations. The GIS presented itself as a powerfull implement {{that can be used}} to evaluate the probability of future damages and pest risky analysis on the country?s field. The maps of monthly projections to favorable areas to the occurrence of red palm mite (Raoiella indica Hirst) to the period of 1961 - 1990 and to the period of 2071 - 2100, A 2 scenario of <b>grennhouse</b> gas emitions, they were elaborated using spatial operations of mathematical and logical expressions. The areas with climate favorability ranges to the red palm mite were calculated to Brazil. Currently the red palm mite in Brazil has its occurrence restricted, notwithstanding, with climatic changes the future predicts more favorable conditions, when compared to the 1961 - 1990 weather. 201...|$|E
40|$|Foi conduzido um trabalho em casa de vegetação com o objetivo de estudar o efeito de 10 dias de estresse hídrico (Yw de ³ 2, 6; - 2, 2; - 0, 35 e - 0, 2 MPa) sobre a eficiência do halosulfuron (150 g p. c. /ha+Aterbane- 0, 25 % v/v) no controle de tiririca em pós-emergência. A aplicação do halosulfuron em plantas de tiririca sob estresse de até - 2, 6 MPa controlou satisfatoriamente a tiririca desde que irrigadas até 24 horas após a aplicação, mas quando a irrigação ocorreu 48 horas após, houve comprometimento na translocação do herbicida nas plantas. Quando o estresse foi menor que - 2, 0 MPa, o herbicida manteve-se eficaz no controle de tiririca, principalmente para aquelas com Yw de - 0, 35 MPa. A <b>grennhouse</b> {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effect of 10 days water stress (Yw values of ³ 2. 6; - 2. 2 - 0. 35, and - 0. 2 MPa) on the efficacy of pos-emergent application of halosulfuron (150 g c. p. /ha+Aterbane 0. 25 % v/v) in the control of purple nutsedge. When the suitable water supplying began {{in a period of}} 24 hours after the herbicide spraying, halosulfuron gave an excellent control of purple nutsedge under every water stress conditions. When the suitable irrigation conditions began 48 hours after herbicide spraying, there was a lower halosulfuron efficacy. When the stress was lower than - 2. 0 MPa, the herbicide gave a good control, mainly in the Yw of - 0. 35 MPa...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural systems, {{especially}} livestock systems, {{are a large}} {{source of}} emissions of <b>grennhouse</b> gas (nitrous oxide N 2 O, methane CH 4, carbon dioxide CO 2) and reactive nitrogen (ammonia NH 3, nitrogen oxides NOx, nitrates NO 3) in Europe. Several mitigation options, such as organic farming, have been suggested in the literature. But they mainly focused on a single gas and dealt with isolated processes. An integrated modelling tool has been developed to assess the effect of farm practices on reactive nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions at the whole farm level. It couples the farm model FARMSIM with the cropland model CERES-EGC and the grassland model PASIM. To assess the contribution of a mechanistic crop model instead of crop emission factors, this integrated tool was compared with that initially developed in the GREENGRASS project and using the IPCC methodology for cropland emissions. Moreover, FARMSIM now includes a module taking into account emissions outside the farm boundaries. To illustrate the model behaviour, a ruminant livestock system was reconstructed from description of farming practices within an intensive dairy farm located in the north-east of France (INRA Mirecourt, Lorraine). As regards reactive nitrogen emissions and greenhouse balance gas balance, this conventional intensive farming system was compared with an associated system using mitigation options e. g., reducing fertilisers supply, reducing male calves number, modifying crop types. Further work is required to assess the model capabilities to predict nitrogen and carbon fluxes at the farm level. But this modelling tool shows promise to define and evaluate mitigation strategies at the whole farm level. Extending this approach at the landscape level meets Component 4 (Landscape analysis) of the NitroEurope projec...|$|E
