2500|$|Nevertheless, Byzantine {{music is}} modal and entirely {{dependent}} on the Ancient Greek concept of harmonics. Its tonal system {{is based on a}} synthesis with ancient Greek models, but we have no sources left that <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> how this synthesis was done. Carolingian cantors could mix the science of harmonics with a discussion of church tones, named after the ethnic names of the octave species and their transposition tropes, because they invented an own octoechos {{on the basis of the}} Byzantine one. But they made no use of earlier Pythagorean concepts tbat had been fundamental for Byzantine music, including: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you then}} have the {{goodness}} to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> whether the soul of Chat-to-bri-ong is more expanded than his reason, or his reason more expanded than his soul?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am almost ashamed,' said Sissy, with reluctance. 'But to-day, for instance, Mr. M'Choakumchild was <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about Natural Prosperity.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You have <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{why it is}} {{impossible}} that Michael Jackson {{died as a result}} of orally swallowing propofol?" [...] "Yes".|$|R
50|$|It {{is a story}} {{concerning}} life, depicting {{life through}} the lives of certain characters of the film. It <b>explains</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the meaning of life, whether its lone, devotion or human good.|$|R
60|$|It {{was in this}} manner, {{that the}} holy apostle, Francis Xavier, {{instructed}} the young men of the Society; and nothing, perhaps, could better <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the great resemblance that was betwixt the souls of Xavier and Ignatius.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you take}} a seat, Ned?" [...] Mr. Simmonds, who was the senior magistrate, said. [...] "We have asked you here to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the meaning of certain rumors which are current {{in the town of}} an attack upon your mill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true, sir," [...] said Paul; [...] "but {{here are}} many minds among few men. Nor is this all; agreeably {{to your own}} account, some of these men do not exactly know their own minds. But, can you <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> what {{essential}} points are involved in all these shades of opinion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ("That is, when I {{walked through}} the house the other day, on the {{occasion}} of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare," [...] Mr. Skimpole airily <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|For, my friends, this is {{the meaning}} of the text, as far as it has <b>to</b> do with <b>us.</b> The noble Collect for to-day tells this, and <b>explains</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> what we are to think of the Epistle and the Gospel.|$|R
60|$|We regret {{very much}} having no letters to Lady Molesworth, {{who was an}} old and dear friend of Charles Dickens. But this lady <b>explains</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> that she has long ceased to {{preserve}} any letters addressed to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God!" [...] she exclaimed, shaking herself like a dog. [...] "Now I'll roll on {{the carpet}} and see if I can't brush off {{what remains of the}} Union Jack. Then perhaps--" [...] here she rolled energetically. Getting up she began to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> what modern {{pictures}} are like when Castalia stopped her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you must}} <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> naughty fox-hunters how all this {{agrees with the}} good book. We see plainly enough, in the meantime, how it agrees with [...] "poor human nature." [...] We see that the [...] "religious world," [...] like the [...] "great world," [...] and the [...] "sporting world," [...] and the [...] "literary world," ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allow me to {{interrupt}} you for one moment, Smith," [...] said the old gentleman, who had been listening attentively to my words. [...] "We understood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity you should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible. Can you <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{what you mean by}} dressing in accordance with the fashion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} to be no war!" [...] Mrs. Barlow exclaimed. [...] "Mr. Selingman has been <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> this {{afternoon}} what wonderful offers Germany is making, so that we shall be able to remain neutral and yet keep our pledges." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked his}} reasons behind {{performing}} the DDoS attacks, Downey <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds that [...] "I {{was doing it}} because I could, more than anything," [...] and [...] "It was a dumb thing to do." ...|$|R
60|$|Now man, as we know, is {{an animal}} with an immortal spirit in him. He has, as St. Paul so {{carefully}} <b>explains</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> a flesh and a spirit--a flesh like the beasts which perish; a spirit {{which comes from}} God.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said he, [...] "Rollo, you {{undertook}} to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> from your stores of knowledge, what {{the effects of}} a suspension of gravitation would be; and, in attempting to tell that houses would be in danger of being blown away, you came no nearer than to tell us that boys could not stand up straight; and that is what I call pretty wide shooting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said he, sternly--he {{always called}} his {{brother-in-law}} [...] "sir" [...] {{when he was}} in a sarcastic or reproachful mood--"I've had an idea for some time that you were plotting mischief. You haven't looked me straight in the eye for a week, and you've twice been late to dinner. I will ask you to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> sir, the brutal suggestion you have just advanced." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{when he was}} {{no longer}} in the unaccustomed meshes of refined conversation, but {{speaking}} with an audience before him, he became a different man. He declared he would <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> just exactly what socialism was, and went on at once to an impassioned contrast of social conditions. [...] "You young men," [...] he said [...] "come from homes of luxury; every need you feel is supplied--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{showed a}} want of poetry in the man," [...] Mr. Skimpole assented, but with perfect good humour. [...] "It was coarse. There was {{an absence of}} the finer touches of {{humanity}} in it! My daughters have taken great offence," [...] he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> [...] "at an honest man--" ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the vessel}} was slowly {{advancing}} to her anchorage, under a light breeze, Jack <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> that Avatea {{was still on}} the island, living amongst the heathens; that she had expressed a strong desire to join the Christians; but Tararo would not let her, and kept her constantly in close confinement.|$|R
50|$|The group {{stood outside}} the court’s main {{entrance}} chanting slogans denouncing Ncube and Lunga. “Welshman (Ncube) isn’t a professional lawyer. How can he allow a selfish and greedy person like Barbra to use him for her own ends? We demand to see him so that he <b>explains</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> his exact role, failure of which we’ll deal with him,” said the war veterans.|$|R
6000|$|Both {{psychology}} and science grope {{when they would}} <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the strange adventures of our immaterial selves when wandering {{in the realm of}} [...] "Death's twin brother, Sleep." [...] This story will not attempt to be illuminative; it {{is no more than a}} record of Murray's dream. One of the most puzzling phases of that strange waking sleep is that dreams which seem to cover months or even years may take place within a few seconds or minutes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, Augusta," [...] {{said the}} stolid Jodd, [...] "but before we kill our own general, whom you {{commanded}} us to obey in all things, {{we would know}} why we must kill him. It is a custom of our country that no man shall be killed until he has been heard. General Olaf," [...] and drawing his short sword for the first time, he saluted me in form, [...] "be pleased to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> why you are to be killed or taken prisoner." ...|$|E
60|$|Before we had {{satisfied}} our hunger {{my cousin}} {{was in a}} more pleasant frame of mind and condescended to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all that had been said and done on the plantation after we left. As nearly as I could make out it seemed {{that my mother was}} willing we should go our own pace, although {{as a matter of course}} she, like any other woman, was frightened at the idea of our venturing among enemies, for surely with my father in the so-called rebel army, we could count that these red-coated gentry would be anything but friendly to those who came from the Hamilton plantation.|$|E
60|$|He said {{he would}} show us the imposture so {{that we might be}} warned against it, and not be taken in by it; and he fetched Uncle's pack of cards from the tea-caddy, and, {{selecting}} three cards from the pack, two plain cards and one picture card, sat down on the hearthrug, and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{what he was going to}} do.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{she pointed}} out <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the {{building}} like a powder magazine, and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in what manner the silver was brought from the mine, and was brought over from the mainland, and was stored here. The Christopher Columbus would have a rich lading, she said, for {{there had been a}} great yield that year, a much richer yield than usual, and there was a chest of jewels besides the silver.|$|R
5000|$|No {{matter where}} we went, our tour guide {{seemed to know}} somebody. He was really the one who <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the Hawaiian concept of ohana, a sense of family that extends far beyond your {{immediate}} relatives. That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme, the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do, which is destroy.|$|R
6000|$|The spiritualists {{themselves}} {{admit that}} their table-rapping spooks are precious dull dogs; {{it would be}} difficult, in face of the communications recorded, for them to deny it. They <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{that they have not}} yet achieved communication with the higher spiritual Intelligences. The more intelligent spirits--for some reason that the spiritualists themselves are unable to explain--do not want to talk to them, appear to have something else to do. At present--so I am told, and can believe--it is only the spirits of lower intelligence that care to turn up on these evenings. The spiritualists argue that, by continuing, the higher-class spirits will later on be induced to [...] "come in." [...] I fail to follow the argument. It {{seems to me that we}} are frightening them away. Anyhow, myself I shall wait awhile.|$|E
60|$|We {{had a very}} {{comfortable}} little banquet seated on the broken lumps of stone which lie about under {{the walls of the}} tomb. I wonder whether the shade of Cecilia Metella was looking down upon us. We have heard much of her in these latter days, and yet we know nothing about her, nor can conceive why she was honoured with a bigger tomb than any other Roman matron. There were those then among our party who believed that she might still come back among us, and with due assistance from some cognate susceptible spirit, <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the cause of her widowed husband's liberality. Alas, alas! if we may judge of the Romans by ourselves, the true reason for such sepulchral grandeur would redound little to the credit of the lady Cecilia Metella herself, or to that of Crassus, her bereaved and desolate lord.|$|E
60|$|On {{the island}} at our right was the machine {{they call the}} Nilometer, a stone-column whose {{business}} it is to mark {{the rise of the}} river and prophecy whether it will reach only thirty-two feet and produce a famine, or whether it will properly flood the land at forty and produce plenty, or whether it will rise to forty-three and bring death and destruction to flocks and crops--but how it does all this they could not <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> so that we could understand. On the same island is still shown the spot where Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in the bulrushes. Near the spot we sailed from, the Holy Family dwelt when they sojourned in Egypt till Herod should complete his slaughter of the innocents. The same tree they rested under when they first arrived, was there a short time ago, but the Viceroy of Egypt sent it to the Empress Eugenie lately. He was just in time, otherwise our pilgrims would have had it.|$|E
60|$|Jack now <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> that he {{had found}} the king in a happy state of satiety, smoking in his very curious and uneasy-looking easy-chair; {{that he had}} at first begged and entreated him (Jack) to stay and take command of his warriors, and had {{followed}} up his entreaties with a hint that it was just possible he might adopt stronger measures if entreaty failed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humphrey, {{you must}} <b>explain</b> it <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> I am so {{interested}} in gardens I'm {{going to have one}} if Electrics increase their dividend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And we {{will make}} love," [...] added the stage manager; [...] "not like marionettes, but like ladies and gentlemen all alive." [...] Seizing the lady nearest <b>to</b> him, he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> by object lesson how the real peasant {{invariably}} behaves when under influence of the grand passion, standing gracefully with hands clasped upon heart, head inclined at an angle of forty-five, his whole countenance eloquent with tender adoration.|$|R
