5000|$|Born to Danish {{immigrants}} in the bayside town of Hoquiam, Washington, Autzen grew up around logging. His father Peter (1854-1918) spent his early adult life working successfully as a logger {{through much of the}} late 1800s. In 1902, Peter purchased an established Northwest wood products mill, originally known as Doernbecher and Holbrook. Once the Autzen family took over management, they renamed the mill [...] "Portland Manufacturing Company." [...] Under Peter's leadership, management at the St. Johns-based mill began pioneering some of the nation's earliest known, mass-produced, plywood panels. A self-engineered <b>glue</b> <b>spreader,</b> which allowed [...] "plys" [...] of wood to easily bond during mass-production, helped drive production levels to a new high. Thomas J. Autzen and the mill's superintendent, Oscar Mason, are credited with developing the device and marketing it into the company's greatest asset.|$|E
40|$|A {{good work}} {{environment}} {{is important for}} the individual, for industry and for society. The work environment research has, predominantly, targeted identification of problems and the measurement of the size of these problems. Innovations to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorder, MSD, have been introduced in different branches of industry, but with limited success. Few of the ergonomic innovations developed for the building and construction industry have reached a sufficient level of adoption. Ergonomic innovations in the health care sector are of an incremental character and seem to have similar problems of adoption as the ones in the building and construction industry. Three examples of ergonomic innovation are examined in the thesis: a <b>glue</b> <b>spreader</b> for floor layers a four-wheel walker with a lifting device a sonographerâ€™s scanning support device The studies show that an ergonomic innovation is not adopted for prevention of occupational injury unless the innovation also has other relative advantages apart from the ergonomic ones. For the group who already has sustained an injury, it is enough that the ergonomic problems are solved, while the other, symptom-free group, requires other advantages in order to adopt the innovation; increased production economy seems to be the most prominent potential advantage.
