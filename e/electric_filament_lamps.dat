5000|$|Almost {{twenty years}} later, in 1933, Ryan {{was also the}} {{lighting}} designer for Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition, which again was notable for its lighting innovation. To match the art moderne architecture, Ryan used the new electric gaseous discharge lamps, especially neon (over 75,000 feet of neon tubing in addition to more than 15,000 incandescent lamps). The fair was conceived of in large part as a lighting display; building surfaces were brightly colored, smooth, and shiny with few openings, for optimum reflectivity, and the fair opened at night (with a fireworks display ignited by light from the star Arcturus that had originated {{at the time of}} the previous Chicago World's Fair, converted into an electrical pulse by a photo-electric cell). The exterior lighting required 3,000 kilowatts of power; the General Electric building had a simulated waterfall on its side that alone required 5,000 feet of blue tube lighting. But the use of new technology enabled Ryan to obtain the maximum amount of light for the fair's limited funds. Scintillators were used again, with smoke effects from the fireworks, but this time the modern lighting fixtures were placed in full view. The largest <b>electric</b> incandescent <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> in the world, 50 kilowatts, was on display. For its second year, in 1934, the illumination was increased by about half, and the Ford Building had a Pillar of Light created by 24 searchlights projecting a mile into the sky. The closing program for the exposition on October 31, 1934, was titled [...] "The Festival of Illumination: The Apotheosis of Man-Made Light." [...] Again, the fair was influential: the expositions at Dallas and Cleveland the following year both emulated both the architecture and the lighting of the Chicago fair.|$|R

40|$|The aging {{characteristics}} and lifetimes of tungsten <b>filament</b> encoder <b>lamps</b> were determined {{as a function}} of operating voltage and filament material. For pure tungsten and thoria doped (1 pct.) <b>filament</b> <b>lamps,</b> crystal grain growth over the center portion of the filament leads to the ultimate failure of the lamp. The development of notches associated with this grain growth is the cause of lamp burn out. Eventually, one of the notches will 'etch' through the filament, causing it to fail open. For rhenium doped (3 pct.) <b>filament</b> <b>lamps,</b> distortion of the filament leads to the ultimate failure of the lamp. The lifetime of these lamps is about 1 year at an operating voltage of 5. 0 volts. The pure tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> have the longest average lifetime, and the thoria doped <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> have the shortest at 5. 0 volts. The lifetimes of these lamps is about 7 years at an operating voltage of 3. 5 volts. Data suggest that the rhenium doped lamps will have the longest average lifetime at 3. 5 volts, and the thoria doped will have the shortest. These lifetimes are comparable to the desired lifetimes of 7 years...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{constant}} illumination level {{control of a}} reading lamp is considered, with the microcontroller PIC, by continuously adjusting the illumination level on a desk from the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp.</b> The illumination, from the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> is transformed into the voltage by the phototransistor on the desk. From the voltage thus transformed, we can know the illumination level on the desk indirectly. For the purpose of constant illumination level control, the phase control of the AC voltage, {{in terms of the}} triac, is adopted. Since the transformed voltage through the phototransistor is small, the voltage is amplified by the operational amplifier. The amplified voltage is applied to the microcomputer PIC and A/D converted in the PIC with a resolution of 10 bits. The microcontroller program is implemented as follows. If the A/ D converted value is larger than the reference input value, the phase delay of the AC voltage, applied to the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> is set to increase. Then the brightness of the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> decreases, and vice versa. According to these adjustments of the illumination level on the desk, the feedback control of the constant illumination level from the reading lamp, is carried out...|$|R
