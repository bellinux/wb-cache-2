5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under cover of {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes attributed the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>and</b> then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ancient}} past, {{there was a}} hero named Hou Yi who was {{excellent}} at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi {{did not want to}} leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But Peng Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved very much her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>and</b> gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.|$|E
500|$|Until March 26, 2008, a -tall {{member of}} the species was a {{prominent}} [...] "centerpiece" [...] of the sculpture garden at the Noguchi Museum in the Astoria section in the borough of Queens in New York City. The tree had been spared by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum and cleaned up its back lot. The tree {{was the only one}} he left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>and</b> the staff would eat lunch with Noguchi under it. [...] "n a sense, the sculpture garden was designed around the tree", said a former aide to Noguchi, Bonnie Rychlak, who later became the museum curator. By 2008, the old tree was found to be dying and in danger of crashing into the building, which was about to undergo a major renovation. The museum hired the Detroit Tree of Heaven Woodshop, an artists' collective, to use the wood to create benches, sculptures and other amenities in and around the building. The tree's rings were counted, revealing its age to be 75, and museum officials hoped it would regenerate from a sucker.|$|E

Lois forgives him and they have sex and Lois is shocked when Peter discovers a [...] on her breast, causing her to go to the hospital the next day to have it tested for breast cancer. The test comes back negative, but while looking through her medical records, Dr Hartman discovers that Lois' mother is a Jewish Holocaust survivor, making Lois and her children Jewish by heritage. Barbara confirms her heritage, and Carter admits he kept it a family secret so that they could join the country club. Despite not being Jewish himself, Peter takes to it eagerly, much to Lois' frustration. That night, Peter is visited by the ghost of his adoptive father, Francis, who warns him that he will go to Hell for not being Catholic. The next day, Peter decides to re-convert the family to Catholicism and becomes prejudiced against Lois' heritage, becoming anti-Semitic.|$|E
500|$|On April 19, 1861, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of hostilities at Charleston Harbor, US President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a blockade of ports in the seceded states. On April 27, after Virginia and North Carolina had also passed ordinances of secession, the blockade was extended to include their ports also. Even before the extension, local troops seized the Norfolk area and threatened the Gosport Navy Yard in Portsmouth. The commandant there, Captain Charles S. McCauley, though loyal to the Union, was immobilized by advice he received from his subordinate officers, {{most of whom were}} in favor of secession. Although he had orders from (Union) Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to move his ships to Northern ports, he refused to act until April 20, when he gave orders to scuttle the ships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>and</b> destroy its facilities.Nine ships were burned, among them the screw frigate [...] One (the old frigate [...] ) was towed away successfully. Merrimack burned only to the waterline, however, and her engines were more or less intact. The destruction of the navy yard was mostly ineffective; in particular, the large drydock there was relatively undamaged and soon could be restored. Without firing a shot, the advocates of secession had gained for the South its largest navy yard, as well as the hull and engines of what would be in time its most famous warship. They had also seized more than a thousand heavy guns, plus gun carriages and large quantities of gunpowder.|$|E
500|$|Upon its foundation, whenaccording to Green (1990)it {{was said}} to be a [...] "temporary expedient", the school was based at Stafford House, in East Street in the centre of Tonbridge. Previously used by private tutor Isaac Fleming in 1878, it was a {{building}} whose central urban position was, Taylor (1988) said, a [...] "major asset, and possibly the only one"; Headmaster Bryant [...] "bore its numerous shortcomings, its bricked ambience and grasslessness". Positioned in a narrow street and originally designed for 20 boarders, traffic noise, awkward arrangement and low pitch of the classrooms and the distance of the school from its playing fields made the building far from ideal. It underwent repairs and alterations to the value of £300, carried out by a local builder; several partition walls were knocked down to form larger rooms, although this still restricted the bench length in even the widest of the rooms to , and 18 pupils. The floor of the main schoolroom was restored and lavatory closets and urinals were installed. Later, a carpentry shed was placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>and</b> a [...] "Mr Russell" [...] was appointed as its first occupant in October 1889. [...] "Mr Beeching's field" [...] was usedat what Taylor (1988) considered [...] "an extortionate sum"for games, but it was unavailable for four months of the year when it was used to grow hay. Beeching ended this arrangement in April 1889, at which time the school used the [...] YMCA field, for £20 per year. In June of that year, a shed to house cricket equipment was constructed at the cost of £13/10s. It was soon decided that there was a need for more [...] "wholesome" [...] surroundings, and it was generally accepted that south Tonbridge would be more suitable {{for the development of a}} new school.|$|E

2500|$|The Morse company's own {{contribution}} to this field was The Dry Dock Dial, a 16-page periodical that was mailed out to employees' homes once a month.

The public's confidence in the British criminal justice system is tarnished by decisions like this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{of these}} {{practices}} {{were accompanied by}} a loud utterance of ritual texts, which had their own semantics, symbolism and structure. Standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>and</b> facing the cloud, farmers would address the cloud himself, or hail, prodigy, the unholy power, ala, drowned or hanged persons (usually calling by name someone like that from their region), and others. People tried to deflect the horrific bringer of clouds from their fields, by scaring him off with something even more appalling that was allegedly present in their village. For example: [...] "Back! Back, ala! Here is a bigger ala, beware!" [...] or [...] "Hey, do not go, prodigy, on prodigy! We have a huge prodigy: here a girl bore a girl, a girl of nine years old! Do not go, prodigy, on prodigy: {{we have a huge}} prodigy!" [...] These texts often contained the idea of hail clouds as cattle, usually white: [...] "OSava and Nevena, turn back those white cattle! There is no pasture for them here! We only have ashes to put their eyes out!" [...] Uttering this, they would spill the ashes of the fire on which a česnica had been baked for Christmas, into the wind.
