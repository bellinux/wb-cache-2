25|$|The {{crew had}} been on reduced-rations {{since the end of}} the first week on the island. Some of the crewmen, noting that there were ample {{supplies}} of water and rum, went to the captain to ask for an increase in their rations, but he chased them off with threats. The men then asked Royal Marine Lieutenant Scott to intercede for them. When Scott presented a petition to Captain Herbert on behalf of the men, Herbert had Scott arrested. The captain then explained to the crew that he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> would be until they could leave the island, and then read them the Articles of War. The next day the captain increased the water ration by one pint per man.|$|E
2500|$|Kinney {{mentioned}} in a February 2006 {{interview that he}} would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains. He explained, [...] "If we found some other dude, I'd love to move on, write some cool tunes and change the name and go on like that. I don't see continuing as Alice and replacing somebody. ... We're not trying to replace Layne. We want to play these songs one more time, and if it seems like the right thing to do, it'll happen. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> will go or where it will take us. It's kind of a tribute to Layne and our fans, the people who love these songs. It's not some 'I'm broke and I need the money' situation. We love playing together." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 7, 2008, Voinovich {{departed}} from Republican party platform and stated {{at a hearing}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the war in Iraq: [...] "We've kind of bankrupted this country" [...] through war spending.

[...] "My daughter and son-in-law {{have been looking}} for a decent cottage for I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long.</b> <b>It's</b> all the war. Upset things terribly, it has. But excuse me, sir, it'll be too dark for you to see much of the house. Hadn't you better wait until to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you're celebrated {{you grow}} handsomer; at least that's what has {{happened}} to you, though you were pretty too of old," [...] Gabriel placidly argued. [...] "I go to the theatre to look at your head; it gives me the greatest pleasure. I take up anything of that sort as soon as I find <b>it.</b> One never <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> may last." ...|$|R

60|$|Rest in {{the chairs}} which stood round the big hearth and {{smouldering}} wood-fire was so extremely comfortable, {{as they all}} dropped down, that nobody moved or spoke, or <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> was {{before there was a}} voice on the stairs--'Eh? what's this, Annaple? An accident? Where's Janet?' and a tall burly figure, candle in hand, in a dressing-gown and slippers, was added to the group.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{majority}} of hyperthermia-related deaths occur in hot tubs, spas and Jacuzzis (1). Alcohol ingestion {{was associated with}} most of these deaths (1, 2). Exiting a hot bath can produce orthostatic intolerance (01) and ethanol ingestion exacerbates this condition immediately following hot bath immersion (3). <b>It</b> is not <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> takes for hyperthermia-induced 01 to subside, and if this time is influenced by ethanol ingestion...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes; very horrid things. I know it all. It {{is part of}} {{a wicked}} plot to rob Mr. Caldigate of his money. It is {{astonishing}} the wickedness that people will contrive.

50|$|In {{the north}} aisle {{is a large}} block of {{limestone}} standing about 5.5 ft high, carved to {{give the appearance of}} a tomb. It dates from about 1100, and is considered to be the former shrine of a saint. <b>It</b> is not <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> had been in the church but it was removed from the church to Canterbury Cathedral in 1760, and returned to Fordwich in 1877.

6000|$|... 'You can't {{get out of}} me what is not in me. You can't wrest from me what I {{have not}} got. Mine is but a poor calling. You have had more than two guineas from me, already.

6000|$|... "Interest, yes; {{but how do}} I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> will be paid? I {{should like}} to see the principal. A hundred {{thousand}} pounds, or something like it, is a precious large stake to have in one man's hands, and he preciously hard up himself. I'll tell you what, doctor--I shall look the squire up myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Jefferson. [...] "It {{has been}} through the barrel, too; {{you can see the}} score of the rifling.

The hammer of the carpenter, the click of the trowel on the brick were music to my ears. There is always a melancholy in everything that is finished; with a house, the moment of its completion is the commencement of its decay.

6000|$|... "How can any one help it? Theoretically we are right--I am sure of it. If {{we leave}} it to the politicians, this war will go {{dragging}} on for God <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long.</b> <b>It's</b> the people who are paying. It's the people who ought to make the peace. The only thing that bothers me is whether we are doing it the right way. Is Freistner honest? Could he be self-deceived?

6000|$|... "Nor do I, Matteo; but I must go, nevertheless. Pisani <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> {{will take}} me to get to Chioggia and return.

Come home, dear, and I'll find your bootjack. I suppose that's what you are rummaging after among my things.

60|$|I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> {{was before}} I spoke. It {{may have been}} some minutes.

50|$|The oldest attested {{flag of the}} {{republic}} dates back from 4 September 1465, when it was commissioned from a manufacturer in Florence. It showed a horizontal tricolor of orange, white and purple, with the old emblem of San Marino depicted on the white stripe. <b>It</b> is not <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> remained the state flag of {{the republic}} or when the white-blue bicolor appeared. In 1797, most likely influenced by the wave of reforms in France, the Supreme Council of the Republic commissioned a white and blue cockade, which, coincidentally or not, was {{identical to the one}} used by the French revolutionaries.|$|R

30|$|Policies {{aimed at}} putting {{vegetation}} back into eroding steeplands {{have worked in}} both study areas giving confidence that reforestation is an effective treatment to deal with regional erosion in areas like the East Coast and the southern French Prealps. It is also now <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> takes for these treatments to become effective in terms of surface and shallow landslide erosion, which is largely a function of when trees reach a closed canopy state (Marden, 2004, 2012; Marden et al., 2012). With other treatments such as spaced plantings and natural reversion, it appears that these require a longer time to become effective (see Phillips et al., 2008).|$|R
