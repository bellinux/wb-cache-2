40|$|Solid {{environment}} reconstruction performed {{entirely on}} the GPU is a relatively unexplored topic as of the date of writing. This paper presents a multi-pass algorithm that converts raw data from a range sensor or a stereo camera into a quad-mesh. A threshold parameter that governs the allowed deviation from the sample points is introduced. In this way, the number of generated faces can loosely be controlled and changed dynamically. The algorithm keeps a quad-tree as an internal data structure, which results in generation of square faces only. Although the <b>face</b> <b>count</b> can be minimized by using more complex polygons, this is of little use in practice as typically the solid environment is used for collision detection and such systems are very e cient for quadrilateral surfaces. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{connections}} between planar graphs, Schnyder woods, and orthogonal surfaces. Schnyder woods and the <b>face</b> <b>counting</b> approach have important applications in graph drawing and the dimension theory of orders. Orthogonal surfaces explain connections between these seemingly unrelated notions. We use these connections for an intuitive {{proof of the}} Brightwell-Trotter Theorem which says, that the face lattice of a 3 -polytope minus one face has order dimension three. Our proof yields a linear time algorithm {{for the construction of}} the three linear orders that realize the face lattice. Coplanar orthogonal surfaces are in correspondence with a large class of convex straight line drawings of 3 -connected planar graphs. We show that Schnyder’s <b>face</b> <b>counting</b> approach with weighted faces can be used to construct all coplanar orthogonal surfaces and hence the corresponding drawings.

For {{numerous}} random matrix ensembles, the expected number of k-dimensional {{faces of the}} random n-dimensional zonotope A obeys the formula E f_k(A) /f_k() = 1 -P_N-n,N-k, where P_N-n,N-k is a fair-coin-tossing probability. The formula applies, for example, where the columns of A are drawn i. i. d. from an absolutely continuous symmetric distribution. The formula exploits Wendel's TheoremWe 62. Let denote the positive orthant; the expected number of k-faces of the random coneA obeys E f_k(A) /f_k() = 1 - P_N-n,N-k. The formula applies to numerous matrix ensembles, including those with iid random columns from an absolutely continuous, centrally symmetric distribution. There is an asymptotically sharp threshold {{in the behavior of}} <b>face</b> <b>counts</b> of the projected hypercube; thresholds known for projecting the simplex and the cross-polytope, occur at very different locations. We briefly consider <b>face</b> <b>counts</b> of the projected orthant when A does not have mean zero; these do behave similarly to those for the projected simplex. We consider non-random projectors of the orthant; the 'best possible' A is the one associated with the first n rows of the Fourier matrix. These geometric face-counting results have implications for signal processing, information theory, inverse problems, and optimization. Most of these flow in some way from the fact that <b>face</b> <b>counting</b> is related to conditions for uniqueness of solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations.

This work demonstrates how low quality camera images can be used to automatically alert when an unusual number of people are absent or present at a location. We report on experiments using publicly available, inexpensive cameras already operational over the Web. A “historical database ” (H) for each camera is constructed by capturing images at regular time intervals and applying a face detection algorithm to store the number of faces appearing in each image (“face count”).

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of aggregate angularity and nominal maximum size of siliceous aggregates on performance of selected HMA surface pavement mixtures. The research approach was guided by the realization that engineers can use the results for mixture design, especially for South Texas districts. Aggregates and mixture designs were obtained from the Corpus Christi, Laredo, and Pharr Districts. The selected aggregates were characterized using image analysis, crushed <b>face</b> <b>count,</b> flat and elongated particles, and Micro-Deval tests.

The {{present study}} includes the determination of particle index based on fractured faces counts of coarse aggregate i. e. less than 2, more {{than or equal to}} 2 and more than 3 and its influences on marshall and fatigue properties of hot mix asphalt mixtures. The different particle index values ranging from 9 to 16 for the coarser size (19 - 13. 2 mm) have been determined and the same are used in the marshall mix design. The important factor for minimizing fatigue property of hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixture are, the fractured <b>face</b> <b>count</b> for coarse aggregate. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of particle index value on aggregate properties. Asphalt mix with crushed particles produces higher stability values with the increase in particle index value. The study also found that an increase in the amount of crushed particles causes decrease in unit weight and an increase in voids in mineral aggregate and optimum asphalt content. As fractured faces counts increases, the stiffness ratio (TSR) also increases. More the particle index value better will be the resistance to fatigue (Permanent deformation of the pavement) ...|$|E
