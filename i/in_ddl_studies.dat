40|$|Many uses {{have been}} found for corpora in {{language}} teaching and learning, most radically perhaps where learners explore the data themselves. Such procedures are especially associated with Tim Johns, who proposed what he called 'data-driven learning' over 20 years ago. While he described his techniques in detail {{in a number of}} papers, researchers and practitioners over the years have adapted Johns' procedures and invented new ones of their own, with the result that {{it can be difficult to}} pin down exactly what DDL is. In a tribute to Johns, this paper traces the evolution of DDL through his work from 1984 up until his death in 2009, as well as <b>in</b> <b>DDL</b> <b>studies</b> by other researchers. The enormous variety of activities possible with corpora means it is difficult if not impossible to identify any single element which is either necessary or sufficient for an activity to qualify as DDL. This paper therefore defends a prototype definition of DDL: the further an activity is from the central, prototypical core, the less DDL-like it is, but any cut-off point beyond which we might like to say 'this is no longer DDL' seems likely to be arbitrary rather than empirically grounded or based on a coherent, hermetic definition...|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} {{analysis}} of previous <b>DDL</b> <b>studies,</b> {{it becomes clear}} that task type, methodology, language proficiency and training as well as the choice of corpora are important variables to be considered while designing DDL activities. It is also obvious that the carefully designed DDL activities are effective in helping learners solve some writing problems. Nevertheless, there are still some limitations of these studies. Firstly, most of the studies just focus on the immediate effects of <b>DDL</b> <b>in</b> classroom settings or computer labs such as improving the accuracy of error-correction. However, as remarked by Boulton (2011), the biggest advantage of <b>DDL</b> lies <b>in</b> medium-term or longer-term benefits. Secondly, {{there is a lack of}} empirical studies comparing the effectiveness of different types of corpora <b>in</b> <b>DDL</b> activities. To complement existing research and to aid teachers in presenting future guidance to students, the present study conducts an empirical study on EFL learners in mainland China, aiming to achieve the following purposes. Firstly, it intends to explore whether the independent DDL activities outside the classroom over a whole term can facilitate EFL learners’ writing development in terms of fluency, accuracy and complexity. Secondly, to compare which type of corpora is more useful for Chinese EFL learners <b>in</b> <b>DDL</b> activities. Thirdly, to investigate EFL learners’ perceptions of BNCweb-assisted DDL activities.|$|R
40|$|Corpus {{linguistics}} {{has contributed}} considerably to the arsenal of tools available for language description, with methodologies applicable to virtually any area of language study. Yet like most academic disciplines, corpus linguistics is generally limited to researchers and other professionals; {{in the fields}} of foreign/second language teaching and learning, this involves considerable mediation upstream before the results filter down to the end users - teachers and learners. An alternative would be for corpus data to feature directly in the learning process, with learners acting as "researchers" to explore the language themselves. This is commonly referred to as "data-driven learning" (DDL), an idea particularly associated with the seminal collection of papers edited by Johns and King (1991). The last 20 years has seen substantial research interest <b>in</b> <b>DDL,</b> with countless scholarly articles arguing its various merits, though it is frequently remarked that empirical research is disturbingly lacking. However, Boulton (forthcoming) lists over 70 studies which seek to evaluate some aspect of L 2 corpus consultation. This suggests that the research exists, but is fragmented and lacking in visibility and accessibility to a wider community. The aim of the present paper is to bring together the <b>DDL</b> research <b>in</b> ESP, where Gavioli (2005) argues convincingly that the learners represent a major population who stand to gain from DDL. An overview is presented of the tools, corpora, methodologies and research questions covered <b>in</b> 20 empirical <b>DDL</b> <b>studies</b> for ESP. The overwhelming majority show that learners are able to work with corpora in many contexts and for many purposes, and respond positively to the approach. In terms of learning outcomes, the results are generally promising, though not perhaps as conclusive as one might hope. Reasons for this are discussed, but it is argued that there are grounds for cautious optimism regarding corpus use in ESP {{in a wide variety of}} contexts...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the degree of {{enlargement}} of the spinal canal between two methods of cervical laminoplasty (open-door laminoplasty and double-door laminoplasty) and to determine their appropriate surgical indications based on the results. Tension-band laminoplasty (TBL, one method of open-door type) was performed in 33 patients and double-door laminoplasty (<b>DDL)</b> <b>in</b> 20 patients. The operation level ranged from C 2 to C 7 in all patients. The width of the spinal canal and the inclination angle of the lamina at the C 5 and C 6 levels were measured using a computer software program (Image J) and pre- and postoperative CT films. Concerning the degree of enlargement of the spinal canal, the mean expansion ratio at the C 5 level was 148. 9 % in TBL and 148. 2 % <b>in</b> <b>DDL,</b> and there was no significant difference between them. However, at the C 6 level, it was 159. 0 % in TBL and 140. 3 % <b>in</b> <b>DDL,</b> which was significantly larger <b>in</b> TBL than <b>DDL</b> (p <  0. 05). The increase of inclination angle of the lamina was 11. 0 ° in TBL and 19. 0 ° <b>in</b> <b>DDL</b> at the C 5 level, and 9. 2 ° in TBL and 19. 3 ° <b>in</b> <b>DDL</b> at the C 6 level.

40|$|Electronic corpora {{can be used}} {{not only}} for {{language}} description {{but also as a}} resource for teaching and learning in what has become known as “data-driven learning” (DDL). The arguments for and against have accumulated over nearly 30 years: in favour are numerous theoretical pedagogical advantages, while the objections tend to revolve around practical and logistical barriers to implementation. One of {{the most important of these}} is the use of the technology itself: whether one sympathises that this is a problem or not, it is clearly an obstacle to DDL for a variety of reasons, and only removing the computer from the equation will help to overcome it. It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with. However, the very first instantiations of DDL relied heavily on concordance print-outs, and prepared materials allow a gentle lead-in, with teacher and learner roles changing gradually as they concentrate first on the new approach (DDL) and the new materials (corpora) without also having to worry about the new technology at the start. Indeed, such has been common practice <b>in</b> many <b>DDL</b> <b>studies.</b> However, to date there has been no empirical research aiming to compare the use of paper-based and hands-on corpus consultation directly. In this study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class, alternating between paper-based materials and hands-on consultation so that each learner had experience of both. After 10 weeks all students were at least moderately familiar with both formats; the efficiency of each was then compared by testing the final two items covered – language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. It is clear that some learners prefer working on paper at least initially, while others are quickly open to working directly on computer. The differences are discussed in relation to feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course, taking account of individual motivations and learning styles. The overall results suggest that there is unlikely to be a single best version of DDL for all learners in all situations at all times, and that variety and sensitivity to learner variation and local conditions is crucial...|$|R
30|$|The first {{important}} factor is task type since not all writing {{problems can be}} solved equally well by <b>DDL</b> approach. <b>In</b> previous <b>studies,</b> <b>DDL</b> is adopted to learn linking adverbials (Boulton 2009; Cotos 2014), to aid learners in generating ideas and writing creatively (Kennedy and Miceli 2010), to distinguish synonym adjectives and solve learners’ problems of overusing general adjectives (Yeh et al. 2007), to learn collocation knowledge and thus help learners produce more accurate and complex language patterns (Thomas 2015). However, it seems that error-correction is the most appropriate task for DDL because a great many studies (e.g. Gaskell and Cobb 2004; Chambers and O’Sullivan 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006; Tono et al. 2014; Reynolds 2015 a) focused on error-correction or self-editing in writing. For instance, Gaskell and Cobb (2004) explored the immediate effects of adopting <b>DDL</b> <b>in</b> correcting L 2 learners’ sentence-level grammatical errors in writing. The results revealed that concordance evidence for lower-level learners’ grammar development was not as effective as for lexical development. Nevertheless, the results still proved {{the positive effects of}} corpus use since more than 80  % corrections were made accurately when the online concordance links were offered to them while less accurate corrections were made when removing the links. There are another two studies (Chambers and O’Sullivan 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006) focusing on the efficacy of <b>DDL</b> <b>in</b> correcting more various kinds of errors, which include lexico-grammatical errors, capitalization errors, spelling errors, etc. These findings confirmed the advantages of <b>DDL</b> <b>in</b> reducing the interference of the mother tongue, highlighting the awareness of lexico-grammatical patterns and improving the accuracy rate of error corrections. Nevertheless, not all types of errors can be corrected equally well with a DDL approach. Thus more recently, Tono et al. (2014) conducted a research on 93 upper-intermediate undergraduate students, aiming {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>DDL</b> <b>in</b> correcting three coded error types. The results revealed that omission and addition errors were easier to be identified and revised, while mis-formation errors were more difficult to be corrected accurately. These studies indicated that although DDL can be adopted to solve various writing problems, some types of tasks may be more appropriate for DDL thus teachers should carefully consider the appropriateness of tasks while organizing DDL activities.|$|R

The arguments for and against have accumulated over two decades and more: in favour are numerous theoretical pedagogical advantages, while the objections tend to revolve around practical and logistical barriers to implementation. Certainly in its more extreme forms, it seems difficult to reconcile DDL with the reality of ordinary language classrooms (e. g. Mukherjee 2006). One of the most apparent obstacles here is the use of the technology itself - the computer with its query software and interfaces for accessing electronic corpora - which has repeatedly been found to pose substantial problems for many learners (e. g. Yoon & Hirvela 2004) as well as teachers (e. g. Farr 2008). Where this is the case, the obvious question is whether the computer can be successfully removed from the equation without losing the benefits of the overall approach (cf. Boulton 2010). It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous, hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with. However, the earliest instantiations of DDL relied almost exclusively on concordance print-outs, and prepared materials can be argued to allow a gentle lead-in, with teacher and learner roles changing gradually as they concentrate first on the new approach (DDL) and the new materials (corpora) without also having to worry about the new technology at the start.

Each approach has its adherents, but to date there has been little if any empirical research attempting a direct comparison of the use of paper-based and hands-on corpus consultation. This study draws on past experience with two different groups of students learning English at an architecture college in France. In the first case, the learners were highly receptive to an encounter with printed DDL materials (Boulton 2010); in the second, a hands-on approach to corpus consultation was far less well received (Boulton 2009). However, the varying conditions mean that direct comparisons are difficult to make. In the present study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students at the same college were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class. Each group covered the same points using essentially the same processes, but alternated between 'hands-on' consultation (i. e. on computer) and paper-based materials (i. e. 'hands-off'). In this way, after 10 weeks all the students (n= 30) should have been at least moderately familiar with both approaches. The learning outcomes of the hands-on and hands-off approaches were compared by testing the final two items covered - language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. The results were compared against feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course on the participants' preferences and affective reactions. Previous experience suggests that those who do best are not necessarily most receptive, and vice versa. In an attempt to identify some of the variables that may underlie the individual differences, two instruments were used to relate the outcomes and reactions to motivation and learning styles.

We compare the semantics of linking <b>in</b> <b>DDL</b> and E-connections, and importing in P-DL within the Distributed First Order Logics (DFOL) framework. Our investigation shows that the domain disjointness assumption adopted by the linking approach leads to several semantic difficulties. We explore the possibility of avoiding some of these difficulties using the importing approach to linking ontology modules. ...|$|R
