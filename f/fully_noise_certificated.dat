40|$|Fuzzy Noise Reduction Method (FNRM) is {{proposed}} {{for the restoration of}} color images that are highly corrupted by salt and pepper noise. The proposed filter (MDBUTMF) replaces the noisy pixel by trimmed median value when some of the elements with values 0 ‟s and 255 ‟s are present in the selected window. If all the pixel values in the selected window are 0 ‟s and 255 ‟s means then the noisy pixel is replaced by mean value of all the elements present in that selected window. The throughput of MDBUTMF is a partial noise removed image. It is further processed by FNRM. The FNRM has two sub-filters. The first sub-filter computes fuzzy distances between the color components of the central pixel and its neighborhood. The target of the second sub-filter is to correct the corrupted pixels. The throughput of FNRM is a <b>fully</b> <b>noise</b> removed image. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed method.

40|$|On-line {{portfolio}} selection {{has been}} attracting increasing interests from artificial intelligence community in recent decades. Mean reversion, as one most frequent pattern in financial markets, {{plays an important}} role in some state-of-the-art strategies. Though successful in certain datasets, existing mean reversion strategies do not <b>fully</b> consider <b>noises</b> and outliers in the data, leading to estimation error and thus non-optimal portfolios, which results in poor performance in practice. To overcome the limitation, we propose to exploit the reversion phenomenon by robust L 1 -median estimator, and design a novel on-line portfolio selection strategy named “Robust Median Reversion” (RMR), which makes optimal portfolios based on the improved reversion estimation. Empirical results on various real markets show that RMR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results. Finally, RMR runs in linear time, and thus is suitable for large-scale trading applications. ...|$|R

30|$|Hutt et al. [27, 28] {{have shown}} that under certain {{specific}} conditions, the presence of noise can delay the onset of a Turing bifurcation in a neural field.

Because all of our numerical simulations use white noise that is completely uncorrelated in space and time, our experiments of Fig.  5 (c) near the Turing critical point of Fig.  4 (c) do not exhibit any onset delay, and thus the stochastic simulations for close approach to the Turing bifurcation for the 1 -D cortex are in excellent agreement with the Chaturvedi et al.

Broadband low frequency noise reductions as large as 9 dB were produced by reducing the separation distance between the nozzle exhaust plane and the flaps. Experiments were also conducted to determine the noise suppression effectiveness in comparison with a reference configuration of three passive types of devices that were located on the jet impingement surfaces of the reference configuration. These devices produced noise reductions that varied up to 10 dB at reduced separation distances. In addition, a qualitative estimate of the noise suppression characteristics of the separate devices was made. Finally static aerodynamic performance data were obtained to evaluate the penalties incurred by these suppression devices.

The cost of the associated damage is estimated at more than ten billion euro per year.

40|$|Understanding the {{structure}} of noise associated with a measurement process is interesting theoretically and has practical applications related to the quantification of detection capability, signal uncertainty and dead time. Here, we present and analyse arguments explaining {{the appearance of the}} Poisson process in the distribution of count numbers in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) signals. We consider the Poisson distribution as a special case of the binomial distribution constrained by inefficient ion transmission from the ICP ion source to the detector. The universal form of the relevant Poisson process is doubly stochastic: the random nature of count numbers acquired per time unit is defined not only by the probabilistic selection of ions during their transport through the interface and ion channel, but also by fluctuations of the ion contents sampled by the spectrometer from the plasma and, more generally, by fluctuations of the rate of the Poisson process itself. Compared to an ordinary Poisson process, the doubly stochastic Poisson process has an excess variance that increases at higher analyte contents. The excess variance in the uncertainty of ICPMS signals is also known as flicker noise; it {{is an integral part of}} the doubly stochastic Poisson process and not a <b>fully</b> individual <b>noise</b> component.
