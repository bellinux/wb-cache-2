[...] Silver suspended her order while the Arizona Clean Elections Commission appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The case was heard by the Ninth Circuit Court on April 12, 2010. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the matching <b>funds</b> <b>provision</b> of Arizona's law was analytically distinct from the millionaire's amendment.|$|R

40|$|A sinking <b>fund</b> <b>provision</b> {{typically}} obligates {{the firm}} to amortize {{a portion of the}} debt issue prior to maturity. A sample of 169 new industrial debt issues was used to examine whether firms with certain characteristics related to agency problems tend to incorporate a sinking <b>fund</b> <b>provision</b> in the bond indenture. Sets of debt-issue and issuer-related variables were constructed to characterize firms with agency problems. Empirical results from both logistic and linear regression models show that leverage ratio, profit ratio, time to maturity, dividend payout ratio, and the life of assets are important factors affecting the sinking fund decision of industrial firms. In general, firms with a high growth rate, high debt and dividend payout ratios, and a low profit ratio are inclined to adopt the sinking fund covenant. Also, the longer the maturity of debts and the shorter the life of the assets supporting these debts, the higher is the probability that a sinking <b>fund</b> <b>provision</b> will be included in the bond indenture...|$|R

In a separating equilibrium, better quality firms choose higher sinking fund amortization rates in their bond issues. A latent index model is proposed for testing the hypothesis of sinking fund signalling. The empirical evidence indicates that the sinking fund amortization rate signals the credit quality of the firm...|$|R

50|$|Shortly after enactment, the Technical Corrections to Food Security Act of 1985 Amendments (P.L. 99-253 gave USDA {{discretion}} to require cross-compliance for wheat and feed grains instead of mandating them, changed acreage base calculations, and specified election procedures for local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation committees.

Again in 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-509) made changes in the 1985 Act requiring advance deficiency payments {{to be made to}} producers of 1987 wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice crops at a minimum of 40% for wheat and feed grains and 30% for rice and upland cotton. The 1985 Act also amended the Farm Credit Act of 1971. Further commodity program changes were made in the FY1987 agricultural appropriations bill (P.L. 99-591). In addition to its <b>funding</b> <b>provisions,</b> P.L. 99-591 set the annual payment limitation at $50,000 per person for deficiency and paid land diversion payments, and included honey, resource adjustment (excluding land diversion), disaster, and Findley payments under a $250,000 aggregate payment limitation. Once again, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-203) not only set the 1988 fiscal year budget for agriculture and all federal agencies, but also set target prices for 1988 and 1989 program crops, established loan rates for program and non-program crops, and required a voluntary paid land diversion for feed grains.
