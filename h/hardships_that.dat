5|$|In {{the second}} part of the story, which starts {{immediately}} after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{threatened}} to withdraw his {{team from the}} Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims {{about the danger of}} Bodyline and {{threatened to}} call off the tour. The series had become a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation. Alexander Hore-Ruthven, the Governor of South Australia, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to J. H. Thomas, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the third Test, and England won the final two matches to win the series 4–1.|$|E

The couple moved to a cottage in Old Lyme, Connecticut, in 1947.

25|$|In 1931, RCA Victor {{launched}} the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record, marketed as program-transcription discs. These revolutionary discs {{were designed for}} playback at rpm and pressed on a 30cm diameter flexible plastic disc, {{with a duration of}} about ten minutes playing time per side. RCA Victor's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression. Because of financial <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> plagued the recording industry during that period (and RCA's own parched revenues), Victor's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{has seen}} very little {{gerrymandering}} of electoral boundaries, relevant {{only for the}} House of Representatives and State Legislative Assemblies, which have nearly always been drawn up by public servants or independent boundary commissioners. But Australia has seen systematic malapportionment of electorates. All colonial legislatures before Federation, and the federal parliament after it, allocated more representation to rural districts than their populations merited. This was justified on several grounds, such as that country people {{had to contend with}} greater distances and <b>hardships,</b> <b>that</b> country people (and specifically farmers) produced most of the nation's real wealth, and that greater country representation was necessary to balance the radical tendencies of the urban population.|$|E

25|$|The long campaigning and <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> Lucullus' {{troops had}} endured for years, {{combined}} with a perceived lack of reward {{in the form of}} plunder, led to successive mutinies among the legions in 68–67. Frustrated by the rough terrain of Northern Armenia and seeing the worsening morale of his troops, Lucullus moved back south and put Nisibis under siege. Tigranes concluded (wrongly) that Nisibis would hold out and sought to regain those parts of Armenia that the Romans had captured. Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus could still not capture either one of the monarchs. With Lucullus' troops now refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend positions from attack, the Senate sent Gnaeus Pompey to recall Lucullus to Rome and take over his command.|$|E
25|$|In 579, Pelagius II chose Gregory as his apocrisiarius (ambassador to the {{imperial}} court in Constantinople), a post Gregory would hold until 586. Gregory {{was part of}} the Roman delegation (both lay and clerical) that arrived in Constantinople in 578 to ask the emperor for military aid against the Lombards. With the Byzantine military focused on the East, these entreaties proved unsuccessful; in 584, Pelagius II wrote to Gregory as apocrisiarius, detailing the <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> Rome was experiencing under the Lombards and asking him to ask Emperor Maurice to send a relief force. Maurice, however, had long ago determined to limit his efforts against the Lombards to intrigue and diplomacy, pitting the Franks against them. It soon became obvious to Gregory that the Byzantine emperors were unlikely to send such a force, given their more immediate difficulties with the Persians in the East and the Avars and Slavs to the North.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Smith {{recruited}} Brett Detar, guitarist of Pennsylvania emocore band Pensive, to {{help him}} build a new incarnation of Zao. Detar suggested a pair of his friends, guitarist Russ Cogdell and enigmatic writer / poet (and future tattoo artist) Daniel Weyandt. Both Cogdell and Weyandt had played in Christian Hardcore band Seasons in the Field, who had released a split EP with Pensive. Smith would drive several hours to Greensburg, where all these new members lived, to co-write and rehearse {{what would become the}} first (and in many ways, defining) album from the new Zao, Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest. The group played fewer and fewer songs from the old version of the band as Blood and Fire took hold. They toured without a bassist and set stages ablaze with their raw emotion and Weyandt's personal storytelling, which detailed the <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> informed their songs. With a rockabilly look and Smith's oddly engaging habit of setting up his drums facing away from the audience, their live reputation grew large in the underground. Not long after recording their half of a split EP with labelmates Training for Utopia in California, Detar left the group in 1999 to focus his energy on his rock side-project The Juliana Theory, who would sign to Sony and have a successful career before disbanding in 2006.|$|E

Berger noticed a similar {{contrast between the}} song's [...] "pop verses" [...] and [...] "the gloom of a twisty, malignant chorus". For Abbott, this four-chord chorus [...] "approaches exuberance" [...] in its mixture of catchy melody and grunge. The penultimate track, [...] "T and T", was described by Bryant as an instrumental introduction leading into [...] "Huffer". Kelley Deal has stated that these two songs share a thematic union: the latter is about the negative side of inhaling paint or other substances, while the former stands for [...] "Toil and Trouble", also about the <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> inhaling chemicals can cause.

While on the run, Slim, who discovers that her husband is following her, [...] "trains herself for a final, violent confrontation". The producers of Enough wanted her to write a new song for film, however, Lopez {{felt as if it}} was not something that could be forced. In October 2001, while on their honeymoon, Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful", {{and that it would be}} perfect fit for Enough.

500|$|All of {{the songs}} on A Lesson in Romantics were written while touring after Warped Tour.

[...] Unlike the band's EP, the album was [...] "more put together" [...] and [...] "more organized", according to Garcia. Sanders thought it stood up [...] "pretty well" [...] to the EP, noting that it was [...] "just as catchy [...] ", but [...] "more powerful." [...] "Jamie All Over" [...] was originally recorded by Kid Named Chicago, Lancaster's previous band. Sanders claimed the song was [...] "kind of a tough one to choose" [...] because the band {{had a lot of}} new material to choose from, but felt [...] "pretty happy" [...] with its inclusion. [...] "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs the band wrote.

500|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} in the United States was a social reform campaign from 1914 to around 1945 that aimed to increase the availability of contraception in the U.S. through education and legalization. [...] The movement began in 1914 {{when a group of}} political radicals in New York City, led by Emma Goldman, Mary Dennett, and Margaret Sanger, became concerned about the <b>hardships</b> <b>that</b> childbirth and self-induced abortions brought to low-income women. Sanger, in particular, simultaneously sought to connect birth control to the organized eugenics movement, [...] regularly appealing to the authority of eugenic scientists [...] Karl Pearson, Charles Davenport, and others in her Birth Control Review from the early 1920s [...] Such figures sought to prevent population segments they deemed genetically 'undesirable' from reproducing. While seeking legitimacy for the birth control movement partly through the approval of organized eugenics, Sanger and other activists also worked on the political front. Since contraception was considered to be obscene at the time, the activists targeted the Comstock laws, which prohibited distribution of any [...] "obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious" [...] materials through the mail. Hoping to provoke a favorable legal decision, Sanger deliberately broke the law by distributing The Woman Rebel, a newsletter containing a discussion of contraception. In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, but the clinic was immediately shut down by police, and Sanger was sentenced to 30 days in jail.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the third}} Test, {{strongly}} worded cables passed between the Australian Board of Control and the M.C.C. at Lord's. The Australian Board accused the English team of unsportsmanlike tactics, stating that [...] "Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace {{the best interests}} of the game, making protection of the body the main consideration." [...] The M.C.C. responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims about the danger of Bodyline and threatened to call off the tour.

Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions that his team were receiving. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using Bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting Jardine and the Bodyline tactics. It was subsequently revealed that several of the players had private reservations, but they did not express them publicly at the time. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
