40|$|Abstract – SF 6 (sulphur hexafluoride) is the gas most {{commonly}} used in high voltage power equipments. Due {{to the fact that}} SF 6 is a greenhouse gas with a very high global warming potential, alternatives have been searched for over the last years. This paper presents the fundamental insulation characteristics of SF 6 /N 2 mixtures(50 % SF 6 _ 50 %N 2, 20 %SF 6 _ 80 %N 2) in sphere-plane and rod-plane configurations. The electrode gap spacing and the relative gas pressure were varied within the range of 10 ~ 50 mm and of 3 ~ 7 bar respectively. To get the 50 % breakdown value under lightning impulse of both polarity and AC, the up and down method was applied. In addition, both mixtures were tested in <b>earthing</b> <b>switch</b> and disconnecting switch sections of GIS model. The test result is applied to make design criteria for mixtures...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-speed}} <b>earthing</b> <b>switch</b> (HSES) of a {{gas-insulated switchgear}} (GIS) performs a secondary role {{in protecting the}} power system {{in the event of}} an accident. After being interrupted by a circuit breaker (CB), the short-circuit current remaining in the network should be earthed by the HSES. However, as the contacts of the HSES may have been damaged by a pre-arc during the closing operation, the HSES may fail to ground the short-circuit current. To successfully ground the short-circuit current, the contacts of the HSES must be protected from damage by the pre-arc. Thus, minimizing the pre-arcing time is required to step up the making performance. This paper analyzes the making performance of the HSES by predicting the pre-arcing time within the short-circuit current making test. To estimate the pre-arcing time, we compared the results of analytical calculations based on streamer discharge theory and the numerical simulations of the electric field strength. By conducting a short-circuit current making test for a 420 kV 63 kA HSES in a high-power laboratory, the pre-arcing time calculation results were verified. A comparison of the results showed that the proposed prediction method was useful for verifying the performance of the HSES...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} field {{distribution in the}} Gas insulated switchgear (GIS) gas chamber {{is an important factor}} for the design of GIS structure. The {{electric field}} distribution in the GIS gas chamber should be uniform as far as possible, to avoid excessive concentration of the electric field causing the occurrence of flashover and discharge in GIS. The electric field intensity in the gas chamber is higher than its dielectric’s isolating strength when SF 6 /N 2 mixed gas is used as the insulation dielectric of the gas chamber to reduce the consumption of pure SF 6, and the research in this paper aim to solve this problem. Electric-filed numerical analysis and optimal design of GIS gas chamber structure have been done in this paper. The GIS gas chamber 3 D model is built in Solidworks, and finite element analysis of the model is calculated in ANSYS. Electric field numerical calculation for the gas chamber model is calculated based on the theory of electrostatic field. The calculation results show that the electric field intensities of isolated switch, <b>earthing</b> <b>switch</b> and insulation rod are excessive high, and the optimizations for its internal structure are necessarily followed, then calibrating calculations of electric field are carried on the optimized model. The calculating results convey that the electric field intensity in gas chamber decreased significantly, and the maximum value of electric field intensity is lower than the dielectric strength of alternative gas. It means that the alternative gas can meet the insulation requirements for the gas chamber after optimization...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} both {{high-voltage}} disconnector theoretical solution and application of the theory. Three basic parts are included. The aim of the first part is the solution of temperature rise during the steady state and short-time current overload of the disconnector. The current overload is solved from new point of view, which is derived from operational and practical conditions of ambient temperature. The foundation of the disconnector optimization for designers are presented in this thesis as well. Analysis of the short-time current overload of a disconnector is developed with consideration of initial conditions (value of current carried through the current path before the overload and value of ambient temperature).

40|$|Worldwide {{utilities}} and industries have seen various technological advancements in circuit breaker (CB) testing and analysing. Yet {{most of the}} owners underperform the maintenance activity {{when it comes to}} circuit breaker maintenance and many limit themselves to an operating time test or a static contact resistance test using inappropriate test equipment. The reasons cited for this were ‘complicated test procedures which involve longer outage time on the feeder’, ‘lack of availability of the feeder for maintenance’ and ‘lack of permission to remove the earth rod or <b>earth</b> <b>switch</b> while the breaker was in shutdown condition’. Also the decision making process and pin pointing the fault in a breaker after performing a basic circuit breaker test will often be a challenge. Though the basic tests like timing test on a circuit breaker provides preliminary information about the breaker condition, actual condition of a deteriorating breaker becomes obvious in a well matured state and often revealed only by a catastrophic failure while in service. Different utilities, switch gear manufacturers, researchers and test equipment manufacturers have stressed the importance of various advanced test methodologies to save time and money. Those tests include coil current analysis, dynamic resistance measurement, testing on dual ground conditions, vibration testing, first trip analysis, online testing and so on. These circuit breaker testing technologies often provide critical information of the circuit breaker and make the decision making process simple. Pinpointing the fault in a circuit breaker and attempting the maintenance activity {{in a very short time}} will be complicated if the directions guided by the test methodologies or equipments are not clear enough or easy enough. Also one particular method, tool or technology will never provide a complete solution on the circuit breaker analysis.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{experiments that}} follow species dynamics and gene expression patterns in synthetic bacterial communities including species that {{compete for the}} single carbon substrate supplied, methane, and species unable to consume methane, which could only succeed through cooperative interactions. We demonstrate that these communities mostly select for two functional guilds, methanotrophs of the family Methylococcaceae and non-methanotrophic methylotrophs of the family Methylophilaceae, these taxonomic guilds outcompeting all other species included in the synthetic mix. The metatranscriptomics analysis uncovered that in both Methylococcaceae and Methylophilaceae, {{some of the most}} highly transcribed genes were the ones encoding methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Remarkably, expression of alternative MDH genes (mxaFI versus xoxF), previously shown to be subjects to the rare <b>Earth</b> element <b>switch,</b> was found to depend on environmental conditions such as nitrogen source and methane and O 2 partial pressures, and also to be species-specific. Along with the xoxF genes, genes encoding divergent cytochromes were highly expressed in both Methylophilaceae and Methylococcaceae, suggesting their function in methanol metabolism, likely encoding proteins serving as electron acceptors from XoxF enzymes. The research presented tested a synthetic community model that is much simplified compared to natural communities consuming methane, but more complex than the previously utilized two-species model. The performance of this model identifies prominent species for future synthetic ecology experiments and highlights both advantages of this approach and the challenges that it presents...|$|R

30|$|However, Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) {{should also}} be {{considered}} {{in the context of the}} geological record of climate change and its proxies, such as sea-level fluctuations, for it is now accepted that during the past two billion years the Earth’s climate has fluctuated between “Icehouse” (Cold) periods and “Greenhouse” (Hot) periods. For example, Miller et al. (2008) describe the largest global cooling event of the Cenozoic (33.8 and 33.5  Ma ago), where the <b>Earth’s</b> climate <b>switched</b> from warm, high CO 2 conditions, to variable “Icehouse” climates where icesheets grew to be 25 % larger than present. There was a corresponding ~ 67  m eustatic sea-level decrease and there was a 21 % extinction of taxa in the geological record (Sepkoski 2002). Such fluctuations have been argued not to be random but periodic. Raup and Sepkoski (1984) analysed ~ 3, 500 families of marine animals (vertebrate, invertebrate and protozoan) and concluded that there was significant periodicity in 12 extinction events with a 26  Ma mean interval. More recently, Rohde and Muller (2005) using Fourier Spectral Analysis (FSA), identified a strong periodicity of 62 [*]±[*] 3  Ma in the cyclicity of marine diversity through the Phanerozoic, based on an analysis of Sepkoski (2002) compendium. Lieberman and Melott (2012), using the Paleobiology Data Base (PBDB), undertook spectral analysis of this data base, which also showed a strong spectral peak of 63  Ma. With such periodicities a recurring result in data analysis, further discussions have eventuated on the origin of this periodicity, focusing on the position or motion of the Sun moving through the Milky Way (Lieberman and Melott, 2012).|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} Earth co-orbital asteroids {{experience}} repeated transitions between the quasi-satellite and horseshoe dynamical states. Asteroids 2001 GO 2, 2002 AA 29, 2003 YN 107 and 2015 SO 2 are well-documented cases {{of such a}} dynamical behaviour. These transitions depend on the gravitational influence of other planets, owing to the overlapping of a multiplicity of secular resonances.
