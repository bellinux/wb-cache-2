He made our nation stronger because he made <b>it</b> <b>better.</b> His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving <b>it</b> <b>better</b> {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Operation California {{began using}} the name Operation USA because <b>it</b> <b>better</b> {{described}} the effort and intent of the organization to represent the entire American people. In 1989 Operation USA facilitated operations on children in Vietnam who had cleft palates by a Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, Dr Stanley Frileck. Medical aid and rebuilding effort was delivered to Mexico in 1990, by OPUSA. In 1991 OPUSA delivered aid to Bangladesh. OpUSA delivered aid to war torn Somali's in 1993. In 1994 OpUSA provided earthquake relief. In 1995 the organization provided aid to Hurricane Mitch survivors in Honduras and Nicaragua. In 1999 OpUSA supplied aid to storm victims in Mexico. In 2003 OpUSA delivered aid to Iraq War victims in the Persian Gulf. The tsunami victims in Sri Lanka and Indonesia were aided by OpUSA in 2004, {{as well as the}} Mexico City Flood victims.|$|E
5|$|In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two {{contracts}} to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 {{billion for the}} development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes {{were made to the}} design to make <b>it</b> <b>better</b> suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the new B-1B. These changes included a reduction in maximum speed, which allowed the variable-aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's radar signature or radar cross-section; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach1.25 at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was {{an effort}} by the CIA to analyze {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help <b>it</b> <b>better</b> understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E

5|$|The major {{difference}} between the F-4J and the British Phantoms was {{the absence of the}} Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, the former being fitted with the GE J79-10B. This produced less power than the British engine, but had a faster afterburner light up, giving <b>it</b> <b>better</b> performance at high altitude, at the expense of slightly poorer acceleration at low level. The high-altitude performance was helped by the reduced drag from its smaller air intakes. Initially delivered capable of carrying the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles (AAM), they were soon made compatible with the Skyflash and SUU-23A gun pod, bringing them into line {{with the rest of the}} RAF's Phantoms. Despite modifications to allow them to operate with the rest of the fleet, the F-4Js retained the vast bulk of the equipment they were originally fitted with, even requiring their crews to use American flying helmets.|$|E
5|$|Trenyce {{was born}} in Memphis, Tennessee on March 31, 1980. Her father, Jesse Cobbins, worked for St. Joe Company, and her mother, Linda Ruth Cobbins, worked at FedEx.

Trenyce has written that her {{interest}} in music started after performing a solo in a musical production celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. She grew up in North Memphis, where she attended Central High School and performed in various talent shows and pageants. In 1996, she won first place in a singing competition at the national NAACP Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Urie {{retired as}} Locomotive Superintendent when the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923.

When the modifications were trialled in service, it became evident amongst locomotive crews that Maunsell had taken a sound design and made <b>it</b> <b>better,</b> achieving a consistent locomotive capable of undertaking all the tasks {{for which it was}} intended. With the successful implementation of the modifications, permission was given by the management of the Southern Railway for a second batch of locomotives to be constructed.|$|E

5|$|After a {{continued}} lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called Operation Rainfall started {{a campaign to}} raise awareness for The Last Story, Xenoblade Chronicles, and another Wii RPG titled Pandora's Tower. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release. Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated {{that there were no}} plans for a North American release. Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought The Last Story would never make it to North America. At this point, Xseed Games, who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about The Last Story, and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights. While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as <b>it</b> <b>better</b> fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic. It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.|$|E
