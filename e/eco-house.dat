There are, we argue, three useful and productive ways to interrogate accessibility in eco-communities, through understandings of legislation, barriers and mobility. These have three significant consequences for eco-communities and disabled access: ecological living as practised by these eco-communities relies upon particular bodily capacities, and thus excludes many disabled people; disabled access was only considered in relation to the house and its thresholds, not to the much broader space of the home; and eco-communities need to be, and would benefit from being, spaces of diverse interaction...|$|R

We argue that children’s experiences of living with materialities, politics and technologies of sustainability have too-often been marginalised in much chief research on childhood, youth and sustainability. Drawing on qualitative research with 8 - 16 -year-olds living with materialities of ‘sustainable’ <b>eco-housing,</b> urban drainage, wind turbines and photovoltaic panelling, we explore how sustainable urban architectures are noticed, (mis) understood, cared about, and lived-with by children {{in the course of}} their everyday geographies. In so doing, we highlight the challenging prevalence and significance of architectural conservatisms, misconceptions, rumours disillusionments and urban myths relating to sustainable urban architectures...|$|R
50|$|The {{study found}} that {{residents}} of The Park and the nearby campus of Cluny Hill College have, on average, a footprint of 2.71 hectares per capita, a little over half the UK national average of 5.4 hectares.

Of particular significance are the results relating to food, ‘home and energy' use, and 'consumables and personal possessions' which have 35%, 27% and 44% of the national average respectively.

This paper undertakes an interdisciplinary research on how social media (i. e. Facebook) can influence users’ perceptions and buying behaviour related to five categories of ecological products and services (eco-food, eco-tourism, <b>eco-housing,</b> eco-textiles and eco-beauty & cosmetics). This research investigates how ecological products and services could gain popularity and overpass the identified purchasing barriers (e. g. high prices, low awareness, low availability) via superior integration in consumers’ daily experiences with Facebook. The research findings indicate that Facebook represents an effective and innovative environment that could build the necessary links between green attitudes and consumers’ hearts and minds. ecological products & services, Facebook, green attitudes, buying behaviour, eco-food, eco-tourism...|$|R

Any moves toward a more sustainable and socially just society will have to manage the transformation of technology. This article introduces a new European perspective about the sustainable transformation of technological regimes. This new perspective emphasises the role played by novel niches in processes of transformation. A new research project is introduced in the article. The project will investigate the experiences from 30 years of the appropriate technology (AT) social movement in the UK. Experiments from the AT movement in the areas of local, organic food, <b>eco-houses,</b> and wind energy will be analysed as if they were novel niches in sustainable development. These experiences will be critical tests for the new theory for transforming technological regimes in more sustainable directions...|$|R

What {{is the significance of}} the connection between nature and city and how can they be articulated? What is the relationship between architecture and nature in the context of densely settled area? This thesis attempts to address these questions through the application of environmental consciousness with three different scales: urban, community and individual. The site is known as Boston State Hospital Site in Mattapan where existing dense neighborhoods and abundant natural environments meet. Moreover, Boston Nature Center of Audubon Society is a major component of the site.

40|$|Living {{sustainably}} {{involves a}} broad spectrum of practices, from relying on a technological fix to a deep green vision. The latter is often articulated by advocates and critics alike as involving shifting to a simpler lifestyle that dispenses with some of the (perceived) frivolous or environmentally damaging attachments to luxury or convenience. This article explores practices of reconceiving comfort {{in the context of the}} social and material architectures of <b>eco-housing.</b> Comfort is defined as an ongoing process, a negotiation between different elements (e. g., climate, materials and bodies) in a particular place. This article uses three case studies of self-built eco-communities in Britain (Green Hills, Landmatters, and Tinkers Bubble) and analyzes their bathrooms and bathing practices. In the eco-communities' bathing practices, comfort was reconceived as not being reliant on particular facilities, furniture, or temperature, as not private but as collective and shared, and as an embodied relation. This article demonstrates the relationality of comfort, how it is therefore possible to reconceive comfort, and how comfort can be understood as a practice. This focus on practices also challenges social practice theories to more purposefully engage with those already living a highly ecological lifestyle to understand how radical change is navigated...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of bamboo}} which is fast growing and ecologically {{friendly}} material for structural applications is being considered as quite appropriate. The tensile strength of bamboo is quite high and can reach up to 125 MPa. This makes bamboo an pretty alternative to steel in tensile loading applications. The bamboo concrete composite elements {{can be used}} as alternate for concrete, steel and wood used in housing and other products required in the day to day applications. In this study it has been attempted to develop engineered bamboo structural elements for use in low cost housing. A bending test was performed on Plain, Steel & Bamboo reinforced members. For example, a total of 4 beam (150 x 150 x 700 mm) were casted using design mix (M 25) as per IS code. These beam included 1 beam of steel reinforcement, 1 beam of plain concrete, and 4 beam of untreated bamboo reinforcement. The load-deformation curves displayed significant nonlinearity, representing that the bamboo has the capacity to absorb energy. Bamboo concrete composite structural members can provide tailored solutions to the <b>eco-housing</b> initiatives at cheaper costs. The results obtained accrue the advantage obtained by the composite members when compared to standard reinforced concrete and plain concrete...|$|R
