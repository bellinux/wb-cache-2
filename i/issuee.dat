At one point she goes outside {{to get away from}} everyone and talks with Peter who has come to discuss a domestic <b>issuee</b> with her. They part ways and eventually Hugo and Finnula prepare to leave. However, Skinner, Hugo's trusted horse, tries to buck him off when he sits down on him. It is discovered that a burr had made its way underneath the saddle. Peter now makes his reappearance with the news that someone is trying to kill Lord Hugo.|$|E

Today, providingservices to urban population –as the basic function of municipalism-, is being carried out by e-municipalitymethod that aims effiency, speed, active participation, low cost and active participation.

40|$|Britain is {{the country}} with a long {{tradition}} of immigration. Over many years it witnessed the arrival of immigrants and refugees from the whole world. Nevertheless the unprecedented extent of immigration from the Commonwealth countries of the former British Empire after the Second World War was unexpected. It caused profound and irreversible change in the British society as a whole. This thesis deals with a description and interpretation of a series of key <b>issuees</b> related to immigration from New Commonwealth (especially from Indian subcontinent) in 1945 - 1971. Main reasons for "coloured immigration" were an increasing demand for low skilled and unskilled labour in United Kingdom and the 1948 British Nationality Act, which gave Commonwealth citizens right to enter, work and settle in the British Isles. I am concerned with issues of immigrants' employment, housing, education {{as well as with the}} attitudes and responses of indigenous whites. Even though the British consider themselves to be "tolerant people" immigrants faced up to prejudices, discrimination, racism, verbal abuse and physical attacks in Britain. White hostility toward coloured immigrants manifested itself in the form of the Notting Hill Riots in 1958. Racial attacks were explained in terms of the enormous number of "coloured" people and the [...] ...|$|R

The {{aim is to}} analyze this <b>issuee</b> {{from the very beginning}} of the CAP to the present times. The theoretical part examines analysis of the effectiveness of providing subsidies in the sector of agriculture. This section pays attention to various rules of European Union, which were adopted in purpose of farmers. The practical part is a case study describing the situation of a farm which uses the subsidies of CAP. Using recent data on the subsidies and Cost Benefit Analysis, case study summarizes and considers the pros and cons of running a modern farm in EU...|$|E

As one of several tools for evaluating success of local youth training programs, "benchmarking " provides a system for measuring the development of those trained with Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) funds. The paper consists of five sections. Section 1 contains definitions and {{a discussion of the}} terms and concepts involved in any consideration of benchmarking. Section 2 provides a historical overview of the development of competency measures in the secondary education and vocational educatibn systems, along with the Consolidated Youth Employment Program,(CYEP) experience with benchmarking.

40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{scientific and}} technology development give {{impacts on the}} development of Islamic law. The dynamic of fiqh in handling issues especially on medicine become a momentum of the synergy of the two diciplines, science and the Islamic jurisprudence of medicine. Many medical issuess are yet to require legal completions that are contemporary ijtihad based on perubatan discipline. On the other hand, ijtihad not only as exclusively unilateral, moreover inclusive multilateral approach (ijtihad jama’i) is needed on handling fiqh issues. It is because expert opinions also important in describing about those issuess. Without those opinions, Islamic law scholar could not give appropriate legal decision. However, this study will explore about the importance of development of Fiqh of Medicine based on contemporary ijtihad. These studies will explain some contemporary Medicine <b>issuees,</b> which is proof the requirement of contemporary ijtihad. For example on the issues of reproduktif organ donation. Some ijtihad instruments which are compatible will be aplicated based on the issuess. Research findings about perubatan issuess gave fact that there were not exact explanations on al-Qur’an and al-Sunnah also did not directly examined on fiqh book in the past. This condition cause contemporary ijtihad on those studies as an important study to give law answer about perubatan issues appear. Generally speaking, the current studies require the sinergized between the dynamic of Islamic law and the advance of science and technology. </em...|$|R
