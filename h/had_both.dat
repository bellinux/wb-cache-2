5|$|Beauchamp {{arrived in}} Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans talked of Sharp's murder {{as the work}} of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills {{critical}} of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he <b>had</b> <b>both</b> political and personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, {{at the time of the}} murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.|$|E

Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions <b>had</b> <b>both</b> orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E

5|$|Grant and Hayes <b>had</b> <b>both</b> {{advocated}} {{civil service}} reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield sympathized with them, {{believing that the}} spoils system damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns. Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Cagney {{replaced}} Spencer Tracy on the Western film Tribute to a Bad Man for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received {{praise for}} his performance, and the studio liked his work enough {{to offer him}} These Wilder Years with Barbara Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; they <b>had</b> <b>both</b> previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained {{the cast and crew}} off-screen by singing and dancing.|$|E

5|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic.
