40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a concept}} for enhanced active safety by introducing a <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> based on vehicle dynamics that predicts a potential {{loss of control}} condition prior to stability control activation. This real-time warning algorithm builds on available technologies such as the Electronic Stability Control (ESC). The <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> computes several indices based on yaw rate, side-slip velocity, and vehicle understeer using ESC sensor suite. An arbitrator block arbitrates between the different indices and determines the status index of the driving vehicle. The status index is compared to predetermined stability levels which correspond to high and low stability levels. If the index exceeds the high stability level, a warning signal (haptic, acoustic, or visual) is issued to alert the driver of a potential loss of control and ESC activation. This alert will remain in effect until the index {{is less than the}} low stability level at which time the warning signal will be terminated. A vehicle speed advisory algorithm is integrated with the warning algorithm to provide a desired vehicle speed of a vehicle traveling on a curve.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore how}} a single master alarm system affects drivers’ {{responses}} {{when compared to}} multiple, distinct <b>warnings.</b> Background: Advanced <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are intended to improve safety, yet inappropriate integration may increase the complexity of driving, especially in high workload situations. This study investigated the effects of auditory alarm scheme, reliability, and collision event-type on driver performance. Method: A 2 x 2 x 4 mixed factorial design investigated the impact of two alarm schemes (master vs. individual) and two levels of alarm reliability (high and low) on distracted drivers’ performance across four collision event-types (frontal collision warnings, left and right lane departure warnings, and follow vehicle fast approach). Results: Participants’ reaction times and accuracy rates were significantly affected {{by the type of}} collision event and alarm reliability. The use of individual alarms, rather than a single master alarm, did not significantly affect driving performance in terms of reaction time or response accuracy. Conclusion: Even though a master alarm is a relatively uninformative warning, it produced statistically no different reaction times or accuracy results when compared to information-rich auditory icons, some of which were spatially located. In addition, unreliable alarms negatively impacted driver performance, regardless of event type or alarm scheme.

40|$|Abstract—Driver in-alertness is an {{important}} cause for most accident related to the vehicles crashes. Driver fatigue resulting from sleep deprivation or sleep disorders is {{an important}} factor in the increasing number of the accidents on today’s roads. Drowsy <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> can form the basis of the system to possibly reduce the accidents related to driver’s drowsiness. The purpose of such a system is to perform detection of driver fatigue. By placing the camera inside the car, we can monitor the face of the driver and look for the eye-movements which indicate that the driver is no longer in condition to driver is no longer in condition to drive. In such a case, a warning signal should be issued. This paper describes how to find and track the eyes. We also describe a method that can determine if the eyes are open or closed. The main criterion of this system is that it must be highly non-intrusive and it should start when the ignition is turned on without having at the driver initiate the system. Nor should the driver be responsible for providing any feedback to the system. The system must also operate regardless of the texture and the color of the face.

40|$|Intelligent <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> can {{be found}} in many {{high-end}} vehicles on the road today, which will likely rapidly increase as they become standard equipment. However, introducing multiple <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> into vehicles could potentially add to the complexity of the driving task, and there are many critical human factors issues that should be considered, such as how the interaction between alarm alerting schemes, system reliabilities, and distractions combine to affect driving performance and situation awareness. In addition, there are also questions with respect to whether there should be any minimum safety standards set to ensure both functional and usage safety of these systems, and what these standards should be. An experiment was conducted to study how a single master alert versus multiple individual alerts of different reliabilities affected drivers' responses to different imminent collision situations while distracted. A master alert may have advantages since it reduces the total number of alerts, which could be advantageous especially with the proliferation of intelligent <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> However, a master alert may also confuse drivers, since it does not warn of a specific hazard, unlike a specific alert for each <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> (cont.) Auditory alerts were used to warn of imminent frontal and rear collisions, as well as unintentional left and right lane departures. Low and high warning reliabilities were also tested. The different <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> and reliability factors produced significantly different reaction times and response accuracies. The <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> with low reliability caused accuracy rates to fall more than 40 % across the four <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition, low reliability systems also induced negative emotions in participants. Thus, reliability {{is one of the most}} crucial determinants of driving performance and the safety outcome, and it is imperative that <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are reliable. For the master versus distinct alarms factor, drivers responded statistically no different to the various collision warnings for both reaction times and accuracy of responses. However, in a subjective post-experiment assessment, participants preferred distinct alarms for different <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> even though their objective performance showed no difference to the different alerting schemes. This study showed that it was essential to design robust and reliable intelligent <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> However, there are no existing safety standards today to ensure that these systems are safe before they are introduced into vehicles, even though such systems are already available in high-end cars. (cont.) Even though there are tradeoffs in having standards, such as increased time-to-market and possible loss of innovation, I recommend that safety standards be set nonetheless, since standards will ensure the safety performance of <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> to an extent. In terms of functional safety, safety standards should be performance-based, and should specify a minimum level of reliability. In terms of usage safety, the standards should also be performance-based, where driving performance can be indicated by measures such as reaction time, lane position, heading distance and accuracy of responses. In addition, multiple threat scenarios should also be tested. In terms of design guidelines, the various human factors guidelines from different countries should be harmonized internationally to ensure that manufacturers have access to a consistent set of guidelines. Finally, it is also important that these standards, especially for usage safety, specify tests with not just the average driver, but also with peripheral driving populations including novice and elderly drivers. by Angela Wei Ling Ho.

40|$|Neurofuzzy {{algorithms}} {{have been}} extensively developed {{in recent years}} for the real time/online identification of nonlinear a priori unknown dynamical processes. As with all rule base paradigms they suffer from the curse of dimensionality, restricting their practical use to low dimensional control problems. This paper shows how adaptive construction algorithms based on additive and extended additive decomposition techniques can overcome this problem, to produce parsimonious neurofuzzy models which retain their transparency or interpretability. Not only does this approach extend the applicability of neurofuzzy algorithms, it also enables low complexity controllers, estimators to be derived. In this context neurofuzzy state estimators are derived which automatically parameterise a Kalman filter for a process state estimate reconstruction from any input/output data source. This approach avoids pitfalls of the extended Kalman filter, and is optimal for local models.

40|$|There {{are several}} factors that {{increase}} the risk of driver sleepiness and result in increased accident risk. Modern vehicle design enables the driver to travel at high speeds and for long distances in a comfortable and often sleep promoting driving environment. Recent decades have seen an increase in shift working and apparent trends for reduced sleep length which combine to increase driving risk, particularly with night driving. The young appear more vulnerable to the effects of reduced sleep, night driving and driving for long periods. Sleep related vehicle accidents represent a high proportion of vehicle accidents with the young and truck drivers standing out as vulnerable groups. People appear to be relatively poor predictors of imminent sleep onset so that <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> would provide a valuable countermeasure, but unfortunately reliable commercial systems are still some years away. Future <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> will need to account for the marked individual differences seen in levels of driver sleepiness, impaired performance and associated risk levels. Driver education programmes are required warning of the increased risks of driver sleepiness associated with extended waking, too little sleep and driving during the circadian low period. Drivers should also be made aware of strategies helping to maximise sleep and optimise arousal which are of particular use for night driving and shift work. These could include the use of appropriate hypnotics to maximise available sleep, or melatonin and light exposure to enhance phase shifting or improve sleep and waking scheduling.

40|$|The {{potential}} impact on driving of {{the processing of}} a single, auditorially presented word is analyzed in this work. Since driving is, in itself, a rather complex cognitive activity involving the integration and coordination of a multitude of sub-processes, we narrowed the scope of our research and concentrate on one – but critical – task involved in driving, that is driver braking response. If two tasks {{have to be performed}} concurrently and both of them require access to a capacity limited system, then performance in {{one or both of the}} tasks will dramatically worsen. This is because the two underlying processes compete for access to cognitive resources. It has been shown that both word recognition and driving requires central resources, therefore this two tasks are likely to interfere with each other. In the experiments, participants were required to perform two tasks during simulated driving (the fixed based driving simulator of Transportation Laboratory - University of Padova was used). In the word recognition task, participants had to categorize auditorially presented words. In the breaking task, participants depressed a brake pedal in response to the lead car’s brake lights. The interval of time between the onset of the tasks’ stimuli (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony, SOA) was varied. Breaking responses were substantially slower as the overlap between tasks increased. This finding demonstrates that the processing of a single word hinders driving performance. The experiments carried out have significant implications in the field of road safety. There are many situations that are similar to those studied in the present experiments, such as a cell phone ring, cell phone conversations (even using hands-free kit), in-car passenger conversations, auditory tips from navigation system, auditory alerts from <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system,</b> etc [...] The present experiments suggest that all of these situations can negatively affect a driver’s response time increasing the likelihood of “near misses” and accidents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a basic architecture of an intelligent <b>driver</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> which embodies an adaptive driver model for indirect collision avoidance. In this study, the driver modelling objective is {{focused only on}} longtitudinal car-following, and the model inputs are chosen to be the past history of throttle angle, controlled vehicles's speed, range and range rate to the front vehicle whereas the model output is chosen to be the current throttle angle. An artificial neural network called CMAC and a conventional linear model are independently applied to model the real driver data taken from test track and motorway environments. The CMAC model is chosen because of its nonlinear modeling capability, on-line learning convergence and minimum learning interference characteristics, whereas the linear model is chosen as a control benchmark to examine the nonlinear characteristics of the driver's behaviour. The modeling capabilities are then evaluated based on one-step ahead prediction error performances over the training and testing sets, learning curves and correlation based model validation techniques. Modeling {{results suggest that the}} past history of the throttle dynamics plays a critical role in reducing the deviation of the error correction, which in turn suggest that the throttle dynamics is generally slow for road driving. Also, the time scale dependency of the model on the driver's behaviour varies significantly from the test track to motorway environment. In the driver modeling expermient, the time scale was chosen such that the deviation of the error correlation was minimised. The test track results suggest that the chosen inputs are indeed relevant variables for modeling the driver's behaviour. Unlike that of the CLM, the degree of error deviation was found to be acceptable for the test track scenario, implying a significant nonlinear coupling of the throttle output with the speed, range and range rate data. Whereas for the motorway data, the modeling performance for both models is comparable, and the time scale of the driver model is approximately three times longer than that used in the test track data...|$|E

Key findings indicate that use of the integrated crash <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> resulted in improvements in lane-keeping, fewer lane departures, and increased turn-signal use. The research also indicated that drivers were slightly more likely to maintain shorter headways with the integrated system. No negative behavioral adaptation effects were observed as a result of drivers’ involvement in secondary task behaviors. Drivers generally accepted the integrated crash <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> and 72 percent of all drivers said they would like to have an integrated <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> in their personal vehicles. Drivers also reported that they found the blind-spot detection component of the lane-change/merge crash <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> to be the most useful and satisfying aspect of the integrated system...|$|R
40|$|An {{auditory}} spatial Stroop paradigm {{was used}} {{to examine the effects of}} semantic and spatial audio cue conflict on accuracy and response time. Participants responded to either the semantic meaning or the spatial location of a directional word, which was either con-gruent (i. e. the word “right ” being presented from the right) or incongruent (i. e. the word “right ” being presented from the left). Contrary to our predictions, people responded more accurately to the semantic meaning of the directional words relative to spatial audio cues. An interaction between task type and congruency indicated people found it more difficult to ignore the semantic content of the word when performing the location version of this task relative to ignoring the location in the semantic task. Implications of these results for use in <b>driver</b> collision-avoidance <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed. The current results indicate that performance benefits gained by the use of directional words in com-bination with spatial audio may be offset by greater detriment to performance when the <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> presents unreliable or incongruent semantic information...|$|R
5000|$|The new styling {{is based}} around the kinetic design Ford Europe uses for their cars. The {{interior}} has been improved {{from the previous}} model. The centre console has been lifted to make for a more luxurious and spacious feeling. The interior is more roomy and has better entry and exit for front and rear passengers. The XT is now better equipped, it has a MP3 compatible CD player, 3.5 mm auxiliary audio input jack, single zone automatic climate control, cruise control, 60/40 split fold-down rear seat back, front and rear power windows, four airbags, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) with Emergency Brake Assist and a <b>driver</b> fatigue <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> From 1 September 2008, all XT models have been specified with alloy wheels as standard equipment, previously an extra-cost option This replaced the standard 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] steel wheels that used plastic wheel covers or center hub caps.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute’s plan to perform {{analysis of data}} collected from the heavy truck platform field operational test of the Integrated Vehicle- Based Safety Systems (IVBSS) program. The purpose of the IVBSS program is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of, and driver acceptance for, state-of-the-art integrated crash <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for both passenger cars and commercial trucks. The heavy truck platform in the IVBSS FOT includes three integrated crash-warning subsystems (forward crash, lateral drift, and lane-change/merge crash warnings) installed into a fleet of ten Class 8 tractors operated by Con-way Freight. Each truck is instrumented to capture detailed data regarding the driving environment, <b>driver</b> behavior, <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> activity, and vehicle kinematics. Twenty commercial truck drivers from Con-way Freight are operating the Class 8 tractors for ten months in place of the trucks they normally drive. Data on driver acceptance for the integrated system are being collected through a post-drive survey and debriefings. The plan describes analyses that emphasize a summary of integrated crash <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> activity, examine how the integrated system affects driver behavior, and assess driver acceptance for the integrated system. The analyses are intended to be complementary to analyses being performed by the program’s independent evaluator, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center...|$|R

These findings are the result of analyses performed by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute {{to examine the effects of}} a prototype integrated crash <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> on driving behavior and driver acceptance. The light-vehicle platform included four integrated crash-warning subsystems (forward crash, curve speed, lateral drift, and lane-change/merge crash warnings) installed on a fleet of Honda Accords driven by 108 lay-drivers for a period of six weeks each. Each vehicle was instrumented to capture detailed data on the driving environment, <b>driver</b> behavior, <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> activity, and vehicle kinematics. Data on driver acceptance was collected through a post-drive survey, debriefings, and focus groups.

40|$|This {{document}} presents key {{findings from}} the heavy-truck field operational test conducted {{as part of the}} Integrated Vehicle-Based Safety Systems program. These findings are the result of analyses performed by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute to examine the effect of a prototype integrated crash <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> on driving behavior and driver acceptance. The heavy-truck platform included three integrated crash-warning subsystems(forward crash, lateral drift, and lane-change/merge crash warnings) installed on a fleet of 10 Class 8 tractors and operated by 18 commercial drivers for 10 months. Each truck was instrumented to capture detailed data on the driving environment, <b>driver</b> behavior, <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> activity, and vehicle kinematics. Data on driver acceptance was collected through a postdrive survey and debriefings. The key findings indicate that integrated crash <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> not only offer benefits relative to improved driver performance (e. g., improved headway keeping), but that the majority of commercial drivers accepted the system and reported subjective benefits from the integrated system they used. Of the drivers who participated, 15 out of 18 stated that they preferred a truck with the integrated system, stating that they would also recommend that their company consider the purchase of vehicles with integrated safety systems installed. No negative behavioral adaptation effects from the drivers’ 10 -month use of the integrated system were observed...|$|R
