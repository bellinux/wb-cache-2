Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E
25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2014–15, India was the third-largest {{producer}} of raw steel {{and the largest}} producer of sponge iron. The industry produced 91.46 million tons of <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> and 9.7 million tons of pig iron. Most iron and steel in India is produced from iron ore.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of foreign trade in this period, however, far exceeded its volume. Foreign imports alleviated temporary but critical shortages of food, cotton, and other agricultural products {{as well as}} long-term deficiencies {{in a number of}} essential items, including raw materials such as chrome and manufactured goods such as chemical fertilizer and <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> products. The acquisition of foreign plants and equipment enabled China to utilize the more advanced technology of developed countries to speed its own technological growth and economic development.|$|E

25|$|The Capehart Amendment put intense {{pressure}} on the Truman administration's inflation program. On August 8, the federal government imposed stricter economic controls on the economy. In the steel industry, production quotas and procurement orders were extended to all civilian steelmakers, not just large manufacturers. Steel companies had reported record and near-record profits in the summer, but by mid-fall net revenues were down as defense needs consumed larger and larger quantities of raw and <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> and steelmakers were unable to sell steel to the higher-margin civilian market. On September 4, DPA again increased the amount of steel needed for defense use, sharply scaling down allotments for the civilian economy. When steelmakers balked at expanding plant and equipment {{in order to meet}} new defense quotas, ODM officials ordered the chief executives of the nation's largest steel manufacturers to attend a meeting in Washington where they were threatened with additional government regulation and oversight. The steelmakers quickly acceded to the government's demands.|$|E
500|$|The ingots {{are then}} heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, billets, or blooms. Slabs are {{hot or cold}} rolled into sheet metal or plates. Billets are hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire. [...] Blooms are hot or cold rolled into {{structural}} steel, such as I-beams and rails. [...] In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one assembly line, with ore coming in and <b>finished</b> <b>steel</b> products coming out. Sometimes after a steel's final rolling it is heat treated for strength, however this is relatively rare.|$|E

50|$|In 1966 {{the board}} of Koninklijke Hoogovens voted in favour of merging their IJmuiden {{steelworks}} with the Dortmund plant of German steelmaker Hoesch; Hoesch would benefit from the IJmuiden steelwork's port, and Koninklijke Hoogovens' 43% shareholding in the Dortmund-Hörder Hüttenunion (DHHU) was converted into a 15% shareholding in Hoesch with Hoesch acquiring DHUU. The two firms made agreements on division of work between the plants - IJmuiden was to concentrate on pig iron, crude steel, and semi-manufactured products, whilst Hoesch's Dortmund plant was to produce <b>finished</b> <b>steels</b> and manufactured products. The two entities were merged in 1972, forming Estel NV, headquarter in Nijmegen.|$|R
