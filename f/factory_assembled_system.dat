50|$|Not {{long after}} the {{fiberglass}} MK-II came onboard Alcort stopped supplying the <b>factory</b> <b>assembled</b> wood models. However, according to the sales brochures, the wood boats continued to be available in kit form long into the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s a {{predecessor}} company, Chang'an <b>Factory,</b> <b>assembled</b> a jeep sold under {{the brand name}} Yangtze River. By {{the end of the}} 1980s, the company was producing pint-sized trucks and vans for commercial purposes.|$|R
50|$|A small {{facility}} {{may have}} become operational c. 2004, and by 2008, a <b>factory</b> <b>assembling</b> Chery models from knock-down kits opened in Johor Bahru, Johor. As of 2012, another factory {{is expected to be}} built and operational in Malaysia by 2015.|$|R
50|$|Engineers Jean Leseurre and his {{brother-in-law}} Charles Gourdou founded the Établissements Gourdou-Leseurre in Saint Maur-des-Fossés, southeast of Paris in 1921. The <b>factory</b> <b>assembled</b> military aircraft under license, {{such as the}} Breguet 14, until Gourdou and Leseurre began building their own aircraft as main designers.|$|R
50|$|Hydronic systems require skilled {{designers}} and tradespeople familiar with boilers, circulators, controls, fluid pressures and temperature. The use of modern <b>factory</b> <b>assembled</b> sub-stations, used primarily in district heating and cooling, can greatly simplify design requirements {{and reduce the}} installation and commissioning time of hydronic systems.|$|R
50|$|In 1985 {{parallel}} with the Matchbox models, production began on the Gama models. The first 1-2 years they were all kit models for assembling and available in only one color—pearl grass green. Later they started making the regular <b>factory</b> <b>assembled</b> models. Some Gama models are still in production.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, PACCAR {{expanded}} its global operations {{with the opening}} of a new DAF factory in Ponta Grossa, Brasil.  The company invested $320 million in the 300,000 sq ft assembly facility on 569 acres.  The <b>factory</b> <b>assembles</b> the DAF XF and CF vehicles for the South American market.|$|R
50|$|Exalogic is a <b>factory</b> <b>assembled</b> 19-inch rack of 42 rack units, {{completed}} with servers {{and network}} equipment. There are 4 configurations, at different prices, {{depending on what}} fills the rack.The weight of the full rack is about 1 ton (more than 2000 lbs), a quarter rack weighs half as much.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{several pieces}} of {{evidence}} that promotes the idea of transcription <b>factories</b> <b>assembling</b> de novo due to transcriptional demands. GFP polymerase fluorescence experiments {{have shown that the}} inducement of transcription in Drosophila polytene nuclei leads to the formation of a factory which contradicts the notion of a stable and secure structure.|$|R
50|$|After {{one year}} of manufacturing, the <b>factory</b> <b>assembled</b> over 1,000 units of the Voleex C10. In December 2013, the company {{performed}} its first regular export to Europe, a first batch of cars being sent to Italy.

50|$|The TagAZ plant {{entered a}} {{partnership}} with Hyundai in 2001, but after the Korean carmaker built its own Russian factory in 2010, TagAZ ceased to {{be of interest to}} them.

5000|$|Among more {{collectible}} {{vehicles in}} Europe after World War II {{and during the}} 1950s, smaller scales, like 1:43, and 1:64 generally became popular first. Since the 1980s, many <b>factory</b> <b>assembled</b> scale model cars made of diecast metal have {{become more and more}} adult collectible oriented and less and less toy-like. Besides the smaller scales, these models are manufactured in various scales like 1:12, 1:18, and 1:24.|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of experimental dynamic substructuring, substructure decoupling consists {{in the identification of}} the dynamic behaviour of a structural subsystem, starting from the dynamic behaviour of both the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> and the residual subsystem (the known portion of the <b>assembled</b> <b>system).</b> On the contrary, substructure coupling identifies an <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> starting from the component subsystems. The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> can be partitioned into internal DoFs (not belonging to the couplings) and coupling DoFs. In substructure coupling, whenever coupling DoFs include rotational DoFs, the related rotational FRFs must be obtained experimentally. Does this requirement holds for substructure decoupling too, as it is commonly believed? Decoupling can be ideally accomplished by adding the negative of the residual subsystem to the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> (direct decoupling) and by enforcing compatibility and equilibrium at enough interface DoFs. Ideally, every DoF of the residual subsystem belongs to the interface between the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> and the residual subsystem. Hopefully, not all the coupling DoFs are necessary to enforce compatibility and equilibrium. This may allow us to skip coupling DoFs and specifically rotational DoFs. The goal of the paper is indeed to establish if rotational FRFs at coupling DoFs can be neglected in substructure decoupling. To this aim, after highlighting the possibility of avoiding the use of coupling DoFs from a theoretical standpoint, a test bed coupled through flexural and torsional DoFs is considered. Experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R

The completed aircraft would be towed from the factory to the airfield for their first flight and onward delivery. In July 1942 1531 Flight was formed as a Beam Approach Training Flight using the Airspeed Oxford. Aircrew were taught the techniques of the-then new airfield approach aid. A United States Army Air Forces liaison flight, operating Sentinels, also worked from the site in 1944.|$|R

A number of recipes and technologies were restored by crumbs.

50|$|Automotive {{manufacturing}} in Colombia had achieved an output {{of more than}} 100,000 vehicles per year in 2005, but their output {{in the past few}} years has been reduced by about 30,000 vehicles per year. Surprisingly, it has seen an incremental increase from the year 2008 and onwards, principally attributable to increased export rates to other Latin American countries from one major factory: Sofasa. This <b>factory</b> <b>assembles</b> Renault cars for markets like Mexico, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador. BYD is an example of a major global automaker with a presence in Colombia.|$|R
