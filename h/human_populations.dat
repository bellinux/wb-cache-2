40|$|Abstract. <b>Human</b> <b>population</b> {{growth has}} {{typically}} {{been seen as}} the primary causative factor of other ecologi-cally destructive phenomena. Current human disease epidemics are explored {{as a function of}} <b>population</b> size. That <b>human</b> <b>population</b> growth is itself a phenomenon with clearly identifiable ecological/biological causes has been overlooked. Here, <b>human</b> <b>population</b> growth is discussed as being subject to the same dynamic processes as the population growth of other species. Contrary to the widely held belief that food production must be increased to feed the growing population, experimental and correlational data indicate that <b>human</b> <b>population</b> growth varies as a function of food availability. By increasing food production for humans, {{at the expense of other}} species, the biologically determined effect has been, and continues to be, an increase in the <b>human</b> <b>population.</b> Understanding the relationship between food increases and population increases is proposed as a necessary first step in addressing this global problem. Resistance to this perspective is briefly discussed in terms of cultural bias in science...|$|R

25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>population</b> {{planning}} is {{the practice of}} artificially altering {{the rate of growth}} of a <b>human</b> <b>population.</b> Historically, <b>human</b> <b>population</b> planning has been implemented by limiting the population's birth rate, usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, environmental concerns, religious reasons, and overpopulation. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.|$|R

The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.|$|E
5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives {{in areas with}} some of the highest <b>human</b> <b>populations.</b> Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by the pet trade, and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner. This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, the pet trade is inflated by replacements. With a greater purchasing power, the increasing <b>human</b> <b>populations</b> in the species' range could have an even more serious impact.|$|E
40|$|A {{key element}} in the {{efficient}} allocation of scarce resources for conservation is the identification of areas of high biological value and high threat. Habitat loss and <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density have proved useful predictors of spatial variation in the current threat status of species albeit at coarse spatial resolution. We present a global analysis, intersecting Endemic Bird Areas (EBAs), to which restricted-range bird species are endemic, with fine-scale data of agricultural extent and <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density and test: (a) how well variation in land use mapped at 0. 5 degrees x 0. 5 degrees resolution predicts spatial variation in threat status of species and (b) how the predictive power compares with that of <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density mapped at the same resolution. Variation among EBAs {{in the proportion of}} restricted-range species that are threatened can be predicted by both the proportion of land used for agriculture and <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density. Agricultural land use was a better predictor of threat status than <b>human</b> <b>population.</b> Further, the average levels of threat attributable to agriculture were better predicted by land use than <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density, whereas threats due to causes other than agriculture were equally well predicted by land use and <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density. We fitted quantitative empirical models to describe these relationships. These results could be used, together with spatially explicit future scenarios of land use change, to project the geographical distribution and magnitude of future threats to birds at global and regional scales...|$|R

Any effort at studying wildlife abundance therefore requires {{the integration of}} detailed socioeconomic context into species distribution models.

We estimated {{the effects of the}} <b>human</b> <b>population</b> on wild mammals in a rural area in the Republic of Guinea, West Africa. We related large mammal survey data via statistical models to detailed socioeconomic information about the <b>human</b> <b>population</b> in the same area.

Although <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density had a negative effect on wild mammals, the effect of market integration and food taboos were more important and not accounted for by <b>human</b> <b>population</b> density alone. Additionally, the analysis did not provide evidence of higher mammal abundance in classified forests, which one would assume if conservation interventions aimed at reducing hunting were implemented. Beyond doubt, the relationship between humans and wild mammals is highly complex and species- and context-specific. To understand mammal–human relationships in the wider context of social-ecological systems, an in-depth knowledge of the socioeconomic characteristics of a <b>human</b> <b>population</b> is needed to identify crucial links and driving mechanisms...|$|R
