40|$|Introduction. Inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> the {{glans penis}} defined as {{balanitis}} or balanoposthitis constitute a disease {{in which the}} effectiveness of conservative treatment is not sufficient. Objective. To present the therapeutic efficacy of magneto-LED therapy in the treatment, and to present a patient with inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> the glans penis. Case report. The patient, 68 years old with inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> the glans penis of 2 – 4 years duration, was previously treated with various methods of local therapy without effect. As {{a result of a}} 32 -week long magneto-LED therapy cycle, complete resolution of skin lesions with subsidence of the burning sensation during urination and reduced swelling and inflammatory erythema of the glans, as well as disappearance of the white coating and unpleasant smell, was achieved. Conclusions. Magneto-LED therapy is an efficient method of treatment of inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> the glans penis...|$|R

5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} cervical spine damage due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{in the long term}} and to investigate which disease-specific factors are related to this damage. METHOD: Patients with early RA from the Nijmegen inception cohort with 6 to 12 years of follow-up were included. Conventional radiographs of the cervical spine were obtained at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 years and scored for <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> C 1 and C 2, anterior atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) and atlantoaxial impaction (AAI). Disease-specific factors, such as disease activity, functionality, and peripheral joint damage, at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 years, were compared between patients with and without cervical spine damage at 9 years. RESULTS: A total of 196 patients were included, of whom 134 had radiographs at 9 years. Cervical spine damage was present in 16 % (22 / 134) of the patients at 9 years. During the total 12 years of follow-up, AAS and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> C 2 were observed most frequently. <b>Erosions</b> <b>of</b> C 1 and AAI were very rare. Patients with cervical spine damage at 9 years had a higher number <b>of</b> <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> the peripheral joints and failed more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at 3, 6, and 9 years. Patients without peripheral erosive disease at 3 years were unlikely to develop cervical spine damage within 9 years of disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cervical spine damage due to RA was 16 % at 9 years. Patients without peripheral erosive disease at 3 years were unlikely to develop cervical spine damage at 9 years...|$|R
