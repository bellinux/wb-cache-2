50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill).

Methods of reducing energy consumption in a manufacturing line consisting of multiple machines are verified. First, to consolidate the processes, a series of <b>horizontal</b> <b>machining</b> <b>centers</b> are replaced with a 5 - axis <b>machining</b> <b>center.</b> The energy consumption can be reduced by approximately 8 %. The cycle time also becomes shorter by approximately 20 %. Since transfer equipment is not needed in the process, reduction of energy consumption by eliminating the equipment can also be expected. Second, energy consumption in the machine tool is classified in detail. As a result, it is found that coolant related equipment consumed approximately 54 % of the overall energy. Thus, the efforts are focused on the equipment. Coolant consumption of each pump is investigated. Based on the result, the coolant pumps can be concentrated in a single unit. In addition, energy consumption of the through-spindle coolant system is reduced and coolant pressure is optimized. Herewith energy consumption can be reduced by approximately 26 %. Finally, the inverter frequency is optimized. As a result, the overall energy consumption in the manufacturing line is reduced by approximately 42 %...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{stiffness}} and damping of the headstock, {{which is a}} critical component of precision <b>horizontal</b> <b>machining</b> <b>center,</b> are two main factors that influence machining accuracy and surface finish quality. Constrained Layer Damping (CLD) structure is proved to be effective in raising damping capacity for the thin plate and shell structures. In this paper, one kind of high damping material is utilized on the headstock to improve damping capacity. The dynamic characteristic of the hybrid headstock is investigated analytically and experimentally. The results demonstrate that the resonant response amplitudes of the headstock with damping material can decrease significantly compared to original cast structure. To obtain the optimal configuration of damping material, a topology optimization method based on the Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO) is implemented. Modal Strain Energy (MSE) method is employed to analyze the damping and to derive the sensitivity of the modal loss factor. The optimization results indicate that the added weight of damping material decreases by 50 %; meanwhile the first two orders of modal loss factor decrease by less than 23. 5 % compared to the original structure...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} about error {{modeling and}} analysis of machine tool few consider the probability characteristics of the geometric error and volumetric error systematically. However, the individual geometric error measured at different points is variational and stochastic, and therefore the resultant volumetric error is aslo stochastic and uncertain. In order to address the stochastic characteristic of the volumetric error for multiaxis machine tool, a new probability analysis mathematical model of volumetric error is proposed in this paper. According to multibody system theory, a mean value analysis model for volumetric error is established with consideration of geometric errors. The probability characteristics of geometric errors are obtained by statistical analysis to the measured sample data. Based on probability statistics and stochastic process theory, the variance analysis model of volumetric error is established in matrix, which can avoid the complex mathematics operations during the direct differential. A four-axis <b>horizontal</b> <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> is selected as an illustration example.

40|$|A {{machine tool}} is an {{assembly}} structure fitted by some moveable substructures, which the relative motion between the substructures creates normal and limit operating positions. Along with the substructures moving, the distributions of masses, stiffness and damping {{of the machine}} in space vary, leading to variety of structure distributions and dynamic properties. For exploring the dynamic properties distributions of machine tools, this paper presents a testing method under practical operational excitations, which is under operating excitations from remaining unbalanced value in the spindle, and collecting vibration signals of time and frequency at the spindle foreside at working positions. To identify resonance characteristics, a judging matrix is established by comparing vibration energy and vibration amplitude at 1 st octave. By this method, MDH 50 active pole <b>horizontal</b> <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> is tested, and the dynamic characteristics is determined. It reveals that dynamic characteristics of resonance come from the substructure independent resonance and their superposition in operating excitation. For verifying this result, FEA is conducted, in which 20 nodes brick element and spring element are applied to build the model entities and interfaces. The analysis result by FEM is consistent to the testing results. The research provides foundation for how setting up machining programs to avoid the resonance vibration of the machine in the operating. ...|$|E

40|$|The milling {{stability}} {{is one of}} the important evaluation criterions of dynamic characteristics of machine tools, and it is of great importance for machine tools’ design and manufacturing. The milling stability of machine tools generally varies with the position combinations of moving parts. The traditional milling stability analysis of machine tools is based on some specific positions in the whole workspace of machine tools, and the results are not comprehensive. Furthermore, it is very time-consuming for operation and calculation to complete analysis of multiple positions. A new method to rapidly evaluate the stability of machine tools with position dependence is developed in this article. In this method, the key position combinations of moving parts are set as the samples of calculation to calculate the dynamic characteristics of machine tools with SAMCEF finite element simulation analysis software. Then the minimum critical axial cutting depth of each sample is obtained. The relationship between the position and the value of minimum critical axial cutting depth at any position in the whole workspace can be obtained through established response surface model. The precision of the response surface model is evaluated and the model could be used to rapidly evaluate the milling stability of machine tools with position dependence. With a precision <b>horizontal</b> <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> with box-in-box structure as an example, the value of minimum critical axial cutting depth at any position is shown. This method of rapid evaluation of machine tools with position-dependent stability avoids complicated theoretical calculation, so it can be easily adopted by engineers and technicians in the phase of design process of machine tools...|$|E
