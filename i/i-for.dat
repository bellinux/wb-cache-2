Performing Songwriter magazine, called Colvin's version of the song [...] "stunning", asked her [...] "Your cover choices, as always, are terrific. Was Rod MacDonald’s 'American Jerusalem' one you used to perform in the early days of your career?" [...] Colvin replied [...] "Yeah … forever ago. In the early 80s before I started writing I’d perform it in Greenwich Village at the Cottonwood Café. I think that song’s more {{reminiscent}} of the New York that <b>I—for</b> want of a better phrase—grew up in, in my 20s. It was a little bleaker. So that’s kind of a little snapshot of New York when I first got there and didn’t know anybody and I was getting used to living in this … jungle. I’m so glad I finally recorded it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{women in}} the West have usually worn their hair long. Although young girls, actresses and a few [...] "advanced" [...] or fashionable women had worn short hair even before World War <b>I—for</b> example in 1910 the French actress Polaire is {{described}} as having [...] "a shock of short, dark hair", a cut she adopted in the early 1890s—the style was not considered generally respectable until given impetus by the inconvenience of long hair to girls engaged in war work. English society beauty Lady Diana Cooper, who had had bobbed hair as a child, kept the style through her teenage years and continued in 1914 as an adult. [...] Renowned dancer and fashion trendsetter Irene Castle introduced her [...] "Castle bob" [...] to a receptive American audience in 1915, and by 1920 the style was rapidly becoming fashionable. Popularized by film star Mary Thurman in the early 1920s and by Colleen Moore and Louise Brooks {{in the mid to}} late 1920s, it was still seen as a somewhat shocking statement of independence in young women known as flappers, as older people were used to seeing girls wearing long dresses and heavy Edwardian-style hair. Hairdressers, whose training was mainly in arranging and curling long hair, were slow to realise that short styles for women had arrived to stay, and so barbers in many cities found lines of women outside their shops, waiting to be shorn of hair that had taken many years to grow.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Old Japanese (eighth century) had split {{alignment}}, with nominative-accusative alignment in main clauses and active alignment in nominalized clauses. The main arguments for active alignment in nominalized clause come from ga-marking of active subjects {{and the distribution}} of two verbal prefixes: <b>i-for</b> active predicates and sa- for inactive predicates (cf. Yanagida, In: Hasegawa (ed.) Nihongo no shubun genshô [Main clause phenomena in Japanese], 2007 b). We review the treatment of non-accusative alignment and argue that active alignment should be analyzed as as a distinct type. We propose a formal analysis of active alignment in nominalized clauses in Old Japanese. The external argument is assigned inherent case, spelled out as ga, in situ in Spec, v. Object arguments are licensed by several distinct mechanisms, including incorporation (Yanagida, In: Miyamoto (ed.) MIT Working Papers in Linguistics, 2007 a) and case assignment by a functional head above vP. The latter accounts for the distinctive O wo S ga V word order of OJ nominalized clauses noted by Yanagida (J. of East Asian Linguistics, 2006). Inability to assign object case is a property of [nominal] v, as proposed by Miyagawa (Structure and case marking in Japanese. Syntax and Semantics, vol. 22, 1989). We discuss the diachronic origins of the OJ active alignment system and point out that it exemplifies a cross-linguistically attested pattern of non-accusative alignment in clauses that originate from nominalizations...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 25 - 29). viii, 29 leaves, bound col. ill. 29 cmBackground: Native Hawaiian (NH) {{and other}} Pacific Island (PI) adults {{have a high}} prevalence of obesity and obesity-related illness such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is little data on childhood obesity in NH and PI children. The Wai'anae area on Oahu is an ideal place to study these children since {{it is home to}} the largest community of NH. The Wai'anae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (WCCHC) is the largest medical provider to NH. Objective: To determine the prevalence of overweight in a population of NH and PI children who attend a health center in Hawai'i Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of height, weight and demographic data obtained from WCCHC clinical electronic database. Participants were children from 1 month to 19 years of age who attended WCCHC from 1998 to 2004. Based on Center for Disease Control 2000 Growth Charts, infants 95 % for age/sex. Children ~ 2 yo were classified as overweight (BMI-for-age/sex> 95 %) or "at risk" (BM <b>I-for</b> -age/sex= 85 - 95 %). " Results: There were 13, 408 participants and 33, 547 observations; 62. 8 % were NH, 10. 1 % Caucasian, 7. 2 % Samoan (Sam), 9. 7 % Filipino (Fil). Overweight status differed markedly among the ethnicities. Sam infants had much higher prevalence of overweight starting from 6 - 11 months, increasing to 39. 3 % by 18 - 23 months. Overweight prevalence for children ~ 2 yo exceeded NHANES 1999 - 2002 in all age groups except Fil teen girls. By 8 - 9 years almost 50 % of children were either "at risk" or overweight. Overweight prevalence between males and females diverged in later teen years as the number of overweight girls dropped. Sam clearly showed the highest prevalence of overweight across all age groups, peaking at 62 % in 14 - 15 yo. Based on mean BMI z-scores, Sam also had the highest degrees of overweight. Fil infants {{were more likely to be}} underweight and stunted but older Fil children still had a high overweight prevalence. Conclusions: Overweight prevalence was high from early childhood in this health center population. Sam children clearly showed the highest prevalence and degree of overweight starting from infancy. The cause and consequence of the high prevalence and the dramatic difference between ethnic groups needs further investigation but may include prenatal and early childhood growth as well as cultural, environmental and socio-economic factors. Childhood obesity prevention, and possibly intervention programs, for NH and Sam children should begin in early childhood...|$|E
