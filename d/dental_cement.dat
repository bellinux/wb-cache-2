5|$|Regardless of the {{abutment}} {{material or}} technique, {{an impression of}} the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with <b>dental</b> <b>cement.</b> Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant.

5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>cements</b> are hard, brittle {{materials}} formed by mixing powder and liquid together. They are either resin cements or acid-base cements.

25|$|Preliminary {{investigations}} {{suggested a}} beluga's life expectancy was rarely more than 30 years. The method {{used to calculate}} the age of a beluga is based on counting the layers of dentin and <b>dental</b> <b>cement</b> in a specimen's teeth, which were originally thought to be deposited once or twice a year. The layers can be readily identified as one layer consists of opaque dense material and the other is transparent and less dense. It is therefore possible to estimate the age of the individual by extrapolating the number of layers identified and the estimated frequency with which the deposits are laid down. A 2006 study using radiocarbon dating of the dentine layers showed the deposit of this material occurs with a lesser frequency (once per year) than was previously thought. The study therefore estimated belugas can live for 70 or 80 years.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dental</b> {{restorative}} <b>cements</b> {{are placed}} in a harsh oral environment where they are subjected to thermal shock, chemical degradation, and repeating masticatory force. The ideal restorative <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> should have superior mechanical properties, chemical stability, aesthetic, good handling properties, biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and preferably bioactivity. This thesis presents research on <b>dental</b> restorative <b>cements</b> with enhanced properties. The overall aim was to increase the bioactivity and antibacterial properties of <b>dental</b> restorative <b>cements</b> without affecting their other properties. The effect from adding calcium silicate to glass ionomer cement (GIC) was investigated. The results showed that calcium silicate could increase the bioactivity and reduce the cytotoxicity of conventional glass ionomer cement without compromising its setting and mechanical properties. Hydroxyapatite (HA) with a high aspect ratio and thin nacreous-layered monetite sheets were also synthesized. Nano HA particles with an aspect ratio of 50 can be synthesized by both precipitation and hydrothermal methods. The aspect ratio was controlled via the pH of reaction medium. Thin nacreous-layered monetite sheets were synthesized through a self-assembly process {{in the presence of}} an amine based cationic quaternary surfactant. Temperature, pH, and presence of surfactant played essential roles in forming the nacreous-layered monetite sheets. Then the effect from adding silver doped HA and monetite particles was investigated. The results showed that the antibacterial properties of GIC could be increased by incorporating silver doped HA and monetite particles. Further examination showed that the pH change, F- ion release, and concentration of released Ag+ ions were not responsible for the improved antibacterial properties. The quasi-static strengths and compressive fatigue limits of four types of the most commonly used dental restorations were evaluated. In our study, resin modified GIC and resin-based composite showed superior static compressive strength and fatigue limits compared to conventional GIC. The static compressive strength of <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> increased with the aging time. However, aging had no effect on the compressive fatigue limit of resin modified GIC and resin-based composite.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the radiopacity of some luting <b>dental</b> <b>cements</b> used in prosthetic dentistry. Methods: Five disclike samples of each material (6 x 1 mm) were prepared from panavia F 2. 0 (Pa), Chioce 2 (Ch. 2), Glass ionomer GC (GI GC), zinc phosphate Hoffmann’s (ZP hof), zinc polycarboxylate Hoffmann’s (ZPC hof), Glass ionomer ariadent(GI ari), zinc phosphate ariadent(ZP ari) and zinc polycarboxylate ariadent (ZPC ari). The radiopacity of each material along with aluminium step wedge were measured from radiographic images using a digital radiography. The average measured radiopacities from five areas were taken into account, which were measured by Digora for windows (DFW) software using a PSP digital sensor. Results: There was a significant difference between radiopacity value of all luting materials (P≤ 0. 001). ZP ari had the highest radiopacity with 7. 7 ± 0. 55 mm aluminium.
