40|$|Two trends {{dominate}} {{the design of}} modern electric machines; a commitment to higher energy-efficiencies {{on the one hand}} and a tendency towards more dedicated drives on the other. As a result, the importance of rigorous optimizations during the design process of electric machines is at an all-time high. This, in turn, has sparked the interest for modeling tools that combine accuracy and a low computational time. The latter is especially important during the earliest phases of the machine's design, when the design space is still very large. Another result of the above-described trends is the emerging of new electric machine types. Especially high-speed electric machines have gained a lot of attention over the past decade. Indeed, the dedicated design of such machines enables a direct-drive configuration of high-speed systems. This doesn't only allow to omit the gearbox, resulting in a higher efficiency and reliability, it also reduces the system's weight and size. In addition to the importance of optimization procedures, the need to gain more insight in emerging machine types is another incentive to develop comprehensible models for these machines. The aforementioned needs for fast and accurate modeling tools and a better insight in emerging machine types form the motivation for this work. Because of their relative importance in the segment of high-speed machine, the focus is on surface-mounted permanent-magnet synchronous machines with a shielding cylinder. In the first place, the aim of this work is to study and improve the existing modeling techniques for high-speed synchronous machines with permanent magnets. Secondly, this work wants to provide the foundation for a better understanding of these machines. Especially regarding the physical processes through which the shielding cylinder affects the machine's performance. The first part of this work discusses the modeling of permanent-magnet synchronous machines, with a focus on machines that operate at high speeds. That discussion starts with an evaluation of the existing modeling techniques. Based on that evaluation, it was chosen to concentrate on the so-called Fourier-based modeling technique. This type of models combines the subdomain technique, i. e. dividing the studied machine topology in a number of subdomains, with the separation of variables technique to calculate the machine's magnetic field. Next, the physical background and implementation of Fourier-based models is described. The term Fourier-based modeling actually covers a wide range of different techniques. There are, for example, different possibilities to account for slotting and even the initial physical formulation of the problem can be based on two different magnetic potentials. Therefore, the next step is to use the previous discussion on Fourier-based modeling as a basis to evaluate the different techniques within Fourier-based modeling. By coupling that evaluation to an overview of the existing literature, this work presents a comprehensible selection guide that can be used by anyone who wants to build a Fourier-based model. The second part of this work concentrates on how the existing Fourier-based models can be improved. The first improvement has been to further reduce the computational times of Fourier-based models, even though they are already inherently low. It was found that this can be done by simplifying the studied geometry and by performing a preliminary analysis of the machine's harmonic content. Especially the latter results in spectacular computational-time reductions up to 99 % without affecting the model's accuracy. Another contribution of this work to the Fourier-based modeling technique has been to account for voltage sources, as opposed to the current-density sources that are traditionally used. Although this does add to the model's complexity, it may greatly improve its value, especially when the modeled machine is to be powered with a voltage source. Whereas the first two parts of this work focus on the calculation of the machine's magnetic field, the third part focuses on the electromagnetic quantities that can be obtained from that magnetic field. Firstly the postprocessing itself, i. e. the actual calculation of the electromagnetic quantities is discussed. Four quantities in particular are considered; the magnetic flux density, the back electromotive force, the torque and the eddy-current losses. This work contributed to the existing literature by introducing a division of the torque in two components, one that is related to the shielding cylinder and one that is related to the magnets. Secondly, the test setup that has been built in the scope of this PhD is introduced and used to validate the calculation of the back electromotive force and the currents that are obtained when imposing a voltage. Note that all other calculations have been validated with a finite-element model. Finally, a number of parameter studies are performed to investigate the shielding cylinder's effect on the torque and the eddy-current losses. By evaluating the effect of the shielding cylinder's conductivity and its thickness while applying various current and voltage sources, a number of interesting observations have been made. It was for example noted that the torque related to the shielding cylinder behaves similarly to the torque that is produced in an induction machine. Another observation is that, unlike expected, the synchronous harmonic content of the machine is affected by the shielding cylinder's conductivity. Although it is difficult to extrapolate the results to other machine topologies, the observations from these parameter studies clearly add to the understanding of high-speed permanent-magnet synchronous machines. Combined, the three individual parts of this work meet the initial goals of this PhD. The first part provides an elaborate study of the existing Fourier-based modeling techniques. The second part makes these models even more attractive for research and optimization purposes by reducing the computational time and accounting for voltage sources. The last part applies Fourier-based modeling to gain a better understanding of high-speed permanent-magnet synchronous machines. Een streven naar betere <b>efficiënties</b> enerzijds en een tendens naar meer gespecialiseerde elektrische aandrijvingen anderzijds, domineren momenteel de evolutie van elektrische machines. Het gevolg daarvan is dat het belang van doorgedreven optimalisaties tijdens het ontwerp van elektrische machines sterk stijgt, wat op zijn beurt weer zorgt voor een toegenomen interesse in wiskundige modellen die zowel nauwkeurig als snel zijn. Dat laatste is bijzonder belangrijk tijdens de eerste fases van het ontwerpproces, als de ontwerpruimte nog zeer groot is. Een ander gevolg van het streven naar efficiëntere en meer gespecialiseerde machines is dat er nieuwe types elektrische machines ontworpen worden. In het licht daarvan zijn hogesnelheidsmachines erg populair geworden tijdens de afgelopen tien jaar. Inderdaad, indien dergelijke machines specifiek ontworpen worden voor één bepaalde hogesnelheidstoepassing, is het mogelijk die toepassing aan te drijven zonder tussenkomst van een tandwielkast. Dit zorgt er niet enkel voor dat de efficiëntie en duurzaamheid verbeteren, het resulteert ook in een lichter en compacter systeem. Om een nieuwe machine te ontwerpen is er echter een goed inzicht in die machine nodig. In dit doctoraat bijvoorbeeld, ligt de focus op hogesnelheidsmachines met permanente magneten. Dergelijke machines worden vaak uitgerust met een beschermende cilinder rond de magneten. Het doel van die cilinder is de magneten op hun plaats te houden en/of de rotorverliezen te verminderen. Een goed inzicht in de fysische processen die zo'n beschermende cilinder teweegbrengt is belangrijk. Als aanvulling op het belang van optimalisatie procedures, is de behoefte naar meer inzicht in nieuwe types machines een extra reden om wiskundige modellen voor dergelijke machines te ontwerpen. De behoefte naar zowel snelle en nauwkeurige wiskundige modellen én een beter inzicht in nieuwe types elektrische machines vormen de motivatie voor dit doctoraat. In de eerste plaats is het doel de bestaande wiskundige modellen voor permanentmagneetbekrachtigde synchrone machines te bestuderen en te verbeteren. Ten tweede wilt dit werk de basis leggen voor een beter inzicht in dergelijke machines. In het eerste deel van dit werk wordt de wiskundige modellering van permanentmagneetbekrachtigde synchrone machines besproken, met een focus op machines die ontworpen zijn voor grote omwentelingssnelheden. In een eerste stap worden de bestaande modelingstechnieken vergeleken. Op basis van die vergelijking werd er gekozen voor de Fourier-gebaseerde modelleringstechniek. Deze techniek combineert de zogenaamde deelgebiedenmethode, die het bestudeerde probleem in kleinere delen opdeelt, met scheiding der veranderlijken om het magnetisch veld in de machine te berekenen. In een tweede stap wordt de fysische achtergrond en de implementatie van Fourier-gebaseerde modellen besproken. De term Fourier-gebaseerd modelleren dekt eigenlijk een brede waaier aan verschillende technieken. Er zijn bijvoorbeeld meerdere methodes om het gleufeffect in rekening te brengen. Zelfs de fysische formulering van het probleem kan gebaseerd zijn op verschillende magnetisch potentialen. Daarom is de volgende stap om, op basis van de voorgaande discussie, de verschillende technieken binnen Fourier-gebaseerd modelleren te evalueren. Door die evaluatie te koppelen aan een overzicht van de bestaande literatuur, slaagt dit werk erin een keuzehulp aan te bieden voor toekomstige onderzoekers die een dergelijk model willen maken. Het tweede deel van dit werk tracht de bestaande Fourier-gebaseerde modellen te verbeteren. Een eerste verbetering werd gerealiseerd door de rekentijd van Fourier-gebaseerde modellen te verlagen. Dit werd enerzijds gedaan door de bestudeerde geometrie te vereenvoudigen en anderzijds door een kwalitatieve studie van de harmonsiche inhoud van het magnetisch veld in de machine te gebruiken. Vooral die laatste methode levert een spectaculaire rekentijdreductie tot wel 99 % op, zonder de nauwkeurigheid van het model te verminderen. Een tweede bijdrage van dit werk is het in rekening brengen van spanningsbronnen, dit in tegenstelling tot het opdringen van stroomdichtheden. Ondanks het feit dat dit de complexiteit van het model vergroot, kan het een grote meerwaarde zijn. Zeker indien de te modelleren machine aangedreven wordt met een spanningsbron. Waar de eerste twee delen van dit werk focussen op de berekening van het magnetisch veld, ligt de focus van het derde deel op de elektromagnetische grootheden. In een eerste stap word de berekening van vier elektromagnetische grootheden besproken; de magnetische flux dichtheid, de tegen elektromotorische kracht, het koppel en de wervelstroomverliezen. Dit doctoraat draagt bij aan de bestaande literatuur door de opdeling van het koppel in twee componenten te introduceren; een component gerelateerd aan de beschermende cilinder en een component gerelateerd aan de magneten. In een tweede stap wordt de testopstelling, die gebouwd werd in het kader van dit doctoraat, kort voorgesteld. Vervolgens wordt ze gebruikt om de berekening van de tegen elektromotorische kracht en de stromen in de machine te onderzoeken. Merk op dat alle andere berekeningen eerder al gevalideerd werden met een eindige-elementen model. Ten slotte werden er verschillende parameterstudies uitgevoerd om het effect van de beschermende cilinder op het koppel en de wervelstroomverliezen te valideren. Door het effect van de geleidbaarheid en de dikte van de cilinder te bestuderen bij verschillende stroom- en spanningsbronnen, kunnen een aantal interessante observaties gedaan worden. Zo werd er bijvoorbeeld vastgesteld dat de koppelcomponent die gerelateerd is aan de beschermende cilinder dezelfde eigenschappen vertoond als het koppel in een inductiemachine. Verder werd er ook vastgesteld dat, tegen de verwachtingen in, de synchrone harmonische inhoud van de machine beïnvloed wordt door de geleidbaarheid van de beschermende cilinder. Ondanks het feit dat het moeilijk is de resultaten te extrapoleren naar andere machines, dragen de inzichten die voortkomen uit deze parameter studies zeker bij aan een beter begrip van permanentmagneetbekrachtigde hogesnelheidsmachines. Samen komen bovenstaande delen van het werk tegemoet aan de initële doelstellingen van dit doctoraat. Het eerste deel bevat een uitgebreide studie van de technieken binnen Fourier-gebaseerd modelleren. In het tweede deel worden twee verbeteringen van de bestaande techniek voorgesteld die Fourier-gebaseerd modeleren nog aantrekkelijker maakt voor onderzoeks- en optimalisatiedoeleinden. Het laatste deel van dit werk gebruikt Fourier-gebaseerd modeleren om een beter inzicht te krijgen in permanentmagneetbekrachtigde hogesnelheidsmachines...|$|R

OB stability was significantly affected by (i) genotype, the accessions with the lowest oil extraction levels displaying the most stable oil bodies, (ii) lowering the pH leading to OBs aggregation at pH lower than 7 and, (iii) the addition of divalent cations able to neutralize the negative charges on the OB surface.

Low <b>efficienty</b> level of environmental knowledge management, operated by decisional agents (simple employee or manager in the position they hold) in the Romanian organizations (mainly the industrial organizations) is the main problem approached by this paper (MP). This paper intends to resolve the problem covered above (MP) designing a quality analysis model for environmental knowledge management and sinecvanon identifying the important factors that influence it (collecting data / information from: a. analysis of different documents (environmental documentation / job descriptions / organization and operation regulations) from the 10 industrial organizations of NE Region of Romania and beyond; b. analysis of the specialized literature (focusing on previous studies conducted)) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} N-(N-dinitrophenylaminoalkyl) maleimides were sythesized with alkyl-chain lengths of two, four and six carbon atoms. When these {{compounds}} reacted with the thiol group of mercaptalbumin, the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein was quenched. This change in fluorescence {{was used to}} determine the rate of reaction of the Dnp (dinitrophenyl) -maleimides with mercaptalbumin. The second-order rate constants were similar to those observed in reactions between low-molecular-weight thiol compounds and maleimides. When N-(N-Dnp-aminoalkyl) succinimidomercaptalbumins were added to univalent fragments of anti-Dnp antibody the antibody fluorescence was quenched. Florescence-quenching titrations showed that the protein-bound Dnp groups were fully available to the antibody even when the alkyl chain was short. The apparent dissociation constants were significantly greater than that of the interaction between anti-Dnp antibody and the free hapten, 6 -(N-Dnp) -aminohexanoate. The antibody fluorescence was quenched <b>efficienty</b> by [dnp-Lys 41]ribonuclease A, also with an increased dissociation constant. It could be concluded from the increase in dissociation constant that the Dnp group spent no more than 0. 1 % of its time in the dissociated state, available to antibody. The second-order rate constants for the association between the Dnp-mercaptablumins and the antibody were determined and were similar in magnitude to those observed in other interactions between protein and anti-protein antibody...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSteam/water rankine cycles {{are mainly}} used as energy {{conversion}} systems (ECS) for large power plants. Due {{to the low}} density of steam at low pressure, the turbine size is generally very big. Furthemore water cooling is almost always preferred as cooling option since it provides the best energy efficiency as compared to air cooling. Nevertheless, water use can be strengthened in the future due to environmental constraints(withdrawal or heat release limitations). In the present work, a two-stage rankine cycle (TSRC) is considered, combining a steam/water cycle and organic rankine cycle (ORC) cooled by an air cooled condenser (ACC). The backpressure of the steam cycle is limited and the heat which remains in the steam is transferred to an ORC through a condenser-boiler. Due to the organic fluid high density, {{it is possible to}} reduce the installation size. Furthermore, the organic fluid is likely to provide additional power when ambient temperatures are low. With those two advantages it is expected for dry cooling to become more cost effective. The paper reports the methodology that has been used in order to optimize a design in terms of fluid selection, component sizing and <b>efficienty.</b> Preliminay cost analyses related to the different working fluids and to local ambient conditions are given...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{efficient}} framework for uncertainty quantification in {{computational fluid dynamics}} is presented. Geometrical uncertainties are <b>efficienty</b> treated by using a mesh de-formation technique and multiple uncertainties are propagated using a Two-Step approach. Both steps are performed using the Probabilistic Collocation method. The first step con-sists of a sensitivity analysis to identify the most important parameters of the problem. The sensitivity derivatives are obtained using a first or second order Probabilistic Collocation approximation. For the most important parameters the probability distribution functions are propagated using the Probabilistic Collocation method using higher order approxima-tions. The Two-Step approach is demonstrated for flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil with eight uncertain parameters in the free stream conditions and geometry. To efficiently han-dle geometrical uncertainties, a mesh deformation algorithm was employed. This avoids remeshing for every collocation point. The first step identified the freestream velocity, angle of attack, and the camber of the airfoil as {{the three most important}} parameters. In the second step the probability distributions of all three parameters are propagated using higher order Probabilistic Collocation approximations. Statistical properties of the lift and drag are obtained, as well as uncertainty bounds for the pressure and skinfriction {{on the surface of the}} airfoil. I...|$|E
