40|$|The {{life cycle}} of Oesophagostomum columbianum (Curtice, 1890) in sheep. International Journal for Parasitology 3 : 843 - 851. Previous {{descriptions}} of the {{life cycle of}} Oesophagostomum columbianum in sheep refer to only one <b>histotropic</b> phase, during which development from the third to the fourth larval stage occurs. The present findings show that some larvae undergo two separate <b>histotropic</b> phases. In first infections, third-stage larvae encysted in the intestinal wall, predominantly in the anterior small intestine. The third moult occurred between 5 and 10 days after infection, and during this period most of the larvae returned to the lumen and migrated to the large intestine. Some larvae entered a second <b>histotropic</b> phase in the large intestine where they were arrested at the mid-fourth larval stage; the remaining larvae appeared to develop directly to the adult stage in the lumen without undergoing a second tissue migration. Few larvae developed to the adult stage after second infections. Some were arrested in the first <b>histotropic</b> phase in the small intestine and others were arrested in the second <b>histotropic</b> phase in the large intestine. The second <b>histotropic</b> phase appears to be an abnormal variation of the basic life cycle pattern of the oesophagostomes which may be indicative of a poorly adapted host-parasite relationship...|$|E

40|$|The genus Trichuris {{includes}} parasites {{of major}} relevance in veterinary and human medicine. Despite serious economic losses and enormous impact on public health, treatment options against whipworms are very limited. Additionally, {{there is an}} obvious lack of appropriately characterized experimental infection models. Therefore, a detailed parasitological characterization of a Trichuris muris isolate was performed in C 57 BL/ 10 mice. Subsequently, the in vivo efficacies of the aminophenylamidines amidantel, deacylated amidantel (dAMD) and tribendimidine {{as well as the}} cyclooctadepsipeptides emodepside and in particular PF 1022 A were analyzed. This was performed using various administration routes and treatment schemes targeting <b>histotropic</b> and further developed larval as well as immature and mature adult stages. Duration of prepatent period, time-dependent localization of larvae during period of prepatency as well as the duration of patency of the infection were determined before drugs were tested in the characterized trichurosis model. Amidantel showed no effect against mature adult T. muris. Tribendimidine showed significantly higher potency than dAMD after oral treatments (ED 50 values of 6. 5 vs. 15. 1 mg/kg). However, the opposite was found for intraperitoneal treatments (ED 50 values of 15. 3 vs. 8. 3 mg/kg). When emodepside and PF 1022 A were compared, the latter was significantly less effective against mature adults following intraperitoneal (ED 50 values of 6. 1 vs. 55. 7 mg/kg) or subcutaneous (ED 50 values of 15. 2 vs. 225. 7 mg/kg) administration. Only minimal differences were observed following oral administration (ED 50 values of 2. 7 vs. 5. 2 mg/kg). Triple and most single oral doses with moderate to high dosages of PF 1022 A showed complete efficacy against <b>histotropic</b> second stage larvae (3 × 100 mg/kg or 1 × 250 mg/kg), further developed larvae (3 × 10 mg/kg or 1 × 100 mg/kg) and immature adults (3 × 10 mg/kg or 1 × 100 mg/kg). <b>Histotropic</b> first stage larvae were only eliminated after three doses of PF 1022 A (3 × 100 mg/kg) but not after a single dose. These results indicate that the cyclooctadepsipeptides are a drug class with promising candidates for further evaluation for the treatment of trichurosis of humans and livestock animals in single dose regimens...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{prevalence}} of parasitic diseases in poultry {{seems to have}} significantly reduced due {{not only to the}} intensive production system but also to the improving conditions of hygiene and management practiced. However, parasitic diseases continue to have great importance in traditional production systems and production systems in the outdoors, contributing significantly to productivity decline of these farms. The pigeon (Columbia livia), a specie produced with outdoors access is more susceptible to infestations. The growing population of wild pigeons in urban areas can be decisive in the infestation of domestic pigeons, since they share the same places and their sanitary control is more difficult. Objectives The aim of this work is to describe a case of a pigeon (Columbia livia) with an intense parasitic infestation, this being the cause of death, with common parasitic species and other less frequent. Material and Methods A cadaver of a pigeon was submitted to the necropsy of Anatomic Pathology Laboratory of the Agrarian Superior School of Viseu, a detailed post mortem examination was carried out and samples were taken. All samples were fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin, for a maximum of 48 hours and processed following the routine histopathological technique. Results Gross examination lesions revealed rounded red lesions in the proventriculus serosa and lung congestion. Microscopic examination confirmed severe lung congestion, with hemosiderosis and the presence of numerous nematodes in cross section, discussing the hypothesis that it might be a case of Cyathostoma bronchialis (Muehlig 1884), taking into account the location or, less likely, an erratic parasite in <b>histotropic</b> migration phase. Eggs observed at this location had thick shell, oval shape, some were embryonated and 35 - 40 μm in length by 20 - 25 μm in width. In the lumen of the proventriculus glands, nematodes in cross section were also observed, noting numerous barrel-shaped eggs, embryonated larvae, oval poles and 55 mm in length by 25 mm in width, apparently compatible with parasites of the genus Tetrameres. Conclusion The high parasitic infestation of the wild pigeon specimen subjected to necropsy, with several, common and uncommon, species of parasites, the severity of lesions, leading to death of the animal, as well as the fact that infected wild birds favoring the spread of the parasite to the domestic pigeons and other poultry production, consisting of a major concern for producers, justifies the study of isolated cases, even constituting an epidemiological alert for the regions where they appear.
