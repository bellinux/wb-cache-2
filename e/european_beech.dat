5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the <b>European</b> <b>Beech</b> (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius is {{very common}} and is found in {{broad-leaved}} woodland, favouring beech; it is most associated with Fagus sylvatica, the <b>European</b> <b>Beech,</b> though {{it has also been}} observed growing in association with species of oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal association with trees, and can grow {{on a wide variety of}} subsoil types, but is more typical of acidic soil. It is found between late summer and late autumn, and is native to Europe. The distribution of the mushroom coincides with the distribution of beech. In the British Isles, the species is one of the one hundred most common mushrooms. Other areas in which it has been recorded include Sweden, France, Italy, and Poland.|$|E

5|$|Russula virescens can {{be found}} fruiting on soil in both {{deciduous}} forests and mixed forests, forming ectomycorrhizal symbiotic relationships {{with a variety of}} trees, including oaks (Quercus), <b>European</b> <b>beech</b> (Fagus sylvatica), and aspen (Populus tremula). Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of Dipterocarpaceae, an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of Southeast Asia. Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups, reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn. A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in subtropical forests in Xalapa showed that the fruiting period of R.virescens occurred in April, before the onset of the rainy season.|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous <b>European</b> <b>beech</b> forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science in 1774 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species Russula parvovirescens and R.crustosa. R.virescens fruits singly or scattered {{on the ground in}} both deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal associations with broadleaf trees such as oak, <b>European</b> <b>beech,</b> and aspen. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland rainforest trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae. R.virescens has a ribonuclease enzyme with a biochemistry unique among edible mushrooms. It also has biologically active polysaccharides, and a laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{it grows}} in {{deciduous}} woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and beech, {{but is also}} found on occasion with conifers. It is also occasionally known from treeless heathland, where it is associated with bracken. The species favours acidic soil. Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree. In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch (Betula pubescens), silver birch (B. pendula), European aspen (Populus tremula) and rarely <b>European</b> <b>beech</b> (Fagus sylvatica). No records of association with oak (Quercus) are known from this region. Brandrud reported that {{what he described as}} spp. hercynicus grew with Picea abies, generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera Hylocomium and Pleurozium, and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus), as well as the buttercup-family shrub Hepatica nobilis. The species grows with Betula pubescens in Greenland, and is also associated with hazelnut (Corylus avellana) in Central and Southern Europe.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNitrogen (N) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources for plants, generally enhancing leaf photosynthesis because a large part of it is allocated to Rubisco and thylakoïds. This is well known in leaves where photosynthesis (i. e. gas exchange, Rubisco activity, chlorophyll content) is positively correlated to leaf N content. * In order to test this hypothesis in stems, N concentration, CO 2 exchange and also Rubisco and PEP carboxylase activities were measured in summer on current-year stems of young <b>European</b> <b>beeches</b> (Fagus sylvatica L.) growing on soils of different N content. * The CO 2 refixation rate of stems increased from 58. 5 % to 74. 3 % when stem N concentration increased from 5. 7 to 10. 1 mg g− 1 DW. A hyperbolic relationship was obtained between stem gross photosynthesis and N concentration, with an x-intercept of 0. 3 mmol N g− 1 DW. Stem PEP carboxylase activity was higher in stems than in leaves and increased with stem N concentration whereas Rubisco activity did not change between treatments in both tissues. * In spite of a low nitrogen investment in stem photosynthesis (low PNUE), these results suggest that (1) stems invest more N in CO 2 refixation when more N is widely available, (2) stem photosynthesis is able to operate at low N concentration and (3) stem PEP carboxylase is involved in stem carbon refixation, but also simultaneously supplies carbon skeletons for N assimilation...|$|R

40|$|Measuring and {{estimating}} biodiversity patterns is {{a fundamental}} task of the scientist working to support conservation and informmanagement decisions. Most biodiversity studies in temperate regions were often carried out over {{a very short period}} of time (e. g., a single season) and it is often—at least tacitly—assumed that these short-termfindings are representative of long-termgeneral patterns. However, should the studied biodiversity pattern in fact contain significant temporal dynamics, perhaps leading to contradictory conclusions. Here, we studied the seasonal diversity dynamics of arboreal spider communities dwelling in 216 <b>European</b> <b>beeches</b> (Fagus sylvatica L.) to assess the spider community composition in the following seasons: two cold seasons (I:November 2005 –January 2006; II: February–April) and two warm seasons (III: May–July; IV: August–October). We show that the usually measured diversity of the warmseason community (IV: 58 estimated species) alone did not deliver a reliable image of the overall diversity present in these trees, and therefore, we recommend it should not be used for sampling protocols aimed at providing a full picture of a forest’s biodiversity in the temperate zones. In particular, when the additional samplings of other seasons (I, II, III) were included, the estimated species richness nearly doubled (108). Community I possessed the lowest diversity and evenness due to the harsh winter conditions: this community was comprised of one dominant species together with several species low in abundance. Similarity was lowest (38. 6 %) between seasonal communities I and III, indicating a significant species turnover due to recolonization, so that community III had the highest diversity. Finally, using nonparametric estimators, we found that further sampling in late winter (February–April) is most needed to complete our inventory. Our study clearly demonstrates that seasonal dynamics of communities should be taken into account when studying biodiversity patterns of spiders, and probably forest arthropods in general...|$|R

40|$|In forest ecology, a snag {{refers to}} a standing, partly or {{completely}} dead tree, often missing a top {{or most of the}} smaller branches. The accurate estimation of live and dead biomass in forested ecosystems is important for studies of carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and forest management. Therefore, an understanding of its availability and spatial distribution is required. So far, LiDAR remote sensing has been successfully used to assess live trees and their biomass, but studies focusing on dead trees are rare. The paper develops a methodology for retrieving individual dead trees in a mixed mountain forest using features that are derived from small-footprint airborne full waveform LIDAR data. First, 3 D coordinates of the laser beam reflections, the pulse intensity and width are extracted by waveform decomposition. Secondly, 3 D single trees are detected by an integrated approach, which delineates both dominate tree crowns and understory small trees in the canopy height model (CHM) using the watershed algorithm followed by applying normalized cuts segmentation to merged watershed areas. Thus, single trees can be obtained as 3 D point segments associated with waveform-specific features per point. Furthermore, the tree segments are delivered to feature definition process to derive geometric and reflectional features at single tree level, e. g. volume and maximal diameter of crown, mean intensity, gap fraction, etc. Finally, the spanned feature space for the tree segments is forwarded to a binary classifier using support vector machine (SVM) in order to discriminate dead trees from the living ones. The methodology is applied to datasets that have been captured with the Riegl LMS-Q 560 laser scanner at a point density of 25 points/m 2 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, respectively under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions for Norway spruces, <b>European</b> <b>beeches</b> and Sycamore maples.
