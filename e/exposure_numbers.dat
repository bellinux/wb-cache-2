40|$|Analyses of {{asbestos}} bodies {{from the general}} population have confirmed that these structures, like asbestos bodies from the lungs {{of asbestos}} workers, contain an asbestos core. In members of the general population this core is almost always an amphibole, whereas asbestos workers may have bodies formed on either amphibole or chrysotile. Most adults have a few bodies, and increasing numbers are seen in blue collar workers and others who handle small amounts of the fiber, with the highest levels being seen in asbestos workers. In men with minimal or extensive occupational exposure, asbestos bodies are formed on the commercial fibers, amosite and crocidolite, whereas women also form a significant number of bodies on the noncommercial fibers, anthophyllite and tremolite. These findings suggest that women may be exposed to specific asbestos-containing products, eg, cosmetic talc. The commercial fibers found in women and white collar men probably reflect atmospheric pollution with asbestos. At the highest levels of <b>exposure,</b> <b>numbers</b> of asbestos bodies correlate in a general way with the presence of asbestosis, although no precise value has been determined above which asbestosis is always found.

We have reviewed processes for the deliberate development and manufacture of nanoparticle products and have considered sources and routes of exposure, levels of <b>exposure,</b> <b>numbers</b> exposed, knowledge gaps and future trends. We conclude that all of the four main groups of nanoparticle production processes may potentially result in exposure by inhalation, dermal or ingestion routes and that little is known about current levels of exposure.

Control approaches for dermal and ingestion exposure may not be as effective as they are for larger particles. Surface area is probably the best exposure metric for some but not necessarily all nanoparticles but there are no effective methods by which this can be measured in the workplace. Current knowledge is insufficient for risk assessment purposes. The number of workers who may be exposed to nanoparticles in the university sector and in emerging nanoparticle companies may be as high as 2000.

40|$|Abstract Background Translocation of {{nanoparticles}} (NP) {{from the}} pulmonary airways into other pulmonary compartments or the systemic circulation is controversially {{discussed in the}} literature. In a previous study it was shown that titanium dioxide (TiO 2) NP were "distributed in four lung compartments (air-filled spaces, epithelium/endothelium, connective tissue, capillary lumen) in correlation with compartment size". It was concluded that particles can move freely between these tissue compartments. To analyze whether the distribution of TiO 2 NP in the lungs is really random or shows a preferential targeting we applied a newly developed method for comparing NP distributions. Methods Rat lungs exposed to an aerosol containing TiO 2 NP were prepared for light and electron microscopy at 1 h and at 24 h after <b>exposure.</b> <b>Numbers</b> of TiO 2 NP associated with each compartment were counted using energy filtering transmission electron microscopy. Compartment size was estimated by unbiased stereology from systematically sampled light micrographs. Numbers of particles were related to compartment size using a relative deposition index and chi-squared analysis. Results Nanoparticle distribution within the four compartments was not random at 1 h or at 24 h after exposure. At 1 h the connective tissue was the preferential target of the particles. At 24 h the NP were preferentially located in the capillary lumen. Conclusion We conclude that TiO 2 NP do not move freely between pulmonary tissue compartments, although they can pass from one compartment to another with relative ease. The residence time of NP in each tissue compartment of the respiratory system depends on the compartment and the time after exposure. It is suggested that {{a small fraction of}} TiO 2 NP are rapidly transported from the airway lumen to the connective tissue and subsequently released into the systemic circulation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dental-related trauma such as tooth {{extraction}} {{is one of}} the major risk factors significantly associated with development of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Tooth extraction is usually performed due to underlying pre-existing pathological inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis but it remains largely unknown whether pathological inflammatory conditions exacerbate ONJ development following {{tooth extraction}}, or resolving pathological inflammatory condition before tooth extraction ameliorates ONJ development. The aim of the study is to determine the role of pathological inflammatory conditions in ONJ development induced by tooth extraction in mice. ZOL (Zometa, 125 μg/kg; Novartis Oncology, East Hanover, NJ, USA) or vehicle (veh) solution (0. 9 % NaCl saline) was i. v. administered bi-weekly throughout the experiment (n = 5 - 10 per group). One week after ZOL-administration, pathological inflammatory conditions were induced by placing ligature (6 - 0) on the second maxillary molar for 3 weeks. To resolve ligature-induced inflammation, the ligatures were removed after 3 weeks and allowed to heal for 2 weeks following tooth extraction. After 3 weeks, maxillae were harvested to analyze for the microCT and bone loss as measured from the cement-enamel junction to alveolar bone ridge. Bone necrosis was measured from H&E stained slides by measuring empty lacunae and necrotic bone. Palatal tissues were subjected to qRT-PCR for expression of IL- 1 B, IL- 6, and IL- 17. The sectioned slides were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) + osteoclasts. Extraction of the tooth with ligature caused increased numbers of empty lacunae and percentages of necrotic bone when compared to that of without ligature. When ligature was removed and allowed to heal before tooth extraction, bone <b>exposure,</b> <b>numbers</b> of empty lacunae, and necrotic bone percentages were all reduced when compared to the unremoved group. These results signify that pathological inflammatory conditions exacerbate ONJ lesions following tooth extraction, and resolution of these conditions before extraction ameliorates ONJ development...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the influence that}} match exposure has upon injury risk in Rugby Union. Method: A seven-season (2006 / 7 2012 / 13) prospective cohort study of time-loss injuries in 1253 English Premiership professional players was conducted. Players’ 12 -month match <b>exposure</b> (<b>number</b> of matches a player was involved in for ≥ 20 mins in the preceding 12 months) and 1 -month match <b>exposure</b> (<b>number</b> of full-game equivalent [FGE] matches in preceding 30 days) were assessed as risk factors for injury using a nested frailty model and magnitude-based inferences. Results: Twelve-month match exposure was associated with injury risk in a non linear fashion, with players who {{had been involved in}} less than ≈ 15 or greater than ≈ 35 matches over the preceding 12 -month period being more susceptible to injury. Monthly match exposure was linearly associated with injury risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 14 per 2 -SD [3. 2 FGE] increase, 90 % CI: 1. 08 1. 20; likely harmful), although this effect was substantially attenuated for players in the upper quartile for 12 -month match exposures (> 28 matches). Conclusion: A player’s accumulated (12 -month) and recent (1 -month) match exposure substantially influences their current injury risk. Careful attention should be paid to planning the workloads and monitoring the responses of players involved in a: 1) high (>≈ 35) number of matches in the previous year; 2) low (<≈ 15) number of matches in the previous year; 3) low-moderate number of matches in previous year but who have played intensively in the recent past.

40|$|Development {{of a red}} kiwifruit {{cultivar}} {{with good}} size, storage ability, and colour is desirable as the genetic potential exists and it could expand the market for kiwifruit. However, red kiwifruit cultivars, including {{the subject of this}} thesis, frequently have inconsistent colour. This thesis aimed to quantify colour variation of this red cultivar and the levels at which this occurred, as well as examining environmental factors (chiefly temperature and light) that may influence colour variation. To achieve this, two harvests were collected in March to May 2014 from eight trial blocks located in five regions around New Zealand (Far North, Western Bay of Plenty, Eastern Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, and Nelson). Orchard information was collected, including within orchard temperature variation via X-Sense temperature loggers, and fruit was assessed for maturity attributes and colour using subjective and objective tests. It was found that the greatest colour variation was at the orchard and region level, though variation between vines and positions within a vine was also significant. Region was not the largest influence on colour, as out of the three regions with two orchards, two of them had both high and low colour orchards. Colour was significantly predicted by fruit firmness, estimated light <b>exposure,</b> <b>numbers</b> of leaf layers, and skin colour in a linear mixed effects model. Lower firmness related to higher colour, as did paler, less exposed fruit with a higher number of leaf layers. The effects of light and leafiness may have been mediated by temperature, as carbohydrate supply seemed to be a less important factor for colour. Temperature was not formally identified as a significant factor; however, a relationship between flesh colour and temperature was implied by light exposure data and by scatterplots. These relationships may have implications for canopy management of this variety. Further investigation of the relationship between light exposure, fruit temperature, and colour may be helpful for determining appropriate management practices for this variety. Additionally, further work on temperature may provide a basis for predicting the colour expected in a given season...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the general developments in road safety in The Netherlands, with a special focus on the year 1997. During 1997, {{for the first time since}} 1991, the number of road deaths decreased slightly. This positive development did not apply to the numbers of in-patients. There is, in any case, no reason for optimism. The ever-increasing exposure means that there can be no relaxation if the goal for the year 2000 is to be achieved; i. e. 25 % less victims than in 1985. Furthermore, the Netherlands would seem to be losing its position in the leading group of the safest countries in Europe; previously it was doing well. However, during the last few years the Netherlands has been slipping behind the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Norway. These countries continue to achieve a decreasing risk per kilometre travelled. This is the main conclusion of this report. It contains a detailed analysis of the registered victims and their risks up to and including 1997. It also discusses explanatory factors such as population, <b>exposure,</b> <b>numbers</b> of vehicles, etc. The nature of road safety is also treated with in this report. In this, victim numbers and exposure data are examined for the important categories of road users; such as the various age-groups and modes of transport. It is well known that mopedists have an extremely high risk; not only as in-patient, but their death rate has, during the last few years, also become the highest. The most numerous moped users, the 15 - 17 year olds, also have the highest risk of all road users by age group. The 18 - 24 year olds and the over- 65 s also have a high risk. The first group mainly because of the inexperienced car drivers, and the second group because of their greater bodily vulnerability. The specific problem areas are dealt with separately. The influence of alcohol on driving is still a considerable worry; it is mainly a problem among young, male car drivers. The 18 - 24 year old car drivers do not drink as much as middle-aged men, but, in spite of this, their involvement in alcohol-related accidents is extremely great. Moreover, their share in the number of offenders of the drinking limit increased during 1997. Extra attention is being paid to road shoulder accidents in which the vehicle left the road. With its share of 30 % of all road deaths, it is of considerable importance. The most common types of road shoulder accidents are as follows: on state roads, collisions with constructions; on provincial and municipal roads, crashes against trees. This year, three subjects receive special attention: motorcyclists, young car drivers, and international comparisons. The number of motorcyclist victims has increased considerably during the last ten years. This is mainly the result of the increase in motorcyclists; their risk (per kilometre travelled) has not increased. The number of young car driver deaths has decreased considerably. This can be explained by the decrease in the number of young people and their lower car ownership per head. Compared with other countries, things have not been going well in the Netherlands the last few years. Whereas we used to be one of the safest countries, we have been losing ground since 1985. Being safe does, however, not mean that there is no more room for improvements; the risks (per kilometre) in the leading group of safest countries continues to decrease. This challenges the Netherlands to lift its road safety to a higher level. This is to ensure that the Netherlands can remain one of the safest countries in Europe, and not lose contact with the leading group...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{response}} studies (BRSs) aim {{to enhance}} {{our understanding of}} the behavior changes made by animals in response to specific exposure levels of different stimuli, often presented in an increasing dosage. Here, we focus on BRSs that aim to understand behavioral responses of free-ranging whales and dolphins to manmade acoustic signals (although the methods are applicable more generally). One desired outcome of these studies is dose-response functions relevant to different species, signals and contexts. We adapted and applied recurrent event survival analysis (Cox proportional hazard models) to data from the 3 S BRS project, where multiple behavioral responses of different severities had been observed per experimental exposure and per individual based upon expert scoring. We included species, signal type, <b>exposure</b> <b>number</b> and behavioral state prior to exposure as potential covariates. The best model included all main effect terms, with the exception of <b>exposure</b> <b>number,</b> as well as two interaction terms. The interactions between signal and behavioral state, and between species and behavioral state highlighted that the sensitivity of animals to different signal types (a 6 – 7 kHz upsweep sonar signal [MFAS] or a 1 – 2 kHz upsweep sonar signal [LFAS]) depended on their behavioral state (feeding or nonfeeding), and this differed across species. Of the three species included in this analysis (sperm whale [Physeter macrocephalus], killer whale [Orcinus orca] and long-finned pilot whale [Globicephala melas]), killer whales were consistently the most likely to exhibit behavioral responses to naval sonar exposure. We conclude that recurrent event survival analysis provides an effective framework for fitting dose-response severity functions to data from behavioral response studies. It can provide outputs that can help government and industry to evaluate the potential impacts of anthropogenic sound production in the ocean. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

The ABR threshold was elevated immediately after noise exposure, but recovered over time; 14 days after noise exposure,the ABR threshold was approximately 15 dB higher than before exposure.

40|$|Evidence for adverse {{human health}} effects from cyanotoxins derives from three {{principal}} sources: epidemiological evidence including human poisonings, animal poisonings, and toxicological studies. Epidemiological evidence results {{from studies of}} human populations that have shown symptoms of poisoning or injury attributed {{to the presence of}} cyanotoxins in drinking water or other sources of water. This type of evidence depends upon good case definition, good characterisation of exposure and a reporting system that enables these data to be compared. Such evidence, discussed later, includes the fatal intoxication by microcystin of 50 dialysis patients in Brazil, and the hospitalisation of 140 children supplied with water from a dam containing Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in Australia. Reports of gastro-enteritis after the appearance of cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water sources come from North and South America, Africa and Europe. Most cases of human injury attributed to cyanobacterial toxins have been studied retrospectively, and complete epidemiological data, especially regarding <b>exposure</b> (<b>number</b> of organisms, type and concentration of cyanotoxins), are rarely available. Nevertheless...|$|R
50|$|By this point, Allin's performances, {{which often}} {{resulted}} in considerable damage to venues and sound equipment, were regularly stopped {{after only a}} few songs by police or venue owners. Allin was charged with assault and battery or indecent <b>exposure</b> a <b>number</b> of times. His constant touring was only stopped by jail time or by long hospital stays for broken bones, blood poisoning, and other physical trauma.|$|R
40|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{the case in}} PRA applications that reported plant-specific failure data are, in fact, only estimates which are uncertain. Even for detailed plant-specific data, the reported <b>exposure</b> time or <b>number</b> of demands is often only {{an estimate of the}} actual <b>exposure</b> time or <b>number</b> of demands. Likewise the reported number of failure events or incidents {{is sometimes}} also uncertain because incident or malfunction reports may be ambiguous. In this report we determine the corresponding uncertainty in core damage frequency which can b attributed to such uncertainties in plant-specific data using a simple but typical nuclear power reactor example...|$|R
30|$|Methods: Three {{experimental}} mouse {{groups were}} formed: PBS[*]+[*]IgG (IgG instillation after PBS exposure), LPS[*]+[*]IgG (IgG instillation after LPS exposure), and LPS+ EphA 2 mAb (EphA 2 monoclonal antibody instillation posttreatment after LPS <b>exposure).</b> Cell <b>numbers</b> and protein {{concentration in the}} bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), changes in histopathology and the expression of several signaling pathway proteins—including PI 3 K-Akt-NF-kB, Src, Erk, E-cadherin and mTOR—were compared among the three groups.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of acute {{chlorpyrifos}} intoxication on the erythrocytes resistance to acid hemolysis and certain hematological parameters (number of erythrocytes, leucocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and trombocytes, hemoglobin content, hematocrit, trombocrit, and platelet indices). Acute exposure to 50 mg/kg CPF leads to {{a decrease in the}} resistance of main erythrocytes pool to acid hemolysis at 15 minutes after <b>exposure.</b> The <b>number</b> of leucocytes increased by 21, 9...|$|R
40|$|Laser welding of {{dissimilar}} materials classes has vast {{potential in}} a variety of applications due to the non-contact nature of the process. This study investigates the effects of CO 2 laser process parameters on the characteristics of spot welded joint between ceramic and thermoplastic. Using a full-factorial design an experimental investigation is carried out studying the effect of welding parameters (laser <b>exposure,</b> <b>number</b> of spots, stand-off distance) on the tensile strength and the diameter of spot weld. The study reveals an increase of joint tensile strength with {{the increase in the number}} of spots and the duration of exposure. However at low laser power, the effect of stand-off distance on the spot weld diameter is found to be inconclusive. Optimal process parameters are estimated using the multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA). The analysis shows that the higher number of spots and the longest duration of laser exposure result in optimal weld characteristics. Alongside these conditions, a larger stand-off distance is seen to have beneficial impact on the weld characteristics...|$|R
