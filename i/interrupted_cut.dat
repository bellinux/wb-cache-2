50|$|In {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools a process called , or <b>interrupted</b> <b>cut</b> drilling, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when {{the depth of the}} hole is three times greater than the drill diameter). Peck drilling involves plunging the drill part way through the workpiece, no more than five times the diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called high speed peck drilling or chip breaking, only retracts the drill slightly. This process is faster, but is only used in moderately long holes, otherwise it will overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break the chips.|$|E

5000|$|The coastal path, {{south of}} the village of Otterton on the {{peninsula}} of Otter Sandstone, has many viewpoints and headlands from which the cliffs can be seen. However, there is no safe access to the seaward shore {{on any of the}} stretch between the southern tip near Danger Point to Ladram Bay in the north. The vertical cliffs are not <b>interrupted</b> (<b>cut)</b> by streams valleys, hence the lack of shore-access. To study the coast accurately a boat is required. It is possible to travel along the shore {{from the mouth of the}} Otter river to Ladram Bay near Otterton at very low tides but the beach is mostly covered with massive boulders of fallen sandstone, many very slippery because the more ferruginous nature of the rocks encourage algal growth. The embayments mean that there is always a risk of being cut off between headlands by even a slight rise in local sea level or weather conditions such as a wind blowing on shore. The most critical point is at Danger Point itself - hence its helpfully descriptive name! There are four other headlands which make the this 4km (3 mile) scramble continuously anxiety-provoking. However, the danger means the littoral ecology of the whole stretch is virtually untouched and very close to what can be inferred to be 'natural'. This includes impressively numerous gastropod populations with some unusually large specimens on show - (Patella spp & Littorina spp) and some red algae(such as Gigartina & Corallina [...] ) which are fairly rare elsewhere on the south coast.

40|$|AbstractFiber-metal {{compound}} {{materials are}} characterized by excellent mechanical properties and enable innovative and new designs, which are increasingly used e. g. in the aircraft industry. Boreholes for riveting and bolts or fasteners are required to join the initially separated material layers. Due to the considerably different machining properties of fiber reinforced plastics and metallic materials the drilling process of compound stacks is a very challenging task. High cutting temperatures and insufficient chip extraction lead to damages and disturbances of the surface integrity especially in the anisotropic and inhomogeneous CFRP layer. In the present study, low frequency assisted vibration drilling was applied for a CFRP/Ti 6 Al 4 V [10 / 10 mm] material stack. The axial oscillations cause an <b>interrupted</b> <b>cut,</b> which leads to small chip segments in the metallic material (Ti 6 Al 4 V). It {{was found that the}} distinctive mechanical damage of the CFRP borehole surface could be significantly reduced due to the improved extraction of the small chip segments.

Consequently thermal damage of the matrix material was not found when applying low frequency assisted vibration drilling...|$|E

40|$|Compliance can {{be defined}} as the {{measurement}} of displacement per unit of force applied e. g. nano-meters per Newton (m/N). Compliance is the reciprocal of stiffness. High stiffness means low compliance and visa versa. It {{is an important factor in}} machine tool characteristics because it reflects the ability of the machine axis to maintain a desired position as it encounters a force or torque. Static compliance is a measurement made with a constant force applied e. g. the average depth of cut. Dynamic compliance is a measurement made as a function of frequency, e. g. a fast too servo (FTS) that applies a varying cutting force or load, <b>interrupted</b> <b>cuts</b> and external disturbances such as ground vibrations or air conditioning induced forces on the machine. Compliance {{can be defined}} for both a linear and rotary axis of a machine tool. However, to properly define compliance for a rotary axis, the axis must allow a commanded angular position.

40|$|AbstractMost of the {{existing}} mechanistic (semiempirical) models for turning are orientated towards continuous cut and are applicable neither to non-axisymmetric parts, nor to the particular case of interrupted turning, so common in real workpieces. Some commercial software packages which simulate machining process by FEM enable to calculate <b>interrupted</b> <b>cut.</b> However, their high computational cost limits the simulations to a very short length of cut, hardly completing one cutting revolution. By contrast, mechanistic models are not as computationally expensive as FEM ones. Despite their limited accuracy, they give approximate estimations of cutting forces during a whole tool path. Consequently, they are extremely useful to detect critical tool path steps, adapt cutting parameters and avoid machine overload. This study presents a mechanistic model to predict orthogonal turning forces in 3 directions (XYZ), torque and power consumption along the machining path of non-axisymmetric parts. The model communicates with CAM software by automatically transferring information about tool path and geometry from the CAM to the mechanistic model in standard format, contained in CL (Cutter Location) and STL (Stereolithography) files, respectively. Thus, the model is suitable to be integrated into any commercial CAM software. The simplicity of the model, the communication with CAM and an easy-to-use interface aim to spread out {{the applicability of the}} model among machining companies. The results of the study are validated by comparing simulations to experimental turning tests...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrilling of fiber-metal {{compound}} {{materials is}} one of the most challenging machining operations. Besides frequently occurring damages of the borehole surface tool wear is a major concern when drilling compound stacks. The significantly divergent cutting conditions of fiber reinforced plastics and metallic alloys require compromises in the tool geometry as well as the cutting materials and coatings. Excessive cutting edge rounding due to the brittle and abrasive fibers leads to increasing cutting forces and temperatures in the metallic alloy. This usually results in a catastrophic failure of the tools. In the present study low frequency vibration assisted drilling (LFVAD) of CFRP/Ti 6 Al 4 V [10 / 10 mm] was investigated in terms of tool wear and compared to conventional drilling. Solid carbide drills with a diameter of 4. 8 mm and different CVD and PVD coatings have been tested. The flank wear as well as the adhesions at the cutting edges have found to be significantly lower when using LFVAD. The tool life could be increased by more than 300 % compared to conventional drilling. This is based on considerably lower process temperatures and an improvement of the process stability which could be proved by cutting force measurements. Additionally the chip extraction was found to be more efficient due to the generation of small chip segments which is a consequence of the <b>interrupted</b> <b>cut.</b> Best results in terms of tool wear and borehole quality have been achieved with an AlCrN coating...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of thermal and {{mechanical}} shocks, which rising during operation, mostly at <b>interrupted</b> <b>cut.</b> Here will be solved their impact on the cutting edge tool life, the impact of coating technology on resistance to shocks and experimental determination of tool life in heating flame. Resistance of removable cutting edges against thermal and mechanical shock is an important indicator of quality as well as its abrasion resistance. Breach of the edge or its crumble may occur due to cyclic loading. We can observe it not only during the interrupted cutting (milling, turning areas abandoned hole or slot), but also in continuous cutting. This is due to the volatility of cutting force on cutting. Frequency of the volatility in this case depends on the type of rising chips (chip size element). For difficult-to-machine materials such as austenitic steel particularly happened at higher cutting speeds for the localization of plastic deformation in the shear plane and for the inception of separate elements substantially continuous chips. This leads to variations of cutting forces substantially greater than for other types of steel. During the uninterrupted cutting the cutting edge is cyclically loaded due to period oscillation of the cutting force main component. The frequency is given by the character of shaving element size [1]. Experiments have shown that during cutting of hard to machine materials with higher cutting speeds, for example austenitic steel, plastic deformation occurs in the shearing plane, in which the elements of continuous shaving are removed. This leads to large variations in the cutting force in these types of steels under the given cutting conditions. The amplitude of the main cutting force component in comparison with a different type of steel is shown on the fig. 1 to illustrate characteristics of a fatigue failure, abrasive wear and cutting edge crumbling away...|$|E
40|$|Milling {{is one of}} {{the basic}} methods of {{machining}} where material is removed <b>interrupted</b> <b>cut.</b> A characteristic feature of this operation is that the removed material hasn´t a constant section, the chip thickness is observed. It is a variable. Therefore, medium chip thickness hm was determined. The experiment was realized by climb milling where the chip during the machining of a lot to say. Uncoated cutting tool was made of speed steel and the cutting speed was changed at three levels. The entire experiment was concentrated at monitoring the formation and shaping of chip at low speeds, as part of other experiments to be carried out at lower speeds. Three kinds of materials were machined, where the machinability has been evaluated {{on the basis of the}} chip shaping and it was compared with machinability according to the content of chemical elements in the material. From Groups of chips produced in the milling of the materials were selected representative samples, which were noted of the radius of these chips at 50 times magnification. The inaccuracy of this method mustn´t is forgotten, because the chip thickness is not constant and there is some distortion. At the selecting the reference material was assumed that material STN 12 050 is optimal machinability and was chosen as the reference material. All three materials as well cultivated by the shape of chips were appeared at cutting speed 4 m. min- 1. When gradually increasing the cutting speed changes occurred first and STN 14 220 material exhibited better machinability than material STN 17 241. Machinability according of chip shaping was also confirmed by machinability content of chemical elements in the material. According to the carbon content could be said that the STN 14 220 has better machinability, but the chromium content makes the material tougher and so makes worse its kinetic and dynamic machinability. Corrosion resistant steel STN 17 241 has the largest chromium content, it is tough, therefore kinetically and dynamically machinability is worse than previous materials. If the goal was to get a good surface quality material STN 17 241 would be in the first place thanks to the highest manganese content. Machining was recorded using high-speed camera Phantom. For the record it was observed the chip formation and their removal from the cutting zone. Chips were twisted into the radius but in machining stainless steel by higher cutting speeds were recorded the highest values of the chip radius of curvature. Observed of chip formation is more widespread in turning than milling operations. However, it is important to follow the features of various technological operations, because each is different and brings a deeper understanding of patterns of technological processes.

40|$|Cutting of chilled {{cast iron}} and {{hardened}} steel affords cutting materials with high hardness and wear resistance, even at high temperatures, {{as well as a}} superior strength in the cutting edge range. Actual cutting tool materials do not meet these requirements sufficiently, especially in <b>interrupted</b> <b>cuts.</b> CBN-materials can be used in some of these applications; since they are no economical alternative there is an urgent need for materials development in this area. The aim of the project was to develop a new generation of cutting tool materials upon the basis of the actual Alumina-Titaniumcarbonitride ceramic-composites which meet the defined necessities. In the same time it was necessary to develop the grinding process for hard machining the extremely wear resistant ceramic itself within the required precision. Extremely fine-grained microstructures in the alumina-titaniumcarbonitride composites yielded a remarkable increase of the mechanical properties. The transformation of these mechanical properties into application properties has been proven by a lot of application tests in the lab and in field-tests. The investigation of the influence of additional hard materials (Cr_ 3 C_ 2, TiB_ 2, Sc_ 2 CO) revealed that the grain size (extremely fine:< 0, 4 #mu#m) improves the properties more than any change in chemical composition.
