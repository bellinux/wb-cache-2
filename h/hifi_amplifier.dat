5000|$|The {{broadcasting}} station that became UKC Radio had {{its origins in}} the autumn term of 1967 as an audio feed through the radiator system. This was inspired by {{an article in the}} magazine Practical Wireless entitled ‘Communications through the Ground’. The article explained how an audio signal injected into two separate earthing points could be detected by connecting an amplifier to two more earthing points nearby. Budding electronics students decided to test this out in Eliot College by connecting the loudspeaker output of a <b>HiFi</b> <b>amplifier</b> between the mains earth and the central heating radiator system. The signal could be heard loud and clear in study bedrooms throughout the college by connecting a modified transistor radio, used as an audio amplifier, between the radiator and the metal table lamp, which provided a connection to the mains earth.|$|E

5000|$|A huge {{issue is}} that {{measurements}} of objective nature (for example, those indicating magnitude of scientifically quantifiable variables such as current, voltage, power, THD, dB, and so on) fail to address subjective preferences. Especially in case of designing or reviewing instrument amplifiers this is a considerable issue because design goals of such differ widely from design goals of likes of <b>HiFi</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> <b>HiFi</b> design largely concentrates on improving performance of objectively measurable variables. Instrument amplifier design largely concentrates on subjective issues, such as [...] "pleasantness" [...] of certain type of tone. Fine examples are cases of distortion or frequency response: HiFi design tries to minimize distortion and focuses on eliminating [...] "offensive" [...] harmonics. It also aims for ideally flat response. Musical instrument amplifier design deliberately introduces distortion and great non-linearities in frequency response. Former [...] "offensiveness" [...] of certain types of harmonics becomes a highly subjective topic, along with preferences towards certain types of frequency responses (whether flat or un-flat).|$|R

30|$|To {{switch the}} {{magnetizing}} coil, a mini amplifier of signals was assembled {{based on the}} TDA 2030 a chip (18  W <b>HiFi</b> power <b>amplifier</b> class AB). This amplifier provides high output current, has small harmonic and intermodulation distortions, wide bandwidth of the amplified signal, low level of intrinsic noise, the built-in protection against the output short circuit, automatic system to limit dissipated power, which holds the working point of the output transistors in the safe area. The built-in thermal protection element switches off the chip when the crystal is heated above 145  °C. The chip is produced in the Pentawatt package and has five pins.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum tubes {{were the}} {{dominant}} active electronic components in bass amplifiers manufactured from the 1950s {{until the early}} 1970s, and tubes continue {{to be used in}} the 2010s for expensive bass combo amplifiers, amp heads, and preamplifiers (as well, tube amps continue to be used by audiophiles for expensive home <b>hifi</b> systems). Tube <b>amplifiers</b> for bass almost always use class AB1 topology for efficiency reasons.|$|R
50|$|The Onix Audio/Onix <b>Hifi</b> and Onix <b>Amplifiers</b> were {{characterized}} by a minimalistic, simple, slim design, without visible screws on the casings. The amplifiers housed unusually large power supplies and were constructed using high quality components. Onix cases were always made from aluminium. They used a powder coat finish in matt black, and the front was originally in the same finish with a screen print word ONIX. In 1987, Onix changed the finish of most products to a brushed anodized finish, as well as making subtle cosmetic and electronic changes to the overall original design as the years passed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the development of}} W Band amplifiers for the Local Oscillator (LO) chains for the Herschel HIFI (Heterodyne Instrument for Far Infrared) Instrument. Key amplifier development issues and their solutions are presented, which have been applied {{on the way to}} realizing stable, wide-band amplifiers capable of producing 240 mW or greater RF power output across the 71 to 106 GHz frequency range. The <b>HIFI</b> power <b>amplifier</b> design embodiment is based on an A- 40 silicon-aluminum alloy package with six GaAs(Gal 1 ium Arsenide) HEMT(High Electron Mobility Transistors) MMIC(Mono 1 ithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) amplifier chps used in each amplifier. Development challenges addressed include: MMIC chip designs which initially had a variety of oscillation or “moding” propensities (mostly out-of-band), signal splitter and combiner development and matching across the band, matching of chip characteristics for those chips installed in the parallel power combined arms of the amplifier, power output control and leveling. device, component and material selection for amplifier operation at cryogenic temperatures. Room temperature and cryogenic (120 Kelvin) data is also shown for the amplifier...|$|R
