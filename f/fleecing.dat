As replacement sheep are {{selected on the basis of}} hogget <b>fleece</b> weights which do not include the maximum wool growth period data were analysed to determine whether hogget <b>fleece</b> weights were correlated with adult <b>fleece</b> production. Three years <b>fleece</b> weight data from a small Coopworth stud flock was examined to determine the correlation between <b>fleece</b> production, over an 8 month period, from December to July, in ewe hoggets, compared with adult yearly <b>fleece</b> production in pregnant two tooth ewes. For one age group the two tooth and four tooth <b>fleece</b> performances were compared. Eight month <b>fleece</b> weights were not a good indicator of adult performance (t=O. 27) whereas two tooth <b>fleece</b> weight grown over a full year correlated significantly (r=O. 86) with four tooth <b>fleeces</b> grown over the same period.

40|$|Gravid {{females of}} Lucilia cuprina (Wiedeman) in a {{laboratory}} cage orientated positively to samples of <b>fleece.</b> Newly-wetted <b>fleece</b> was significantly more attractive than dry <b>fleece,</b> an effect resulting from the action {{of water on the}} <b>fleece</b> and not just addition of water vapour to the volatile <b>fleece</b> kairomones. <b>Fleece</b> contaminated with serous exudate, resulting from myiasis by L. cuprina, was much more attractive than wet, uncontaminated <b>fleece</b> from the same sheep. Kairomones from wetted <b>fleece</b> consistently augmented the attractive effects of 2 -mercaptoethanol and indole in separate experiments, and of hydrogen sulphide (released from saturated aqueous sodium sulphide solution) in one trial out of three, but not overall. It is suggested that volatile <b>fleece</b> kairomones play a part in eliciting orientation to sheep by gravid L. cuprina. <b>Fleece</b> kairomones may augment the efficacy of kairomones released by putrefactive conditions in the <b>fleece,</b> which are known to predispose sheep to fly strike.

2500|$|By June 6, 1902, Masterson was in New York City, where [...] {{two other}} men and he were arrested on a bunco charge. Masterson and his companions were accused of <b>fleecing</b> George H.

[...] No sooner had these charges against Masterson been dropped than on June 15, 1902, he was arrested again for carrying a concealed weapon. Fortunately for him, an invaluable friend, Alfred Henry Lewis (1855–1914), turned up at this point. Lewis got his brother, William Eugene Lewis (1861–1924), to provide Masterson with employment as a columnist on William's newspaper, the New York Morning Telegraph. His column, [...] "Masterson's Views on Timely Topics," [...] concerned sports in general and boxing in particular. The column appeared three times a week from 1903 until his death in 1921.

If, on this basis, the sheep with the <b>fleece</b> that appeared most dense were selected for breeding, selection would be away from the longer <b>fleece.</b> Any method {{that can be used to}} measure accurately the density of the <b>fleece</b> will be very useful in inheritance and wool production studies...|$|R

40|$|Variation between {{animals in}} clean <b>fleece</b> weight {{at the same}} fibre {{diameter}} {{can be attributed to}} a number of skin and follicle factors. The aim of this project was to determine what contributions various skin and follicle attributes make to variation in clean <b>fleece</b> weight. Two groups of ten sheep were selected from the CSIRO Finewool flock at the extremes of estimated breeding values for clean <b>fleece</b> weight and mean fibre diameter (high clean <b>fleece</b> weight and low fibre diameter, low clean <b>fleece</b> weight and low fibre diameter) and the differences between the groups {{in a wide range of}} skin and follicle attributes were determined. The associa-tions between the skin and follicle attributes with clean <b>fleece</b> weight and fibre diameter were also calculated. There were significant associations of follicle density, S/P ratio, dp/ds ratio, follicle branching and follicle shutdown on clean <b>fleece</b> weight. The correlations between staple length and clean <b>fleece</b> weight (0. 50) were of similar magnitude to the correlations between clean <b>fleece</b> weight and follicle density (0. 37 to 0. 48), follicle branching (0. 50), S/P ratio (0. 28) and dp/ds ratio (0. 40).
