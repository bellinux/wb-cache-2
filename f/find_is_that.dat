25|$|A {{very large}} number of fossils have now been {{discovered}} and identified. These fossils serve as a chronological record of evolution. The fossil record provides examples of transitional species that demonstrate ancestral links between past and present life forms. One such transitional fossil is Archaeopteryx, an ancient organism that had the distinct characteristics of a reptile (such as a long, bony tail and conical teeth) yet also had characteristics of birds (such as feathers and a wishbone). The implication from such a <b>find</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> modern reptiles and birds arose from a common ancestor.|$|E
25|$|Netzer {{discovered}} the Roman Theatre {{just before his}} death in late 2010. A loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This means that when Herod or other notable officials went to see a play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 650 people. What is quite unique about this <b>find</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> frescoes of landscapes were discovered. This suggests that the painters were well traveled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome.|$|E

A team led by Danny Hunter (David Oyelowo) attempts to bug his home, only to find it impossible because of the home's high-tech countersurveillance equipment. What MI5 does <b>find</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Osbourne abuses his wife Claire (Debra Stephenson); believing Claire is vulnerable for recruitment, Section D start [...] "Operation Greensleeves" [...] and tasks a [...] "runner" [...] to befriend her before recruiting. However, vetting did not {{pick up on the}} runner's alcoholism after she becomes involved in a road traffic accident while inebriated. Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) appoints Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) and junior administrative officer Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner) to step in and pose as a married couple who are substitute tutors at the same Romford community college Claire is attending.|$|E

The style is very plain and simple; and the only fault I <b>find</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the author, after the manner of travellers, is a little too circumstantial. There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoken it.|$|E

60|$|I placed {{before you}} in a few words, some little time ago, a {{statement}} of the sum and substance of Milton's hypothesis. Let me now try to state as briefly, the effect of the circumstantial evidence bearing upon the past history of the earth which is furnished, without the possibility of mistake, with no chance of error as to its chief features, by the stratified rocks. What we <b>find</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the great series of formations represents a period of time of which our human chronologies hardly afford us a unit of measure. I will not pretend to say how we ought to estimate this time, in millions or in billions of years. For my purpose, the determination of its absolute duration is wholly unessential. But that the time was enormous there can be no question.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Johnson, more {{fortunate}} in his contempt of the labours of Macpherson {{than those of}} his modest friend, was solicited not long after to furnish Prefaces biographical and critical for the works {{of some of the}} most eminent English Poets. The booksellers took upon themselves to make the collection; they referred probably to the most popular miscellanies, and, unquestionably, to their books of accounts; and decided upon the claim of authors to be admitted into a body of the most eminent, from the familiarity of their names with the readers of that day, and by the profits, which, from the sale of his works, each had brought and was bringing to the Trade. The Editor was allowed a limited exercise of discretion, and the Authors whom he recommended are scarcely to be mentioned without a smile. We open the volume of Prefatory Lives, and to our astonishment the first name we <b>find</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Cowley!--What is become of the morning-star of English Poetry? Where is the bright Elizabethan constellation? Or, if names be more acceptable than images, where is the ever-to-be-honoured Chaucer? Where is Spenser? where Sidney? and, lastly, where he, whose rights as a poet, contradistinguished from those which he is universally allowed to possess as a dramatist, we have vindicated,--where Shakspeare?--These, and a multitude of others not unworthy to be placed near them, their contemporaries and successors, we have not. But in their stead, we have (could better be expected when precedence was to be settled by an abstract of reputation at any given period made, as in this case before us?) Roscommon, and Stepney, and Phillips, and Walsh, and Smith, and Duke, and King, and Spratt--Halifax, Granville, Sheffield, Congreve, Broome, and other reputed Magnates--metrical writers utterly worthless and useless, except for occasions like the present, when their productions are referred to as evidence what a small quantity of brain is necessary to procure a considerable stock of admiration, provided the aspirant will accommodate himself to the likings and fashions of his day.|$|E
60|$|There {{are other}} {{circumstances}} in these accounts highly auxiliary to this evidence. The lac {{and a half}} was not only attested by Rajah Gourdas, by the Begum, by Chittendur, by the Begum again upon Mr. Hastings's own question, indirectly admitted by Mr. Hastings, proved by the orders {{for it to be}} written off to expense, (such a body of proof as perhaps never existed,) but there is one proof still remaining, namely, a paper, which was produced before the Committee, and which we shall produce to your Lordships. It is an authentic paper, delivered in favor of Mr. Hastings by Major Scott, who acted at that time as Mr. Hastings's agent, to a committee of the House of Commons, and authenticated to come from Munny Begum herself. All this body of evidence we mean to produce; and we shall prove, first, that he received the two lacs,--and, secondly, that he received one lac and a half under the name of entertainment. With regard to the lac and a half, Mr. Hastings is so far from controverting it, even indirectly, that he is obliged to establish it by testimonies produced by himself, in order to sink in that, if he can, the two lacs, which he thinks he is not able to justify, but which he fears will be proved against him. The lac and a half, I do believe, he will not be advised to contest; but whether he is or no, we shall load him with it, we shall prove it beyond all doubt. But there are other circumstances further auxiliary in this business, which, from the very attempts to conceal it, prove beyond doubt the fraudulent and wicked nature of the transaction. In the account given by the Begum, a lac, which is for Mr. Hastings's entertainment, is entered in a suspicious neighborhood; for there is there entered a lac of rupees paid for the subahdarry sunnuds to the Mogul through the Rajah Shitab Roy. Upon looking into the account, and comparing it with another paper produced, the first thing we <b>find</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> this woman charges the sum paid to be a sum due; and then she charges this one lac to have been paid when the Mogul was {{in the hands of the}} Mahrattas, when all communication with him was stopped, and when Rajah Shitab Roy, who is supposed to have paid it, was under confinement in the hands of Mr. Hastings. Thus she endeavors to conceal the lac of rupees paid to Mr. Hastings.|$|E

The research aims {{to find out the}} accounting treatment on the government fixed asset acquirementand disposalin Regency Sukoharjo corresponding to the Government Accounting Standard and to find out the accounting application on the government fixed asset acquirementand disposalin Regency Sukoharjo corresponding to the Government Accounting Standard. From the result of research, the writer finds the compatibility and discrepancy between the application of Regency Sukoharjo’s fixed asset and the Government Accounting Standard. The strength the writer <b>finds</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the government’s fixed asset acquirement has been assessed with historical cost. Meanwhile the weakness the writer <b>finds</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> up to 2007, the Regency Sukoharjo’s fixed asset had not been depreciated because its recording system still uses the cash basis, in addition, many government fixed asset are excluded from the balance such as cultural/historical asset because they are difficult to be recognized due to their very high value. And the 2006 / 2007 balance still uses the single entry of fixed asset recording system...|$|R
