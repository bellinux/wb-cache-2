5|$|The {{series is}} set in a world with an {{alternate}} history, where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the amount of magicians in existence. Following the Third World War, the world's superpowers shifted to these four nations: The United States of North America (USNA), New Soviet Union, the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the ten master clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited amount of magicians, they are treated as commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{teaching}} {{had described}} the mesocolon as a fragmented structure {{with all the}} named parts—the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid mesocolons, mesoappendix, and mesorectum as separately terminating their insertion into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, following detailed microscopic and electron microscopic examinations, the mesocolon was {{shown to be a}} single, continuous structure that commenced from the duodenojejunal flexure and extended {{to the level of the}} distal mesorectum. This simpler concept has enabled substantial advances to be made <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of surgery on the colon and rectum.

Even though Hispanics now heavily populate the area that was once predominantly black, such transition has improved over time. The building of a stronger and more understanding community could help to prevent social chaos arising between the two groups. Hate crimes and widespread violence between the two groups continue to be a problem in the L.A. area, however.|$|E

25|$|Sulfatide {{can also}} be found in the kidney. Although {{sulfatide}} is not necessary for the kidneys to maintain their function and structure, it does play an active role <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of the kidney. For example, sulfatide is a ligand for L-selectin, which is a receptor that {{can be found in the}} kidneys. Specifically, L-selectin is a lymphoid receptor, and the binding between L-selectin and sulfatide in the kidney’s interstitium plays a major role in monocyte permeation and infiltration into the kidney. Additionally, sulfatide is also found in the glandular stomach epithelium and in the apical membranes of the distal kidney tubuli where Myelin and lymphocyte protein(MAL) is expressed. MAL forms complexes with sulfatide and other glycosphingolipids, and these complexes have been shown to play a role in apical sorting and stabilization of sphingoglycolipid enriched areas.|$|E
25|$|Patriarchal {{values are}} deeply {{embedded}} in the society of Pakistan, and its different manifestations are observed <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of the society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This {{has led to a}} low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's human capital, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of patriarchy by women themselves, becomes the basis for gender discrimination and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job-market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E

[...] This was also based on the producers themselves, who despite being good friends, often argue while producing the series.|$|E
500|$|Predator-prey {{interactions}} are an introductory concept into food-web studies {{as well as}} behavioural ecology. Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators, such as avoid, flee, or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ {{in the degree of}} danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency. For example, [...] "he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk" [...] or [...] "he optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Christian critics {{wrote that}} Avatar has [...] "an {{abhorrent}} New Age, pagan, anti-capitalist worldview that promotes goddess worship {{and the destruction}} of the human race" [...] and suggested that Christian viewers interpret the film as a reminder of Jesus Christ as [...] "the True Avatar". Some of them also suspected Avatar of subversive retelling of the biblical Exodus, by which Cameron [...] "invites us to look at the Bible from the side of Canaanites." [...] Conversely, other commentators concluded that the film promotes theism or panentheism rather than pantheism, arguing that the hero [...] "does not pray to a tree, but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally" [...] and, unlike in pantheism, [...] "the film's deity does indeed—contrary to the native wisdom of the Na'vi—interfere in human affairs." [...] Ann Marlowe of Forbes agreed, saying that [...] "though Avatar has been charged with [...] "pantheism", its mythos is just as deeply Christian." [...] Another author suggested that the film's message [...] "leads to a renewed reverence for the natural world—a very Christian teaching." [...] Saritha Prabhu, an Indian-born columnist for The Tennessean, saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism: [...] "What pantheism is, at least, to me: a silent, spiritual awe when looking (as Einstein said) at the 'beauty and sublimity of the universe', and seeing the divine manifested <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> of nature. [...] What pantheism isn't: a touchy-feely, kumbaya vibe as is often depicted. [...] No wonder many Americans are turned off." [...] Prabhu also criticized Hollywood and Western media for what she saw as their generally poor job of portraying Eastern spirituality.|$|E

60|$|The present {{was such}} an {{occasion}} to little Ailie Dunning. She had indeed seen bloody work before, in the cutting-up of a whale. But although she had been told it often enough, she did not realise that whales have feelings and affections like other creatures. Besides, she had not witnessed the actual killing of the whale; and if she had, it would probably have made little impression on her beyond that of temporary excitement--not even that, perhaps, had her father been by her side. But she sympathised with the gazelle. It was small, and beautiful, and lovable. Her heart had swelled the moment she saw it, and she had felt a longing desire to run up to it and throw her arms round its soft neck, so that, when she saw it suddenly struggling and crushed in the tremendous jaws of the horrible crocodile, every tender feeling in her breast was lacerated; every fibre of her heart trembled with a conflicting gush of the tenderest pity and the fiercest rage. From that day forward new thoughts began to occupy her mind, and old ideas presented themselves <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>aspects.</b>|$|E
