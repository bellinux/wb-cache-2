25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., <b>diuron),</b> and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|E

Water samples were taken at various sites and depths around Ma’alaea Harbor before, during, and after a period of heavy rainfall. The runoff samples taken after the rainfall had concentrations of <b>Diuron</b> exceeding 3 parts per billion, a concentration proven lethal to corals by a previous Australian study. Because the study was relatively brief, lasting about three months, the results could not cite <b>Diuron</b> as an absolute cause for coral depletion in Ma’alaea Harbor.|$|E

5000|$|Photosystem II inhibitors reduce {{electron}} flow from water to NADP+ at the photochemical step in photosynthesis. They bind to the Qb {{site on the}} D1 protein, and prevent quinone from binding to this site. Therefore, this group of compounds causes electrons to accumulate on chlorophyll molecules. As a consequence, oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, and the plant dies. The triazine herbicides (including atrazine) and urea derivatives (<b>diuron)</b> are photosystem II inhibitors.|$|E

50|$|Bromacil (40%) is {{combined}} with the active ingredient <b>diuron</b> in the herbicide Krovar, which is used by companies such as the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT).

The half-life of bromacil in soils is about 60 days, but as long as 8 months in some conditions. Bromacil is available in granular, liquid, water-soluble liquid, and wettable powder formulations. Because bromacil is a possible human carcinogen and systemic toxicity may result from intermediate exposure (one week to several months), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessed risk to workers using several major exposure scenarios. Bromacil is stable to hydrolysis under normal environmental conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ornamental}} {{flower of}} the Oxalis glabra {{has made it}} a desirable addition to gardens, however it is often classified as a weed. Due to its underground growth process the Oxalis is difficult to eradicate. A single bulb can propagate into many independent plants and yield many more bulbils. The small size of the bulbs make them hard to detect and easy to spread. The plant grows in a dense carpet and can choke out indigenous species; if introduced to a disturbed community Oxalis glabra will prevent native plants from repopulating the community. Destroying the shoots of the plant are ineffective as well as hand digging because bulbs easily break free and remain in soil. Glyphosate, <b>diuron</b> and sulfonyl urea herbicides are most effective in eradication; herbicides should be applied at first sight of flowering because at this stage the bulbs will be exhausted.|$|E
50|$|The land {{development}} {{that results from}} maintaining large plots of sugarcane fields, {{as well as the}} use of herbicides like <b>Diuron</b> in those fields, could be contributing to the degradation of coral reefs around Maui. On the island of Ishigaki, located in Japan’s Okinawa Prefecture, scientists from Hokkaido University and Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies examined the effects of {{land development}}, specifically the presence of sugarcane fields, on the health of the island’s coral. In a study that spanned over three years, the researchers took coral samples during both the warmer summer months and rainy winter months, and measured the levels of calcification. The tendency for the corals to calcify was indicative of their overall health. The study concluded the coral samples taken around Ishigaki were more vulnerable to coral calcification in the winter than the summer, possibly {{as a result of the}} coral’s exposure to mineral runoff from the sugarcane fields.|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} about the selectivity of herbicides in physic nut (Jatropha curcas) in Brazil. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of different doses and mixtures of paraquat and <b>diuron</b> in direted-spray applications in physic nut plants in greenhouse conditions. The study used a randomized block design, with five replicates. The treatments were: paraquat (200 and 600 g ha- 1), <b>diuron</b> (1, 000 and 2, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + <b>diuron</b> (200 + 1, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + <b>diuron</b> (200 + 2, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + <b>diuron</b> (600 + 1, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + <b>diuron</b> (600 + 2, 000 g ha- 1) and a control (no application).

The treatments of <b>diuron</b> and paraquat + <b>diuron</b> mixtures affected the growth and photosynthetic activity of physic nut plants, injuries being more pronounced at doses of <b>diuron</b> of 2, 000 g ha&# 8209; 1, while the isolated application of paraquat at doses of 200 and 600 g ha- 1 showed good selectivity potential for physic nut plants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDiuron {{has a high}} {{leachability}} with GUS {{value of}} 4. 1 and a very long residence time in the soil. A novel use of date seeds for <b>diuron</b> adsorption and preconcentration from water is reported. Upon heating at 400 °C, the date seeds exhibited a good adsorption and preconcentration of <b>diuron</b> from water, the adsorption capacity is 2. 0 mg/g at 25 °C and pH 7. Using principal component analysis PCA, the adsorption of <b>diuron</b> is correlated to the experimental factors as: 				Kd(distribution value) = 0. 01 (Mass) − 0. 11 (pH) + 0. 61 (Conc.) + 0. 24 (Agt Time) + 0. 49 (Temp.) The preconcentration recovery of <b>diuron</b> is also correlated to the experimental factors as: 				%Recovery= 0. 09 (Samp. vol.) + 1. 76 (Mass) − 4. 23 (pH) + 8. 06 (Eluent vol.) The PCA revealed that initial concentration and temperature are the most significant factors for <b>diuron</b> adsorption. However, pH and eluent volume are the most significant factors for <b>diuron</b> preconcentration. <b>Diuron</b> adsorption is an endothermic process with ΔH value of 8. 0 kJ/mol. The shape of <b>diuron</b> isotherm is “C 1 ” type, which is often reported.

40|$|Effects of {{short-term}} exposure to sedimentation and <b>diuron,</b> separately and in combination, on the photophysiology and survival of crustose coralline algae (CCA) {{were examined in}} controlled time-course experiments, using pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) chlorophyll fluorometry.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{herbicide}} <b>diuron</b> on sugarcane fields {{along the}} river catchments of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia {{is an issue of}} concern due to high levels of <b>diuron</b> reported in the GBR lagoon, and has recently led to a restriction on the use of <b>diuron</b> during the 2011 / 12 wet season. An important question in this context is how much <b>diuron</b> is mobilised from the agricultural area by strong rainfall and floods in the wet season and transferred to the GBR lagoon. We have set up a multimedia chemical fate model for a tropical catchment to describe the fate of <b>diuron</b> within the Tully River catchment, Queensland, Australia. The model includes highly variable rainfall based on meteorological data from the Tully River catchment and a flood water compartment on top of the agricultural soil that is present during times for which floods were reported. The model is driven by <b>diuron</b> application data estimated for the Tully River catchment and is solved for time-dependent <b>diuron</b> concentrations in agricultural soil and seawater. Model results show that on average 25 % of the <b>diuron</b> applied every year is transferred to the GBR lagoon with rainwater and flood water runoff. <b>Diuron</b> concentrations estimated for the seawater range from 0. 1 ng/L to 12 ng/L and are in good agreement with concentrations measured in the GBR lagoon. The uncertainty of the <b>diuron</b> concentrations estimated for seawater is approximately a factor of two and mainly derives from uncertainty in the <b>diuron</b> degradation half-life in soil, properties of the soil compartment such as organic matter content, and the speed of the seawater current removing <b>diuron</b> dissolved in seawater from the seawater compartment of the model.

40|$|An {{experimental}} plot {{has been established}} on a calcareous soil in southern England to investigate the fate and transport of <b>diuron</b> (N'-[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]-NN-dimethylurea), a commonly used phenylurea herbicide. An agricultural grade of <b>diuron</b> {{was applied to the}} soil surface at a rate of 6. 7 kg/ha along with a potassium bromide conservative tracer applied at 200 kg/ha, in early January, 2001. Hand augured samples were taken at regular intervals over the next 50 days, with samples collected down to 54 cm. Porewaters were extracted from the soil cores by using high speed centrifugation and the supernatant fluids were retained for analysis by HPLC, for <b>diuron</b> and three of its metabolites, N'-[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]-N,N-methylurea (DCPMU), N'- 3, 4 -dichlorophenylurea (DCPU) and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA). The centrifuged soil was retained and then extracted with methanol prior to HPLC analysis for the same suite of phenylureas. A mass balance approach showed large variations in <b>diuron</b> distribution, but on average accounted for 104 % of the <b>diuron</b> applied. Concentrations of <b>diuron</b> and its metabolites were roughly five times higher in the soil than in the soil porewaters. After 50 days, metabolites comprised 10 % of the total <b>diuron</b> present in the porewater and 20 % of the total <b>diuron</b> sorbed to the soil matrix. After 36 days, a large pulse of <b>diuron</b> and DCPMU appeared in the porewaters and soil matrix at a depth of 54 cm, travelling an average of 0. 15 cm/day faster than Br. A preferential route for <b>diuron</b> transport is suggested. There is evidence to suggest that degradation occurs at depth {{as well as at the}} soil surface. Metabolites generally appear to move more slowly than the parent compound. All metabolites were encountered, but interpreting transport and degradation processes simultaneously proved beyond the scope of the study. <b>Diuron</b> was detected once in a shallow (5 m) observation well, situated on the {{experimental plot}}.

40|$|The <b>diuron</b> is an {{herbicide}} used on autumn-winter crops, due to {{its ability}} to block the chloroplast electron chain at level of photosystem II. Furthermore, <b>diuron</b> can also exert toxic effects on heterotrophic beings, blocking the respiratory chain and ROS generating. Despite the progressive suppression of <b>diuron</b> application by Directive 200 / 60 /CE, groundwater contamination will still persist. Therefore {{the main purpose of}} this work was to evaluate the effect of this phenylurea on S. cerevisiae at proliferative phase. The results show a significant decrease of GSH/GSSG ratio, in cells exposed to 50 mM <b>diuron.</b> Although GR activity does not changes significantly in any assay of this study, it was observed a significantly decrease of G 6 PD and GPx enzyme activities, in cells grown in 50 and 75 mM <b>diuron.</b> The decline of NADPH availability probably blocks the glutathione cycle, generating oxidative stress. In addition, the CAT T activity presents also a significant increase in cells grown in 50 mM <b>diuron,</b> as well as an increase of cytoplasm ROS, MDA level and CAT A activity in cultures with 50 and 75 mM <b>diuron,</b> that suggests a key role of peroxisomal lipid oxidation in <b>diuron</b> response which cause cell death by an active process...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurposeSurface runoff {{and erosion}} are major drivers of {{pesticide}} transport from soils to rivers draining vineyard watersheds. A recent {{study showed that}} applications of <b>diuron</b> on vineyards and <b>diuron</b> dispersal could lead to microbial adaptation to <b>diuron</b> biodegradation from treated soils to the receiving hydrosystem. Given the limited knowledge on microbial adaptation to pesticide degradation in aquatic environments, we conducted a microcosm study designed {{to assess the impact}} of runoff and erosion processes on the adaptation of riverine-sediment microbial communities to <b>diuron</b> mineralization. Materials and methodsThe experimental laboratory set-up consisted in aquariums filled with natural riverine sediments and water and supplemented or not in triplicate (a) with <b>diuron</b> to simulate surface water runoff and (b) with diuron-treated vineyard soil to simulate erosion following a strong rainfall event. The resulting effects were estimated by assessing and comparing (a) the fate of <b>diuron</b> and <b>diuron</b> partitioning between sediment and water phases, (b) the evolution of sediment-based bacterial community density and community structure, and (c) the evolution of <b>diuron</b> mineralization potential in sediment samples. Results and discussionDiuron dissipated rapidly in all the microcosms, with half-life values varying between 1 and 3 weeks. The treated soil (and then soil microbiota) or dissolved <b>diuron</b> inputs to microcosms had no significant effect on sediment bacterial density and community structure. After 2 to 4 weeks, both contamination procedures led to a significant increase in sediment <b>diuron</b> mineralization potential. Despite the lack of effects on sediment bacterial density and community structure, both <b>diuron</b> runoff and/or diuron-contaminated soil erosion led to sediment community adaptation to <b>diuron</b> mineralization. This confirmed that chronic exposure to <b>diuron</b> may lead riverine sediment communities to adapt to the degradation of this herbicide. The shorter initial lag-phase in mineralization kinetics observed in microcosms treated with diuron-contaminated soil suggests transfer of degradative potential from soil to sediment. ConclusionsOur observations confirmed evidence of a high <b>diuron</b> biodegradation potential by benthic microbial communities in chronically exposed watersheds and highlighted that inter-linkages between soil and sediments may also modify biological functions that regulate aquatic ecosystems. Microbial communities adapted to pesticide biodegradation are likely to play a key environmental role in reducing pesticide exposure in contaminated ecosystems. To assess this self-purifying function, further research is needed to improve the estimation of real in-field pesticide biodegradation kinetics and processes in both soil and aquatic ecosystems without overlooking the inter-compartments linkages that can occur...|$|E

40|$|<b>Diuron</b> is a {{herbicide}} {{commonly used}} in agricultural areas where excess application causes it to leach into rivers, reach sensitive marine environments like the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon and pose risks to marine life. To investigate the impact of <b>diuron</b> on whole prokaryotic communities that underpin the marine food web and are integral to coral reef health, GBR lagoon water was incubated with <b>diuron</b> at environmentally-relevant concentration (8 µg/L), and sequenced at specific time points over the following year. 16 S rRNA gene amplicon profiling revealed no significant short- or long-term effect of <b>diuron</b> on microbiome structure. The relative abundance of prokaryotic phototrophs was not significantly altered by <b>diuron,</b> which suggests that they were largely tolerant at this concentration. Assembly of a metagenome derived from waters sampled at a similar location in the GBR lagoon did not reveal the presence of mutations in the cyanobacterial photosystem that could explain <b>diuron</b> tolerance. However, resident phages displayed several variants of this gene and could potentially {{play a role in}} tolerance acquisition. Slow biodegradation of <b>diuron</b> was reported in the incubation flasks, but no correlation with the relative abundance of heterotrophs was evident. Analysis of metagenomic reads supports the hypothesis that previously uncharacterized hydrolases carried by low-abundance species may mediate herbicide degradation in the GBR lagoon. Overall, this study offers evidence that pelagic phototrophs of the GBR lagoon may be more tolerant of <b>diuron</b> than other tropical organisms, and that heterotrophs in the microbial seed bank may have the potential to degrade <b>diuron</b> and alleviate local anthropogenic stresses to inshore GBR ecosystems...|$|E

The samples were collected in a field experiment conducted in randomized design blocks consisted of 2 base fertilization levels (0 and 400 kg&# 8729;ha&# 8722; 1 NPK 00 - 20 - 20 fertilizer formula) and 3 doses of biochar (0, 8 and 16 Mg&# 8729;ha&# 8722; 1). In the evaluation of sorption and desorption, Batch Equilibrium method was used. The kinetics of sorption and desorption of <b>diuron,</b> total organic carbon, fulvic acid, humic acid and humin, pH and partition coefficient to organic carbon were evaluated. The Freundlich isotherm was adjusted appropriately to describe <b>diuron</b> sorption kinetics in all the studied treatments. The application of biochar provided increment in the sorption (Kf) and reduction in the desorption of <b>diuron</b> in 64 and 44 %, respectively. This effect is attributed to the biochar contribution to the total organic carbon and C-humin and of these to <b>diuron</b> through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The positive correlation between the partition coefficient to organic carbon and Kf confirms the importance of soil organic compartment in the sorption of <b>diuron.</b> There was no competition of NPK fertilizer for the same sorption site of <b>diuron.</b> The increase and reduction in sorption and desorption, respectively, show that the application of biochar is an important alternative for the remediation of soil leaching of <b>diuron,</b> especially in sandy soils...|$|E

After seven days, no differences {{in the incidence of}} histological urothelial lesions or labeling indices were detected among the groups; however, the incidence of urothelial lesions after 15 weeks was significantly increased in the animals fed <b>diuron</b> or NaS. After seven days or 15 weeks, the severity of urothelial alterations was significantly higher in animals fed with <b>diuron.</b> Both fixative and drying methods allowed for the identification of prenecrotic swollen superficial cells in the urothelium after seven days exposure to 2500 ppm <b>diuron.</b> Our results confirmed that the presence of prenecrotic swollen cells in the urothelium is an early key event due to <b>diuron</b> cytotoxicity and is not an artifact related to the processing methods use...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the removal and adsorption of <b>diuron</b> through a 200 Da nanofiltration (NF) membrane. The effects of ionic environment (0. 002, 0. 02 and 0. 2 M of NaCl, CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O and MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O solutions), and operating pressure (5 and 25 bar), on the removal and adsorption of <b>diuron,</b> were investigated. There was a gradual increase in the removal efficiency with an increase in ionic strength. However, a better removal performance of NF membrane was achieved with the presence of intermediate ionic strength (0. 02 M of NaCl). The presence of the highest ionic strength did not exhibit the highest removal efficiency for <b>diuron.</b> Moreover, ionic strength had a much more significant influence on the removal of <b>diuron</b> at a lower operating pressure (5 bar). The adsorption results indicated that there was a shielding effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of <b>diuron,</b> which was stronger at 5 bar. In contrast, the removal of <b>diuron</b> decreased significantly as the concentration of divalent cations increased at 25 bar. The experimental results also showed that the size exclusion mechanism seemed to be significant with the presence of electrolyte for the removal of <b>diuron</b> through the NF membrane...|$|E
40|$|The white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was {{investigated}} for {{its capacity to}} degrade the herbicide <b>diuron</b> in liquid stationary cultures. The presence of <b>diuron</b> increased the production of lignin peroxidase in relation to control cultures but only barely affected the production of manganese peroxidase. The herbicide at the concentration of 7 [*]μg/mL did not cause any reduction in the biomass production {{and it was almost}} completely removed after 10 days. Concomitantly with the removal of <b>diuron,</b> two metabolites, DCPMU [1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 3 -methylurea] and DCPU [(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) urea], were detected in the culture medium at the concentrations of 0. 74 [*]μg/mL and 0. 06 [*]μg/mL, respectively. Crude extracellular ligninolytic enzymes were not efficient in the in vitro degradation of <b>diuron.</b> In addition, 1 -aminobenzotriazole (ABT), a cytochrome P 450 inhibitor, significantly inhibited both <b>diuron</b> degradation and metabolites production. Significant reduction in the toxicity evaluated by the Lactuca sativa L. bioassay was observed in the cultures after 10 days of cultivation. In conclusion, P. chrysosporium can efficiently metabolize <b>diuron</b> without the accumulation of toxic products...|$|E

40|$|Results on <b>diuron</b> {{mineralisation}} and adsorption-desorption on a soil artificially contaminated (50 mg kg- 1), {{to which}} two different composted organic amendments (sewage sludge mixed with pruning remains, LDD, and domestic wastes, RSU), an inorganic amendment (micronutrients) and a hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) solution were applied, were obtained. Treatments were investigated at different amendment concentrations. From initial studies, the incapability of the endogenous soil microorganisms to mineralise <b>diuron</b> was confirmed. However, after the inorganic amendment was applied, {{with the aim}} of supplying essential nutrients for soil flora activation, a 5 % of <b>diuron</b> mineralisation was reached after 150 days, concluding that the soil has a potential capacity to mineralise the herbicide through biostimulation-assisted natural attenuation. <b>Diuron</b> mineralisation was improved using a HPBCD solution at a very low concentration of only 10 times the <b>diuron</b> equimolar concentration in soil. This molecule is able to form <b>diuron</b> inclusion complexes, which provokes an increasing in its hydrosolubility, and hence, in the amount of the herbicide in the soil solution. With this strategy, a higher amount of <b>diuron</b> molecules will be more bioaccesible for the soil microorganisms. After HPBCD application mineralisation rate was increased 27 times regarding to the inorganic amendment application, and the extent of herbicide mineralisation reached a 31 %. Organic amendments from different origins were also applied on the contaminated soil at different concentrations (0. 5, 2 and 4 % w/soil dw). In general, as increasing amendment concentration <b>diuron</b> mineralisation rate was improved, regarding to the inorganic amendment application. 33 % of the herbicide was mineralised after RSU amendment was applied at 4 % w/soil dw. Finally, the joint application of the three amendments investigated and at the best conditions tested was conducted in order to obtain the best <b>diuron</b> mineralisation results. In this case, the inorganic amendment plus RSU amendment at 4 % w/soil dw plus HPBCD solution provoked an extent of <b>diuron</b> mineralisation of 54, 30 %Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The phenylurea {{herbicide}} <b>diuron</b> [N-(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -N,N-dimethylurea] {{is widely}} used in {{a broad range of}} herbicide formulations, and consequently, it is frequently detected as a major water contaminant in areas where there is extensive use. We constructed a linuron [N-(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -N-methoxy-N-methylurea]- and diuron-mineralizing two-member consortium by combining the cooperative degradation capacities of the diuron-degrading organism Arthrobacter globiformis strain D 47 and the linuron-mineralizing organism Variovorax sp. strain SRS 16. Neither of the strains mineralized <b>diuron</b> alone in a mineral medium, but combined, the two strains mineralized 31 to 62 % of the added [ring-U- 14 C]diuron to 14 CO 2, depending on the initial <b>diuron</b> concentration and the cultivation conditions. The constructed consortium was used to initiate the degradation and mineralization of <b>diuron</b> in soil without natural attenuation potential. This approach led to the unexpected finding that Variovorax sp. strain SRS 16 was able to mineralize <b>diuron</b> in a pure culture when it was supplemented with appropriate growth substrates, making this strain the first known bacterium capable of mineralizing <b>diuron</b> and representatives of both the N,N-dimethyl- and N-methoxy-N-methyl-substituted phenylurea herbicides. The ability of the coculture to mineralize microgram-per-liter levels of <b>diuron</b> was compared to the ability of strain SRS 16 alone, which revealed the greater extent of mineralization by the two-member consortium (31 to 33 % of the added [ring-U- 14 C]diuron was mineralized to 14 CO 2 when 15. 5 to 38. 9 μg liter− 1 <b>diuron</b> was used). These results suggest that the consortium consisting of strains SRS 16 and D 47 could be a promising candidate for remediation of soil and water contaminated with <b>diuron</b> and linuron and their shared metabolite 3, 4 -dichloroaniline...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} behaviour of metolachlor and <b>diuron</b> was {{studied in the}} Central-western region of Brazil, {{by means of a}} field study where six experimental plots were installed. The soil was classified as a Latosol, and the soil horizons were characterized. Sorption of metolachlor and <b>diuron</b> was evaluated in laboratory batch experiments. Metolachlor and <b>diuron</b> were applied to the experimental plots on uncultivated soil in October 2003. From this date to March 2004, the following processes were studied: leaching, runoff and dissipation in top soil. K oc of metolachlor varied from 179 to 264 mL g- 1 in the soil horizons. K oc of <b>diuron</b> in the Ap horizon was 917 mL g- 1, decreasing significantly in the deeper horizons. Field dissipation half-lives of metolachlor and <b>diuron</b> were 18 and 15 days, respectively. In percolated water, metolachlor was detected in concentrations ranging from 0. 02 to 2. 84 ?g L- 1. In runoff water and sediment, metolachlor was detected in decreasing concentrations throughout the period of study. Losses of 0. 02 % and 0. 54 % of the applied amount by leaching and runoff, respectively, were observed confirming the high mobility of this herbicide in the environment. In percolated water, <b>diuron</b> was detected with low frequency but in relatively high concentrations (up to 6. 29 ?g L- 1). In runoff water and soil, <b>diuron</b> was detected in decreasing concentrations until 70 days after application, totalizing 13. 9 % during the whole sampling period. These results show the importance of practices to reduce runoff avoiding surface water contamination by these pesticides, particularly <b>diuron.</b> 200...|$|E
