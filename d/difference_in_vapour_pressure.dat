A series of pyrolytic experiments was car-ried out with different combinations of electroplated materials in an atmosphere of gaseous HCI. The HCI was produced by pyrolyzing scrap polyvinyl chloride.

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} (MD) is {{an emerging}} technology for desalination. Membrane distillation differs from other membrane technologies {{in that the}} driving force for desalination is the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of water across the membrane, rather than total pressure. The membranes for MD are hydrophobic, which allows water vapour (but not liquid water) to pass. The vapour pressure gradient is created by heating the source water, thereby elevating its vapour pressure. The major energy requirement is for low-grade thermal energy. It is expected that the total costs for drinking water with membrane distillation will be lower than $ 0. 50 /m 3, even as low as $ 0. 26 /m 3, depending on {{the source of the}} thermal energy required for the evaporation of water through the membrane...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The Arctic springtail Megaphorura arctica (Tullberg, 1876) {{employs a}} {{strategy}} known as cryoprotective dehydra-tion to survive winter temperatures as low as- 25 °C. During cryoprotective dehydration, water is lost from the animal to ice in its surroundings {{as a result}} of the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> between the animal’s supercooled body fluids and ice (Worland et al., 1998; Holmstrup and Somme, 1998). This mechanism ensures that as the habitat temperature falls, the concentration of solutes remains high enough to prevent freezing (Holmstrup et al., 2002). In M. arctica, accumulation of trehalose, a cryo/anhydro protectant, occurs in parallel with dehydration. Recent studies have identified a number of genes and cellular processes involved in cryoprotective dehydration in M. arctica (Clark et al., 2007; Clark et al., 2009; Purać et al., 2011). One of them includes late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. This study, together with that of Bahrndorff et al.

SPH- 280) was grown on a Vertisol at ICRISAT Centre either unirrigated throughout growth or irrigated for 7 weeks after emergence and rainfed thereafter. Before sowing, ammonium sulphate was applied at six rates from 0 to 150 kg/ha N. Roots were sampled every 2 weeks to determine biomass and root length density {{as a function}} of depth. Every week, soil water content in all treatments was measured gravimetrically to a depth of 0. 23 m and with a neutron probe from 0. 3 to 1. 5 m. Below 0. 45 m, volumetric water content was a negative exponential function of time after roots arrived and the maximum depth of extraction moved downwards at 2 - 5 cm per day. In the dry treatment,the extraction ''front'' lagged behind the deepest roots by c. 12 days initially but the two fronts eventually converged. Irrigation delayed the descent of the extraction front by c. 20 days but thereafter it appeared to descend faster than without irrigation. Averaged over N rates, the time constant of the exponential function was inversely related to the root length density, l sub(v), decreasing with depth from about 20 to 10 days as l sub(v) increased from 2. 5 to 4. 0 km/m sup(3). The biomass:water ratio was almost independent of N but increased from a mean of 5. 3 g dry matter per kg water in the dry treatments to 6. 9 g/kg with irrigation.

40|$|Purpose: Major {{problems}} with smelting of light titanium-based alloys {{are related to}} their strong reactivity in the liquid phase with virtually all melting pot materials. Another problem regarding titanium alloy smelting is an unfavourable process of alloy component evaporation due to high melting temperatures of the alloys and significant <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of their individual components. In the present paper, results of a study on manganese evaporation from the OT 4 alloy are presented. Design/methodology/approach: The OT 4 alloy contained 94. 29, 3. 50 and 1. 49 %mass of Ti, Al and Mn, respectively. The experiments were performed at 5 to 1000 Pa for 1973 K and 2023 K. During each smelting experiment, metal samples were collected and analysed for titanium, aluminium and manganese contents. Findings: During inductive OT 4 alloy smelting from the Ti-Al-Mn system at reduced pressure, significant manganese losses from the alloy are observed as a result manganese evaporation. For manganese and titanium, the evaporation coefficient ΩMn/Ti values were within 12421 – 42899, while for manganese and aluminium (ΩMn/Al), they were within 34 to 52, suggesting that, thermodynamically, {{there is a potential}} for intense manganese evaporation from the investigated alloy. Research limitations/implications: The study findings may be a basis for a full kinetic analysis of Mn evaporation from the OT 4 alloy which enables determination of process-controlling stages. Practical implications: The study results regarding changes in manganese content in the OT 4 alloy during its smelting with the use of VIM technology suggest that one of conditions that may limit the unfavourable process of manganese evaporation is shortening the smelting time or performing the process at about 1000 Pa.

The sample container and the circuit are in stainless steel. The decomposition was estimated by a parameter based on the mean value of <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the sub-atmospheric <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> at selected temperatures. The increase of the <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> resulting from even a small thermal decomposition (more noticeable at sub-atmospheric pressures) is an important indicator as it may anyway have great effects on the engine in which the fluid works.

As to the three hydrocarbons considered, the cyclo-pentane results thermally very stable: at 350 °C, after eighty hours, the rate of decomposition is about twenty times lower than the corresponding value for n-pentane. The toluene sample remains remarkably stable at higher temperatures, confirming its potential application in the so-called high temperature Rankine cycles: at 400 °C the rate of decomposition is the same of that of n-pentane at 315 °C and of that of cyclo-pentane at 375 °C...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{with which}} water is delivered through leaf tissue to sites of evaporation (the leaf hydraulic conductance) {{is an important}} determinant of photosynthetic capacity. This is because inadequate water supply forces stomata to close due to plant desiccation. The resulting reduction in stomatal conductance restricts carbon dioxide (CO 2) uptake. An oversupply of water, on the other hand, results in unprofitable investment in vascular tissue. Accordingly, water supply is strongly correlated with the demand for water generated by stomata. Recent work suggests that this balance is achieved in a tropical angiosperm tree by a simple developmental mechanism in which changes to leaf size co-regulate vein and stomatal density (major determinants of water supply and demand, respectively). However, the generality of this mechanism is unknown. Thus, in this thesis I set out to establish {{whether there is a}} general developmental mechanism that allows plants to maintain a constant ratio between leaf vein and stomatal density. In doing so the following specific research questions were investigated: 1. Does acclimation to high and low VPD (vapour pressure difference) modify the relationships between vein density, stomatal density and leaf size? (Chapter 2) 2. Does leaf or epidermal cell expansion coordinate vein and stomatal density in herbs and woody angiosperms? (Chapter 3) 3. Does epidermal cell expansion coordinate vein and stomatal density in older plant lineages like ferns? (Chapter 4) 4. Is vein density directly regulated by epidermal cell expansion? (Chapter 5) The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> between leaf tissue and the atmosphere determines how much water is transpired at any given stomatal conductance. Thus, I hypothesised in Chapter 2 that plants grown under high VPD would exhibit a modified relationship between vein and stomatal density resulting in maintenance of homeostasis in leaf water potential such that there is either a decrease in stomatal density and no change in vein density, or no change in stomatal density and an increase in vein density. This would also disrupt previously observed relationships with leaf size. However, contrary to my hypothesis, I found a small but coordinated increase in vein and stomatal density in plants grown under high VPD compared with those grown under low VPD. Furthermore, densities of veins and stomata were independent of large VPD-induced changes to leaf size and were instead limited by epidermal cell size (which was fairly insensitive to VPD). This suggests that significant modification of epidermal cell size is required to produce large changes in vein and stomatal density. Thus, to further investigate whether leaf expansion or epidermal cell expansion coordinates vein and stomatal density more generally among plants I examined relationships between vein density, stomatal density, leaf size and epidermal cell size across a diverse range of woody and herbaceous angiosperms grown under sun and shade conditions (Chapter 3). Contrary to the original premise that differential leaf expansion coordinates vein and stomatal density, I found that leaf size was independent of epidermal cell size in most cases and that relationships between vein density, stomatal density and epidermal cell size were well described by modelled relationships that assume veins and stomata are passively ‘diluted’ by epidermal cell expansion. These results demonstrate that coordination of vein and stomatal density in angiosperms is driven by their co-variation with epidermal cell size. While this ‘passive dilution’ mechanism seems to be common among angiosperms, it is not known when it appeared in the vascular plant phylogeny. Furthermore, older plant lineages like ferns may employ different mechanisms to coordinate vein and stomatal density because they differ from angiosperms in both current water relations physiology and evolutionary history. Contrary to this expectation, I found that relationships between vein density, stomatal density and epidermal cell size across four ferns species were very similar to those previously observed across angiosperm species (Chapter 4). However, there was little plasticity in these traits within fern species and changes to stomatal density across species were actively regulated by stomatal index, as well as epidermal cell size. Despite this, epidermal cell size was a strong determinant of vein and stomatal density in ferns (explaining 55. 5...|$|E

In Experiment (Expt) I, six peanut genotypes with wide genetic variation for the specific leaf area (SLA) were used. In Expt II, three non-nodulating isogenic lines were used to study the effect of N levels on leaf chlorophyll concentration–TE relationship without potential confounding effects in biological nitrogen fixation. Leaf N was manipulated by applying N fertiliser in Expt II. Chlorophyll concentration, TE (g dry matter kg− 1 of H 2 O transpired, measured using gravimetric method), specific leaf nitrogen (g N m− 2, SLN), SLA (cm 2 g− 1), carbon isotope composition (Δ 13 C) were determined in the leaves sampled during the treatment period (35 – 55 days after sowing) in the two experiments. Results showed that the leaf chlorophyll concentration expressed as soil plant analytical development (SPAD) chlorophyll metre reading (SCMR) varied significantly among genotypes in Expt I {{and as a result}} of N application in Expt II. Changes in leaf N levels were strongly associated with changes in SCMR, TE and Δ 13 C. In both the experiments, a significant positive relationship between SCMR and TE with similar slopes but differing intercepts was noticed. However, correction of TE for seasonal <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> deficit (VPD) between the two experiments resulted in a single and stronger relationship between SCMR and TE. There was a significant inverse relationship between SCMR and Δ 13 C, suggesting a close linkage between chlorophyll concentration and Δ 13 C in peanut.

40|$|An indica variety Takanari {{is known}} as one of the most {{productive}} rice varieties in Japan and consistently produces 20 – 30 % heavier dry matter during ripening than Japanese commercial varieties in the field. The higher rate of photosynthesis of individual leaves during ripening has been recognized in Takanari. By using pot-grown plants under conditions of minimal mutual shading, it was confirmed that the higher rate of leaf photosynthesis is responsible for the higher dry matter production after heading in Takanari as compared with a japonica variety, Koshihikari. The rate of leaf photosynthesis and shoot dry weight became larger in Takanari after the panicle formation and heading stages, respectively, than in Koshihikari. Roots grew rapidly in the panicle formation stage until heading in Takanari compared with Koshihikari. The higher rate of leaf photosynthesis in Takanari resulted not only from the higher content of leaf nitrogen, which was caused by its elevated capacity for nitrogen accumulation, but also from higher stomatal conductance. When measured under light-saturated conditions, stomatal conductance was already decreased due to the reduction in leaf water potential in Koshihikari even under conditions of a relatively small <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> leaf–air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>difference.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the higher stomatal conductance was supported by the maintenance of higher leaf water potential through the higher hydraulic conductance in Takanari with the larger area of root surface.

Rainforest {{is considered to}} be a climax vegetation, capable of regenerating in the absence of a major disturbance event, such as fire. Rainforest is also considered to be a fire sensitive community, as many rainforest species are incapable of surviving a fire event.

These fire events are likely to increase with future climate change, which may result in a substantial loss of rainforest communities. It is important to understand the conditions under which fire will sustain and spread within rainforest as this will aid in protective measures, such as hazard-reduction burning, and the allocation of resources during a wildfire. In this study, I ask, under what conditions it would be likely that a fire would sustain and spread within rainforest.

Further research into the yields and speciation leading to this reaction product is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Water vapour {{sorption}} isotherms of casein micelles prepared from {{raw milk}} and various heat-treated milks were determined. The equilibrium water {{contents of the}} heated preparations were markedly {{lower than that of}} the raw-milk casein over the whole range of <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> studied. An analysis of the sorption isotherms <b>in</b> the relative <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> range 0 · 1 - 0. 45, according to the Brunauer, Emmett & Teller (1938) equation, showed that there were significant <b>differences</b> between preparations <b>in</b> the computed monolayer contents. <b>Differences</b> <b>in</b> the rates of water sorption were also observed between the different preparations. As judged from the amount of absorbed water, the influence of the heating methods could be ranked in the order: HTST (92 °C) UHT (direct) <UHT (indirect) < HTST (72 °C...|$|R
40|$|The weights {{of single}} mealworms were {{continuously}} recorded at 20 °C during exposure to periods of constant humidity and to abrupt changes <b>in</b> atmospheric <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure.</b> Two exchange stages were recognized in each animal. Weight changes were either limited to slow losses, suggesting transpiration through the external cuticle, or showed more rapid humidity-dependent gains {{as well as}} losses. Rapid exchanges indicated that water was gained or lost through permeable barriers, from a fluid compartmet of significantly lower <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> than the haemolymph, equivalent to about 90 % R. H. Weight gains and losses during humidity changes provided evidence of a significant, passively exchanging fluid compartment located between the exchange surface and absorbing mechanism. Weight changes in faecal pellets following their elimination provide further support for a rectal site of atmospheric absorption...|$|R
40|$|Vapour-liquid {{equilibrium}} is {{the driving}} force behind many separation processes such as distillation. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} vapour-liquid equilibria of many mixtures can be altered when the vapour-liquid interface is modified by capillary systems. This thesis studied the effects of capillary actions due to modified vapour-liquid interfaces on the vapour composition of ethanol-water and 1 -propanol-water systems. A method was developed to measure and compare the vapour compositions of systems with a planar vapour-liquid interface and systems with capillary plates. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of interface materials, pore sizes and liquid compositions. Significant <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> composition between capillary systems and systems with a planar interface were observed. This difference was much larger than that predicted by the Kelvin equation. The mechanism of the capillary actions and the factors causing the increase <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> composition were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Information on the {{potential}} of pollen mediated gene flow (PMGF) in sorghum is required for ensuring varietal purity and to mitigate risk transgenic gene flow. Replicated trials were conducted in Kenya using a local landrace, ‘Ochuti’ as pollen donor surrounded by male-sterile pollen baits. Frequency of PMGF decreased {{with the increase of}} distance from pollen sources and was significantly influenced by wind direction and speed. Anther dehiscence correlated with increase <b>in</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> deficit <b>in</b> the morning. A negative exponential regression model with logarithmic transformation of PMGF and square-root transformation of distance from source field best fitted the data. Up to 50 % of female florets on a male sterile (MS) plant were pollinated at 1 m from pollen source and declined to 14 % at 10 m. The maximum distance of PMGF using the PMGF model, based on a threshold of one seed per MS plant, was 203 m when data above the 95 th percentile is considered. However, in the presence of self-produced pollen of male-fertile target plants, the possibility of long-distance cross-pollination may be very low.

40|$|A {{simplified}} perturbed hard-chain theory (SPHCT) {{equation of}} state is used to predict the vapour-liquid equilibria of 69 one-component fluids including n-alkanes, n-alkenes, n-alkynes, n-alkanols, polyatomic polar molecules and noble gases. A procedure is reported for obtaining the {{equation of state}} parameters from critical properties and the acentric factor. The predicted <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> are compared with experimental data {{over a wide range}} of temperature, which in many cases, extends from the triple point to the critical point of the fluid. The calculations are also compared with results obtained using the Christoforakos-Franck equation of state. It is concluded that the hard-chain theory methodology represents vapour-liquid equilibria of non-spherical molecules more accurately than hard-sphere approaches. The average absolute deviation <b>in</b> the <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> predicted by the SPHCT equation of state is typically within the range of 5 %- 15 %...|$|R
40|$|It has {{previously}} been established that H/sub 2 / emission from condensates and adsorbates on He-cooled cryopumps is enhanced by incident thermal radiation and this effect has produced anomalously high values for the H/sub 2 / saturated <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure.</b> Also it has been indicated that the effect depends on the substrate used. The subject is reviewed and additional information is given on the desorption characteristics of HD and D/sub 2 /. Studies made at CERN with three types of cryopump are discussed. The pumps had stainless steel and silver cryosurfaces and blackened baffles whose temperature determined {{the nature of the}} incident thermal radiation. The apparent rise <b>in</b> saturated <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of condensed hydrogen and its isotopes was attributed to the relase of phonons from the substrate by photons which traversed the condensate without absorption.
