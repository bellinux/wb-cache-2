The strength of ties between mobile phone users can be estimated for large numbers of users by using the aggregated call duration as a proxy <b>for</b> tie <b>strength.</b> This paper investigates appropriate proxies <b>for</b> tie <b>strength</b> in a network of less than one hundred people. We find that aggregated call duration is a reasonable proxy <b>for</b> tie <b>strength</b> <b>for</b> {{a small number of}} users, as is total call count, and that aggregated proximity duration and total proximity count are also approximate proxies <b>for</b> tie <b>strength...</b>|$|R
40|$|Kimachi {{sandstone}} and Shikotsu {{welded tuff}} {{were tested in}} single and multistage triaxial tests to determine the Biot’s effective stress coefficient (α). Pure water saturated 30 mm in diameter and length of 60 mm cylindrical test specimens were introduced for triaxial compression, with strain rate at 10 − 5 s− 1. For Kimachi sandstone, α value <b>for</b> peak <b>strength</b> decreased with effective confining pressure. α values <b>for</b> residual <b>strength</b> were almost constant and larger than the case of peak <b>strength.</b> <b>For</b> Shikotsu welded tuff, only two data points were obtained <b>for</b> peak <b>strength</b> due to pore collapse and α value <b>for</b> residual <b>strength</b> decreased with effective confining pressure. The multistage test has given a fair evaluation of the coefficient <b>for</b> peak <b>strength</b> of Kimachi snadstone. Number of specimens and variation from specimen to specimen can be reduced by using multistage tests although further considerations are required to obtain the coefficient <b>for</b> residual <b>strength.</b> 2014 ISRM European Rock Mechanics Symposium (EUROCK 2014), May 27 - 29, 2014, Vigo, Spain...|$|R
30|$|In general, we can {{say that}} IPOG-F {{presented}} the best performance compared with TTR 1.2, because IPOG-F was better <b>for</b> all <b>strengths,</b> as well as lower and medium <b>strengths.</b> <b>For</b> higher <b>strengths,</b> there was a statistical draw between both approaches. An explanation for the fact that IPOG-F is better than TTR 1.2 is that TTR 1.2 ends up making more interactions than IPOG-F. In general, we might say that efficiency of IPOG-F is better than TTR 1.2 which influenced the cost-efficiency result. However, if we look at cost in isolation <b>for</b> all <b>strengths,</b> the average value of the test suite size generated via TTR 1.2 (734.50) is better than IPOG-F (770.88).|$|R
5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and <b>for</b> <b>strength</b> only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays <b>for</b> <b>strength</b> and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E

30|$|The {{developed}} GLT model, in this study, {{predicts the}} bending strength of GLT using the tensile strength of weakest cross section. High <b>strength</b> <b>for</b> clear segment would be underestimated, but low <b>strength</b> <b>for</b> knot segment is not underestimated.

5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be <b>for</b> <b>strength,</b> but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused <b>for</b> <b>strength.</b> Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E

5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked <b>for</b> <b>strength.</b> Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E
5|$|Thelma is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The story was based on Marie Corelli's 1887 novel of the same name, it focuses on a Norwegian maiden who meets Sir Phillip and the two are wed. Lady Clara conspires to ruin the marriage and tricks Thelma with a letter purported to be from her husband. Thelma returns to Norway and {{to the death of}} her father. Thelma, alone in the world, prays at her mother's grave <b>for</b> <b>strength.</b> Sir Phillip searches for Thelma, ultimately finding her, uncovers the tricks which have been played on them and they fall back in love. Released on June 21, 1910, the film was met with praise in The Moving Picture World. An incomplete print of the film survives in the Library of Congress archives.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened <b>for</b> <b>strength.</b> On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E
