5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} <b>defacement,</b> fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the <b>defacement,</b> but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the works}} {{that make up the}} Better Out Than In series were defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one <b>defacement</b> was {{identified}} as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{the more}} elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further <b>defacement.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to Jart Armin, a researcher, many Georgian Internet servers {{were under}} {{external}} control since late 7 August 2008. On 8 August, the DDoS attacks peaked and the <b>defacements</b> began.|$|R
5000|$|Contained {{in some of}} the group’s web <b>defacements,</b> was the quote: [...] "il livello sette posidare la vostra famiglia", which loosely {{translated}} from Italian says, [...] "Level Seven owns your family".|$|R
5|$|In a 2013 {{analysis}} of over 170,000 website <b>defacements,</b> published by Zone-H, {{the most frequently}} (53%) used technique was exploitation of file inclusion vulnerability, mostly related to insecure usage of the PHP functions include, require, and allow_url_fopen.|$|R
5|$|Quiriguá {{suffered}} a hiatus from {{the turn of}} the 6th century that lasted through {{to the middle of the}} 7th century. This may be linked to the Tikal hiatus of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate <b>defacement</b> of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpredictability of}} the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while <b>defacement</b> from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The north {{transept}} contains {{three large}} murals featuring Jesus Christ: Jesus washing St. Peter's feet, the Sacred Heart, and the Pietà. The north transept also contains the tombs of two bishops. One {{is of the}} first Vicar Apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao, Bishop Georg Weig, SVD who supervised {{the construction of the}} cathedral. Bishop Weig's tombstone shows obvious signs of <b>defacement,</b> being chipped around the edges, and with broken stonework at its base. The other tomb contains part of the ashes of Bishop of Qingdao Paul Han Xirang, OFM, the rest having been buried in his hometown, Han Village, Yucheng County, Shandong Province.|$|E
50|$|Reality hacking is any {{phenomenon}} {{that emerges from}} the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially, or culturally subversive ends. These tools include website <b>defacements,</b> URL redirections, denial-of-service attacks, information theft, web-site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage.|$|R
50|$|AnonCoders is a {{group of}} {{computer}} hackers. Using denial of service attacks, database hijacking, database leaks, admin panel takeovers, and other <b>defacements,</b> the group mainly targets Israeli websites in protest of crimes allegedly committed against the Palestinian people on behalf of Israel. AnonCoders began operation in January 2015.|$|R
50|$|The Shabaka Stone, {{sometimes}} Shabaqo, is a relic incised with {{an ancient}} Egyptian religious text, which {{dates from the}} 25th dynasty. In later years, the stone was likely used as a millstone, which damaged the hieroglyphics. This damage is accompanied by other intentional <b>defacements,</b> leaving the hieroglyphics in poor condition.|$|R
25|$|In February 2009, Schäuble's {{homepage}} was hacked due to {{a security}} flaw in the TYPO3 CMS and its non-secure password gewinner ("winner"). The hack consisted of a <b>defacement</b> that placed a large, easily visible link on his front page to the homepage of the German Working Group on Data Retention.|$|E
25|$|The {{red ensign}} may {{continue}} to be flown on land in Māori areas or during Māori events under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 in recognition of long held Māori preference for red flags. New Zealand law allows the <b>defacement</b> of the flag in accordance to Māori custom in which white capital letters identifying a particular family or Māori tribe are added. In {{the case of the}} flag on the right, TAKITIMU refers to a grouping of Māori iwi descended from the crew of the Tākitimu waka (canoe).|$|E
25|$|The first {{historical}} {{record of a}} campaign of destruction of temples and <b>defacement</b> of faces or heads of Hindu idols lasted from 1193 through the early 13th century in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh {{under the command of}} Ghuri. Under the Khaljis, the campaign of temple desecration expanded to Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, and continued through the late 13th century. The campaign extended to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu under Malik Kafur and Ulugh Khan in the 14th century, and by the Bahmanis in 15th century. Orissa temples were destroyed in the 14th century under the Tughlaqs.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, A Chinese student {{posted a}} picture of {{engraved}} graffiti that read [...] "Ding Jinhao was here" [...] (...) in Chinese on a sculpture. This discovery spurred debate about increased tourism after the media confirmed a Chinese student caused this and other <b>defacements.</b> The engraving has since been partially cleared.|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{civil disobedience}} can include web site <b>defacements,</b> redirects, denial-of-service attacks, {{information}} theft and data leaks, illegal web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage. It {{is distinct from}} other kinds of hacktivism in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity. Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets, but they often generate significant media attention.|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the group were {{responsible}} for over a hundred website <b>defacements,</b> trafficking stolen personal and financial information and illegally accessing numerous teleconferences over which they co-ordinated their efforts. A few of the systems they broke into include those of United States Army, the White House, United States Cellular, Ameritech and the US Postal Service.|$|R
25|$|From the outset, {{they adopted}} the {{philosophy}} espoused by esoteric novel series The Illuminatus! Trilogy, gaining notoriety for various anarchic situationist manifestations, including the <b>defacement</b> of billboard adverts, the posting of prominent cryptic advertisements in NME {{magazine and the}} mainstream press, and highly distinctive and unusual performances on Top of the Pops. Their most notorious performance was a collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror (and Barney Greenaway of Napalm Death) at the February 1992 BRIT Awards, where they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance announced the KLF's departure from the music business, and in May 1992 the duo deleted their entire back catalogue.|$|E
500|$|The cathedral {{was badly}} damaged during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1971. During this time St. Michael's Cathedral was defaced by the Red Guards. The crosses topping the twin {{steeples}} were removed by the Red Guards, {{with two men}} falling to their deaths during the removal. An account of the cathedral's <b>defacement</b> is translated as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Work stopped {{during the}} English Civil War, {{and there was}} much <b>defacement</b> and mistreatment of the {{building}} by Parliamentarian forces during which old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed, and the nave used as a stable for cavalry horses. Much of the detailed information historians have of the cathedral is taken from William Dugdale's 1658 History of St Pauls Cathedral, written hastily during The Protectorate for fear that [...] "one of the most eminent Structures of that kinde in the Christian World" [...] might be destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|Some people {{describing}} {{themselves as}} hacktivists {{have taken to}} defacing websites for political reasons, such as attacking and defacing government websites as well as web sites of groups who oppose their ideology. Others, such as Oxblood Ruffin (the [...] "foreign affairs minister" [...] of Cult of the Dead Cow and Hacktivismo), have argued forcefully against definitions of hacktivism that include web <b>defacements</b> or denial-of-service attacks.|$|R
25|$|The Arsenal's main gate, the Porta Magna, {{was built}} around 1460 {{and was the}} first Classical revival {{structure}} built in Venice. It was perhaps built by Antonio Gambello from a design by Jacopo Bellini. Two lions taken from Greece situated beside it were added in 1687. One of the lions, known as the Piraeus Lion, has runic <b>defacements</b> carved in it by invading Scandinavian mercenaries during the 11th century.|$|R
50|$|MLT is the {{pseudonym}} of {{a former}} grey hat computer hacker and member of TeaMp0isoN. MLT was arrested in May 2012 in relation to his activities within TeaMp0isoN, a computer hacking group which claimed responsibility for many high profile attacks including website <b>defacements</b> of the United Nations, Facebook, NATO, BlackBerry, T-Mobile USA and several other large sites in addition to high-profile denial of service attacks and leaks of confidential data.|$|R
500|$|American Life is Madonna's {{second album}} {{to bear a}} [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] label after Erotica (1992), due the profanity used in the title song. The album was {{released}} in the United States on April 22, 2003 and eight months later, Warner Music France released a box set version containing both the album and the remix collection, Remixed & Revisited, in a cardboard sleeve entitled Édition Spéciale 2CDs: American Life + Remixed & Revisited. To counter illegal downloads of the album's songs {{before and after the}} release, Madonna's associates created a number of false MP3 files of similar length and size. Some of these files delivered a brief message from Madonna saying [...] "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" [...] followed by minutes of silence. Madonna's website was hacked and the hacker added a message appearing on the main page, saying [...] "This is what the fuck I think I'm doing..." [...] followed by download links for each of the album's songs. The Madonna.com website was closed after the attack for about 15hours. Liz Rosenberg, Madonna's spokesperson, told The Smoking Gun that the <b>defacement</b> was indeed a hack, and not a marketing ploy. The <b>defacement</b> was linked to Phrack, an online hacker magazine whose representatives clarified that they did not [...] "have [...] link with this [...] guy in any way, and we don't even know his identity." [...] The hacked page also contained a derogatory reference to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the federal law aimed at cracking down on digital and online piracy. In addition, the defaced page included an impromptu marriage proposal to Morgan Webb, the host of a daily technology show called The Screen Savers.|$|E
500|$|As {{a man of}} some means, (Winthrop {{referred}} {{to him as a}} [...] "man of great estate") in 1634, Haynes was admitted as a freeman and elected to the colony's council of assistants. [...] He was also named to a committee overseeing military matters, a position that assumed some importance when war broke out with the Pequot tribe that year. [...] The assistants were called on to consider the controversial <b>defacement</b> of the English flag by John Endecott in 1634. Claiming that St George's Cross was a symbol of popery, he had cut it from the Salem militia company's banner. [...] Haynes was part of a moderate faction that disagreed with Endecott's action, claiming that the cross had been reduced to a symbol of nationalism. [...] For his action, Endecott was censured and deprived of serving in any offices for one year.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} Communists assumed control, a {{combination}} of assertive nationalism and socialist ideology led to the eradication of the Western presence in China, including Western culture and products. [...] "The denunciation of anything Western as 'capitalist,' 'bourgeois' and representative of the 'imperialist world' reached a peak during the ideological extremism of the Korean War (1950–1953) when the final vestiges of the Western economic and cultural presence were eradicated." [...] This {{took the form of}} expulsion of foreigners and destruction or <b>defacement</b> of foreign property. An example of this in Shinan District was St. Michael's Cathedral, which was badly damaged during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1971. During this time St. Michael's Cathedral was defaced by the Red Guards. The crosses topping the twin steeples were removed, with two Red Guards falling to their deaths during the removal.|$|E

50|$|The {{conflict}} also engendered considerable propaganda, hacktivism and cyber warfare (both on {{the part}} of the combatants and polities directly involved and of independent, private parties) which resulted in numerous website <b>defacements,</b> denial-of-service attacks and domain name and account hijackings. An opt-in anti-Hamas botnet created by Israeli students appeared, and new media diplomacy appeared on social networking sites such as Facebook and Second Life, and on new media such as Twitter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. These days a {{web server}} {{has become the}} focal point of most organizations. For this reason, a web server {{is one of the main}} targets of an attack from a hacker. Detecting web page <b>defacements</b> is one of the main {{services}} for the security moni-toring and controlling system. Users request a web page from the web server via the internet, and then the web server generates and sends a page at the requested time to the user by running a server-side script or querying database. So the web page is dynamically changing its content as time passes. This is one of the difficul-ties in detecting web page <b>defacements</b> from a remote site. In this paper we pro-pose a mechanism for detecting web page <b>defacements</b> at a remote site and a method for a threshold adjustment. For a detection mechanism, we generated a fea-ture vector for each web page by using 2 -gram frequency index, which calculates the similarity between the current feature vector and the previous feature vector, and decides whether the page has been defaced or not by comparing the similarity of the current threshold with the threshold of the previous page. Before starting a detection process, we run an initial threshold generation process during a certain period of time. For the threshold adjustment method, we used two types of thresh-old adjustment methods. One is the daily adjustment method and the other is the threshold trend adjustment method. The first is applied two times a day by a weighted moving average of the threshold. The latter is applied during every detec-tion process by applying the difference of the two thresholds from the recent to the current threshold. These two threshold adjustment methods can reduce the false alarm rate. ...|$|R
500|$|These {{considerations}} {{should lead}} us to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested with a certain sanctity, {{to be used by}} us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before has there been such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale <b>defacement</b> of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion! ...|$|E
500|$|The gravestone {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} vandalized by those aggrieved that [...] "Hughes" [...] is {{written on the}} stone; they have attempted to chisel it off, leaving only the name [...] "Sylvia Plath." [...] When Hughes' mistress Assia Wevill killed herself and their four-year-old daughter Shura in 1969, this practice intensified. After each <b>defacement,</b> Hughes had the damaged stone removed, sometimes leaving the site unmarked during repair. Outraged mourners accused Hughes in the media of dishonoring her name by removing the stone. Wevill's death led to claims that Hughes had been abusive to both Plath and Wevill. Radical feminist poet Robin Morgan published the poem [...] "Arraignment", in which she openly accused Hughes of the battery and murder of Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. Other feminists threatened to kill Hughes in Plath's name. Plath's poem [...] "The Jailor", in which the speaker condemns her husband's brutality, {{was included in the}} 1970 anthology [...]|$|E
500|$|Various {{critics have}} written about the story's {{paradoxical}} themes of deformity and monstrosity. Not only does Henry Johnson suffer a literal and physical <b>defacement</b> that brands him a monster, but the Trescotts' suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society. The trope of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when {{it becomes clear that}} the townspeople's actions make them more monstrous than the man they shun for his deformity; as professor and critic Lee Clark Mitchell asked in his essay, [...] "Face, Race, and Disfiguration in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster'", [...] "Is 'the monster' the disfigured black man or is it the town that comes to dis-figure him?" [...] Similarly, Harold Bloom called The Monster an example of the [...] "invasion myth", made worse {{by the fact that the}} [...] "monster" [...] is born from within the townspeople's collective mind. Henry-the-monster is therefore [...] "generated by its fears of social instability, its prejudices about appearance (including racism), and its all-consuming passion for gossip and drama." [...] Trescott, the only man in town not to see Henry as an invader, also becomes ostracized by the frenzied small-town mentality.|$|E
5000|$|During the Kosovo {{conflict}} in 1999, NATO computers were blasted with e-mail bombs and hit with denial-of-service attacks by hacktivists protesting the NATO bombings. In addition, businesses, public organizations, and academic institutes received highly politicized virus-laden e-mails {{from a range}} of Eastern European countries, according to reports. Web <b>defacements</b> were also common. After the Chinese Embassy was accidentally bombed in Belgrade, Chinese hacktivists posted messages such as [...] "We won't stop attacking until the war stops!" [...] on U.S. government Web sites.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, during the Croatian War of Independence, {{numerous}} monuments erected {{in honour of}} the Partisans have been damaged or destroyed throughout the country, and these incidents were generally not censured by the authorities at all. Furthermore, the devastation of World War II partisan monuments also often extended to those erected in honour of civilian victims of war, also {{with little or no}} intervention from the police. The <b>defacements</b> occurred during a period when communist parties lost power in much of Eastern Europe.|$|R
50|$|The group's {{beliefs are}} {{described}} fully in The Hacktivismo Declaration, {{which seeks to}} apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the Internet. Oxblood Ruffin, the director of Hacktivismo, has argued forcefully against definitions of hacktivism that include web <b>defacements</b> or denial-of-service attacks. Hacktivismo has also authored its own software license agreement, the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement (HESSLA). The HESSLA prohibits use or modification that would violate human rights or introduce features that spy on the user.|$|R
