25|$|On 10 April 1995, The American Reporter {{became the}} first daily Internet-based newspaper, with its own paid reporters {{around the world and}} all-original content. The {{editor-in-chief}} and founder is Joe Shea. The site is owned by 400 journalists. The future of newspapers in countries with high levels of Internet access has been widely debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad sales, the loss of much classified advertising to Craiglist, eBay and other websites, and precipitous drops in circulation. In the late 1990s the number of newspapers slated for closure, bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risen—especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001. Revenue <b>has</b> <b>plunged</b> while competition from internet media has squeezed older print publishers.|$|E

500|$|Davidson opines that Siggeir's {{anger at}} his {{inability}} to gain the sword that Odin <b>has</b> <b>plunged</b> into Barnstokkr at first sight appears excessive, and states {{that there may be}} an underlying reason for Siggeir's passionate desire for the sword. Davidson notes that the gift of the sword was made at a wedding feast, and states that Barnstokkr likely represents the 'guardian tree', [...] "such as those that used to stand beside many a house in Sweden and Denmark, and which was associated with the 'luck' of the family", and that the 'guardian tree' also had a connection with the birth of children. Davidson cites Jan de Vries in that the name barnstokkr [...] "used in this story was the name given to the trunk of such a tree because it used to be invoked and even clasped by the women of the family at the time of childbirth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some in {{the media}} felt that both the {{controversy}} and Reid’s reaction had been overblown. An editorial in the National Post argued that “perhaps no one in Parliament understands the Official Languages Act better than Scott Reid,” and expressed the hope that Reid would soon “be restored to that portfolio, either as critic or minister, after the election is over.” An Ottawa Citizen editorial stated that “the level of political debate in Canada <b>has</b> <b>plunged</b> again with the verbal attack on ... Scott Reid.” ...|$|E

They angrily debate {{the concept of}} [...] genocide {{in the treatment of}} Aboriginal populations. [...] They debate how [...] "British" [...] or [...] "multicultural" [...] Australia has been historically, and how it should be today. [...] The rhetoric has escalated into national politics, often tied {{to the question of whether}} the royalty should be discarded and Australia become a republic. There have been angry statements by those adhering to the older pro-British position.

2500|$|Often {{business}} transfers take place {{when a company}} <b>has</b> <b>plunged</b> into an insolvency procedure. If a company enters liquidation, which aims to wind down the business and sell off the assets, TUPER 2006 regulation 8(7) states that the rules on transfer will not apply. The main objective, however, in an insolvency procedure particularly since the Cork Report and the Enterprise Act 2002, is to effect rescues through the system of company administration. An administrator's task under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paragraph 3, is either to rescue the company as a going concern, rescue the business typically by finding a suitable buyer and thus save jobs, or {{as a last resort}} put the company into liquidation. If employees are kept on after an administrator is appointed for more than 14 days, under paragraph 99 the administrator becomes responsible for adopting their contracts. The liability on contracts is limited to [...] "wages and salaries". This includes pay, holiday pay, sick pay and occupational pension contributions, but has been held to not include compensation for unfair dismissal cases, wrongful dismissal, or protective awards for failure to consult the workforce before redundancies. If the business rescue does ultimately fail, then such money due employees achieves the status of [...] "super priority" [...] among different creditors' claims.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 December, {{supporters}} of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood held counter protests {{the next day}} at the Presidential Palace, and clashed with anti-Morsi protesters in street battles that saw seven people killed and more than 650 injured. Morsi met with Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, chief of the Egyptian Army, and with his cabinet ministers, to discuss a [...] "means to deal with the situation on different political, security, and legal levels to stabilize Egypt and protect the gains of the revolution." [...] Soldiers backed by tanks moved in to restore order as the death toll began to rise. While addressing the nation, Morsi criticized the opposition [...] "for trying to incite violence" [...] against his legitimacy. During his speech he invited his opponents to a common dialogue, but they rejected it because Morsi remained determined to press forward with the referendum on the Islamist-backed draft constitution that <b>has</b> <b>plunged</b> Egypt into a political crisis. Meanwhile, the government imposed a curfew after the military sent tanks and armored vehicles into Cairo. Morsi's family was forced to evacuate their home in Zagazig, 47 miles (76km) northeast of Cairo. Four of Morsi's advisers resigned their posts in protest against the violence, which they claimed was orchestrated by the Muslim Brotherhood supporters.|$|E

2500|$|The {{value of}} the Iranian rial <b>has</b> <b>plunged</b> since autumn 2011, it is {{reported}} to have devalued up to 80%, falling 10% immediately after the imposition of the EU oil embargo since early October 2012, causing widespread panic among the Iranian public. [...] In January 2012, the country raised the interest rate on bank deposits by up to 6 percentage points in order to curtail the rial's depreciation. The rate increase was a setback for Ahmadinejad, who had been using below-inflation rates to provide cheap loans to the poor, though naturally Iranian bankers were delighted by the increase. Not long after, and just a few days after Iran's economic minister declared that [...] "there was no economic justification" [...] for devaluing the currency because Iran's foreign exchange reserves were [...] "not only good, but the extra oil revenues are unprecedented," [...] the country announced its intention to devalue by about 8.5 percent against the U.S. dollar, set a new exchange rate and vowed to reduce the black market's influence (booming, of course, {{because of the lack of}} confidence in the rial). The Iranian Central Bank desperately tried to keep the {{value of the}} rial afloat in the midst of the late 2012 decline by pumping petrodollars into the system to allow the rial to compete against the US dollar. Efforts to control inflation rates were set forth by the government through a three-tiered-multiple-exchange-rate; this effect has failed to prevent the rise in cost of basic goods, simultaneously adding to the public's reliance on the Iranian black-market exchange rate network. Government officials attempted to stifle the black-market by offering rates 2% below the alleged black-market rates, but demand seems to be outweighing their efforts.|$|E
