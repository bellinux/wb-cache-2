5|$|As {{it turned}} out, maybe Hadl {{had led him}} {{to believe that we}} had come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with him. And it was really <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> it was not what he was expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E
25|$|I {{see people}} who write {{characters}} who are loonies and make them convincing and believable, and I envy them tremendously. I don’t really understand them. It’s <b>funny,</b> <b>because</b> I’ve created my own monster. In the ‘Great War’ and ‘American Empire’ books, I’m writing {{the person who is}} the functional equivalent of Adolf Hitler. I’m inside his head — and that’s a very strange place for somebody who thinks of himself as a fairly rational fellow to be. That’s alarming.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. When Dietter read through his first script, she did not find it very <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> of all the visual gags. Once the animatic was finished, her opinion changed, and she thought to herself: [...] "Hey, this is really funny!".|$|E
50|$|NOTE: NHRA {{does not}} keep records for Top Fuel or <b>Funny</b> Car <b>because</b> of the 1,000 foot {{distance}} used {{in those two}} classes when the track opened.|$|R
5000|$|Carnival: At {{the end of}} February. It is {{very famous}} in the area. There is a contest of fancy dresses {{organized}} by the town hall with awards. It is a very <b>funny</b> day <b>because</b> everybody goes dressed.|$|R
5000|$|Linehan {{notes that}} some people think [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials is an {{inherently}} <b>funny</b> song <b>because</b> of its use in the episode, while the joke was originally that it is simply [...] "not a floor filler".|$|R
500|$|Fazekas {{called him}} [...] "a comedy guy, {{who plays the}} lab tech who is kind of disgruntled. He feels like, 'You agents, you just look down your nose at the lab techs,' and he’s a thorn in Sousa’s side. He’s so <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> {{everything}} he says is completely earnest, but hilarious. He just annoys everyone ... he also has his little hero moments as well." [...] Butters called Braunger [...] "a great comic addition to our cast." ...|$|E
500|$|In this episode, Liz {{says the}} line [...] "I {{want to go}} to there", twice, which {{according}} to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey was [...] "coined" [...] by her daughter, Alice. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Jane Krakowski, who portrays Jenna Maroney, revealed [...] "Some of the great catchphrases of 30 Rock have come from Alice. Like, 'I want to go [...] there!'– that's Alice. It's so <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> I hear people say it on the street, and that was [...] daughter!" ...|$|E
500|$|I {{wrote it}} two years ago, which is <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> {{everybody}} is like [...] "God, {{it sounds so}} current," [...] and some people that I work with were like [...] "You should just say you wrote {{it a couple of}} weeks ago." [...] I'm like [...] "I'm not a dick, I'm going to tell the truth." [...] I wrote it two years ago when I was writing and recording Teenage Dream, [...] it didn't feel right on the record. I would've had to take out one of my other songs that [...] a nice, complete package.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{compared}} to Michael Haneke's <b>Funny</b> Games <b>because</b> of the similarities in the plot. However, Omega is very different stylistically, playing more as an On Stage film and belonging to a subgenre of cinema that {{could be described as}} [...] "Isolated Cottage".|$|R
50|$|Working from Chandler's {{original}} {{words and}} adding spins of their own, the writers (William Faulkner, Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett) wrote {{one of the}} most quotable of screenplays: it's unusual to find yourself laughing in a movie not <b>because</b> something is <b>funny</b> but <b>because</b> it's so wickedly clever.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} mixed-to-negative reviews, with a 33% {{rating on}} Rotten Tomatoes. That being said, Vincent Canby of The New York Times did give a positive {{review of the}} film, describing it as having [...] "a whole range of jokes that are <b>funny</b> primarily <b>because</b> they are in absolutely terrible taste." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{contrast}} to his real-life personality, which was described as [...] "a regular guy and, by all accounts, one of show business' most low-key, decent people", Hartman often played seedy, vain or unpleasant characters as well as comedic villains. He noted that his standard character was a [...] "jerky guy", and described his usual roles as [...] "the weasel parade", citing Lionel Hutz, Bill McNeal, Troy McClure and Ted Maltin from Jingle All the Way as examples. Hartman enjoyed playing such roles because he [...] "just want to be funny, and villains tend to be <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> their foibles are all there to see." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, country {{pop singer}} Taylor Swift used Bieber's [...] "One Time" [...] as {{background}} music and music {{that she and}} her friends were dancing to in a tour video diary that she posted on her official YouTube account. In response to Swift using his song, Bieber posted an acoustic rendition of the then never-before heard [...] "Favorite Girl" [...] on his YouTube. When asked about his learning of Swift using his song, Bieber stated, [...] "It was really <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> I heard about it from a fan. I watched it and it was hilarious!" [...] Bieber and Swift then met in person at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later invited him to be a special guest on her Fearless Tour when she returned to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Josh Modell of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A grade, {{saying that it}} [...] "was a great episode because the jokes came quick and <b>funny,</b> not <b>because</b> there was some huge point to be made". A notable part of the episode for him was the viral video, [...] "What What (In The Butt)".|$|R
3000|$|... …does {{these very}} funny pracs [practicals]. We were doing {{electricity}} {{and he decided}} to get his gherkin electrocuter out and he got a gherkin and he stuck it with a ton of power and it was like “pppzzzz”. He was showing us how human skin would react to electricity. That was <b>funny</b> just <b>because</b> it was a gherkin (14).|$|R
5000|$|... "This classic Laurel and Hardy {{comedy is}} famous for the pants-ripping scene at the end, but {{the other parts of}} it are just as funny.... The final pants-ripping scene is not <b>funny</b> just <b>because</b> so many men lose their pants, but because Laurel and Hardy come up with inventive ways to pull more {{innocent}} bystanders into the fray." ...|$|R
500|$|Oakley and Weinstein {{decided to}} include Abe in the episode {{because they had}} an [...] "obsession" [...] with old people. Weinstein said they both [...] "love them and seem to really hate them" [...] at the same time. He also said that they enjoy writing for {{characters}} such as Abe and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he and Oakley get to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang". Executive producer David Mirkin thought {{it was difficult to}} make Abe <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> he is a [...] "boring and tedious" [...] character. He thinks that even though [...] "Abe's doing all these complaints, what makes him funny is that the things he says are actually funny {{in the context of the}} boring and tedium." [...] Mirkin thought this was a [...] "big challenge, and Bill and Josh pulled it off very well." ...|$|E
500|$|Wadia {{warns that}} Yusef will {{ultimately}} get worse as time progresses. She said to Inside Soap: [...] "I was filming out on location recently with Ace {{and a bunch}} of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The Independent {{reported}} that Moffat [...] "stresses that Chalk is a sitcom, not some banner-waving, agitprop pamphlet", {{but is still}} [...] "passionate about education". Moffat criticises [...] "the [...] government talk about the specially talented needing more education, but that's absurd, the equivalent of hospitals for the healthy." [...] Moffat expected that teachers would find the show <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> it [...] "has certain notes of accuracy", recognising familiar myths such as the dead teacher and teachers' contempt for their pupils. Moffat continued to say that teachers would [...] "also recognise the pathological preference for science over arts and all that league-table shit. An official teaching organisation couldn't say, 'It's a very faithful portrayal,' but I hope they'd say, 'It's a comedy series. Why take it seriously?' You couldn't claim {{it is the most}} flattering series, but, there again, people continued to stay at hotels after Fawlty Towers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gafurov is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} the prototype of the main hero of Darya Mitina sets of humoristic short stories - [...] "The highest level of relations" [...] and [...] "Talks in bed". He is depicted as a simple-minded, naive henpecked husband who pretends to be ultra male chauvinistic and always get in <b>funny</b> situations <b>because</b> of it.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "We're now {{starting}} to explore Lindsey and Kim's relationship more and realising they're both nutters together. It's <b>funny,</b> though, <b>because</b> the fans suddenly think Kim's the sane one. I keep telling everyone that she isn't - Kim might not kill people, but she doesn't behave normally either!" [...] — Sophie Austin (pictured) on Kim.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 1 out of 4 stars, writing, [...] "Myers {{has made some}} funny movies, but this film could have been written on toilet walls by callow adolescents. Every {{reference}} to a human sex organ or process of defecation is not automatically <b>funny</b> simply <b>because</b> it is naughty, but Myers seems to labor under that delusion." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|... "Media Blitz" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators particularly praising {{the performance of}} Adam Scott, although some said the subplot with Chris and Ann was less effective. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook wrote, [...] "Party Down vet absolutely stole the show on Parks and Recreation. ... Scott was a machine of mania, a dork gone wild, who gave the rapidly unraveling Ben {{just the right amount}} of crazy while completely cracking us up." [...] Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] continue a long period of excellent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the problems were resolved too quickly at the end of the episode. Sundermann said Scott's slightly over-the-top performance was made especially <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> he is normally such a straight man character. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character, as during his meltdowns in media interviews. Sepinwall also complimented Aubrey Plaza's performance and said the overall episode was very funny, but that the main storyline was resolved too quickly.|$|E
500|$|Arular {{takes its}} title from the {{political}} code name employed by M.I.A.'s father, Arul Pragasam, during his involvement with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, popularly known as the Tamil Tigers; she contends that her father's [...] "revolutionary ideals" [...] are the album's thematic base. [...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. So I turned it around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same time I {{thought it would be a}} good way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E

There's Mr. Pepper who {{knows more about}} separable verbs than any man in Europe, eh?" [...] and he went off laughing. Rachel laughed, too, as indeed she had laughed ever since she could remember, without thinking it <b>funny,</b> but <b>because</b> she admired her father.|$|R
2500|$|IGN, an American {{entertainment}} website, {{has generally}} commented positively on him. They {{pointed out that}} Herbert {{is one of the}} most popular recurring characters in the series, referring to him (with his dog Jesse) as one of the characters that stuck out from the rest. They also noted that one of the reasons Herbert is <b>funny</b> is <b>because</b> of his [...] "soft, high-pitched whistling voice".|$|R
50|$|Miss Herford's inimitable monologues, being each the apotheosis of some typical Bromide—a shop-girl, {{a country}} dressmaker, a bargain-hunter and so on—become, through her art, {{intensely}} sulphitic. They are excruciatingly <b>funny,</b> just <b>because</b> she represents types so common that we recognize them instantly. Each expresses the crystallized {{thought of her}} particular bromidic group. Done, then, by {{a person who is}} herself a Sulphite par excellence, the result is droll.|$|R
500|$|The {{incident}} {{helped push}} their romance into [...] "top gear". Kate {{went to the}} police station to see Mark and they ended up kissing in front of his colleagues. McGregor called his first on-screen kiss with Brewer [...] "awkward". Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because of what they do and where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, so we do seem quite different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!" [...] He added that Mark and Kate's relationship [...] "may not be the easiest of rides." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Just Jared, Rihanna explained how the bright and colorful was more representational of her persona, saying [...] "I've started to incorporate {{a lot of different}} colors into my wardrobe now. I'm loving that direction. Right now, it feels good and right. It was a cool concept too because it was kind of one side of me and now, it's evolving into the new colorful stuff that we've been doing." [...] In {{an interview}} for MTV News, Guetta explained his role in the music video, saying [...] "I'm DJing from a spaceship. It's actually really <b>funny,</b> <b>because</b> we shot that in Los Angeles in a place where they used to shoot Star Trek, but like the old ones. And so it's kind of retro futuristic, you know? It's like how people were seeing the future back in the 80s. It has a sense of humor in the video." [...] The nighttime version was released as the song's official music video to download digitally on 1 February 2011.|$|E
500|$|According to the project's lead {{programmer}} Ed Boon, Mortal Kombat II was [...] "intended to {{look different}} than the original MK" [...] and [...] "had everything we wanted to put into MK but {{did not have time}} for." [...] In 2012, Boon placed creating the game among his best Mortal Kombat memories, recalling: [...] "When we did Mortal Kombat II, we got new equipment and all that stuff, but it was <b>funny</b> <b>because</b> when we started working on Mortal Kombat II, the mania, the hysteria of the home versions of Mortal Kombat I was literally all around us. We were so busy working on the next one, going from seven characters to 12 and two Fatalities per character and all these other things that that consumed every second." [...] Both the theme and art style of MKII were slightly darker than those of its predecessor, although a more vibrant color palette was employed and the new game had a much richer color depth than the previous game. A new feature was the use of multiple layers of parallax scrolling in the arcade version. The game was made to be less serious with the addition of humorous alternative finishing moves.

5000|$|On January 13, 2017, Whedon {{attacked}} Speaker Paul Ryan on Twitter, {{saying that}} [...] "Violence solves nothing. I want a rhino to f-k @SpeakerRyan {{to death with}} its horn <b>because</b> it's <b>FUNNY,</b> not <b>because</b> he's a #GOPmurderbro." [...] In late April 2017, Whedon made a very controversial tweet, observing that cancer survivors who met with Republican politicians [...] "were not 10s" [...] and thus might not meet the standards of president Donald Trump.|$|R
5000|$|Gary Austin {{will forever}} be {{considered}} one of the greats, always interested in producing work that is <b>funny</b> and moving, <b>because</b> it's true and utterly unique. His work is always a treat to watch. Helen Hunt(Actor, writer, producer, director) ...|$|R
5000|$|Diane {{is full of}} gumption and chutzpah, {{but quite}} frequently, she doesn't have the vaguest idea about what's going on. However, the {{producers}} are cooperative, andthey have agreed Diane will change. One of my fears of television is 'Do I {{want to play the}} same character seven, eight, maybe 10 years?' But it wouldn't be that bad because Diane has a lot of room to grow and still be <b>funny.</b> It's <b>because</b> she cares so deeply. Shelley Long ...|$|R
