By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next step was to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to <b>handle</b> <b>feed</b> that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident.|$|E

Industries such as food & beverage, hydrometallurgical, water softening, catalysis, bio-based chemical etc. use ion exchange as a critical step in processing.

40|$|Feed intake is {{probably}} one of the most important constraints on ruminant productivity irrespective of the type of production system. Eating is a voluntary act that includes decisions such as when, where, what and how much to consume. These decisions, ultimately define the overall dietary quality, the total amount consumed and the highly adaptable behaviour pattern. The complexity of the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of food intake are even greater when animals are free-ranging, an environment where accurate estimates of dietary choices and of structure of intake (meal bouts and criteria) pose methodological difficulties. Improving these methodologies will help to understand foraging behaviour in natural grazing conditions. Our purpose was to assess grazing behaviour from the perspective of the animal (point-of-view -POV) using commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) video cameras carried by grazing animals and allowing continuous video recording of behavioural sequences. Six ewes carrying GoPro® cameras, grazing a natural pasture were used, in four sessions spread out in time, providing differences in the phenological state and nutritive value of plants. Easy to use open-source software (OSS) for audio and video editing and for digital image analyses, allowed the classification of feeding station selection by grazing animals (height, greenness index an type of plants) and of the corresponding foraging events (walking, resting, grazing) and meal criteria (feeding bouts, bites and chews). Case studies taken from the field experiment will be used to illustrate the scope and application of this approach. A rich record of behaviours along a trajectory is generated, yielding data on foraging behaviour patterns, together with diet selection and highlights the usefulness of the approach to find underlying principles of grazing decisions, such as grazing station attributes, plants preferred and time allocated to search and <b>handle</b> <b>feed.</b> The set of multimedia data (acoustic, video, and image) of what the animal sees in the field, sounds resulting from oral manipulation of food, the fine-scale animal movements related with pasture features and the diet-linked meal criteria provide an essential context for understanding animal decisions. Along with the lengthy time required for data interpretation, the limited battery span represents a major drawback, currently restricting the use of POV cameras to hypothesis-driven studies. Nevertheless this approach provides a powerful and integrative tool by providing a unique context for understanding animal decisions and interactions with other individuals and with feed resources supporting better understand how animals select their food resources and habitats...|$|E
40|$|Thermally coupled {{distillation}} {{arrangements with}} dividing-wall implemen- tation provide significant energy and capital savings compared to energy intensive conventional distillation arrangements. In this thesis, {{the focus is}} to study control and operation of such arrangements for three and four product separation. The study comprises of mainly simulation study for the Petlyuk arrangements while for the four-product Kaibel arrangement, simulation as well as experimental works are reported. The first contribution deals with selecting control structures for a three- product Petlyuk (dividing-wall) column. Alternate control structures are considered, with and without the vapor split as a degree of freedom. This work also demonstrates {{the usefulness of the}} graphical Vmin diagram to visualize minimum boilup requirement and choose the appropriate control structure. Next, for a four-product Kaibel column separating methanol, ethanol, propanol and n-butanol, a start-up procedure and steady state operation is demonstrated using experimental setup. A control structure with four temperature controllers is used for control and it can <b>handle</b> <b>feed</b> rate dis- turbances as well as setpoint changes. The experiment data also compares well with an equilibrium stage model. Dividing-wall distillation columns offer large potential energy savings over conventional column sequences, typically up to 30 % for three-product (Petlyuk) columns and 40 % for four-product (Kaibel) columns. However, the energy required for a separation depends on using an optimal vapor split. Hence, the energy saving potential may be lost if the column is operated away from its optimal point, for example, due to feed composition changes. The following work demonstrates experimentally that the vapor split can be effectively used as a degree of freedom during operation for example, for temperature control in the prefractionator section. Together with an adjustable liquid split, the vapor split control allows for minimizing the energy requirements. Finally, a control study on a four-product extended Petlyuk column op- erating close to minimum energy is reported. The study assumes an “ideal” case with all steady state degrees of freedom available for control, including the vapor split valves, which is required to achieve minimum energy under all conditions. Four decentralized control structures are proposed and tested against a wide range of disturbances. This work demonstrates again the use of the graphical V min tool which can be used to visualize the minimum boilup requirement for four-product Petlyuk arrangements.

40|$|Ultra-fine powders, sized between 0. 1 – 10 µm, are {{commonly}} used materials {{in a variety of}} industries including detergents, catalysts, paint pigments, and agricultural products. Ultra-fine powders are known to have complex behaviors due to cohesive forces and are considered difficult to <b>handle,</b> <b>feed,</b> and form consistent final products. One specific issue is that wet granules formed from ultra-fine powders are difficult to densify and take significant amounts of time to reach a desired granule density. This thesis hypothesizes that formation of complex structures within ultra-fine powder granules is responsible for densification issues and that the granule microstructure can be controlled through careful powder handling and preparation prior to the granulation. Furthermore, this thesis hypothesizes that ultra-fine powders have unique behaviors separate from larger primary particles which requires specific studies in the applicable size range to understand ultra-fine powder granulation. ^ In order to investigate this hypothesis, methods are developed to describe the granule microstructure and specifically the granule void phase distribution in 3 D space. X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) and image analysis techniques are used to isolate, identify and describe the spatial distribution of the various granule phases. Additional methods for distinguishing between large macro-voids and the pore space between primary particles are created as well as tools for quantifying macro-void size, shape, volume fraction in the granule (2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void) and distribution of the voids within the granule structure. Descriptions of macro-void size, shape, and volume fraction show that the macro-void properties depend upon primary particle size, powder history, liquid binder and method of granule formation. ^ The granule microstructure measurement methods are developed to describe the internal structure of single-droplet nuclei granules formed in a static powder bed. Alumina powders with mean size varying from 0. 5 to 100 µm are used as model powders with water and polymer solutions as the liquid binders. The size, shape, and macro-void volume fraction (2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void) of the macro-voids is used to describe the effects of primary particle size and powder bed preparation on granule microstructure. Granules formed from ultra-fine powders show the presence of large spheroidal macro-voids distributed throughout a particle matrix. Granules formed from coarser powders show either no macro-voids or non-spheroidal macro-voids which are described as “cracks” within the granule microstructure. Smaller primary particles within the ultra-fine powder range are found to increase the size and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void of measured macro-voids and the complexity of the structure. The maximum void size and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void are dependent upon the powder bed preparation technique. Sifting the material through a 1. 4 mm sieve produces a larger maximum macro-voids size and larger 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void than producing powder beds by sifting through either 710 µm or 500 µm sieves. Sifting of 0. 5 µm primary particles results in formation of stable, large, spheroidal agglomerates while other tested materials do not form stable structures from sifting. ^ The developed methods are also applied to single-droplet granules formed in a tumbling drum to investigate granule microstructures from a moving bed. The effects of consolidation time and liquid binder viscosity are also evaluated and the results are compared to predictions from the surface-tension flow model of the nucleation immersion mechanism developed by Hounslow et al. As consolidation time increases, the thickness of the powder shell slowly increases, but the internal void structure is unchanged. Increasing the liquid binder viscosity increases the void size and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;void. Granules formed from the 25 µm powder have a simpler structure. They have a uniform packing structure of the primary particles surrounding a central void. This structure forms within the first few seconds and is then unaffected by either time on liquid viscosity. Apart from the persistence of the central void, the kinetics of nucleation for the coarse powder agrees with Hounslow’s model. However, the ultrafine powder granules have a complex multiscale structure that is not predicted from a simple nucleation model. ^ Finally, the feeding behavior of several ultra-fine and coarser powders used in the pharmaceutical industry is evaluated using the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the mass flow rate for a twin-screw feeder run in volumetric mode to predict quality of feeding. The RSD results are compared to bulk powder flow properties measured with the FT 4 Powder Rheometer. The RSD of the mass flow rate does not correlate with any of the measured properties. The quality of material feeding and likelihood of failure remains a complicated endeavor with multiple types of failure that are not well described by a single material property.

40|$|Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die Analyse, Bewertung und der Vergleich des kontinuierlichen und der diskontinuierlichen (Batch) Zweidruck-Destillations-Prozesse. Hierzu wurde ein rigoroses dynamisches Modell entwickelt, welches den Anfahrvorgang der Kolonnen aus kaltem und leerem Zustand für beide Prozesse berücksichtigt. Für den kontinuierlichen Prozess wurde die Wärmeintegration analysiert. Hier sind Energieeinsparungen von bis zu 45 % möglich. Mit Hilfe des Modells wurden unterschiedliche Prozessdesigns und Prozessführungskonzepte entwickelt, verglichen und bewertet. Der Schwerpunkt der Arbeit liegt in der Analyse von praktikablen und industrierelevanten Prozesskonzepten unter realistischen Bedingungen. Daraus folgt der Vergleich der einzelnen Prozesse auf volumetrischer Basis und nicht wie sonst üblich auf molarer Basis. Die wesentlichen Ergebnisse werden im Folgenden vorgestellt. Vollständig stoff- und wärmeintegrierte Zweidruckkolonnensysteme können stabil und robust mit einem {{relative}} einfachen Prozessführungskonzept sowohl für kleine Feed-Konzentrationsstörungen als auch für große Feed-Konzentrationsstörungen in das andere Destillationsgebiet betrieben werden. Der limitierende Faktor ist allerdings die Größe der Destillateströme (Recycleströme) an den Köpfen der Kolonnen. Für den diskontinuierlichen Zweidruckprozess wird ein neu entwickelter analytischer Ansatzes vorgestellt, mit dem es in Abhängigkeit der Feedstartkonzentration, der Produktreinheit und der Destillationsregion (Hochdruck oder Niederdruck) leicht möglich ist, die geeignete Batchvariante zu ermitteln. Dieser dient allerdings nur für eine erste Abschätzung, so dass für den detaillierten Vergleich das dynamische rigorose Anfahrmodell genutzt wird. Der reguläre Batchprozess hat insbesondere für Feedstartkonzentration in der Nähe des azeotropen Punkts Vorteile, der inverse Batchprozess für Feedstartkonzentration in der Nähe der Reinstoffe. Der erweiterte inverse Batchprozess stellt ein neues Prozessdesign dar und ist grundsätzlich besser als der klassische inverse Batchprozess und kann sehr gut mit dem regulären Batchprozess konkurrieren. Er stellt eine echte Innovation gegenüber dem klassischen inversen Prozess dar. Eigene neue experimentelle Daten schließen die Lücke in der Literatur und dienen der Validierung der einzelnen Prozessmodelle. Insbesondere sind hier die erstmals vorgestellten experimentellen Ergebnisse für den inversen Batch Prozess hervorzuheben. Außerdem wurde der Anfahrvorgang auf heuristischer Basis analysiert. Hier ist hervorzuheben, dass beim Anfahren eines gekoppelten Zweidrucksystems zur Trennung azeotroper Stoffgemische das Überlappen der Kopfkonzentrationen und damit eine ausreichende Druckdifferenz zwischen den Kolonnen zwingend erforderlich ist, um den Betrieb des Systems zu gewährleisten bzw. überhaupt zu ermöglichen. Hierzu wurde ein mit dem Prozessleitsystem gekoppletes Visualisierungstool entwickelt. Abschließend wurden die Nutzung der Wärmeintegration in anderen Prozessen, insbesondere von hybriden Prozessen, vorgestellt und erste Ideen zu deren Umsetzung diskutiert. The {{distillation process}} is the most used thermal unit operation in industry. Most of the mixtures have non-ideal behavior, so the separation will only be possible with a great complexity concerning plant, automation and equipment. The systematic feed back inside these systems makes the process control and automation very complex and {{the design of the}} system challenging. In the past the research has added a lot of alternatives to the distillation, like membrane processes, adsorption processes, but in the future distillation will also be one of the main unit operations in thermal separation especially for the separation of non-ideal liquid mixtures in big dimensions. The pressure swing distillation (PSD) uses the dependency of azeotropic composition on the system pressure to break the azeotrope. The main advantages of these processes compared to the other is, that no additional substances (entrainer) have to be used. The PSD process can be operated in continuous or in discontinuous mode and also in semi-continuous mode. This unit operation is not widely used in industry used but the PSD process has a high potential because of the possible energy savings (continuous process) and the simple process structure (discontinuous process). The objective of this work is the analysis, evaluation and comparison of the discontinuous and the continuous operation concerning design, process control concepts, energy demands and complexity and feasibility, to expand the experimental data basis and the theoretical knowledge of the PSD process and to get industrial relevant data and better process understanding. To close the gaps and solve the problems mentioned above, the present work will first reduce the lack of missing experimental data and than discuss the different PSD processes in detail to get more knowledge of this unit operation. The work starts with {{the state of the art}} with an overview of the publication and a description of the main process structures of the PSD process. After that a basic model and a rigorous dynamic model with start-up from cold and empty will be introduced and described in detail. These two approaches will first help finding the feasible batch structure for a given PSD case and second will give the possibility to design a good process control structure for the continuous process. It follows the experimental validation of the different models. That includes first experimental results for batch PSD processes as well as the validation of the startup processes of the continuous totally heat integrated columns system. Then the continuous process will be analysed concerning possible process control concepts and process design concepts, which will also be evaluated. Here it can be shown that a process control concept can <b>handle</b> <b>feed</b> concentration changes into the other distillation region in a very stable way. The chapter ends with a detailed analysis of the start-up concepts. The main challenge lies in the coupling of the columns during start-up. The discontinuous pressure swing distillation process is discussed next. As well as for the continuous process the process control concepts and the process designs will be discussed and analyzed. The main improvement in inverted batch design is the introduction of the advanced batch structure. Furthermore the start-up of the batch processes is discussed. The focus lies here in the automatic switching of the controllers. The different batch design concepts will be compared in a simulations study using an analytical as well as the rigorous dynamic model. The potential of the heat integration discussed for the pressure swing distillation leads to the idea to uses this concept with other unit operation as well. So a new way of using an energy integration concept for a Hybrid-process composed of a distillation and a pervaporation unit will be introduced, including a first feasibility study, also for the example of the homogenous azeotropic mixture acetonitrile / water as an alternative process concept to the pressure swing distillation process mainly discussed in this work. Finally a summary of all results and an outlook for further studies in the range of azeotropic separation is given. In conclusion the main contributions from this work are the new experimental data for the continuous and especially for the discontinuous pressure swing distillation processes, the development and verification of a stable process control structure for the heat- and mass-integrated continuous process with energy savings up to 45 %, the heuristically analysis of the start-up process of the coupled system including PCS visualization for the operator, the analytical method for a first and fast comparison of the regular and inverted batch process, the verification of a reasonable use of the inverted batch column in case of pressure swing distillation and the transfer of the heat integration concept to other separation processes like hybrid processes...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Studies on {{determinants}} of dairy farmers' exposure to dust and endotoxin have been sparse {{and so far}} none has addressed the combined effect of tasks and farm characteristics. : To study whether and how work tasks and specific stable characteristics influence the level of dairy farmers' personal exposure to inhalable dust and endotoxin. : We applied an observational design involving full-shift repeated personal measurements of inhalable dust and endotoxin exposure among 77 subjects (owners and farm workers) from 26 dairy farms. Performed tasks were self-registered in activity diaries, and information on stable characteristics was collected through personal interviews and walk-through surveys. Associations between exposure, tasks, and stable characteristics were examined in linear mixed-effect models with individual and farm treated as random effects. Separate as well as combined models for tasks and stable characteristics were elaborated. : The 124 personal samples collected had a geometric mean level (geometric standard deviation) of 360 EU m(- 3) (3. 8) for endotoxin exposure and of 1. 0 mg m(- 3) (2. 7) for dust exposure. Identified factors that increased endotoxin exposure included a lower outdoor temperature and use of slope-based or back-flushed slurry systems along with milking, distribution of bedding, and <b>handling</b> of <b>feed</b> and seeds in barns. For dust, exposure was higher when fully automatic (robotic) milking was used and during re-penning of animals, <b>handling</b> of <b>feed</b> and seeds, <b>handling</b> of silos and when distributing bedding. Dust exposure increased also {{as a result of}} use of rail feed dispensers in a model without fully automatic milking. : The current exposure to dust and in particular endotoxin among Danish dairy farmers demand effective strategies to reduce their exposure. The present findings suggest that future interventions should focus on <b>feeding</b> and manure <b>handling</b> systems. Use of respirators during <b>handling</b> of <b>feed</b> and distribution of bedding should be advised until adequate risk management measures have been established. The expected increased use of fully automatic milking in the future might increase dust exposure of dairy farmers...|$|R
