40|$|Background: Moral case <b>deliberation</b> is {{increasingly}} {{becoming part of}} various Dutch healthcare organizations. Although some evaluation studies of moral case <b>deliberation</b> have been carried out, research into the results of moral case <b>deliberation</b> within aged care is scarce. Research questions: How did participants evaluate moral case <b>deliberation?</b> What has moral case <b>deliberation</b> brought to them? What has moral case <b>deliberation</b> contributed to care practice? Should moral case <b>deliberation</b> be further implemented and, if so, how? Research design: Quantitative analysis of a questionnaire study among participants of moral case <b>deliberation,</b> both caregivers and team leaders. Qualitative analysis of written answers to open questions, interview study and focus group meetings among caregivers and team leaders. Participants and research context: Caregivers and team leaders in a large organization for aged care in the Netherlands. A total of 61 moral case <b>deliberation</b> sessions, carried out on 16 care locations belonging to the organization, were evaluated and perceived results were assessed. Ethical considerations: Participants gave informed consent and anonymity was guaranteed. In the Netherlands, {{the law does not}} prescribe independent ethical review by an Institutional Review Board for this kind of research among healthcare professionals. Findings: Moral case <b>deliberation</b> was evaluated positively by the participants. Content and atmosphere of moral case <b>deliberation</b> received high scores, while organizational issues regarding the moral case <b>deliberation</b> sessions scored lower and merit further attention. Respondents indicated that moral case <b>deliberation</b> has the potential to contribute to care practice as relationships among team members improve, more openness is experienced and more understanding for different perspectives is fostered. If moral case <b>deliberation</b> is to be successfully implemented, top-down approaches should go hand in hand with bottom-up approaches. Conclusion: The relevance of moral case <b>deliberation</b> for care practice received wide acknowledgement from the respondents. It can contribute to the team’s cohesion as mutual understanding for one another’s views is fostered. If implemented well, moral case <b>deliberation</b> has the potential to improve care, according to the respondents...|$|R

5|$|It is {{commonly}} and erroneously, {{believed that a}} Sejm was first disrupted by the liberum veto by a Trakai deputy, Władysław Siciński, in 1652. In reality, he vetoed only {{the continuation of the}} Sejm's <b>deliberations</b> beyond the statutory time limit. He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent. Over the proceedings of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted. Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in Kraków, the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the liberum veto before it had finished its <b>deliberations</b> by the Kiev deputy, Adam Olizar. The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before the proceedings had begun or the Marshal of the Sejm was elected.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} three {{mechanisms for}} the aggregation {{of information in}} heterogeneous committees voting by Unanimity rule: Private Voting and voting preceded by either Plenary or Subgroup <b>Deliberation.</b> While the first <b>deliberation</b> protocol imposes public communication, the second restricts communication to homogeneous subgroups. We find that both protocols allow to Pareto improve on outcomes achieved under private voting. Furthermore, we find that when focusing on simple equilibria under Plenary <b>Deliberation,</b> Subgroup <b>Deliberation</b> Pareto improves on outcomes achieved under Plenary <b>Deliberation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} dynamic model of {{sequential}} information acquisition by a heterogeneous committee. At each date agents {{decide whether to}} continue <b>deliberation,</b> generating costly information, or stop and take a binding vote yielding a decision. For homogeneous committees, the model is a reinterpretation of the classic Wald (1947) sequential testing of statistical hypotheses. In heterogeneous committees, the resources spent on <b>deliberation</b> depend on the committee’s preference profile and on the rules governing the <b>deliberation</b> and decision-making processes. Three main insights emerge from our analysis and match an array of stylized facts on jury decision making. First, more heterogeneity of preferences, more consensual <b>deliberation</b> rules, or more unanimous decision voting rules, lead to greater duration of <b>deliberation</b> and more accurate decisions. Second, balanced committees unanimously prefer to delegate <b>deliberation</b> power to a moderate chairman rather than be governed by a <b>deliberation</b> rule such as unanimity. Last, voting rules at the decision stage are inconsequential when either information collection is cheap or <b>deliberation</b> rules are consensual...|$|R
40|$|Deliberative ways {{of dealing}} with ethical issues in health care are expanding. Moral case <b>deliberation</b> is an example, {{providing}} group-wise, structured reflection on dilemmas from practice. Although moral case <b>deliberation</b> is well described in literature, aims and results of moral case <b>deliberation</b> sessions are unknown. This research shows (a) why managers introduce moral case <b>deliberation</b> and (b) what moral case <b>deliberation</b> participants experience as moral case <b>deliberation</b> results. A responsive evaluation was conducted, explicating moral case <b>deliberation</b> experiences by analysing aims (N = 78) and harvest (N = 255). A naturalistic data collection included interviews with managers and evaluation questionnaires of moral case <b>deliberation</b> participants (nurses). From the analysis, moral case <b>deliberation</b> appeals for cooperation, team bonding, critical attitude towards routines and nurses' empowerment. Differences are that managers aim to foster identity of the nursing profession, whereas nurses emphasize learning processes and understanding perspectives. We conclude that moral case <b>deliberation</b> influences team cooperation that cannot be controlled with traditional management tools, but requires time and dialogue. Exchanging aims and harvest between manager and team could result in co-creating (moral) practice in which improvements for daily cooperation result from bringing together perspectives of managers and team members. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R

40|$|What are {{the effects}} of <b>deliberation</b> about {{political}} issues? This essay reports {{the results of a}} kind of <b>Deliberation</b> Day, involving sixty-three citizens in Colorado. Groups from Boulder, a predominantly liberal city, met and discussed global warming, affirmative action, and civil unions for same-sex couples; groups from Colorado Springs, a predominately conservative city, met to discuss the same issues. The major effect of <b>deliberation</b> was to make group members more extreme than they were when they started to talk. Liberals became more liberal on all three issues; conservatives became more conservative. As a result, the division between the citizens of Boulder and the citizens of Colorado Springs were significantly increased as a result of intragroup <b>deliberation.</b> <b>Deliberation</b> also increased consensus, and dampened diversity, within the groups. Hence <b>Deliberation</b> Day produced group polarization, in the distinctive form of ideological amplification.
