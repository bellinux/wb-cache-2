2500|$|The {{queen post}} truss, {{sometimes}} queenpost or queenspost, {{is similar to}} a <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> in that the outer supports are angled towards the centre of the structure. [...] The primary difference is the horizontal extension at the centre which relies on beam action to provide mechanical stability. This truss style is only suitable for relatively short spans.|$|E
2500|$|The chancel {{was built}} in 1499. It has a double plinth course, gargoyles, parapets, coped gables, and angled {{buttress}}es. Each buttress had an east window of five-light panes; {{the north and south}} sections had three-light windows. [...] The chancel was built with a moulded <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> roof and many rosettes, angels and other carvings. The wide panelled chancel arch has a well preserved Devon-style timber screen.|$|E
2500|$|The bridge has {{a single}} span, wooden, double pyramidal-shaped Burr-type trusses and {{multiple}} <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> design {{with the addition of}} steel hanger rods. [...] It is the only bridge in the county to use this design. [...] The deck is made from oak planks. It is painted red, the traditional color of Lancaster County covered bridges, on both the inside and outside. [...] Both portals to the bridge are painted in red with white trim.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{also holds}} the {{distinction}} of not only being the shortest covered bridge in Parke County but also the only bridge left that is not of Burr Arch construction, it is a four-segment <b>Kings</b> <b>Post</b> <b>truss</b> bridge. It took these honors in 1957 when its sister bridge, the Weisner Covered Bridge, was washed out. The Weisner Covered Bridge had been built {{the year before the}} Phillips Covered Bridge by J.A. Britton also using a four-segment <b>Kings</b> <b>Post</b> <b>truss</b> but was shorter than the Phillips Bridge.|$|R

50|$|The {{queen post}} truss and the <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> may be combined, {{by using the}} {{straining}} beam of the queen post truss as the tie beam for a <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> above. Such combinations are known as compound trusses.|$|E

5000|$|Architectural historians in Louisiana use {{the term}} [...] "Norman roof" [...] {{to refer to a}} steeply pitched roof; it is {{supported}} by what they call a [...] "Norman truss" [...] which is similar to a <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss.</b> This is a through-purlin truss consisting of a tie beam and paired truss blades, with a central king post to support the roof ridge. The name derives from a belief that this system of construction was introduced to North America by settlers from Normandy in northern France, but it is really a misnomer as the system was more widely used than that. The difference between a Norman truss and a <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> is the tie beam in a Norman truss is technically a collar beam (a beam between the rafters above the rafter feet) where the <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> the rafters land on top of a tie beam.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> has two {{principal}} rafters, a tie beam, and a central vertical king post. [...] The simplest of trusses, {{it is commonly}} used in conjunction with two angled struts.|$|E
50|$|The west wing's {{second floor}} {{has a large}} landing with beaded woodwork. It leads to a master bedroom and two smaller bedrooms. The entire floor has its {{original}} wideboard flooring. The roof framing uses <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses</b> on the collar ties rather than the more commonly used tie beam formation, a construction visible in the master bedroom.|$|R
50|$|The Brick Shelter is {{an open-air}} {{structure}} with a concrete foundation. It was built {{early in the}} history of Fountain Park. No exact date is known. There are four brick piers that support the exposed <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses</b> of the gable roof. Originally there was a water tank and pump, which has been moved to create a public gathering area.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the church}} has <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses</b> with {{diagonal}} struts and the roof is lined with timber boarding on the rake. Walls are lined with horizontal boarding, and a shallow pointed arch frames and separates the raised sanctuary from the nave.

50|$|Harrington Covered Bridge is a {{historic}} wooden covered bridge located at Conneaut Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania. It crosses the west branch of Conneaut Creek. It is a 72 ft, <b>King</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> bridge. It was constructed about 1870, and rebuilt in 1962.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} of <b>King</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> with tied arch design, {{one of only}} 3 left {{standing}} in the state. This bridge {{is also one of}} the shortest in the state, and it at the lowest elevation being just off the shore of Lake Champlain.|$|E
50|$|King posts {{were used}} in timber framed roof {{construction}} in Roman buildings, and in medieval architecture in buildings such as parish churches and tithe barns.

50|$|The {{first floor}} {{practice}} rooms have exposed <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses</b> which span {{the width of}} the building.. Evidence of the original use and form of the building includes a piece of equipment suspended within the roof trusses of the practice room at the southern end, hardwood columns in the reception space and exposed brick walls to some areas and an early fire system in the entrance.|$|R
50|$|The {{church in}} Flemish bond brick has a slate roof and was {{subsequently}} extended {{at the east}} end. It has a five-bay nave with plain, segment-headed window openings and the chancel has a three-lancet east window. The south aisle and bell cote were added in the 19th century and its vestry dates from the 20th century. The gabled porch {{on the north side}} has a Norman-style arched entrance. The roof is supported by <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} floor of the main block are three bedrooms, all with their {{original}} finishes. A steep, narrow stair leads up to the attic, where the original roof framing is visible. It consists of three heavy beech <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses</b> with purlins and common rafters, about 16 in below the current roof. The two chimneys corbel together and form a common flue. At the south end are the remains of a small 6 by 8 ft brick room.|$|R
50|$|Grimes Covered Bridge was a {{historic}} wooden covered bridge located in Washington Township in Greene County, Pennsylvania. It was a 31.75 ft, <b>King</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> bridge with a tin covered gable roof, constructed in 1888. It crossed Ruff Creek. As of October 1978, {{it was one}} of nine historic covered bridges in Greene County.|$|E
50|$|The roof framing {{consists}} of king post trusses {{with a double}} top chord (or top chord and rafter). This type of <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>truss</b> is rare but other examples have been noted in {{such as in the}} 1714 Lynnfield, Massachusetts meeting house, 1800 Congregational Church in Windham, Vermont, and the 1799 Strafford, Vermont meeting house.|$|E

5000|$|The roof {{dates from}} the 15th century; it is an open timber roof {{consisting}} of four <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses</b> with side struts. The chancel arch is Norman in style. [...] The font {{dates from the}} 14th century. It consists of a square bowl on a pedestal; the bowl has trefoils and plain rounded decorations. In the aisle is a steeply pointed trefoiled piscina.

50|$|The Chimneys' {{floor plan}} has two rooms {{on each side}} of a central hall. The two-story house is framed with heavy timber with mortise and tenon joints secured with {{hardwood}} pegs. Each timber is marked by chiseled Roman numerals. Spaces between wall studs are nogged with brick in the interior and exterior walls. Fredericksburg was a major port city in the colonies in the mid- to late 18th century and The Chimneys' hipped roof framing utilizes techniques common in the construction of ships' hulls at the time. The roof is supported by three heavy <b>king</b> <b>post</b> <b>trusses.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge over}} {{the upper part of}} the cascade is part of Highway 28, a major north-south {{transportation}} route. Although the south and north shores are at one point less than 100m apart, the area is so riddled with large lakes and rivers that before the bridge was built the shortest distance by land between the two points was at that time more than 70 km., much of it without roads. Before the <b>Kings</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Truss</b> style iron bridge was built in the 1860s, travelers managed by crossing Stony Lake, by boat in the summer, and across the ice in winter.|$|R
