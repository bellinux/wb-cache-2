40|$|In a globalised {{environment}} knowledge increasingly {{becomes the}} central success factor for a company. Additionally, networking forms of organisation, {{as represented by}} affiliated business groups and corporate networks, become economically reasonable. This work examines the influence of company relations and their changes on the enabled knowledge acquisition by co-workers and on the actual utilisation of existing knowledge by the companies. The objective of a process-related compilation of co-worker qualification and knowledge use {{as well as of}} company relations is the following: to avoid inadvertent crises, to accompany changes suitable to the organisation and to increase the probability of attaining strategic goals. This requires a theory with high degree of predictability. The only theory known by mankind without limits is Quantum Theory. Her application in politics, economics, theology and philosophy is described by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. This dissertation takes up these ideas and the synergetic conceptions of Hermann Haken and presents the quantum theoretically interpreted Synergetics {{for the first time in}} comprehensive written form. In order to underline her sociological relevance, it was also compared with the more established Theory of Structuration by Anthony Giddens. On this basis, the available conditions in affiliated business groups, corporate networks and during their changes were first analysed. Apart from an interpretation for the substantial but <b>indefinite</b> <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of the uniform line was determined the possible degree of company-spreading co-operation, without releasing the legal subsumption under the specific affiliated business group concept of german law. Against the prevailing opinion in the German-speaking countries were confirmed the doubts on the long-termness from corporate networks in the Angloamerican research. Then the connection between the conditions in affiliated business groups, corporate networks and individual learning procedures could be explained processually. Assumptions that hierarchical organisations were less successful than flat organisational structures in the knowledge management sector, proved as too simplifying and not as automatism applicable. Their respective pro and cons are balanceable through on the phase process and the respective conditions co-ordinated management measures. In the empirical part of the dissertation, a research methodology - based upon synergetics quantum theoretically interpreted - allowed for extraordinarily differentiated explanations an prognoses with highly predictive qualities. The extracted stabilising and impairing factors of the individual companies underline the theoretical elaboration to the close connection between co-worker qualification, knowledge use and business success against the background of the reached strategic decisions. In sum, this disseration ist to be considered a contribution to the purpose of enabling management an appropriate reaction to the social phenomena "globalization of the economy", "networking forms of organisation" and "knowledge dependency of production". </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{will discuss the}} nature of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts.</b> The law {{contains}} <b>legal</b> <b>concepts,</b> <b>legal</b> relations {{as well as other}} concepts and other relations. For an adequate understanding of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> we investigate them from a philosophical viewpoint and a knowledge-representation viewpoint. The philosophical viewpoint leads to a philosophically grounded ontology of law. This provides an answer to the question what <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> are. As an immediate consequence I treat the representation question: how can <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> be represented properly in a formal manner? The representation language used is situation semantics. In the framework developed concepts are formed by constitutive relationships, relating application conditions to concept names. When all conditions apply, this constitutive relation establishes a new institutional fact. ...|$|R

40|$|We are {{researching the}} problem of open texture in legal {{reasoning}} and how it leads {{to the evolution of}} <b>legal</b> ontologies. <b>Concepts</b> in law are open-textured, they can’t be uniquely matched to common sense concepts which describe real-world events. The argumentation that occurs in many legal cases is about the meaning of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts.</b> These <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> evolve through this argumentation. Our aim is to build computational models of this legal reasoning. We argue for the importance of ontologies for meta-knowledge in modelling this argumentation. We also argue that this work has relevance for ontology matching. 1 Legal Reasoning and Open Texture Legal reasoning is {{not simply a matter of}} identifying the subsumptions between <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> and real-world <b>concepts.</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>concepts</b> are not precisely defined enough for this: the relationship between them and the real-world is not exact.

40|$|Fixing the Shadows: Access to Art and the <b>Legal</b> <b>Concept</b> of Cultural Commons studies {{access to}} art as knowledge, {{and the role}} law plays in facilitating access. The {{research}} project discusses how to advance and strengthen access to art and create legal pathways that facilitate communication, access to and sharing of art as knowledge. Thus, the study introduces the <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of cultural commons and discusses how such a concept may be introduced to law and given a legal platform. The study utilises the theories and methods of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze (1925 - 1995) and the French psychoanalyst Félix Guattari (1930 - 1992) in dealing with law and jurisprudence. It focuses particularly {{on the concept of}} the rhizome. The theoretical aim of the study is to develop a critique of dogmatic law and to study particular obstacles to access to art created by traditional approaches to <b>legal</b> <b>concepts.</b> Consequently, through a rhizomatic jurisprudence a <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of cultural commons is developed and presented. The study is divided in two volumes. Volume I is called “Beyond the ontological question” and it studies obstacles to access to art created by law and certain types of traditional legal reasoning, it aims to bring forth the potential of law. Volume II analyses the cultural commons as a <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> and is called “The Performativity of the Commons”.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the reasons why}} the European Court of Justice (ECJ) judges need <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> when they pronounce their judgments. It points out that the ECJ as a law-interpreting and an ipso facto law-making court needs <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> to communicate results of its interpretative and law -making enterprise. The article also shows how in the context of Article 234 EC preliminary ruling procedure <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> become useful tools of portraying ECJ judgments as mere products of interpretation and not as the results of subsuming {{the facts of the case}} into a legal provision. It is by means of application of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts,</b> that the ECJ judges are able to justify that they are not overstepping the mandate they have been entrusted with. In the same time the use of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> enables them to engage in dialogue with national judges, who seek guidance as to the content ofEClaw rules, and to maintain a strong doctrine of precedent. Most importantly, however, the use of concepts promotes coherence which, the article maintains, is the primary source of Community law's authority, and thus constitutes the foundational technique of persuading the relevant audience that Community law is indeed a legal system. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Doctoral {{candidate}} Birgit Snijder-Kuipers {{recommended to}} use the term ‘change of legal form’ instead of ‘conversion’. These words convey the meaning ofthis <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> better. In the opinion of Snijder-Kuipers change of legal form is a form of amendment of the articles of association. A separate <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> is not necessary. Advisors and legislators are advised by the doctoral candidate to give consideration to this <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> when preparing legislation, articles of association, agreements and last wills. The word ‘conversion’ has more than one meaning. One is conversion as meant in sections 2 : 18, 2 : 71, 2 : 72, 2 : 181 and 2 : 183 of the Dutch Civil Code. I refer to that <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> as ‘change of legal form’. These words more accurately convey that this <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> means the transformation of the legal form of the corporate entity. If there is a change of legal form the legal personality of the legal entity is maintained, as a result of which its assets are maintained. The central question is what is the nature, the function and the advisable scope of the <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of change of legal form under Dutch corporate law. To the extent a foundation changes its legal form, the law prescribes that the assets are blocked at the time of change of legal form of the foundation. There is a ‘blocked assets clause’ in Dutch law. I describe the implications of the blocked assets clause. The consequences of change of legal form to present legal relationships are also described. Finally, there is attention given to specific changes of legal form: religious denominations, partnerships and internationally the EESV, SE and SCE. ...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of maximum}} {{harmonization}} directives in EU private law {{in combination with}} open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> is controversial. Due to differing legal cultures, {{it is likely that}} open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> will be interpreted differently in the Member States. This seems to conflict with the aim of maximum harmonization as put forward by the European Commission: reducing legal fragmentation and increasing legal certainty among consumers and businesses. Although supporting the notion that national interpretations of open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> are likely to differ, this article posits that this is not incompatible with the aim of maximum harmonization. It proposes a different understanding of the concept of maximum harmonization that allows for different national applications of the rules. This understanding is based on the distinction between harmonizing a legal framework (the written rules) and harmonizing the application of this legal framework. By acknowledging the importance of fully harmonizing the written rules without harmonizing the national applications of these rules, it demonstrates that maximum harmonization does not necessarily conflict with the use of open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts...</b>|$|R
