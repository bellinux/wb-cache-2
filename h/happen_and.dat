5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> presented all the games with his comments on the play. Unfortunately some of Staunton's comments {{in the book and}} in The Illustrated London News were intemperate, because he was disappointed with the placing he achieved.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton's faction {{were against}} any {{conditional}} ratification, {{under the impression}} that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any adjournment would not <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> a compromise would have to be reached. Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from The Federalist Papers, and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric. The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{film has}} {{a handful of}} {{differences}} from Rubel's original work. Many character names were changed for the film, including Cliff Monroe to Steven Monroe, Puff Gordon to Ed Gordon, and Nancy Starweather to Nancy Richards. Additionally, {{the majority of the}} characters in the film were nameless in the book. The ending was also tweaked. In the novel, Monroe professes his love for Nancy Starweather and they happily marry in Painted Springs. In the film, this does not <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> Monroe just leaves the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the {{deregulation of the}} market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of murders in which the heart {{has been removed from}} the victims. A writer who lives next door to Mulder is writing a novel about the murders before they actually <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> soon, Scully finds herself confused and drawn to the writer, who has a romantic interest in her.|$|E
5|$|Two {{members of}} the group, Beyoncé and Rowland each {{released}} one album, while Michelle Williams released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyoncé's had been regarded as the most successful {{with the release of}} Dangerously in Love (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fifth and final album. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> that their affinity to each other kept them together.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, Warren {{returns to}} the garage and Lucas shows his support for Chris and defends him. Chris meets and befriends Warren's son, Blake (Oliver Edwin). When Warren learns Blake is friends with Chris, he decides {{to put a stop}} to the situation. Warren threatens to kill Chris unless he stops {{spending}} time with Blake. Mason told TV Week that he thinks it is a shame Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear someone is spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or someone else is not clear. Mason added something big would <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> it may not end well for Chris.|$|E

5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as aeolian deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different scenario, in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the navigator set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to <b>happen,</b> <b>and</b> his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the navigator was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
5|$|In {{summing up}} the counterattack, US Army {{official}} historian John Miller {{argues that the}} Japanese offensive failed due to poor planning and intelligence. The Japanese commanders underestimated {{the strength of the}} US defenders, but even if XIV Corps had been as weak as the Japanese believed, the force committed to the attack did not include enough troops or artillery to penetrate the well-prepared defenses. In the event, the defenders greatly outnumbered the Japanese force and had far superior artillery support. Miller argues further that the attack might have achieved a degree of success, {{at least in terms of}} inflicting heavy casualties on the US forces, had Hyakutake concentrated his forces early in the attack, rather than cumulatively, in order to achieve a break in the US line, which he might have been able to exploit to penetrate into the rear areas and cause considerable destruction before the US forces regrouped. Nevertheless, this did not <b>happen</b> <b>and</b> ultimately the veteran US troops held their positions despite the onslaught. Miller opines that had the offensive been successful, it would have had a serious affect on the campaign in the Solomons, resulting in a large drain on Allied resources, but would most likely not have altered the wider course of the war.|$|E
