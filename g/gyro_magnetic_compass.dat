The types of previously available sensors are detailed including strapdown accelerometers, roll and pitch sensors, <b>gyro</b> and <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> depth sensor, and various types of acoustic positioning systems. A doppler velocimeter is added to this sensor suite to improve the performance of the filter. As {{an integral part of the}} filter, <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and gyrocompass biases are estimated to improve vehicle heading accuracy. The filter is designed to account for numerous real-life complications. These include varying rates of sensor output, lengthy gaps in reception of position information, presence of non-Gaussian position fix errors (flyers), and varying probability density functions for sensor errors. Simulated data are used to test the filter with varying availability of data and accuracy of initial conditions, along with actual data from a deployment of the towed DSL- 120 vehicle. The increased accuracy obtained by using the doppler velocimeter is emphasized. [URL]...|$|R

Only compass #yaw angle# feedback is used. The yaw rate signal is reconstructed by a linear observer.

40|$|Abstract: A <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module must be {{calibrated}} accurately before use. Moreover, the calibration process must {{be performed}} {{taking into account}} any magnetic dip if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module has tilt angles. For this, a calibration method for a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is explained. Tilt error of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is compensated using a biaxial accelerometer generally. The accelerometer error causes a tilt angle calculation error that gives rise to an azimuth calculation error. For error property analysis, error equations are derived and simulations are performed. In the simulation results, the accuracy of derived error equations is verified. If a biaxial <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> module is used instead of a triaxial one, the magnetic dip and z-axis <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> data must be estimated for tilt compensation. Lastly, estimation equations for the magnetic dip and z-axis magnetic compas...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of birds is located only in the right eye. However, here we show that night-migrating garden warblers (Sylvia borin) are able to perform <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation with both eyes open, with only the left eye open and with only the right eye open. We did not observe any clear lateralization of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation behaviour in this migratory songbird, and, therefore, it seems that the suggested all-or-none lateralization of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation towards the right eye only cannot be generalized to all birds, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> orientation in birds is lateralized is probably not as simple as suggested previously...|$|R
40|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of a migratory bird, the European robin (Erithacus rubecula), {{was shown}} to be lateralized in favour of the right eye/left brain hemisphere. However, {{this seems to be}} a {{property}} of the avian <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> that is not present from the beginning, but develops only as the birds grow older. During first migration in autumn, juvenile robins can orient by their <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> with their right as well as with their left eye. In the following spring, however, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> is already lateralized, but this lateralization is still flexible: it could be removed by covering the right eye for 6 h. During the following autumn migration, the lateralization becomes more strongly fixed, with a 6 h occlusion of the right eye no longer having an effect. This change from a bilateral to a lateralized <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> appears to be a maturation process, the first such case known so far in birds. Because both eyes mediate identical information about the geomagnetic field, brain asymmetry for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> could increase efficiency by setting the other hemisphere free for other processes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we are {{discussing}} {{the effect of the}} use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> on the orientation of ancient Chinese architectonical complexes. As Czech researchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the ancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys were made by means of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> we can find the axes of the complexes deviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic declination that existed at the time the structures were built.

50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized compass (or heading indicator) is {{to read the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro compass will read correctly in a turn, whereas the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> can't be read properly while turning.
