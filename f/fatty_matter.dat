6000|$|That {{interesting}} anthropoid's career {{after death}} was one series of misfortunes, ending with being stuffed for the British Museum. My factotum sat {{up half the}} night skinning, {{but it was his}} first coup d'essai. In a climate like the Gaboon, especially during the rains, we should have turned the pelt [...] "hairy side in," [...] filled it with cotton to prevent shrinking, and, after painting on arsenic, have exposed it to the sun: better still, we should have placed it on a scaffolding, like a defunct Congo-man, over a slow and smoky fire, and thus the <b>fatty</b> <b>matter</b> which abounds in the integuments would have been removed. The phalanges of the hands and feet, after being clean-scraped, were restored to their places, and wrapped with thin layers of arsenicated cotton, as is done to small animals, yet on the seventh day decomposition set in; it was found necessary to unsew the skin, and again to turn it inside out. The bones ought to have been removed, and not replaced till the coat was thoroughly dry. The skinned spoils were placed upon an ant-hill; a practice which recalls to mind the skeleton deer prepared by the emmets of the Hartz Forest, which taught Oken that the skull is(?) expanded vertebr√¶. We did not know that half-starved dogs and [...] "drivers" [...] will not respect even arsenical soap. The consequence of exposing the skeleton upon an ant-hill, where it ought to have been neatly cleaned during a night, was that the [...] "Pariah" [...] curs carried off sundry ribs, and the [...] "parva magni formica laboris" [...] took the trouble to devour the skin of a foot. Worse still: the skull, the brain, and the delicate members had been headed up in a breaker of trade rum, which was not changed till the seventh day. It was directed to an eminent member of the old Anthropological Society, and the most interesting parts arrived, I believe, soft, pulpy, and utterly useless. The subject seems to have been too sore for mentioning --at least, I never heard of it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} {{at once that}} all {{argument}} upon this head should be urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the rationale of the rule. Now the human body, in general, is neither much lighter nor much heavier than {{the water of the}} Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from sea. But, leaving this tide out of question, it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh water, of their own accord. Almost any one, falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own--that is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as possible. The proper position for one who cannot swim, is the upright position of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface. Thus circumstanced, we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion. It is evident, however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate. An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about. Now, in the struggles of one unused to swimming, the arms are invariably thrown upwards, while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position. The result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs. Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them. This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or <b>fatty</b> <b>matter.</b> Such individuals float even after drowning.|$|E

50|$|Total <b>fatty</b> <b>matter</b> (TFM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics describing the quality of soap and it is always specified in commercial transactions. It is defined as the total amount of <b>fatty</b> <b>matter,</b> mostly fatty acids, that can be separated from a sample after splitting with mineral acid, usually hydrochloric acid. The fatty acids most commonly present in soap are oleic, stearic and palmitic acids and pure, dry, sodium oleate has TFM 92.8%, while top quality soap noodles now increasingly used for making soap tablets in small and medium size factories, are typically traded with a specification TFM 78% min., moisture 14% max. But besides moisture, finished commercial soap, especially laundry soap, also contains fillers used to lower its cost or confer special properties, plus emollients, preservatives, etc. and then the TFM can be as low as 50%. Fillers, which are usually dry powders, also make the soap harder, harsher on the skin and with greater tendency to become 'mushy' in water and so low TFM is usually associated with hardness and lower quality. In older days in Europe and in some countries now, soap with TFM 75% minimum was referred to as Grade 1 and 65% minimum as Grade 2 and less 60% as Grade 3.|$|E

The acid value of soapstock-HAAO increased to 199. 1 mg KOH/g but {{a large amount of}} potassium sulfate was produced. To resolve the formation of potassium sulfate, acid oil was extracted from soapstock and was converted to HAAO by using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). The maximum acid value of acid oil-HAAO was 194. 2 mg KOH/g when the mass ratio of acid oil, sulfuric acid, and water was 10 : 4 : 10 at 2 % of SDBS.

50|$|Whether a {{cerebral}} infarction is thrombotic or embolic based, its pathophysiology, or the observed conditions and underlying mechanisms of the disease. In thrombotic ischemic stroke, a thrombus forms and blocks blood flow. A thrombus forms when the endothelium is activated {{by a variety}} of signals to result in platelet aggregation in the artery. This clump of platelets interacts with fibrin to form a platelet plug. This platelet plug grows into a thrombus, resulting in a stenotic artery. Thrombotic ischemia can occur in large or small blood vessels. In large vessels, the most common causes of thrombi are atherosclerosis and vasoconstriction. In small vessels, the most common cause is lipohyalinosis. Lipohyalinosis is when high blood pressure and aging causes a build-up of <b>fatty</b> hyaline <b>matter</b> in blood vessels. Atheroma formation can also cause small vessel thrombotic ischemic stroke.|$|R
40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{is obliged to}} adapt to ecological legislation because classical processes have a great environmental impact caused by operations included in preparation, dyeing and printing of textile materials, specially those containing cotton. Removal of hydrophobic impurities and starches, using surfactants, alkalis and oxidants at high temperatures is normally made with important consequences at ecological level, with problematic effluents and higher costs. CORONA is a non- pollutant technique based in physical means of production of plasma at ambience pressure, which {{can be applied to}} reduce ecological and economical cost factors in textile industry. The term plasma means an ionized gas, formed by a complex mixture of electrons, neutral particles, ions, photons and radicals produced by an electric discharge or by radiation in electromagnetic fields able to produce ionization. When the fabric runs betweenelectrodes and an electric discharge is made at ambience temperature and pressure, with a high voltage of more than 10 000 V and a frequency between 20 - 40 kHz, the treatment is known as CORONA. In the medium, free electrons lose energy when collide with neutral molecules. This energy transfer produces new very reactive particles and with capacity to be involved in other reactions, responsible for the formation of new compounds and changes of fibre‚Äôs superficial properties. CORONA technology is not industrially used in textiles yet, but it has a wide application in the case of other polymeric products like plastics in order to achieve a better degree of cohesion between printing inks and materials. Its application in textiles has been thought in order to take practical advantage of the possibility to work continuously at ambience conditions. CORONA effects in the structure of cotton‚Äôs surface were already studied and the creation of channels for water penetration was proved, together with the oxidation of <b>fatty</b> <b>matters,</b> which are the mechanisms responsible for the fast increase in hidrophility after CORONA treatment. This fact is decisive in what concerns all the chain of wet processes for cotton transformation. Studies were previously made about CORONA effects in textile printing. These studies led to very good results related to the reinforcement of links in the system fibre-pigment together with surface changes caused by the discharge which are responsible for an increase in the wet/dry rubbing fastness. It is possible to have a fastness improvement of one point, which means an optimal result for pigment printing quality. In the present work, the extension of these results to preparation and dyeing of cotton has been made. Shorter, cleaner and easier processes are possible, including direct dyeing of raw cotton materials. Depending on final use for textile dyed products, results for a completely ‚ÄúGreen Process‚Äù are presented, where the presence of husks and seeds not removed by any chemical treatment {{can be seen as a}} kind of quality certification...|$|R

The results showed that the better soap samples in the physical properties were in the following increasing order: soap nos 3 > soap nos 4 > soap n. os 5 > soap n. os 6 compared with the standard soap (sample nos 1), where from firm structure with high foam, while the other soap samples (n. os 2, 7 and 8) were poor quality (i. e., low lathering properties with deep colours). Therefore, it could be concluded that mucilage palm oil {{can be used as a}} new fatty material for toilet soap manufacturing at ratio of 40 % from the fatty blend. Mucilagos de aceite de palma (M. P. O.) fueron obtenidos mediante la etapa de refinaci√≥n f√≠sica del aceite de palma crudo. Los componentes de M. RO. tuvieron un alto contenido en √°cidos grasos libres (82. 2 %) con cantidades peque√±as de aceites neutros (11. 9 %), mientras que el contenido residual (materia insaponificable e impurezas) fue del 2. 1 % adem√°s del 3. 8 % de agua. Los resultados indicaron que los colores de M. RO., sebo y aceite de almendra de palma mejoraron despu√©s de la decoloraci√≥n. Ocho muestras de jab√≥n (n. os 1 - 8) fueron preparadas a partir de mezclas grasas decoloradas de mucilagos de aceite de palma, sebo y aceite de almendra de palma en diferentes proporciones. Los resultados mostraron que los contenidos de humedad de muestras de jabones n. os 2, 7 y 8 fueron altos comparados con el jab√≥n control (muestra n. ¬∞ 1), y por tanto su materia grasa total fueron menores que la encontrada en el jab√≥n control (muestra n. ¬∞ 1). Los resultados se√±alaron que la materia insaponificable de los jabones n. os 2, 7 y 8 fueron mayores que las obtenidas de los otros jabones. No se observaron grandes diferencias en el √°lcali libre de todos los jabones preparados (rango de 0. 06 a 0. 09 %). Por otra parte, se encontraron grandes variaciones en el aceite libre de todas las muestras de jabones (n. os 2 - 8) comparadas con el del jab√≥n control (muestra n. ¬∞ 1), excepto las muestras de jabones n. os 2, 7 y 8, las cuales registraron valores muy altos. Las mejores muestras de jab√≥n en cuanto al color siguieron el siguiente orden creciente: n. os 1 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 2. Los resultados mostraron que las mejores muestras de jab√≥n en cuanto a las propiedades f√≠sicas siguieron el siguiente orden creciente: jab√≥n n¬∞ 3 > jab√≥n n. ¬∞ 4 > jab√≥n n¬∞ 5 > jab√≥n n. ¬∞ 6 cuando fueron comparadas con el jab√≥n control, ellos mostraron estructura firme y buena espuma, mientras que las otras muestras de jab√≥n (n. os 2, 7 y 8) fueron de pobre calidad (esto es, bajas propiedades espumantes con colores intensos). Por consiguiente se puede concluir que los mucilagos de aceite de palma pueden ser usados como nuevo material graso para la fabricaci√≥n de jabones de tocador en la proporci√≥n de un 40 % de mezcla grasa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Emulsions, {{thermodynamically}} unstable mixtures, are dispersed {{systems in}} which one liquid is dispersed as droplets in a second immiscible phase. In most natural and processed foods, the immiscibility of water with lipids is overcomed by dispersing one phase as droplets into the other phase. The oil-in-water emulsions are highly stable. This is because some water-soluble surface-active agents and fine solid mineral particles are often adsorbed onto the oil droplets so that the emulsions are difficult to demulsify. In the present study we have determined some characteristics of oil-in-water emulsions obtained by three different types of oils: sun flower oil, olive oil and corn oil, and we have investigated the stabilization of these emulsions fortified with iron in the presence or {{in the absence of}} casein. The solubility, pH values, water and volatile content, free acidity, total <b>fatty</b> <b>matter,</b> iron content and redox potential were measured. It was observed that the increase of emulsions Fe(II) content was associated to the diminution of the system‚Äôs redox potential...|$|E
40|$|The histochemistry of masked lipids of {{chromosomes}} {{has been}} investigated {{with the aid of}} paper chromatographic procedures. At least three tightly bound associations of phospholipid with protein have been identified in calf thymus nucleohistone. Hence {{it seems likely that the}} 'spurious ' reactions of nuclei and of nucleohistone, especially after extraction with lipid solvents, is a true indication of the increased availability of these closely linked phospholipids. Moreover, not more than about 10 % of the material extracted by hot pyridine from calf thymus was fatty, the rest being water-soluble. After treatment of plant cells with hot trichloroacetic acid had produced increased staining with methods for demonstrating lipids, <b>fatty</b> <b>matter</b> could be extracted from the tissues. This demonstrates that the cells which gave the 'spurious' reaction did contain lipid. Hence it seems probable that extraction with solvents does not remove all lipids but may make those that remain more available for staining, so giving rise to what has been considered to be a spurious reaction. The nature of the binding of lipid to protein and the relevance of such complexe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{ingredients}} on the reactions occurring during the making of sponge cake and leading to the generation of volatile compounds related to flavour quality. To obtain systems sensitive to lipid oxidation (LO), a formulation design was applied varying the composition of <b>fatty</b> <b>matter</b> and eggs. Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and formation of related volatile compounds were followed at the different steps of cake-making. Optimised dynamic Solid Phase Micro Extraction was applied to selectively extract either volatile or semi-volatile compounds directly from the baking vapours. We show {{for the first time}} that in the case of alveolar baked products, lipid oxidation occurs very early during the step of dough preparation and to a minor extent during the baking process. The generation of lipid oxidation compounds depends on PUFA content and on the presence of endogenous antioxidants in the raw matter. Egg yolk seemed to play a double role on reactivity: protecting unsaturated lipids from oxidation and being necessary to generate a broad class of compounds of the Maillard reaction during baking and linked to the typical flavour of sponge cake...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of sodium nitrate administration on some biochemical parameters and to explore the ability of Wheat germ oil (WGO) as a natural source of antioxidants to minimize the deleterious effects of sodium nitrate. The results showed significant increase in alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and significant decrease in butyryl cholinestersea (BChE) content in hepatic tissue in nitrate group as compared to control and wheat germ oil groups through the experimental period. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) accompanied by significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) content in rat renal tissue after 28 and 42 days of treatment with drinking water containing sodium nitrate. Significant decrease was also observed in serum estradiol (E 2) in group treated with nitrate through the experimental period. In addition, microscopically examination of renal tissue showed atrophy of glomerular tuft and congestion of renal blood vessels in nitrate treated group. Administration of WGO to rats with sodium nitrate suggesting role of WGO as a natural protective antioxidant agent in hepatic and renal tissues. WGO also stimulates estrogen secretion and inhibits oxidative damage that may be attributed to the presence of biologically active components (unsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids, unsaponifible <b>matters</b> and sterols matters) as antioxidant and cyto-protective activities. It can be concluded that WGO offers a great advantage for therapeutic purpose to minimized sodium nitrate free radical induced cell damage...|$|R

40|$|The study {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} oil fraction of 8 types of edible nuts available on the Polish market. All tested nuts were characterized with high content of dry <b>matter.</b> <b>Fatty</b> acid and sterol composition was analyzed by GC-MS. Squalene and tocopherol profiles were examined by HPLC with diode array (DAD) and fluorescence detectors (FLDs). The highest level of fat was found in macadamia (75. 4 g/ 100 g) and the lowest in cashew nuts (46. 9 g/ 100 g). Fatty analysis showed that nuts were rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fatty acids were predominant in most cases, {{with the exception of}} Brazilian nuts, walnuts and pine nuts which were richer in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Œ≤-Sitosterol was the main sterol of nuts, and its content ranged from 96. 9 mg/ 100 g of oil (in macadamia) to 474. 8 mg/ 100 g of oil (in pistachio). Œ≥-Tocopherol homologue was predominant among its fraction with the largest content determined in pistachio (8. 3 mg/ 100 g of oil) and walnuts (8. 6 mg/ 100 g of oil). The presence of squalene was confirmed in seven types of nuts, and the richest source of it were Brazilian nuts (145. 8 mg/ 100 g of oil). The study proofs the variation of nut oil composition, especially phytosterol and tocopherol content and can be used for better characterization of nuts derived from different geographic areas or cultivars...|$|R
