40|$|Vast {{areas of}} central Saskatchewan are {{occupied}} by aspen groves, aspen forest and mixed-wood (Rowe, 1959). A {{part of the}} aspen forest has been cleared and is now utilized as pastures. These pastures may {{be referred to as}} 'wooded', 'bushland' or 'northern wooded' pastures. Though, historically, the utilization of the wooded pastures {{can be traced back to}} the times of early settlers, their development as government sponsored pasture dates back to the early 1940 's. While the first government community pasture in the grassland zone was established in 1922 at Matador (Moen, 1964), it was not until 1941 that a community pasture was set up at Beaver Hills in the forest zone. By the early 1950 's it became obvious that the livestock industry was being greatly hampered by insufficient grazing facilities. The pastures in the grassland region could not cope with the increasing demand for grazing needs due to low carrying capacity as a result of frequent droughts. In the northern fringe of settlement there were still present vast areas of unutilized submarginal lands under aspen forest. The soil under aspen forest is podzolic, often low in fertility, of sandy texture, stony and poorly drained in low lying areas so that its tillage for cereal crops was not feasible. The importance of wooded pastures would further increase with the rising demand of beef production. Haase (1964) has outlined the need and importance of increased forage production in Canada. He suggested that an additional 15 million acres of improved land would be needed by 1980. The investigators in various fields discussed effectively the problems and needed fields of study in the establishment of northern wooded pastures in a meeting on "The development of pasture from bushlands in western Canada" under the auspecies of Canada Department of Agriculture in 1964. Perhaps, the most important aspect of the problems that were discussed at the meeting, was the need for understanding the response of vegetation, native as well as seeded, to grazing. The present study was undertaken primarily to consider the effect of grazing on herbaceous vegetation in wooded pastures. This involved the selection and study of comparable grazed and ungrazed stands under three different 'habitat' types: forest; forest, cleared; and forest, cleared, ploughed and seeded. The study sites were located in areas, potentially capable of supporting aspen forest on podzolic, degraded black or <b>grey</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>soil.</b> Populus tremuloides is the dominant tree species and Fragaria vesca, Lathyrus venosus, Vicia americana, Aster ciliolatus, Galium septentrionale, Thalictrum dasycarpum, Bromus ciliatus, Agropyron subsecundum and Schizachne purpurascens are the common herb species in undisturbed sites. Poa pratensis and Poa palustris are the dominant grasses in cleared areas while Bromus inermis, Agropyron cristatum and Medicago sativa are the most common species in seeded areas...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} measure, using C 14, the dissimilation of added plant tissue in soil and to study {{the effect of these}} additions upon the mineralisation of native soil organic matter. Oat plants were uniformly labeled by growth in an atmosphere enriched with C 14 O 2. A biosynthesis chamber, built from ordinary laboratory equipment, was used for the labeling of plants. To facilitate uni­form labeling, the net assimilation of C 14 O 2 was measured by tracing the changes in radioactivity in the atmosphere of the chamber. At the end of the 35 day labeling period, 98. 7 % of the released radioactivity was recovered in the plant and soil system. Eighty six percent of this was retained in the above-ground parts of the plants. Dry sieving and hand picking removed 54 % of the labeled root material from the soil. Subsequent incubation of this soil showed a rapid mineralisation (86 %) of the unrecovered labeled material. The addition of 1 % (22. 6 tons/ha or 10 tons/acre) labeled oat straw to a Chernozemic (Oxbow) and to a Grey Wooded (Waitville) soil resulted in a markedly accelerated mineralisation of native organic matter ("priming effect"), especially during the initial two weeks of incubation. The amount of organic matter lost due to priming, after 222 days of incubation, was quite considerable. Thus, 34 % and 58 % more native soil carbon was mineralized from the amended Oxbow and Waitville soils than from the respective unamended soils. The priming effect tapered off earlier in the Waitville than in the Oxbow soil. This difference in duration of priming and in the susceptibility towards priming is evidence of a more rapid turnover of humus in the <b>Grey</b> <b>Wooded</b> <b>soil.</b> Isotopic measurements showed that the extent of plant tissue mineralisation was essentially equal in both soils. A comparison of tracer and non-tracer techniques revealed that non-isotopic methods of evaluation considerably over-estimated (in some cases up to 27 %) the extent of plant residue mineralisation in soil. A radioactivity balance sheet for the incubated soils showed that either the direct measurement of C 14 O 2 evolved or the indirect determination by measuring the amount of C 14 retained in soil, were reliable in estimating the amount of plant residues decomposed in soil after extended incubation periods. The large quantities of mineral nitrogen, measured after 65 days of incubation, indicated that most of the humus-N mineralized during the initial period of strong priming was derived from the nitrogen-rich fraction of hydrolysable humus. It was concluded that, on a short-term basis, the dynamics of soil organic matter turnover in an organically amended soil represent in essence an exchange of carbon in the hydrolysable or "active" soil humus. The large amount of soil carbon lost initially due to priming was offset by the occurrence of a plant carbon 11 "sparing" effect during the later stages of incubation. Thus, the priming effect of added plant tissues did not result in a net loss of total soil carbon...|$|E

In this research, a polyphasic methodology has been used to investigate changes in microbial community structure and function in a series of tropical soils in western Kenya. These soils have different land usage with both <b>wooded</b> and agricultural <b>soils</b> at Kakamega and Ochinga, whereas at Ochinga, Leuro, Teso, and Ugunja a replicated field experiment compared traditional continuous maize cropping against an improved N-fixing fallow system. For all sites, principal component analysis of 16 S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles revealed that soil type was the key determinant of total bacterial community structure, with secondary variation found between <b>wooded</b> and agricultural <b>soils.</b> Similarly, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis also separated <b>wooded</b> from agricultural <b>soils,</b> primarily on the basis of higher abundance of monounsaturated fatty acids, anteiso- and iso-branched fatty acids, and methyl-branched fatty acids in the <b>wooded</b> <b>soils.</b> At Kakamega and Ochinga <b>wooded</b> <b>soils</b> had between five 5 and 10 -fold higher levels of soil carbon and microbial biomass carbon than agricultural soils from the same location, whereas total enzyme activities were also lower in the agricultural sites. Soils with woody vegetation had a lower percentage of phosphatase activity and higher cellulase and chitinase activities than the agricultural soils. BIOLOG analysis showed woodland soils to have the greatest substrate diversity. Throughout the study the two functional indicators (enzyme activity and BIOLOG), however, showed lower specificity with respect to soil type and land usage than did the compositional indicators (DGGE and PLFA). In the field experiment comparing two types of maize cropping, both the maize yields and total microbial biomass were found to increase with the fallow system. Moreover, 16 S rRNA gene and PLFA analyses revealed shifts in the total microbial community in response to the different management regimes, indicating that deliberate management of soils can have considerable impact on microbial community structure and function in tropical soils.

They have grayish coloured, leached surface (Ae) horizons and clayey subsoil (Bt) horizons where the main soil-forming process is the downwards movement or translocation of clay minerals. When cultivated, the generally silty, low organic matter surface horizons are of poor tilth and generally deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur. The clayey Bt horizons are slowly permeable to water and difficult for roots to grow into. Despite these limitations, and the cool climate that limits the range of crops, Gray Luvisols can be improved with good farming.

40|$|The grey-wooded soils of Western Canada are {{becoming}} increasingly important {{due to the fact}} that future settlement will be largely confined to such soils. In the Peace River region today sizeable tracts of <b>wooded</b> <b>soils</b> are being brushed and broken for crop production by modern power machinery. Over the three Prairie Provinces grey-wooded soils consist well in excess of 100, 000, 000 acres and of the four major soil zones (brown, dark brown, black, grey-wooded) they represent by far the largest area. About two-thirds of the entire province of Alberta is made up of the grey soil zone. Vyatt (39) points out that ultimately over 50 per cent of all cropped land of this province will belong to the grey soil group. Of the surveyed area of the Peace River region 78 per cent or approximately 13, 000, 000 acres is of the grey-wooded or grey-transitional type. The grey-wooded soils are generally rather poor in fertility as they represent a degraded phase, the result of prolonged leaching under a forest cover. Under cultivation their scant organic matter rapidly disappears and the limited amount of available nitrogen is quickly absorbed by crop growth. Moreover, their initial poor physical condition is enhanced with puddling, washing, and blowing as the inevitable result. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Zinc {{speciation}} was {{studied by}} EXAFS spectroscopy, m-SXRF elemental mapping, XRD, and chemical extraction methods in two smelter-impacted soils sampled {{near one of}} the largest Pb and Zn processing plants in Europe, which is located in northern France about 50 km south of Lille. The tilled and <b>wooded</b> <b>soils</b> chosen for study differ in Zn concentration (ª 600 and 1400 mg/kg, respectively), soil pH (7. 5 and 5. 5, respectively), and organic matter content (1. 5 and 6. 4 wt% TOC, respectively). In both soils, the occurrence of Fe- and Zn-rich (up to 10 wt% Zn) slag particles ranging in size from a few micrometers to a few millimeters, was shown by m-SXRF elemental mapping of soil thin sections as well as by SEM and chemical analysis of different soil size fractions. For both soils, XRD analysis of the dense coarse fraction, which contains up to 10 wt% Zn, revealed the presence of a minor amount (1 – 1. 5 wt%) of crystalline ZnS (sphalerite and wurtzite). In this fraction, EXAFS data show that Zn is mainly incorporated in the tetrahedral sites of a magnetite- franklinite solid solution. The clay fraction (< 2 mm) represents the largest pool of Zn in both soils, with 77 and 62 % of the total Zn in the tilled and <b>wooded</b> <b>soils,</b> respectively. However, XRD was not able to detect any Znbearing phases in this fraction. Comparison of Zn K-EXAFS data of untreated and chemically treated samples from the bulk (< 2 mm) and the clay (< 2 mm) soil fractions with Zn K-EXAFS data from more than 30 model compounds suggests that Zn is present in the following chemical forms: (1) Zn outer-sphere complexes, (2) Zn-organic matter inner-sphere complexes, (3) Zn/Al-hydrotalcite (Zn/ Al-HTLC), (4) phyllosilicates in which Zn is present in the dioctahedral layer at dilute levels, and (5) magnetite-franklinite solid solutions inherited from the smelting process. The presence of exchangeable Zn outer-sphere complexes and of Zn inner-sphere complexes on organic matter is indicated by the relative increase of second-neighbor contributions in the EXAFS RDFs after chemical treatments with 0. 01 M CaCl 2 and 0. 1 M Na 4 P 2 O 7. The occurrence of Zn/Al-HTLC is demonstrated by the persistence of a Zn-Zn pair correlation at 3. 10 ± 0. 04 Å (i. e., edge sharing ZnO 6 octahedra in the trioctahedral layer structure) in EXAFS data of Na 4 P 2 O 7 treated soil samples and its disappearance after treatment with 0. 45 M HNO 3. This latter treatment also revealed the occurrence of Znbearing phyllosilicate minerals, as shown by two Zn-Mg/Al/Si pair correlations at 3. 05 ± 0. 04 Å and 3. 26 ± 0. 04 Å, and of magnetite-franklinite solid solutions, as indicated by a Zn-Mn/Fe/Zn pair correlation at 3. 50 ± 0. 04 Å. Significant changes in the relative proportions of the different forms of Zn between the two soils explain their different responses to chemical treatments and emphasizes the relationships between solid state speciation and mobility of Zn in soils...|$|R

Calcareous organic-matter-rich Black Chernozemic soils often persist under poplar forests in Saskatchewan, not acquiring the Ae horizons and related properties more characteristic of Gray Luvisol soils. These are Rego Black Chernozems, locally termed “Wooded Calcareous” {{because of the}} occurrence of a dark, calcareous horizon (AC) at depths of 10 to 30 cm. We hypothesize that dark, calcareous horizons are former Bm horizons that have been recarbonated because of intense bio- cycling of Ca by aspen (Populus tremuloides). The comparatively small amounts of carbonate occur mainly in the fine silt and clay fractions, and are dominantly calcite, indicating secondary origin, {{in comparison to the}} carbonate minerals of the Ck horizons where both calcite and dolomite occur, the latter more common in coarse fractions. The δ 13 C values of the carbonate minerals indi- cate that virtually all the carbonate in fine fractions of the upper horizons of the <b>Wooded</b> Calcareous <b>soil</b> is pedogenic. The dom- inance of pedogenic carbonate in the Ahk and AC horizons of the <b>Wooded</b> Calcareous <b>soil</b> is consistent with a secondary enrichment, a probable result of increased biocycling of Ca where aspen grows on sites with large amounts of soluble Ca in the subsoil.

40|$|Background: This {{research}} is part of a project aimed at verifying the potential of a specifically assessed wooded riparian zone in removing excess of combined nitrogen from a river flow for the reduction of nutrient input into Venice Lagoon. Objectives: 1. To compare microbial metabolic activities in the wooded riparian strip (internal) to that of external soil. 2. To characterize bacterial populations colonizing that soil at different depths. Methods: Cultivation on complex solid media, LIVE/DEAD BacLight stains and CTC assay were used to determine culturable, viable and actively metabolizing bacterial cells, respectively. Microbial diversity of colturable populations was analyzed by Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA). Results: As expected, the number of culturable, total living and metabolically active cells followed seasonal fluctuations and significantly higher values were always found for surface soils as compared to medium and deep samples. The main difference observed between the <b>wooded</b> riparian <b>soil</b> and the external samples was the number of metabolically working cells, although the total number of living bacteria was almost the same. Several hundreds colonies were isolated from the wooded riparian strip, 16 S rDNA was amplified and HinfI- and HpaII-restricted. A variety of different DNA fragment patterns was revealed. Conclusions: The results obtained indicated that the plant {{play an important role in}} supporting microbial growth in soil by overcoming the main limiting factor, almost always represented by the availability of organic carbon.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{proposition}} of a fully automatic classification of VHR satellite images. Unlike the most widespread approaches: supervised classification, which requires prior defining of class signatures, or unsupervised classification, which must be followed by an interpretation of its results, the proposed method requires no human intervention except for {{the setting of the}} initial parameters. The presented approach bases on both spectral and textural analysis of the image and consists of 3 steps. The first step, the analysis of spectral data, relies on NDVI values. Its purpose is to distinguish between basic classes, such as water, vegetation and non-vegetation, which all differ significantly spectrally, thus they can be easily extracted basing on spectral analysis. The second step relies on granulometric maps. These are the product of local granulometric analysis of an image and present information on the texture of each pixel neighbourhood, depending on the texture grain. The purpose of texture analysis is to distinguish between different classes, spectrally similar, but yet of different texture, e. g. bare soil from a built-up area, or low vegetation from a wooded area. Due to the use of granulometric analysis, based on mathematical morphology opening and closing, the results are resistant to the border effect (qualifying borders of objects in an image as spaces of high texture), which affect other methods of texture analysis like GLCM statistics or fractal analysis. Therefore, the effectiveness of the analysis is relatively high. Several indices based on values of different granulometric maps have been developed to simplify the extraction of classes of different texture. The third and final step of the process relies on a vegetation index, based on near infrared and blue bands. Its purpose is to correct partially misclassified pixels. All the indices used in the classification model developed relate to reflectance values, so the preliminary step of recalculation of pixel DNs to reflectance is required. Thanks to this, the proposed approach is in theory universal, and might be applied to different satellite system images of different acquisition dates. The test data consists of 3 Pleiades images captured on different dates. Research allowed to determine optimal indices values. Using the same parameters, we obtained a very good accuracy of extraction of 5 land cover/use classes: water, low vegetation, bare <b>soil,</b> <b>wooded</b> area and built-up area in all the test images (kappa from 87 % to 96 %). What constitutes important, even significant changes in parameter values, did not cause a significant declination of classification accuracy, which demonstrates how robust the proposed method is...|$|R
40|$|ECOSYSTEMIC GOODS AND SERVICES IN TEMPERATE FORESTS: QUANTITY-QUALITY OF WATER AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION UNDER VARIOUS SCENARIOS OF FOREST USE AND MANAGEMENT Goods and {{services}} generated by temperate forests are highly {{important for the}} environment at a local and global level, and have a significant economic impact at a domestic and international level. Among their benefits, 3 of them are increasingly important: production of wood and fibre, production of quality water and in big amounts, and carbon sequestration. Therefore, implementing management schemes in watersheds covered by wooded vegetation that allow optimising the obtaining of these goods {{and services}} is a challenge. Native forests {{play a key role}} on water resources as it has been pointed that these forests gradually deliver water to streams and rivers that drain wooded basins, which during summer have water flows that are 3 to 6 times bigger than those in watersheds with a different use of the <b>soil.</b> In native <b>wooded</b> ecosystems, nutrient flows are closely related to the water cycle, with a high percentage of internal supply. The degree of NO 3 retention in forest ecosystems would depend on relative nitrogen sources and on the accumulation capacity determined by the characteristics of the ecosystem (age, soil and content of organic matter in the soil) and by anthropic influences (management practices). NO 3 retention should be maximum or near maximum in <b>wooded</b> ecosystems with <b>soils</b> recently developed on volcanic ash deposits or recent glaciations. Inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen, exported from micro basins in the South of Chile, are 20 % and 80 %, respectively. This means that the soils have a biotic or a-biotic mechanism for NO 3 or NH 4 retention, thus substantially reducing losses under restrictive conditions of the element. Dead leaves and the thick wooden material (trunks and branches) are the main contribution of organic matter and nutrients to the soil. A high provision of fallen leaves improves the soil structure and its ability to retain humidity, which is a basic condition for a forest’s productive potential. Scientific data from various decades make it possible today to develop silvicultural management schemes in diverse Chilean forest types, which should be oriented towards achieving production of wood goods and ecosytemic services, including regulation of water regimes and carbon capture, considering that adult multistratified forests retain more nutrients than secondary forests, and produce more water due to their greater capacity of storage/release, and their lower grow rates. It is, therefore, necessary to design silvicultural schemes in order to produce wood and fibre without significantly jeopardizing the ability of the forests to retain carbon and produce water. These schemes should result in forests with continuous cover and mixed composition, with a matrix of pioneer and successional species and with few veteran trees. Our general hypothesis is that an optimal production of wood and fibre, water and carbon sequestration is achieved in these forests. Positive growth rates and high levels of nutrient retention and water production are registered in these trees.
