25|$|Until the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were {{re-engineered}} with drop safeties (such as {{firing pin}} blocks, hammer blocks, or transfer bars) that prevent {{the firing pin}} from contacting the cartridge's primer unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the primer of a cartridge. If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> to help prevent its accidental loss.|$|E
5000|$|The Bianchi Cup, {{a fusion}} of IPSC (without the [...] "run and gun" [...] element) and {{bullseye}} shooting (except shot with two hands and going prone whenever rules allow it) where accuracy under tight time limits in four simulated scenarios, known as the [...] "Event(s)", {{is the basis of}} this competition. Shooters must start with <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> on every strings of fire and distances range from 10 to 50 yards.|$|E
50|$|Most uniformed police {{officers}} usually wore {{a variation of}} the Jordan holster: sturdily designed, with no leather over the trigger guard or shrouding the hammer, and with a metal shank inside a drop loop to position the holster well below the waist so the gun butt stood away from the body and was angled forward and could easily be drawn in a big hurry when necessary. This was an excellent type of holster for quick-draw because it was difficult for the shooter to jam the <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> during the draw. This type of holster usually had an over-the-hammer safety strap to lock the gun into the holster. The student was expected to unsnap the safety strap whenever he might be approaching a dangerous situation; but, if desired, McDaniel could teach him how to unsnap the safety strap {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw without ever slowing his hand. The currently popular thumb-break safety strap is not suitable for quick-draw, because it requires the shooter to stop his hand completely while popping the strap.|$|E
5000|$|Julian informs Mitch that he {{has never}} worked for the FBI and has {{obtained}} his wealth through the [...] "entertainment industry." [...] Julian has his two henchmen disarm Mitch and take him outside the city to be disposed of. Mitch manages to kill his executioners with <b>the</b> forgotten <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ankle <b>holster</b> and returns to his parents' house where he finds them dead. Again, the scene has been set up as if Mitch had killed his parents, although this time, Mitch believes Anson to be behind the setup.|$|R
50|$|In addition, wise {{students}} of quick-draw for combat shooting seldom practice drawing and firing a loaded double-action revolver or automatic at top speed. They draw and dry fire an empty gun at top speed, but draw and shoot a loaded gun at a significantly slower speed. On the few occasions when an experienced shooter does practice a maximum-speed quick-draw with a revolver, he generally loads five {{rounds of ammunition}} into the six-shot cylinder, so {{that the first time}} he pulls the trigger, the hammer will fall on an empty chamber. If he screws up the draw, the sound of the hammer falling on the empty chamber while <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> is still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> will generally be enough to stop him from pulling the trigger again, firing a loaded cartridge into his leg the second time. And the wise practitioner uses a firmly anchored quick-draw-holster, which will release the gun very easily, whether it be a belt holster or a concealment rig.|$|R

50|$|Pocket pistols {{are carried}} {{with a round}} chambered, and with a safety engaged (ON), for single-action designs. However, with the 5 to 6 lbf (22 to 27 N) trigger pulls seen on double-action-only long trigger pull handguns without any {{external}} safety, and with a round chambered, the use of form-fitting trigger-covering holsters prevents inadvertently discharging the gun while it is carried, <b>in</b> much <b>the</b> same way that a revolver can be carried without an external safety. The use of moisture and vapor-barrier layers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> stitched closer to <b>the</b> body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> is recommended to prevent damaging the finish of the pocket pistol due to sweat. This extra layer also serves to increase carry comfort, and to prevent chapping or blistering the skin under <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> due to repetitive motion rubbing or friction that can occur while walking, jogging, or running.|$|R
50|$|The thumb break {{helps to}} prevent an {{unauthorized}} person from drawing a pistol or knife from another person's body.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Berns-Martin <b>holster</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s by J.E. Berns of the Navy Rifle Team, who, assigned to shore duty in Alaska, {{decided he wanted}} to carry a long-barrelled gun for hunting and invented a holster that allowed him to carry such a revolver high on his hip and out of the Alaskan snow. The leather work was left to Berns' Navy teammate Martin, and hence the name [...] "Berns-Martin" [...] for the company. [...] <b>The</b> <b>holster</b> was patented by John Emmett Berns in 1935 as 2,001,321 for a Revolver Holster. [...] When used <b>in</b> a hip <b>holster,</b> <b>the</b> revolver is drawn by pushing down (slightly) on the revolver grip while rocking the top of the revolver forward through the open front of <b>the</b> <b>holster.</b> While <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster,</b> a leather covered steel spring holds the revolver cylinder (and the rest of <b>the</b> revolver) securely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster,</b> regardless of what physical gyrations the wearer might go through. No less an authority than Jeff Cooper stated that <b>the</b> Berns-Martin <b>holster</b> [...] "keeps <b>the</b> pistol secure enough for anything up to parachute jumping, and yet permit drawing without releasing any latch or strap beforehand." ...|$|R
60|$|But as {{she fought}} to free herself one hand came <b>in</b> contact with <b>the</b> butt of Malbihn's {{revolver}} where it rested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> at his hip.

60|$|I never budged {{so much as}} an inch till that thundering {{apparition}} had got within fifteen paces of me; then I snatched a dragoon revolver out of my holster, {{there was}} a flash and a roar, and the revolver was back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> before anybody could tell what had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{to speak}} of, Smithson. See to Miss Ellison, first. There is some water in my flask <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster.</b> Just bring it here, and {{sprinkle}} her face. I hope {{she is only}} stunned; but that scoundrel threw her off with such force, that she may well be badly hurt." ...|$|R
60|$|The big {{automatic}} pistol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> on <b>the</b> wall, handy to one's {{hand from the}} bed, caught her eye. She reached to it and lifted gently at the butt. It was as she had expected--loose--Dick's way. Trust him, {{no matter how long}} unused, never to let a pistol freeze in its holster.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> ammunition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saddle-bags, each carried a powder-horn {{and a bag}} of bullets over his shoulder. <b>The</b> revolvers were <b>in</b> their belts, and the rifles slung behind them. While Jerry was away at the fort Tom had made and baked three loaves, which were cut up and put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holsters.</b>|$|R

Todd carried a pistol, of the [...] "hoss" [...] variety and nearly two feet long, the same being deposited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> of his saddle.|$|R
60|$|A brace of pistols {{were placed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holsters,</b> {{and with a}} last {{farewell}} to the farmer Malcolm gave the rein to his horse and rode away from the village. He travelled fast now and without fear of interruption. The sight of armed men riding to join one or other of the armies was too common to attract any attention, and avoiding large towns Malcolm rode unmolested across the plain.|$|R
60|$|Most of the {{men were}} already fast asleep, but as soon as they learned that there was a {{prospect}} of active work all were full of life and animation. The girths of the saddles were tightened, swords buckled on, and revolvers carefully examined before being placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holsters.</b> Many of <b>the</b> men carried repeating rifles, and the magazines were filled before these were slung across the riders' shoulders.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2007 film, Charlie Prince carries two Smith & Wesson Schofield Model 3 revolvers in butts-forward {{holsters}} {{built by}} Will Ghormley. Ghormley also designed Prince's holsters. Thell Reed extensively trained Foster in multiple quick draw and spinning techniques prior to filming. The Schofields {{were also used}} by Wade to kill Prince. Thell, the armorer, felt <b>the</b> arched back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holsters</b> impeded Foster’s ability to draw. Ultimately the arches were removed {{even though they were}} period correct. Also <b>the</b> <b>holsters</b> on <b>the</b> final rig were made ‘baggier’ than <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> on <b>the</b> prototype so Foster could holster his pistols with less resistance. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1957 film, he used a Colt Peacemaker.|$|R
60|$|The saddle was {{furnished}} with valises. These contained several articles {{he had not}} thought of buying, among them a warm fur cap with flaps for the ears, {{and a pair of}} fur-lined riding gloves. He transferred the remaining articles from the little trunk to the valises, and threw the former away; rolled up his cloak and strapped it behind the saddle; and then mounted. He was glad to find <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holsters</b> a brace of double-barrelled pistols, a powder flask and a bag of bullets, and also a large flask full of spirits.|$|R
50|$|Holster {{designs for}} {{firearms}} cover {{a wide variety}} of shapes, sizes, and materials. Holsters are generally designed to offer protection to the firearm, secure retention, and provide access to it. The most popular options of BWB holsters resemble fanny packs or a pouch type of concealment for the firearm. As an added safety feature a few of <b>the</b> BWB <b>holsters</b> ensure <b>the</b> trigger is inaccessible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> until <b>the</b> firearm is drawn. Concealment holsters are designed to easily conceal sub-compact and compact firearms while a few even offer options for full-sized firearms. Because BWB Holsters are designed to be worn below the waistband, under clothing and held close to the body, comfort is important.|$|R
60|$|The colonel bent quietly {{before the}} storm; and leaving <b>the</b> wounded man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{care of his}} daughter-in-law and the attendants, {{made his way to}} the stables, to inquire what had become of Rupert. There he found that a few minutes before, Rupert, {{accompanied}} by Hugh Parsons, had ridden off at full speed, having placed valises and a brace of pistols <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holsters</b> on their saddles. The colonel was glad to hear that Rupert had his humble friend with him, and doubted not that he had made for London. With a somewhat lightened heart he went back to the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "We won't {{lose sight}} of him again," [...] Charlie said. [...] "Though, if we do, we shall know where {{to pick up his}} traces, for he evidently frequents this place. I should say he has taken to the road. There were a brace of pistols <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holsters.</b> That is how it is that we have not found him before. Well, at any rate, there is no use trying to make his {{acquaintance}} here. The first question is, will he stay here for the night or not--and if he does not, which way will he go?" ...|$|R
50|$|For {{practicing}} quick-draw extensively, {{the very}} best bet is a Jordan holster sewn to a wide stout belt, with tie-down straps to secure the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> firmly to your leg. It is best to prep a new quick-draw <b>holster</b> by putting <b>the</b> gun inside of six or seven gallon-size Ziploc bags and sealing each one, then wetting <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> thoroughly <b>in</b> a bucket of warm water with a little soap in it and jamming the gun into <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> to shape it, then letting <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> dry completely. Without the bags, the gun will be a loose fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster.</b> For uniformed police-officers, it does them good {{to learn how to}} unsnap the safety strap, which is snapped across the hammer to lock the gun into <b>the</b> <b>holster,</b> {{as an integral part of}} the quick-draw, without slowing or stopping <b>the</b> hand <b>in</b> that process. (Do not use a thumb-break safety strap for quick-draw.) A shoe-repair shop can sew a small bent-up piece of sheet metal to the bottom of the tag-end of the safety strap to hold it away from <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> and enable <b>the</b> extended fingers sweeping up the side of <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> to pop <b>the</b> snap on the safety strap so that it will fly up out of the way as the hand draws the gun.|$|R

50|$|While at {{the police}} department, and booking Varley into the last jail cell, Constable Ferguson stated that Varley had pulled his {{bulletproof}} vest {{over his head and}} gained momentary control of his pistol through what experts testified was a little-known defect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>holster</b> design. An altercation occurred at which time Ferguson regained enough control of the gun to fire two quick shots. One grazed the side of Varley's abdomen and the other shot pierced his skull just behind the ear. Varley, now breathing with severe difficulty, lay wounded on the cell floor while Constable Ferguson called the ambulance, which attended moments later. Varley was airlifted to a Calgary hospital where he was pronounced dead.|$|R
