Misinterpretation of the flashing driver's intent can cause crashes.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{character}} designer Tatsuhiko Kanaoka, {{better known}} as [...] "Falcoon", said K' {{was one of his}} favorite original King of Fighters characters. Music composer Sha-V suggested that K' should yell [...] "Dora!" [...] or [...] "Ora!" [...] to mirror Kyo and Iori's shouts, [...] "Kurae!" [...] and [...] "Doushita!" [...] respectively. Konny, another music composer, jokingly wondered if K' <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the word [...] "dry", since the first word of his yell was [...] "Dorei!" [...] Originally, K' was voiced by Yuuki Matsuda. However, by The King of Fighters XIV, he was replaced by Yoshihisa Kawahara.|$|E
500|$|Nellie {{does not}} sing {{together}} with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin {{that she would}} not have to compete vocally with Pinza, but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music. [...] A tetrachord, heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to [...] "Dites-Moi", the show's first song. [...] Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as [...] "Twin Soliloquies") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of [...] "Some Enchanted Evening". [...] Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with her Act II line [...] "We're the same sort of people fundamentally– you and me".|$|E

2500|$|In an {{epilogue}} titled [...] "3 Memory/historical misfortune" [...] Roxy {{is again}} in the countryside while a voiceover narration representing Roxy's thoughts (and paraphrasing Clifford D. Simak's Time and Again) wonders what the water <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to him. A narrator mentions that Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein near the couples house in Cologny; Shelley {{is seen in the}} country writing her book with quill and ink and is joined by Lord Byron and Percy Shelley. An unseen man and woman (Godard and Florence Colombani) paint with watercolors and black ink. They order Roxy {{out of the room and}} (paraphrasing Dostoyevsky's Demons) compare Kirillov's two questions, [...] "a big one and a little one" [...] (the other world and suffering) and the [...] "difficult fit flatness into depth" [...] to the act of creating art. [...] Roxy falls asleep on a couch as a narrator (Anne-Marie Miéville) describes his thoughts and the film ends with the sounds of a dog barking and a baby crying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rights" [...] is vague; I do {{not know}} what it means there. Mrs. Eddy is not well acquainted with the English language, and she is seldom able to say in it what she <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She has no ear for the exact word, and does not often get it. [...] "Rights." [...] Does it mean [...] "honors?" [...] "attributes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is too true. Much too true. Many, {{many times}} too true. She {{is a most}} trying witness--the most trying witness that ever kissed the Book, I am sure. There is no keeping up with her erratic testimony. As soon as you have got her share of the authorship nailed where you half hope and half believe it will stay and cannot be joggled loose any more, she joggles it loose again--or seems to; you cannot be sure, for her habit of dealing in {{meaningless}} metaphors instead of in plain, straightforward statistics, makes it nearly always impossible to tell just what it is she <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She was definite when she claimed both the language and {{the ideas of the}} book. That seemed to settle the matter. It seemed to distribute the percentages of credit with precision between the collaborators: ninety-two per cent. to Mrs. Eddy, who did all the work, and eight per cent. to the Deity, who furnished the inspiration not enough of it to damage the copyright in a country closed against Foreigners, and yet plenty to advertise the book and market it at famine rates. Then Mrs. Eddy does not keep still, but fetches around and comes forward and testifies again. It is most injudicious. For she resorts to metaphor this time, and it makes trouble, for she seems to reverse the percentages and claim only the eight per cent. for her self. I quote from Mr. Peabody's book (Eddyism, or Christian Science. Boston: 15 Court Square, price twenty-five cents): ...|$|E

5000|$|Lennevald {{created a}} new sound, {{assisted}} by producer Peter Björklund, in which his voice is the prime focus.

50|$|Free word order, with no {{syntactically}} governed {{positions for}} subject, object, verb etc. in a sentence. All {{this information is}} encoded in the morphology, which results in highly complex word structures. Interpreting these complex words correctly is crucial in determining what the speaker <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
50|$|Voice changers {{change the}} tone or pitch, add {{distortion}} to the user's voice, {{or a combination}} of all of the above and vary greatly in price and sophistication. A kazoo/didgeridoo {{can be used as a}} makeshift voice changer, though it can be difficult to understand what the person <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some Korean {{adjectives}} {{are derived}} using the copula. Separating these articles and nominalizing the former part will often {{result in a}} sentence with a related, but different meaning. Using the separated sentence {{in a situation where}} the un-separated sentence is appropriate is usually acceptable as the listener can decide what the speaker <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> using the context.|$|E

50|$|O’Brien uses {{examples}} of tales from his fellow soldiers {{to illustrate the}} fact that truth is a delicate and malleable thing {{when it comes to}} telling war stories. After all, anything can be faked... but generally, only the worst events can be proven real.

50|$|Chamorro is a VSO or verb-subject-object language. However, {{the word}} order {{can be very}} {{flexible}} and so change to SVO (subject-verb-object), like English, if necessary to convey different types of relative clauses depending on context and stressing parts of what someone <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or convey. Again, this is subject to debate as those on Guam believe the language is flexible whereas those in the CNMI do not.|$|E
50|$|In the Street Fighter Alpha games, Sodom is an American {{character}} {{trying to}} speak Japanese, he is a comedic object of ridicule in his failed attempts at the language. In the Japanese version of Street Fighter Alpha, Sodom's inability to speak fluent Japanese is portrayed in his win quotes by having him use English words that are pronounced similarly to whatever Japanese words he <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with a Japanese translation below.|$|E

50|$|Second, sharing {{opinions}} {{with peers}} is helpful in building and increasing one's confidence. Clearly expressing what one <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> requires confidence and sufficient knowledge; {{people need to}} self dress what to say with their own knowledge or experiences. Thus, giving useful feedback definitely strengthens one's confidence. Moreover, peer feedback helps student to take more responsibilities in learning process. Besides doing assignments, students have to read others' work carefully as well so that one is not only responsible for his/her own work but also the others'.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the androids refer contempuously to human beings as people who suffer from glandular {{disorders}} called emotions, Torn wants very much to suffer from these disorders himself. Eventually, he does. I have no intention of unraveling the whole plot which was not so much complicated as psychologically dense. If I understand him correctly, Mr. Bester <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that having androids to free us of mundane preoccupations like work is by no means good for us. His humans are pretty close to being bums.|$|E

He can {{translate}} what the nanny <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> The nanny {{told them that the}} nun also knew that Marco is her son.|$|E
