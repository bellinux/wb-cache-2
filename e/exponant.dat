40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the proof of dispersive estimates on stratified Lie groups of step 2, for the linear Schrödinger equation involving a sublaplacian. It turns out that the propagator behaves like a wave operator on a space of the same dimension p as the center of the group, and like a Schrödinger operator on a space of the same dimension k as the radical of the canonical skew-symmetric form, which suggests a decay with <b>exponant</b> -(k+p- 1) / 2. In this article, we identify a property of the canonical skew-symmetric form under which we establish optimal dispersive estimates with this rate. The relevance of this property is discussed through several examples...|$|E
40|$|A {{tight binding}} model {{on the general}} 1 D quasiperiodic chain is studied in the {{framework}} of perturbation theory, near the corresponding periodic chain, using a new set of coordinates. The main gaps are well described, whereas the very small ones are correctly given, only for a very small perturbation. For a given irrational number, the energies where the gaps appear in the periodic chain spectrum, are exactly derived. Moreover, a labelling for these gaps which orders them according to their decreasing width is naturally introduced, and an approached integrated density of states is explicitely written. As an application of this perturbative derivation, we give the first order expansion of δ the <b>exponant</b> which describes the vanishing of the total band width B of an approximant, when its size increases : B ∼ 1 /n δ. The first order expression for δ does not depend on the considered quasiperiodic chain...|$|E
40|$|Tool life is {{of major}} concern for {{economical}} {{production in the}} metal cutting industries and a simple method of predictive the tool wearability of materials would be of considerable value in enabling optimum cutting conditions to be determined. It {{has been shown that}} tool life for minimum cost Der piece = - 1) K where ‘n’ is the <b>exponant,</b> in the speed/life relationship VT - 11 = C. Since I n' is substantially constant for a given tool material and chip thickness, and K is constant for given operating conditions then the life of the tool (T) has an unique value under these circumstances. Also since tool life (T) will be determined by a specific magnitude of tool wear, a simple method by which the time to arrive at this criterion could be predicted would be very useful. In the experimental work to be described it has been possible from simple cutting tests to predict tool wear over a limited range of conditions— Much more extensive research is required to establish the range of the technique...|$|E

In its CFT formulation, the SLE dual Fokker-Planck operator acts as the two-particle Calogero hamiltonian on boundary primary fields and as the dilatation operator on bulk primary fields localized at the fixed point of the SLE map. Stochastic Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) [2, 3, 4] are random processes adapted to a probabilistic description of fractal curves or sets growing into simply connected planar domains U ⊂ C. They are expected to provide a rigorous description of two dimensional critical clusters in their continuous limit. SLEs depend on a real parameter κ. For 2 ≤ κ < 4, they are conjecturally related to the O(n) models in their dilute phase with n = − 2 cos(4 π/κ), and to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters of the Q-state Potts models with Q = 4 cos 2 (4 π/κ) for 4 ≤ κ < 8. We refer to refs. [6, 7] for an introduction to SLEs...|$|R
