40|$|The most-cited {{estimates}} of the prevalence of transsexualism are based on counts of <b>gender</b> <b>reassignments</b> in European clinics many years ago. Observing that reassignments {{have been in a}} start-up transient, we extend those results by recalculating prevalence from the accumulating incidence data, taking into account birth, reassignment and death rates and then, based on age-distributions of reassignment data, we determine the inherent number of persons who at some point in life will undergo reassignment. From this reanalysis of those early reports, we determine lower-bounds on the prevalence of the underlying condition of transsexualism to be between 1 : 1000 and 1 : 2000, using those reports own data. We then present more recent incidence data and alternative methods for estimating the prevalence of transsexualism, all of which indicate that the lower bound on the prevalence of transsexualism is at least 1 : 500, and possibly higher...|$|R

40|$|Purpose : Cloacal exstrophy is {{a complex}} multisystem anomaly. Due to {{ambiguous}} genitalia <b>gender</b> assignment or <b>reassignment</b> is common. The psychological, emotional and behavioral impact of this condition has rarely been investigated. Materials and Methods : We recruited 8 children with cloacal exstrophy born with genital ambiguity and a control group of 12 with cloacal anomalies born without genital ambiguity were recruited via urology-endocrine clinics at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. Patient age was 5 to 18 years (average 11. 3). The child behavior checklist, child health related {{quality of life and}} social cognition questionnaire were administered to assess perceived levels of social competence and adjustment, emotional and behavioral distress, and perceived quality of life. Results : Social and behavioral competence as well as psychological problems were comparable with normative data for the 2 groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the 2 groups on any competence, problem or social adjustment scale. A quality of life measure again revealed no significant differences in the groups. The scores obtained were comparable with those reported for other chronic illnesses. Conclusions : Results suggest that being born with cloacal exstrophy or anomaly and <b>gender</b> assignment or <b>reassignment</b> does not necessarily result in childhood psychological, emotional or behavioral distress and/or problems, lower levels of social competence or subjective reports of poor quality of life. It is suggested that longitudinal and larger studies are required to assess the long-term implications of this condition...|$|R

5000|$|This {{issue of}} <b>gender</b> and sexual <b>reassignment</b> raises {{the notion of}} disembodiment and its {{associated}} implications. [...] "Disembodiment" [...] {{is the idea that}} once the user is online, the need for the body is no longer required, and the user can participate separately from it. This ultimately relates to a sense of detachment from the identity defined by the physical body. In cyberspace, many aspects of sexual identity become blurred and are only defined by the user. Questions of truth will therefore be raised, particularly in reference to online dating and virtual sex. As McRae states, [...] "Virtual sex allows for a certain freedom of expression, of physical presentation and of experimentation beyond one's own real-life limits". At its best, it not only complicates but drastically unsettles the division between mind, body and self in a manner only possible through the construction of an online identity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Transsexualism (ICD- 10) is a {{condition}} characterized by a strong and persistent dissociation with one's assigned <b>gender.</b> Sex <b>reassignment</b> surgery (SRS) and hormone therapy provide a means of allowing transsexual individuals to feel more congruent with their gender and have {{played a major role}} in treatment over the past 70 years. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to play a key role in recovery from acute surgical trauma and environmentally mediated vulnerability to psychopathology. We hypothesize that BDNF may be a biomarker of alleviation of gender incongruence suffering. Objectives: To measure preoperative and postoperative serum BDNF levels in transsexual individuals as a biomarker of alleviation of stress related to gender incongruence after SRS. Methods: Thirty-two male-to-female transsexual people who underwent both surgery and hormonal treatment were selected from our initial sample. BDNF serum levels were assessed before and after SRS with sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The time elapsed between the pre-SRS and post-SRS blood collections was also measured. Results: No significant difference was found in pre-SRS or post-SRS BDNF levels or with relation to the time elapsed after SRS when BDNF levels were measured. Conclusion: Alleviation of the suffering related to gender incongruence after SRS cannot be assessed by BDNF alone. Surgical solutions may not provide a quick fix for psychological distress associated with transsexualism and SRS may serve as one step toward, rather than as the conclusion of, construction of a person's gender identity...|$|R
25|$|Since 4 April 2005, as per the Gender Recognition Act 2004, it is {{possible}} for transgender people to change their legal gender in the UK, allowing them to acquire a new birth certificate, affording them full recognition of their acquired sex in law for all purposes. Transgender people must present evidence to a Gender Recognition Panel, which considers their case and issues a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC); they must have transitioned two years before a GRC is issued. It is not a requirement for sex reassignment surgery to have taken place, although such surgery will be accepted as part of the supporting evidence for a case where it has taken place. There is formal approval of medical <b>gender</b> <b>reassignment</b> available either on the National Health Service (NHS) or privately.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the processes of}} gender role transition and sex reassignment {{from the perspectives of}} psychology, medicine, and sociology. Its main focus is on the various aspects influencing the psyche of a person undertaking transition. The thesis investigates why trans identity is commonly viewed as a pathology and the impact of pathologization on the self-perception of trans people. Furthemore, the traditional outline of the transition process in Czech sexology is compared to some current international approaches. A section of the text addresses psychotherapy as a key factor in transition. A significant component of the thesis is that it takes a sociocultural viewpoint on gender identity and gender roles. One of the goals is to understand how medical experts dealing with trans identity conceptualize transition and how trans people themselves conceptualize it. The overall aim is to investigate how both of these sides influence each other and what psychological aspects enter the processes of gender role transition and sex reassignment.
