40|$|This article {{traces the}} {{development}} and increased use of <b>exacted</b> conservation easements. Although <b>exacted</b> conservation easements are {{an extension of the}} conservation easement phenomenon, they do not embody the freedom of contract associated with other conservation easements and often tie directly to regulation of property. Thus, the <b>exacted</b> conservation easement is a tool that directly conflicts with many of the goals that gave rise to its emergence. The article concludes by questioning the practice of <b>exacting</b> conservation easements because of inherent conflicts with state conservation easement statutes, which did not contemplate the use of conservation easements as a tool of government regulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{enforceability}} of <b>exacted</b> conservation easements is {{a threshold}} question for their continued use. This brief article, {{prepared for the}} publication of the Environmental Law Section of the California Bar Association, builds on earlier work on <b>exacted</b> conservation easement to examine tricky enforceability questions arising in that state. In California, three statutes regulate agreements of this type: the Scenic Easement Deed Act (SEDA), the Open Space Easement Act (OSEA), and the Conservation Easement Act (CEA). It is not clear whether <b>exacted</b> conservation easements are permissible under any of these three statutes and the CEA’s requirement that conservation easements be “voluntary” and complicates matters. With {{a close look at the}} CEA and related case law, this article assesses the likelihood of enforcing <b>exacted</b> conservation easements in California. The California cases present two possibilities. One group of cases indicates that courts might choose to enforce <b>exacted</b> conservation easements based on the underlying law that served as the basis for the exaction. In such cases, it does not appear to matter whether the <b>exacted</b> conservation easements follow the requirements outlined in CEA or other California property law. Other cases, however, hint that courts might refuse to enforce <b>exacted</b> conservation easements that do not follow the requirements of California property law, requiring any created restrictions to adhere to the conservation easement or servitude statutes. The result is a conflicting legal landscape with few published cases and little legislative history to guide courts, local governments, and citizens...|$|R

5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} <b>exact</b> solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known <b>exact</b> solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. <b>Exact</b> solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E

5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought <b>exact</b> solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These <b>exact</b> solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different <b>exact</b> solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing <b>exact</b> solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known <b>exact</b> solutions.|$|E
