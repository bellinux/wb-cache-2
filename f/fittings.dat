5|$|Further {{repairs and}} <b>fittings</b> were done 1935–1936 by Caroe & Passmore (primarily to the Lady Chapel), and in 1960 by George Pace (the {{interior}} porch, and light <b>fittings).</b> The museum and chapel of St Padarn {{are the most}} recent works, aside from the re-casting and re-hanging of the peal of bells.|$|E

30|$|As the {{acquisition}} {{and use of}} 3 D data become more widespread, a number of methods have been proposed for estimating principal curvatures on a surface. Principal curvatures provide unique view-point invariant shape descriptors. One way to estimate principal curvatures is to perform surface <b>fitting.</b> A local <b>fitting</b> function is constructed and then curvature can be calculated analytically from the <b>fitting</b> function. The popular <b>fitting</b> methods include paraboloid <b>fitting</b> [22 – 24] and quadratic <b>fitting</b> [1, 25 – 27]. Apart from these <b>fitting</b> techniques, other methods have been proposed, such as higher-order <b>fitting</b> [5, 28] and circular <b>fitting</b> [29, 30].Cazals and Pouget[5] perform a polynomial <b>fitting</b> and show that the estimated curvatures converge to the true ones {{in the case of}} a general smooth surface. A comparison of local surface geometry estimation methods can be found in [31].|$|R

5|$|The A Station's {{control room}} was given many Art Deco <b>fittings</b> by {{architect}} Halliday. Italian marble {{was used in}} the turbine hall, and polished parquet floors and wrought-iron staircases were used throughout. Owing to a lack of available money following the Second World War, the interior of the B Station was not given the same treatment, and instead the <b>fittings</b> were made from stainless steel.|$|E

5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN <b>fittings</b> widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN <b>fittings,</b> so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
40|$|Data <b>fitting</b> is {{the main}} method of {{functional}} data analysis, and it is widely used {{in the fields of}} economy, social science, engineering technology and so on. Least square method {{is the main}} method of data <b>fitting,</b> but the least square method is not convergent, no memory property, big <b>fitting</b> error and it is easy to over <b>fitting.</b> Based on the orthogonal trigonometric function system, this paper presents a data forward stepwise <b>fitting</b> algorithm. This algorithm takes forward stepwise <b>fitting</b> strategy, each time using the nearest base function to fit the residual error generated by the previous base function <b>fitting,</b> which makes the residual mean square error minimum. In this paper, we theoretically prove the convergence, the memory property and the <b>fitting</b> error diminishing character for the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective, and the <b>fitting</b> performance is better than that of the least square method and the forward stepwise <b>fitting</b> algorithm based on the non-orthogonal function system...|$|R

40|$|Free-form {{surfaces}} {{are widely used}} in advanced optical and mechanical devices. In order to assess the form accuracy of free-form surfaces, it is needed to fit the measurement surface with the design template. To improve the <b>fitting</b> efficiency and accuracy, the <b>fitting</b> procedure {{is divided into two}} stages, rough <b>fitting</b> and final <b>fitting.</b> A new rough <b>fitting</b> method, called structured region signature is proposed. Structured region signature is a generalised global feature which represents the surface shape by a one-dimensional function. The template location occupying the best <b>fitting</b> signature is considered to be the correct initial position of the measurement surface. In the final <b>fitting,</b> the motion parameters are calculated iteratively using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Simulation and experiments are given to identify the validity of this method. It is demonstrated that the <b>fitting</b> accuracy is as high as 1 : 106...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{significant}} progress in deformable model <b>fitting</b> over the last decade, the problem of efficient and accurate person-independent face <b>fitting</b> remains a challenging problem. In this work, a reformulation of the generative <b>fitting</b> objective is presented, where only soft correspondences between the model and the image are enforced. This has the dual effect of improving robustness to unseen faces as well as affording <b>fitting</b> time which scales linearly with the model’s complexity. This approach is compared with three state-of-the-art <b>fitting</b> methods {{on the problem of}} person independent face <b>fitting,</b> where it is shown to closely approach the accuracy of the currently best performing method while affording significant computational savings. 1...|$|R
