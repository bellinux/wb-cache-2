As an immediate step George purchased a house in Clifton, near Bristol, where their third son, Charles, was born in 1857. The same year, as a longer-term measure, George took the position of vice-principal at Cheltenham College and they moved to a local house. They continued their support for liberal causes, including that of the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi, although their sympathy for the Union side in the American Civil War led to social ostracism; Josephine considered that the resultant feeling of social isolation [...] "was often painful... but the discipline was useful".|$|E
500|$|With the US {{entry into}} World WarII in 1941, copper and tin, which were both {{used in the}} cent, were in short supply. [...] Experiments were carried out by several {{corporations}} under contract from the Mint; they tested various metallic and non-metallic substances, including fiber, tempered glass, and several types of plastic. [...] These experiments used various designs, since actual Lincoln cent dies could not leave government custody. [...] As the experiments proceeded, production of bronze cents was cut back drastically in , and ceased in December. [...] On , 1942, Congress gave the mint authorization to change {{the composition of the}} cent for a three-year period, and five days later, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau announced that the coin would be made out of zinc-coated steel. [...] Zinc and iron form an electromagnetic [...] "couple"; the two metals soon corrode when in contact with each other in a <b>damp</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The public soon complained that the new coins were becoming spotted and stained. [...] Another common complaint was confusion with the dime, and some letters suggested that a hole be punched {{in the center of the}} new coins. Morgenthau responded that the new pieces would soon become darker, and that the Mint would be willing to darken them if it could figure out a suitable process.|$|E

In 1753, Lind published A Treatise of the Scurvy, in which he explained the details of his clinical trial, but it occupied only a few paragraphs in a work that was long and complex and had little impact. [...] In fact, Lind himself never actively promoted lemon juice as a single ‘cure’.

The {{early detection of}} corroded areas in oil and gas tanks and pipelines {{is an important issue}} to avoid any untoward incidents. In this study we introduce a new Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) method for corrosion inspec-tion on metallic surfaces. This approach considers gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) attributes to describe texture changes in metallic surface images and the Self Organizing Mapping (SOM) as a clustering algorithm to characterize corroded and non-corroded spots in the image.

2500|$|The main {{contributor}} to onychocryptosis is footwear, particularly ill-fitting shoes with inadequate toe-box room and tight stockings that apply {{pressure to the}} top or side of the foot. Other factors may include the <b>damp</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of enclosed shoes, which soften the nail-plate and cause swelling on the epidermal keratin (eventually increasing the convex arch permanently), genetics, trauma and disease. Improper cutting of the nail may cause the nail to cut into the side-fold skin from growth and impact, {{whether or not the}} nail is truly [...] "ingrown". The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle of its cut. If the cutting tool, such as scissors, is at an attitude in which the lower blade is closer to the toe than the upper blade, the toenail will tend to grow upwards from its base, and vice versa. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp advancing {{to the end of the}} nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center of the nail tip. Holding the tool at the same angle for all nails may induce these conditions; as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in the right attitude under the nail. When cutting a nail, it is not just the correct angle that is important, but also how short it is cut. A shorter cut will bend the nail more, unless the cut is even on both top and bottom of the nail.|$|E

40|$|Studies on the {{duration}} of the oviposition and incubation periods of Boophilus decoloratus (Koch, 1844) revealed that these non-parasitic periods are temperature dependent, increase in temperature causing shortening of the periods. Humidity had no effect on {{the duration}} of either the oviposition or the incubation periods. The relation between the mass of engorged female ticks and that of the eggs they produced was found to be linear. The viability of eggs produced during the first 13 days of oviposition (at 26 °C) was greater than that of eggs laid subsequently. The critical temperature for B. decoloratus eggs was found to be 42 °C and they were shown to be unable to take up water vapour from <b>damp</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Both temperature and humidity affected the hatch of eggs.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a short Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Data on {{atmospheric}} trace constituents and the vertical structure of stratus clouds from a 1996 expedition to the central Arctic reveal mechanisms of vertical mixing {{that have not been}} observed in mid-latitudes. Time series of the altitude and thickness of summer arctic stratus have been observed using an elastic backscatter lidar aboard an icebreaker. With the ship moored to the pack ice during 14 data collection stations and the lidar staring vertically, the time series represent advected cloud fields. The lidar data reveal a significant amount of vertical undulation in the clouds, strongly suggestive of traveling waves in the buoyantly <b>damped</b> <b>atmosphere</b> that predominates in the high Arctic. Concurrent observations of trace gases associated with the natural sulfur cycle (dimethyl sulfide, SO{sub 2 }, NH{sub 3 }, H{sub 2 }O{sub 2 }) and aerosols show evidence of vertical mixing events that coincide with a characteristic signature in the cloud field that may be called dropout or lift out. A segment of a cloud deck appears to be relocated from the otherwise quasicontinuous layer to another altitude a few hundred meters lower or higher. Atmospheric models have been applied to identify the mechanism that cause the dropout phenomenon and connect it dynamically to the surface layer mixing...|$|R

I also wanted to relieve their minds as to Lys and myself, as I knew that they must have already given us up for dead. It was a cloudy day, though warm, as it always is in Caspak.

60|$|The {{photometer}} observations show {{a greater}} degree of sun's light on the hills than below, but there is not at either station a decided relation between the indications of this instrument and the black-bulb thermometer. From observations taken elsewhere, I am inclined to attribute the excess of solar light on the hills to their elevation; for at a far greater elevation I have met with much stronger solar light, in a very <b>damp</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> than I ever experienced in the drier plains of India. In a damp climate the greatest intensity may be expected in the forenoon, when the vapour is diffused near the earth's surface; in the afternoon the lower strata of atmosphere are drier, but the vapour is condensed into clouds aloft which more effectually obstruct the sun's rays. On the Birbhoom and Behar hills, where the amount of vapour is so small that the afternoon is but little drier than the forenoon, there is little difference between the solar light at each time. In the Soane valley again, where a great deal of humidity is removed from the earth's surface and suspended aloft, the obstruction of the sun's light is very marked.|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} deceived, too, {{in respect to}} the shape of the enclosure. In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total {{darkness}} upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a <b>damp</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone.

60|$|The {{descent from}} the Yalloong ridge to the Khabili feeders of the Tambur was very steep, {{and in some}} places almost precipitous, first through dense woods of silver fir, with Rhod.

One bush of the former was in flower, making a {{gorgeous}} show. Here also appeared the great oak with lamellated acorns, which I had not seen in the drier valleys to the westward; with many other Dorjiling trees and shrubs. A heavy mist clung to the rank luxuriant foliage, tantalizing from its obscuring all the view. Mica schist replaced the gneiss, and a thick slippery stratum of clay rendered {{it very difficult to}} keep one's footing. After so many days of bright sunshine and dry weather, I found this quiet, <b>damp,</b> foggy <b>atmosphere</b> to have a most depressing effect: there was little to interest in the meteorology, the atmospheric fluctuations being far too small; geographical discovery was at an end, and we groped our way along devious paths in wooded valleys, or ascended spurs and ridges, always clouded before noon, and clothed with heavy forest.|$|R
40|$|Climatological {{planetary}} albedo {{obtained from}} the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) D-series flux dataset is broken down into contributions from the surface and atmosphere in cryosphere regions. The atmosphere accounts for much more of climatological planetary albedo (� 75 %) than the surface at all times of the year. The insignificance of the surface contribution over highly reflective cryosphere regions is attributed mostly to the damping effect of the atmosphere. The overlying atmosphere attenuates the surface’s contribution to climatological planetary albedo by {{reducing the number of}} solar photons initially reaching the surface and the number of photons initially reflected by the surface that actually reach the top of the atmosphere. The ISCCP datasets were also used to determine the relative contributions of the surface and atmosphere to seasonal and interannual planetary albedo variability in cryosphere regions. Even <b>damped</b> by the <b>atmosphere</b> to the same degree as in the climatological case, the surface contribution dominates the variability in planetary albedo on seasonal and interannual time scales. The surface accounts for about 75 % of the change in climatological planetary albedo from one season to another with similar zenith angle and more than 50 % of its interannual variability at nearly all times of the year, especially during seasons wit...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the power}} of {{continuous}} wave laser sources have reached one kilowatt, beam shaping is an important topic in the sector of laser material processing. The high intensity allows the increase of process speed, but the extreme local overheating often decreases the quality. Typically beam shaping solutions use a static beam adaptation by optical elements. For laser cutting for example, the increase of sheet thickness requires larger Rayleigh length what will be achieved by adapting {{the conditions of the}} incident ray at the focalization element. In this case the cutting quality increases but the cutting speed decreases. The advantage of high intensity gets lost. The dynamic beam shaping is known from the electron beam, and already applied in laser hardening and welding applications using galvanometer scanners. While the galvo-systems reached the physical limitations, the frequency is not high enough to achieve the desired effects. Resonance galvanometer scanners are limited by the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>damping,</b> too. This paper will introduce a new possibility of dynamic beam shaping, using MEMS technology in a low pressure atmosphere.

60|$|All {{ordinary}} {{flowers are}} so far open that insects can force an entrance into them, notwithstanding that some, like the Snapdragon (Antirrhinum), various Papilionaceous and Fumariaceous flowers, are in appearance closed. It cannot be maintained that their openness is necessary for fertility, as cleistogene flowers which are permanently closed yield {{a full complement of}} seeds. Pollen contains much nitrogen and phosphorus--the two most precious of all the elements for the growth of plants--but in the case of most open flowers, a large quantity of pollen is consumed by pollen-devouring insects, and a large quantity is destroyed during long-continued rain. With many plants this latter evil is guarded against, as far as is possible, by the anthers opening only during dry weather (10/7. Mr. Blackley observed that the ripe anthers of rye did not dehisce whilst kept under a bell-glass in a <b>damp</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> whilst other anthers exposed to the same temperature in the open air dehisced freely. He also found much more pollen adhering to the sticky slides, which were attached to kites and sent high up in the atmosphere, during the first fine and dry days after wet weather, than at other times: 'Experimental Researches on Hay Fever' 1873 page 127.)--by the position and form of {{some or all of the}} petals,--by the presence of hairs, etc., and as Kerner has shown in his interesting essay, by the movements of the petals or of the whole flower during cold and wet weather. (10/8. 'Die Schutzmittel des Pollens' 1873.) In order to compensate the loss of pollen in so many ways, the anthers produce a far larger amount than is necessary for the fertilisation of the same flower. I know this from my own experiments on Ipomoea, given in the Introduction; and it is still more plainly shown by the astonishingly small quantity produced by cleistogene flowers, which lose none of their pollen, in comparison with that produced by the open flowers borne by the same plants; and yet this small quantity suffices for the fertilisation of all their numerous seeds. Mr. Hassall took pains in estimating the number of pollen-grains produced by a flower of the Dandelion (Leontodon), and found the number to be 243,600, and in a Paeony 3,654,000 grains. (10/9. 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 8 1842 page 108.) The editor of the 'Botanical Register' counted the ovules in the flowers of Wistaria sinensis, and carefully estimated the number of pollen-grains, and he found that for each ovule there were 7000 grains. (10/10. Quoted in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1846 page 771.) With Mirabilis, three or four of the very large pollen-grains are sufficient to fertilise an ovule; but I do not know how many grains a flower produces. With Hibiscus, Kolreuter found that sixty grains were necessary to fertilise all the ovules of a flower, and he calculated that 4863 grains were produced by a single flower, or eighty-one times too many. With Geum urbanum, however, according to Gartner, the pollen is only ten times too much. (10/11. Kolreuter 'Vorlaufige Nachricht' 1761 page 9. Gartner 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. page 346.) As we thus see that the open state of all ordinary flowers, and the consequent loss of much pollen, necessitate the development of so prodigious an excess of this precious substance, why, it may be asked, are flowers always left open? As many plants exist throughout the vegetable kingdom which bear cleistogene flowers, there can hardly be a doubt that all open flowers might easily have been converted into closed ones. The graduated steps by which this process could have been effected may be seen at the present time in Lathyrus nissolia, Biophytum sensitivum, and several other plants. The answer to the above question obviously is, that with permanently closed flowers there could be no cross-fertilisation.|$|E

40|$|The {{laboratory}} experiment of Plumb and McEwan demonstrates the principal mechanism of periodically reversing winds {{observed in the}} stratosphere—the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO).

Incorporating the rapidly undulating boundaries of the {{laboratory experiment}} into the numerical algo-rithm—via time-dependent curvilinear coordinates—allows for the reproduction of the experimental setup, while minimizing numerical uncertainties. Results are presented of the first direct numerical simulation of the phenomena that lead to the zonal-mean flow reversal in the laboratory analog The aim of this research is to narrow the widening gap between the theoretical understanding of laboratory-scale, internal-gravity wave processes and the complexity of global-scale circulations. A detailed study is presented on the para-metric and numerical sensitivities of the oscillation. The results confirm a number of sensitivities, addressed in earlier studies. The analogy of radiative <b>damping</b> in the <b>atmosphere</b> and the role of molecular viscosity in the zonally varying laboratory flow are discussed, emphasizing the dominant role of wave–wave and wave–mean flow interactions in the latter, and in particular the retroaction of the induced mean flow on the waves. The findings elevate the importance of the laboratory setup for its fundamental similarity to the atmosphere. Implications are discussed for the theory and numerical realizability of equatorial zonal-mean zonal flow oscillations. The study corroborates the dependence of global-scale motions on small-scale wave-driven fluctuations, while being independent of parameterized or approximated means of forcing and wave dissipation. 1...|$|R
60|$|After breakfast I went on shore, and {{ascended the}} nearest slope to {{a height of}} between two and three {{thousand}} feet. The outer mountains are smooth and conical, but steep; and the old volcanic rocks, {{of which they are}} formed, have been cut through by many profound ravines, diverging from the central broken parts of the island to the coast. Having crossed the narrow low girt of inhabited and fertile land, I followed a smooth steep ridge between two of the deep ravines. The vegetation was singular, consisting almost exclusively of small dwarf ferns, mingled, higher up, with coarse grass; it was not very dissimilar from that on some of the Welsh hills, and this so close above the orchard of tropical plants on the coast was very surprising. At the highest point which I reached trees again appeared. Of the three zones of comparative luxuriance, the lower one owes its moisture, and therefore fertility, to its flatness; for, being scarcely raised above the level of the sea, the water from the higher land drains away slowly. The intermediate zone does not, like the upper one, reach into a <b>damp</b> and cloudy <b>atmosphere,</b> and therefore remains sterile. The woods in the upper zone are very pretty, tree-ferns replacing the cocoa-nuts on the coast. It must not, however, be supposed that these woods at all equal in splendour the forests of Brazil. The vast number of productions, which characterise a continent, cannot be expected to occur in an island.|$|R

Close to {{the house was a}} rather good menagerie, where I saw, amongst other animals, a pair of kangaroos in high health and condition, the female with young in her pouch. Before dark I was again in my palkee, and hurrying onwards. The night was cool and clear, very different from the <b>damp</b> and foggy <b>atmosphere</b> I had left at Calcutta. On the following morning I was travelling over a flat and apparently rising country, along an excellent road, with groves of bamboos and stunted trees on either hand, few villages or palms, a sterile soil, with stunted grass and but little cultivation; altogether a country as unlike what I had expected to find in India as well might be. All around was a dead flat or table-land, out of which a few conical hills rose in the west, about 1000 feet high, covered with a low forest of dusky green or yellow, from the prevalence of bamboo. The lark was singing merrily at sunrise, and the accessories of a fresh air and dewy grass more reminded me of some moorland in the north of England than of the torrid regions of the east.|$|R
