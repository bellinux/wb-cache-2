25|$|On {{receiving}} the proposed Constitution from the Philadelphia Convention, Congress initiated a ratification procedure {{for the proposed}} Constitution which by-passed the sitting state legislatures, <b>going</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> {{the people of the}} country, state by state. Four delegates, James Madison with Edmund Randolph for the Federalists and Patrick Henry with George Mason for the Anti-federalists made most of the speeches of the Convention; 149 of the 170 delegates were silent. An early estimate gave the Federalists seeking ratification a slim margin of 86 to Anti-Federalists rejecting at 80, with four unknowns. Federalists came from the Tidewater and Northern Neck, the Shenandoah Valley and western counties, although the Kentucky counties along the Ohio River feared being abandoned to the Spanish under the new government. The Anti-federalists found strength in the central Piedmont, Southside and southwest counties.|$|E

25|$|In November 1994, CDNow {{launched}} its BuyWeb program. CDNow {{had the idea}} that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors might be interested in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CD's directly from its website, but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle the order fulfillment. Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNow home page and <b>going</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> an artist's music page.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} year of Julian's stay in Gaul, the Sassanid Emperor, Shapur II, invaded Mesopotamia and took the city of Amida after a 73-day siege. In February 360, Constantius II ordered {{more than half of}} Julian's Gallic troops to join his eastern army, the order by-passing Julian and <b>going</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the {{military}} commanders. Although Julian at first attempted to expedite the order, it provoked an insurrection by troops of the Petulantes, who had no desire to leave Gaul. According to the historian Zosimus, the army officers were those responsible for distributing an anonymous tract expressing complaints against Constantius as well as fearing for Julian's ultimate fate. Notably absent at the time was the prefect Florentius, who was seldom far from Julian's side, though now he was kept busy organizing supplies in Vienne and away from any strife that the order could cause. Julian would later blame him for the arrival of the order from Constantius. Ammianus Marcellinus even suggested that the fear of Julian gaining more popularity than himself caused Constantius to send the order on the urging of Florentius.|$|E

25|$|The person {{called up}} to read from the Torah – the summons is called an aliyah and the person so honored is called an oleh – hastens from his seat to the desk, <b>going</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the desk without any interruptions. Although around the world, {{including}} North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside from the desk. The oleh takes his place at the desk facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed out for him, he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing {{the corner of his}} prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin – not the writing – of the scroll), and then he may close his eyes, or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing he is about to recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{struggling}} to find financial backing for Donnie Darko in Hollywood, director Richard Kelly spent {{a year and a}} half pitching the project to executives. After reading the script, Drew Barrymore agreed to finance the film through her production company Flower Films. Following Barrymore's involvement, Kelly was able to hire several well-known actors—such as Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Katharine Ross—and to produce the film for a budget of $4.5million. On January 19, 2001, Donnie Darko made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Despite the film receiving considerable acclaim from critics, distributors felt daunted and were unsure of what could be done with it. With its genre-bending themes and complex plot, it was described as [...] "inaccessible" [...] and [...] "not marketable".

500|$|The Premier League {{intended}} {{to sell its}} own television rights, with the proceeds <b>going</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the 22 member clubs.

He persuaded the clubs {{to set up a}} separate working party, which led by himself, Ron Noades and Bill Fotherby in October 1991 came to an agreement of the sale of a shared package. The party was short-lived however; hostility towards Dein meant the other clubs settled with Parry and Quinton in charge of matters. As Mihir Bose, author of Game Changer: How the English Premier League Came to Dominate the World notes, [...] "That did not prevent rival club chairman from meeting competing broadcasters on their own." [...] Dein for instance visited Greg Dyke, chairman of London Weekend Television (LWT), and was offered £4 million per year, over four seasons in pursuance of live Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United, Liverpool and Everton home games on ITV.

The International became an annual championship tournament in 2012, with the venue changing to Seattle. In its third year, The International allowed crowdfunding to add to its prize pool through an interactive, in-game app called a [...] "compendium".
