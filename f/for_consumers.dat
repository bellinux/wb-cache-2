5|$|In August 1992, Greyhound {{canceled}} its {{bus terminal}} license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed {{the requirement that}} Greyhound be the sole-seller of the tenant's bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a Greyhound terminal. In 1995, The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought suit to stop this practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad <b>for</b> <b>consumers,</b> and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor interline tickets with competitors.|$|E
5|$|Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) rated Ninja Gaiden and Black, {{on their}} release, as 18+ games. At the time, CERO ratings acted as {{guidelines}} <b>for</b> <b>consumers.</b> However, on March 1, 2006, the Japanese rating system changed. A scale from A to D was introduced, {{with an additional}} Z rating for games with large amounts of gore and sexual content. The Z rating is legally enforced, it being illegal to sell such games to anyone {{under the age of}} 18. As a result, Tecmo removed the human beheadings in Sigma to obtain a D rating for the East Asian market. However, CERO reclassified the two previous games as D, despite them also depicting human decapitations.|$|E

On education, the DAP also criticised SUPP's involvement in the sale of the Laila Taib College, previously known as United College Sarawak, to the Yayasan Sarawak (Sarawak Foundation) for the price of one ringgit, when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college's building.|$|E

5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> who needed traditional functions.|$|E

5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E
