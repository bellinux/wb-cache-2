I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it.

500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Arjen and Bernadien's first meeting {{have been reported}} by his former youth coach, Barend Beltman: [...] "Arjen was driven and determined at a young age. He was always on time, never late. But one Friday afternoon he showed up 15 minutes past the start of practice. I asked him what was going on. 'We were at the market square, having fun,' he said. There were some girls {{with him and his}} friends, so I asked, 'Was she worth it?' 'Yes, trainer, she was,' he told me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get his gear and join the training session. At his wedding, I heard the woman he met that day was now his wife and mother of his children. Bernadien is her name." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September 15, Hendrix was asked by his friend Eric Burdon, formerly of the Animals, {{if he wanted to}} participate in a jam session at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with Burdon's newly formed band, War. Hendrix accepted, but {{when he arrived at the}} club that evening, he was not allowed to play due to his apparently drug-related disorientation. Burdon commented: [...] "Jimi came down and was well out of it. He... was wobbling too much to play, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come back the following night." [...] Hendrix returned the next night and presented a healthier appearance. The crowd was enthusiastic and impressed by his performance despite his uncharacteristically subdued guitar playing when he sat in with War on [...] "Tobacco Road" [...] and [...] "Mother Earth". This was the last time Hendrix played guitar in public.|$|E

500|$|By January 5, 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, [...] "Hey Joe", {{backed with}} [...] "Stone Free", peaked at number six on the UK record chart. [...] "Hey Joe" [...] {{was not a}} Hendrix {{composition}} – {{it was written by}} Billy Roberts and recorded by several groups prior to the Experience. Hendrix commented, [...] "That record isn't us. The next one's gonna be different. [...] We're working on an LP which will mainly be our stuff." [...] The group recorded several demos of original material at studios in London, including [...] "Can You See Me", [...] "Foxy Lady", [...] "Third Stone from the Sun", [...] "Red House", and [...] "Remember". [...] In the middle of December, producer Chas Chandler heard Hendrix toying around with a new guitar riff. [...] "I heard him playing it at the flat and was knocked out. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> keep working on that, saying, 'That's the next single!'" [...] Chandler claimed that after some more urging, Hendrix wrote the rest of [...] "Purple Haze" [...] in the dressing room of a London club during the afternoon of December 26, 1966, before a gig. In several interviews, Hendrix spoke about writing the song, but did not mention where or when he wrote it.|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Eileen Davidson, who portrayed Ashley Abbott, {{said that}} she [...] "couldn't judge" [...] Engen's {{decision}} {{since it was a}} [...] "personal one". Davidson said, [...] "Everybody has his or her own demonsand makes their own choices due to their creative process." [...] In other interviews, Eric Braeden, who portrays Adam's father Victor Newman, stated his disappointment with Engen's departure, and told Soap Opera Digest that he unsuccessfully tried to convince the actor to stay with the soap opera. Braeden stated, [...] "He was somewhat disturbed {{by the fact that he}} was playing this evil character. I said, 'Listen, I remember Victor feeding rats to people.' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> embrace it because he had the most riveting storyline around, period." [...] In another interview with Soaps In Depth, Braeden said that he too was [...] "saddened by the fact that he left", saying it was a [...] "hell of a role". Braeden also said, [...] "Whatever personal reasons he has, you've got to respect that. But he was a very nice guy, very professional. We all liked working with him. We were shocked when he decided to leave, but that's his personal decision." [...] After the controversy surrounding his departure from the show, Engen posted a message on his Myspace page stating he had been unhappy with Adam's storyline long before the homosexual plot twist had emerged.|$|E

"Brigadier general Zvonko Stojanovski the {{commander}} of the Army Anti-air Defence informed me that our radars caught 6 fighter planes with course from Italy, through Albania towards Macedonia. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> follow their course and to dislocate the helicopters to the reserve airfield in Lozovo.

2500|$|... "We {{picked up}} the girls {{and went to the}} beach. I had a shot behind the shed. While the girls were {{drinking}} I was trying to OD. We drove around with them. I was asleep most the time. Beckett told me he dropped them off at home. I remember waking up and seeing the girls and then later I asked Beckett where we were and he said Victoria, on the main road somewhere. And I went off my head. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go home, {{get the fuck out of}} here. Then I saw him walking out of the bush. He had blood all over him.

2500|$|The {{events that}} {{occurred}} immediately following the shooting were streamed live in a 10-minute video by Reynolds via Facebook. The recording appears to begin seconds after Castile was shot, just after 9:00p.m. CDT. The video depicts Castile slumped over, moaning and moving slightly, with a bloodied left arm and side. In the video, Reynolds is speaking with Yanez and explaining what happened. Reynolds stated on the video that Yanez [...] "asked him for license and registration. He {{told him that it}} was in his wallet, but he had a pistol on him because he's licensed to carry." [...] Castile did have a license to carry a gun. Reynolds further narrated that the officer said, [...] "Don't move" [...] and as Castile was putting his hands back up, the officer shot him in the arm four or five times. Reynolds told the officer, [...] "You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir." [...] Reynolds also said [...] "Please don't tell me he's dead," [...] while Yanez exclaims: [...] "I told him not to reach for it! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get his hand open!" ...|$|E

6000|$|My {{idea was}} to send her on a wild-goose chase, and while the Wild Rose was away I thought it out.

2500|$|Speaking {{about her}} {{relationship}} with Prince {{in an interview with}} Norwegian station NRK in November 2014 she said, [...] "I did meet him a couple of times. [...] We didn’t get on at all. [...] In fact we had a punch-up." [...] She continued: [...] "He summoned me to his house after 'Nothing Compares 2U'. I made it without him. [...] I’d never met him. [...] He summoned me to his house – and it’s foolish to do this to an Irish woman – he said he didn’t like me saying bad words in interviews. So <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fuck off....He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine." [...] She told a similar story to an interviewer from Hot Press in December 1990. Prince said the events she described never took place, replying to the allegations in his song [...] "Days of Wild", which deals with misogyny. In a 2004 interview with Graham Norton, O'Connor claimed that the story was [...] "much exaggerated by the press" [...] and referred to him as [...] "a sweet guy".|$|E
2500|$|French {{was made}} an Aide-de-Camp General to the King on 19 June 1911. The Second Moroccan Crisis was {{occasion}} for French to push again for greater Army-Navy cooperation. Admiral Fisher, recently retired as First Sea Lord, wrote (20 August 1911) that French {{had been to}} see him [...] "as the tool of Sir William Nicholson. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go to Hell." [...] On 23 August Henry Wilson carried a CID meeting with a lucid presentation of the Army’s plans for deployment to France; Admiral Wilson’s plans {{to land on the}} Baltic Coast were rejected. French spoke to the Navy Club that year on the need for cooperation between the two services. The autumn 1911 manoeuvres were cancelled, supposedly because of shortage of water but in reality because of the war scare. [...] French accompanied Grierson and the French military attaché Victor Huguet to France for talks with de Castelnau, Assistant Chief of the French General Staff (Wilson—Director of Military Operations since August 1910—had already been over for talks in July). On the journey, French talked of how Douglas and Paget would command armies under him in the event of war, with Grierson as chief of staff. Plans for British deployment were especially welcome as French war plans were in a state of flux, with Joffre having been appointed commander-in-chief designate on 28 July. After his return from France in 1911 French inspected German cavalry manoeuvres in Mecklenburg, and was summoned from his bath to receive the Order of the Red Eagle. [...] On presenting him with a signed photograph of himself the Kaiser told him: [...] "You may have seen just how long my sword is: you may find it just as sharp".|$|E
2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E
