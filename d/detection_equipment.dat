30|$|In most target {{tracking}} cases, {{it is assumed}} that one target generates at most one measurement per time step due to the low resolution sensor system, i.e., each target is tracked as a single point source, and its extension is assumed to be neglectable in comparison with sensor resolution [1 – 3]. However, with the increase of the resolution of modern radars and other <b>detection</b> <b>equipments,</b> the echo signal of a target may be distributed in a different range resolution cell, so the measurement is no longer equivalent to a point, i.e., a single target may produce multiple measurements. Such target is referred to as an extended target in [4 – 7]. Recently, extended {{target tracking}} is a hot topic in the field of data fusion and has drawn a considerable attention, especially the multiple extended-target tracking (METT) [8 – 14].|$|R

On 22 May she escorted the Isle of Man ferry Mona Queen as she transported British Army troops of the Irish Guards to Boulogne, returning to England with 212 refugees aboard. The contingent of refugees included Otto and Marie Neurath.|$|E
25|$|Mobile speed cameras may be hand-held, tripod mounted, or vehicle-mounted. In vehicle-mounted systems, <b>detection</b> <b>equipment</b> {{and cameras}} can be mounted {{to the vehicle}} itself, or simply tripod mounted inside the vehicle and {{deployed}} out a window or door. If the camera is fixed to the vehicle, the enforcement vehicle does not necessarily have to be stationary, and can be moved either with or against the flow of traffic. In the latter case, depending on the direction of travel, the target vehicle's relative speed is either added or subtracted from the enforcement vehicle's own speed to obtain its actual speed. The speedometer of the camera vehicle needs to be accurately calibrated.|$|E

30|$|With the {{increase}} of the resolution of modern radars and other <b>detection</b> <b>equipments,</b> one target may produce more than one measurement. Such targets {{are referred to as}} extended targets. Recently, multiple extended target tracking (METT) has drawn a considerable attention. However, one crucial problem is how to partition the measurement sets accurately and rapidly. In this paper, an improved METT algorithm is proposed based on the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter and an effective partition method using spectral clustering technique. First, the density analysis technique is introduced to eliminate the disturbance of clutter, and then the spectral clustering technique based on neighbor propagation is used to partition the measurements. Finally, the GM-PHD filter is implemented to achieve the METT. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a better performance, especially a better real-time performance, than the conventional distance partition and K-means++ methods.|$|R

25|$|Traffic police cars, {{known in}} the UK as Road Policing Units, are cars {{designed}} {{for the job of}} enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road. They may be fitted with special bumpers designed to force vehicles off the road, and may have visual and audible warnings, with special audible warnings which can be heard from a greater distance. In some police forces, the term traffic car may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws. As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed <b>detection</b> <b>equipment,</b> traffic cones, flares, and traffic control signs.|$|E
25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special <b>detection</b> <b>equipment.</b> Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E

Prototypes of several stations were designed and built in Alaska and in a rural section of Illinois in 1953. While few of the original designs for either buildings or equipment were retained, the trial installations did prove that the DEW Line was feasible, and they furnished a background of information that led to the final improved designs of all facilities and final plans for manpower, transportation, and supply.|$|E
