40|$|This article {{examines}} Black young adult parents' reliance on <b>grandmothers</b> for parenting support. The sample of 487 parents, 18 to 34 years old, {{was drawn from}} the National Survey of Black Americans. Parents most often nominated <b>grandmothers</b> as the person they could count on for child care assistance and parental guidance. Mothers and fathers {{did not differ in}} their overall nominations of <b>grandmothers.</b> However, mothers were more likely than fathers to rely on <b>grandmothers</b> for both child care assistance and parenting advice. Fathers were more likely than mothers to rely on <b>grandmothers</b> for child care assistance only. Factors affecting parents' reliance on <b>grandmothers</b> for parenting support varied by gender. For mothers, family closeness, the number of generations in multigeneration family lineages, residence in the rural South, and family proximity were related to increased reliance on <b>grandmothers</b> for parenting support. Among fathers, being employed and family proximity increased their reliance on <b>grandmothers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{characteristics}} of rural versus urban caregiving <b>grandmothers</b> along with their physical and mental health status. Methods: A secondary analysis of data produced from the first wave of a longitudinal study of 485 Ohio <b>grandmothers</b> was conducted. Health status was measured using the SF- 36 Health Survey and the 20 -item CES-D depression scale. Rural-urban classification was made using Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes based on resident ZIP codes, identifying 97 rural and 388 urban <b>grandmothers</b> in the sample. Findings: The rural and urban <b>grandmothers</b> were similar in age, educational level and employment status; however, 90 % of the rural <b>grandmothers</b> compared with 60 % of the urban <b>grandmothers</b> were white. Rural <b>grandmothers</b> were most likely to have traditional nonresidential relationships with their grandchildren. Approximately 38 % of both the rural and urban <b>grandmothers</b> served as primary caregivers for their grandchildren, but a lower percentage of rural <b>grandmothers</b> lived in multigenerational homes. There was no significant difference between the rural and urban <b>grandmothers</b> in relation to physical or mental health. Among rural <b>grandmothers,</b> primary caregivers had significantly lower levels of mental health compared with the other caregiver groups. Conclusions: These findings suggest that rural and urban <b>grandmothers</b> have similar levels of physical and mental health, despite differences in demographics and caregiving arrangements. Health promotion efforts with rural caregiving grandparents are indicated, addressing both mental and physical health...|$|R

40|$|Sources {{of support}} {{and quality of life}} of 50 grandmother-headed {{families}} raising grandchil-dren with and without disabilities were examined.

Informal support was significantly higher for <b>grandmothers</b> raising grandchildren without disabilities. In addition, <b>grandmothers</b> raising grandchildren without disabilities rated satisfaction with all aspects of family quality of life except parenting as significantly higher than <b>grandmothers</b> raising grandchildren with disabilities. Correlational analyses showed a moderate correlation between sources of support and family quality of life for both groups of <b>grandmothers.</b> While total informal social support was significantly correlated with satisfaction ratings of family quality of life for both groups of <b>grandmothers,</b> total formal support was significantly correlated with satisfaction ratings of family quality of life only for <b>grandmothers</b> raising grandchildren with disabilities.

40|$|Using a {{grounded}} theory approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), this study produced {{a conceptual framework}} for exploring the relationships between <b>grandmothers</b> and the grandchildren they are raising. Twenty-one <b>grandmothers</b> and grandchildren were engaged in in-depth interviews. <b>grandmothers</b> had legal custody of the participating grandchildren {{for at least the}} last six months. Grandchildren were between the ages of 7 and 14. Data were analyzed using open coding, axial coding, and selected coding. Four of the seven <b>grandmothers</b> were found to have a similar pattern {{due in large part to}} their daughters having a long history of drug addiction. These four <b>grandmothers</b> are the focus of the model. The remaining three <b>grandmothers</b> have dissimilar situations, but support the model as well. The study proposed a three-phase model of the relationships. These phases included: rescuer/protector, caregiver/provider, and mother/advocate. The model described movement from each phase through contextual conditions. The mother/advocate phase became the most developed phase of the model. Eight strategies used by the <b>grandmothers</b> to manage the mother/advocate phase are proposed. In addition, seven intervening conditions were identified that either constrain or enhance the strategies...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{approximately}} 74, 000 {{children are}} adopted by nonrelatives each year. Considerable {{information is available}} about adopted children and adoptive parents. However, there is no information on the reactions of grandparents about the family adoptions. This study explores <b>grandmothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 reactions to their adult children 2 ̆ 7 s decisions to adopt, <b>grandmothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 roles in, and reactions to, the adoption processes, and, most important, their feelings about their adopted grandchildren. ^ Eighty-three <b>grandmothers,</b> ages 55 to 90, were interviewed by telephone. They had a total of 119 adopted grandchildren, {{ranging in age from}} newborn to 30 years. The adopted children were from 15 different countries and included same-race and cross-race, as well as healthy and special needs children, in closed and varying degrees of open adoptions. ^ Analysis of grounded theory interviews derived (a) issues which may predispose <b>grandmothers</b> to favor or to disapprove adoption beforehand, (b) issues which may influence <b>grandmothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 degrees of satisfaction/disappointment, after completed adoptions, and (c) comparison of such issues within and between groups for <b>grandmothers</b> of four categories of adopted children: disabled, African-American, single-mothered, and healthy Caucasian. ^ The study found agreement with all research literature findings on biological grandparenting. The <b>grandmothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 fulfillment of a kinkeeper role and their positive attitudes overcome the ambiguity of connectedness and boundaries inherent in adoption. All the <b>grandmothers</b> in the study expressed acceptance of the adopted grandchildren and, insofar as feasible, great enjoyment of them.
