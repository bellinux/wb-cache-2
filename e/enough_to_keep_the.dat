5|$|The Independent newspaper's {{review of}} the audio books stated that the {{chapters}} are short enough to keep children of seven-plus interested but, as there are ghosts, rats, soldiers and dragon boats to help Septimus and the young Princess fight the evil necromancer DomDaniel, there is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> whole family amused.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to bring in}} and then kill a Shade {{at the end of}} the book was made when Paolini realized he needed a new ending for the book after it was split up. He was in need of plot points that were strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> reader interested through the ending of the book. The point of view of Glaedr and Oromis' confrontation with Thorn and Murtagh was combined with the Shade battle to further keep the reader interested.|$|E
5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war, and along with fresh imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of enemies that can see Corvo {{from a great}} distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> enemies formidable.|$|E
25|$|On the day {{the verdict}} was read, Welch's younger brother Richard stated that he blamed the Klan for {{changing}} his brother. He said he was happy with the verdict, and hoped {{that it would be}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Klan away from their town.|$|E

25|$|Toronto is {{situated}} by Lake Ontario and a lake breeze often develops during the day. This wind brings cooler {{air at the}} surface and causes a marine temperature inversion {{which could have been}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> rotation aloft. To the west of the city, there is the Niagara Escarpment, reaching 1,500 feet above sea level, while the shores of Lake Ontario are just 250 feet ASL.

25|$|During his mayoralty, Sanders {{called himself}} a socialist {{and was so}} {{described}} in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first Citizens Party City Councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party. The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> council from overriding Sanders's vetoes.

25|$|Port Alberni's dry July {{gives it}} a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Koppen Csb), {{although}} it is much wetter than most such places. Although the summer months do see a relatively small amount of precipitation, {{the vast majority of}} it comes during the winter months as cool, moist air flows from the Pacific Ocean over the much colder B.C. coast. Despite its location on the relatively dryer east side of Vancouver Island, the resulting weak rain shadow is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> city dry.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{viewpoint}} characters were born under the Nazis, {{and maintaining the}} masquerade is second nature. The greatest danger is {{when a child is}} told of his or her true identity, usually at age of ten: considered old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> secret. Children often are shocked, since, like all German children, they grew up exposed to constant anti-Semitism from teachers and children's books. The adults soften the shock by teaching the children to feel privileged to belong to such a secret society.|$|E
25|$|When a {{piece of}} {{lithosphere}} that was heated and stretched cools again, its density rises, causing isostatic subsidence. If this subsidence continues long enough, the basin is called a sag basin. Examples of sag basins are the regions along passive continental margins, but sag basins {{can also be found}} in the interior of continents. In sag basins, the extra weight of the newly deposited sediments is <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> subsidence going in a vicious circle. The total thickness of the sedimentary infill in a sag basins can thus exceed 10km.|$|E

25|$|The Grant's gazelle is a gregarious, territorial, and migratory species. The home {{ranges of}} does overlap {{with those of}} the bucks. Only male gazelles are territorial. Male gazelles will herd all females that cross their territories. When the females are in estrus, they are {{strongly}} guarded by the dominant male, which prevents other males from mating with them.

25|$|As McGruder's spaceship, Justice 4, {{began to}} leave the planet Hestia the flight crew were murdered, and the ship crashed. Many {{passengers}} and crew were killed, and the survivors were stranded in the hostile wilderlands of the unexplored part of the planet. Since no distress message had been sent, nobody even knew that they had crashed. McGruder received a head injury in the crash, and went into a life-threatening coma. Even though Dredd was a prisoner he assumed command, since none of the ship crew (who now all technically outranked him) were competent or experienced <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> survivors alive.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceuticals {{designed}} to reduce stomach acid, such as the proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), {{are among the most}} widely sold drugs in the world. One PPI, omeprazole (Prilosec), has been found to lower the bioavailability of vitamin C by 12% after 28 days of treatment, independent of dietary intake. The probable mechanism of vitamin C reduction, intragastric pH elevated into alkalinity, would apply to all other PPI drugs, though not necessarily to doses of PPIs low <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> stomach slightly acidic. In another study, 40mg/day of omeprazole lowered the fasting gastric vitamin C levels from 3.8 to 0.7µg/mL.|$|E

25|$|Jouett {{also helped}} General Edward Stevens escape. The general was {{recovering}} from wounds he received at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. From Swan Tavern, Jouett rode with General Stevens {{as he made his}} escape, but the wounded Stevens could not ride quickly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> British from catching up. Fortunately, Jouett had the eccentric habit of dressing in ornate military costume with a scarlet coat and a plumed hat and Stevens was dressed in shoddy clothing. British cavalry assumed that Jouett must be a high military officer, so they ignored the shabby general, and pursued Jouett, who successfully eluded them.|$|E
25|$|Popping {{results are}} {{sensitive}} to {{the rate at which the}} kernels are heated. If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.|$|E
25|$|Confederate {{reinforcements}} from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived {{while the}} Confederate artillery under Col. William Pegram softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30p.m. by six brigades against Miles's position and it {{broke through the}} northwest corner of the Union fortifications; although the Union defensive fire was fierce <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Confederates at bay, suddenly two Union regiments panicked and bolted for the rear, opening a gap. Miles ordered his reserve brigade under Col. Horace Rugg to close the gap, but to his astonishment, Rugg's men fell prone and refused to open fire. Heth personally led the charge through the earthworks, tussling with Sgt. Thomas Minton of the 26th North Carolina about who would carry the colors forward.|$|E
