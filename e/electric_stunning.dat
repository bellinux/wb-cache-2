50|$|Twice a year, {{partners}} including The Nature Conservancy, the Bureau of Land Management, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and Dr Peter Reinthal, {{professor at}} the University of Arizona, sample nine sites {{along the length of}} Aravaipa Canyon. Three of these sites are located at the west and east ends of the canyon respectively, and three are within the canyon itself. Various methods are used to survey the type and abundance of fish species present at each location. The most common of these is seining, a method that involves dragging a long net through the water and catching many fish at a time. This is best done by two individuals (one {{on either side of the}} net) who run downstream, scooping up the fish that are attempting to swim upstream against the current. Another form of seining involves the same two people on either side of the net, but this time they plant the edges of the net into the streambed. Then, another group of individuals form a line parallel to the net and kick up the water as they move toward the stationary net, driving fish into it. This approach works best on narrow side-channels that deviate from the wider stream’s flow. Yet another, less-used method is known as electro-shocking. This involves placing a set of electrodes in the water which send out a low-level <b>electric</b> pulse, temporarily <b>stunning</b> the fish in the immediate area. This makes catching and identifying the fish somewhat easier than seining, but some may say it has ethical implications as it can occasionally cause death to some fish if not expertly done.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>stunning</b> can be humane when {{a proper}} current {{is made to}} flow through the fish brain for a {{sufficient}} period of time. <b>Electric</b> <b>stunning</b> can be applied after the fish has {{been taken out of}} the water (dry stunning) or while the fish is still in the water. The latter generally requires a much higher current and may lead to operator safety issues. An advantage could be that in-water stunning allows fish to be rendered unconscious without stressful handling or displacement. However, improper stunning may not induce insensibility long enough to prevent the fish from enduring exsanguination while conscious. Whether the optimal stunning parameters that researchers have determined in studies are used by the industry in practice is unknown.|$|E

Cooling (tap water 0 °C, sea water - 1, 8 °C) and anesthesia with MgCl 2 (10 %) were both discarded as anesthetic procedures because responses to external stimuli were still detectable under treatment. Contrarily, bubbling the aquarium water with CO 2 {{can be considered a}} "partially successful" anesthesia, because signal propagation is inhibited but before that the animals show discomfort. The procedure of "electro-stunning" induces epileptic-form seizures in the crustacean CNS (lobster, crayfish), which overlay but do not mitigate the response to external stimuli. After several minutes the activity declines before the nervous system starts to recover. A feasible way to sacrifice lobsters is to slowly raise the water temperature (1 °C min- 1), as all electrical activities in the CNS cease at temperatures above ~ 30 °C, whereas below this temperature the animals do not show signs of stress or escape behavior (e. g. tail flips) in the warming water. CO 2 is efficient to anaesthetize lobster and crayfish but due to low pH in water is stressful to the animals previous to anesthesia.

40|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>stunning</b> {{results in}} {{paroxysmal}} cerebral (epileptic) seizures with temporary loss of consciousness. Death is caused either by bleeding or cardiac arrest. During routine slaughter {{it is difficult}} to tell weather animals regain consciousness or sensation. In eighteen studies involving twelve slaughter houses, 1, 741 hogs were tested for eye reflexes and nose pinch reaction. Various stunning methods were used including asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning, head only stunning, and different frequencies of current. Testing was done using a modified tong pinching the hog´s nose and or nasal septum (enervated by the trigeminal nerve) at 40 to 45 sec. after initiation of current flow. The different killing methods produced dissimilar results. This {{can be explained by the}} variations in stun-stick-times, and current form influence an the epileptic fit and the probability of cardiac arrest which is also frequency dependent. In addition to the nose pinch reaction test, 1, 266 animals were tested for eye reflexes. There was no regularity or correlation between the reactions of the two test, and the nose pinch test is more accurate and practical under actual slaughter house conditions. Although the nose pinch test probably does not indicate consciousness, a positive reaction may indicate the possibility of eventual return to consciousness. Therefore the goal of further investigation should be to determine which slaughter-method would lead to zero positive reactions to the nose pinch test. I. The investigated stunning method had been evaluated on the ground of recent results: 1.) Head-only stunning is considered inhumane if stun to stick time exceeds more than 21 sec [...] In all cases when sticking took place after this time more than fifty percent of slaughter hogs reacted to the nose pinch test. Even when slaughter houses with head only stunning were able to stick the hogs 15 - 21 sec. after current flow began, the number of positive reacting hogs was higher than after asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning. The results underline the importance of inducing cardiac fibrillation in hogs after the onset of (epileptic) seizures through the stun. 2.) In cardiac arrest stunning, when current frequencies were 300 to 500 Hz, there was reduced incidence of cardiac fibrillation. The results were similar to head only stunning. Without cardiac fibrillation, exact sticking in a lying position can be hindered and humane slaughter can not be assured. The results of this work confirms the results of other investigators concerning the shorter seizure-activity resulting from higher current frequencies. 3.) Asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning using frequency modulated current (head current: 500 ms from 10 KHz down to 100 Hz; heart- current: 500 ms from 10 KHz down to 80 Hz resulted in the lowest percentage of reacting pigs after stunning and sticking (nose-pinch: 4, 6 %; eye-reflexes: 0 % (N= 237)). 4.) When using asynchronous cardiac arrest stunning, it is essential to control also the heart-current frequency, strength, and duration; in order to induce fibrillation and assure humane slaughter with short stun to stick times. II. Veterinary supervision of humane slaughter should include following steps: 1.) Technical examination. The goal of the technical examination of stunning equipment should be to assure the proper function of the stunning device; including cables, electrodes and electric tongs. Continuous measurement of current can be a help (limited) in evaluating the stunning. Process evaluation can be used to analyse the conditions of pre-slaughter handling in the animals. 2.) Examination of the process of stunning and sticking, including physical evaluation of the anaesthetized animals. 2. 1) Evaluation of the process and efficacy of <b>electric</b> <b>stunning</b> (seizures) Exact placement of the electrodes and continuous current flow during the stunning time should be a priority. Evaluation should include the suitability of the restraining device to assure calm entrance and low stress restraint, so that the electrodes can be placed precisely. At the end of current-flow, all animals must show typical signs of grand mal seizures, i. e. tonic-clonic spasms, no regular breathing, no reflexes, no vocalization, no reaction to the bleeding-stick, nor head righting. (In case of cardiac fibrillation, clonic contractions may be slight or unnoticeable.) 2. 2) Assurance of maintaining the effect of stunning till death resulting from blood loss Measuring the stun to stick time and evaluate the workflow and - conditions is fundamental for humane slaughter. It must be assured that early sticking in the tonic state of epileptic fit is possible. Assessment of stunning and sticking could be assured by testing the nose pinch reaction or by a surface cut at nose tip or septum with a knife...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 120 pigs (86 to 95 Kg/ 140 days) was divided in {{two groups of}} 60 animals and transported in the night period (0, 4 m 2 / 100 kg) for a {{distance}} of 120 Km. In the first group, the animals were handled using aluminum panel, during loading and unloading of the pigs, {{and in the second}} group the animals were handled with electric stick (40 v). All the pigs were submited to the manual <b>electric</b> <b>stunning</b> in the slaughterhouse (340 v/ 1, 3 A). The pig group handled with the aluminum panel presented smaller blood cortisol concentrations (10, 76  5, 76) and lactate(16, 32  5, 50) in comparison with the group handled with the electric stick (80, 26  41, 38) and (189, 214  72, 06), demonstrating that the stick was more stressful, however the welfare provided by the use of panel was not enough to alter the color values significantly (L*, a*, b*), as well as the drip loss. Significant variations in the pH (4, 6 and 8 h post-mortem) were also obtained when the treatments was compered, however none significant value was obtained in the period of 24 h post-mortem. Significant visual blood splashed score in the central area of the loin was obtained when the pigs was handled with the electric stick. We concluded that the pigs handled with panel suffered less stress. Um total de 120 suínos, com pesos entre 86 e 95 kg aos 140 dias, foi dividido em dois grupos de 60 animais e transportado no período noturno a uma densidade de 0, 4 m 2 / 100 kg por uma distância de 120 Km. No primeiro grupo os animais foram movimentados por meio de painel de alumínio, durante o carregamento e descarregamento enquanto que, no segundo, os animais foram manejados com bastão elétrico (40 v). No abatedouro, os animais foram submetidos ao sistema de insensibilização elétrico manual (340 v/ 1, 3 A). O grupo manejado com o painel de alumínio apresentou menores concentrações plasmáticas de cortisol (10, 76  5, 76 g/dL) e lactato (16, 32  5, 50 mg/dL), em comparação ao grupo manejado com o bastão elétrico (80, 26  41, 38 g/dL) e (189, 21  72, 06 mg/dL), respectivamente, o que demonstrou que o bastão foi mais estressante, porém o bem-estar proporcionado pela utilização do painel não foi suficiente para alterar significativamente os valores de cor (L*, a*, b*), assim como os valores de perda por gotejamento. Variações significativas nos valores de pH ocorreram apenas às 4, 6 e 8 h post-mortem entre os tratamentos. Maior concentração de salpicamento na região central do lombo foi obtida em suínos submetidos ao bastão elétrico. Conclui-se que os suínos manejados com painel sofreram menos estresse...|$|E
