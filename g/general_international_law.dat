25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili cites {{a number}} {{cases in which}} {{international}} tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council {{does not intend to}} offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed {{in such a way as}} to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{ratified}} the United Nations Charter on October 24, 1945. Article 92 of the Charter established the International Court of Justice. The ICJ Statute, which established the procedures and {{jurisdiction of the}} ICJ and {{was attached to the}} U.N. Charter, delineates two ways in which a nation may consent to ICJ jurisdiction: It may consent generally to jurisdiction on any question arising under a treaty or <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> or it may consent specifically to jurisdiction over a particular category of cases or disputes pursuant to a separate treaty.|$|E

2500|$|Another early {{landmark}} {{case was}} Commission v Luxembourg & Belgium (1964), the [...] "Dairy Products" [...] case. In that decision the Court comprehensively ruled out any {{use by the}} Member States of the retaliatory measures commonly permitted by <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> within the European Economic Community. That decision is often {{thought to be the}} best example of the European legal order's divergence with ordinary international law. Commission v Luxembourg & Belgium also has a logical connection with the nearly contemporaneous Van Gend en Loos and Costa v ENEL decisions, as arguably it is the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy that allow the European legal system to forego any use of retaliatory enforcement mechanisms by the Member States.|$|E
2500|$|The court {{delivered}} its {{advisory opinion}} on [...] 2010; {{by a vote}} of 10 to 4, it declared that [...] "the adoption of the declaration of independence of the 17 February 2008 did not violate <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> because international law contains no 'prohibition on declarations of independence'": nor did the adoption of the declaration of independence violate UN Security Council Resolution 1244, since this did not describe Kosovo's final status, nor had the Security Council reserved for itself the decision on final status. There were many reactions to the decision, with most countries which already recognise Kosovo hailing the decision and saying it was [...] "unique" [...] and does not set a precedent; while many countries which do not recognise Kosovo said they would not be doing so as the ruling could set a precedent of endorsing secession in other places.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 March 2008 Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić said Serbia would {{request the}} International Court of Justice {{to review the}} {{legality}} of Kosovo's declaration of independence. On 8 October 2008 the UN General Assembly adopted Serbia's resolution requesting the International Court of Justice to assess the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The United Nations General Assembly adopted this proposal on 8 October 2008 with 77 votes in favor, 6 votes against and 74 abstentions. On 22 July 2010 {{the court ruled that}} the declaration did not breach international law, because in <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> does not deal with declarations of independence and because in this specific case the declaration was not issued by the Assembly of Kosovo, Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, or any other official body and thus the authors, who named themselves [...] "representatives of the people of Kosovo" [...] were not bound by the Constitutional Framework (promulgated by United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)) or by UNSCR1244 that is addressed only to United Nations Member States and organs of the United Nations. Prior to the announcement Hashim Thaçi said there would be no [...] "winners or losers" [...] and that [...] "I expect this to be a correct decision, according to the will of Kosovo's citizens. Kosovo will respect the advisory opinion."

5000|$|Prior to 1870, {{there were}} two {{subjects}} of international law: the Papal State and the Holy See. (...) Of these two persons in international law the one, the Papal State, undoubtedly came to an end, under the rules of <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> by the Italian conquest and subjugation in 1870. But the Holy See remained, as always, a subject of <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> also in the period between 1870 and 1929. That this is so, is fully proved by the practice of states. The Holy See continued to conclude concordats and continued, {{with the consent of}} a majority of states, to exercise the active and passive right of legation.

50|$|From a legal standpoint, {{environmental}} protection {{during times of}} war and military activities is addressed partially by international environmental law.

50|$|Therefore, {{there is}} a {{persisting}} need to put arms control agreements into proper perspective. The central jurisprudential theme of this study adopts this perspective and investigates the role of -and interactions with- the institutions and mechanisms of <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> in the negotiation, operation, verification and enforcement of arms control agreements. The general jurisprudential thesis {{of the study is}} that, being part of and subject to <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> the law of arms control cannot provide a technical guarantee against the occurrence of wars. This is because the weakness of <b>general</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> itself is not due to technical reasons: International law {{is a function of the}} political community of nations, the defects of which are due to the embryonic character of the community in which it functions, not due to its technical shortcomings. International law after more than four centuries of systematized experience cannot claim to have found an effective and consistently reliable anti-dote against determined aggressors or violators ultimately outside that of self-help. Arms control negotiations and agreements mitigate the insecurity in which the States in world arena find themselves as a result of this ultimately individual responsibility to self-preservation. If armaments are about deterrence, arms control is about reassurance, he stated, before he went on to an exhaustive study of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the Vienna Document on Confidence and Security Building Measures in Europe.|$|E
