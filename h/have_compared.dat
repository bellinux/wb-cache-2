5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|DVD film reviews have {{suggested}} the film influenced director John Woo; critics <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> the graphic {{detail of the}} face transplant scene in Woo's action film Face/Off (1997) to the face transplant scene in Eyes Without a Face and noted the similarity. Another resemblance is Woo's trademark use of white doves in his films {{that is similar to}} the character Christiane's dove-laden escape in the film's finale.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones offer {{players the}} ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles. Games have {{included}} all kinds of vehicles, such as cars, helicopters, boats, jet-skis, fixed-wing aircraft, and military vehicles. Reviewers <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> these games {{based on the number}} of vehicles they offer, with greater choice resulting in better reviews. Players can also use vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the Cobra manga {{has sold}} 40 million copies, {{making it one}} of Weekly Shōnen Jumps best-selling manga series of all time. Publications for manga, anime and other media <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> the series to Star Wars and Barbarella, and the main character's {{attitude}} to James Bond. Its film adaptation received mixed reviews, and the original anime series as well as Cobra the Animation has been well received by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{is known}} for her {{particularly}} aggressive guitar-playing and its interaction with Linda Hopper's pop-influenced vocals. In addition, the vocal harmony between the two singers has defined the band's sound, especially on later releases such as Rubbing Doesn't Help that feature more of Morris' vocals. Critics <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> Morris' guitar-playing to punk acts like Johnny Ramone of Ramones as well as alternative rock musicians such as Johnny Marr.|$|E

5|$|Some critics <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> 30 Rock to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with {{parallels}} {{drawn between}} {{the relationship of}} Liz and Jack and that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant. It has also been compared to That Girl. Like That Girl and Mary Tyler Moore, 30 Rock is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living {{in a big city}} where she works in the television industry. That Girl was parodied in the opening segment of 30 Rocks pilot.|$|E
5|$|The {{music has}} been {{compared}} to the tone of alternative rock bands Radiohead, TheFlamingLips, and R.E.M.'s 1998 album Up. Furthermore, Barry Walters of Spin has compared the music to former Eno collaborators U2 and several reviewers <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> the musicality to PaulSimon—especially his 2006 Eno collaboration Surprise. The vocals have been declared similar to NeilYoung; and the arrangement {{has been compared to}} TheBeachBoys. Although the music was informed by gospel and digital music, comparisons have been made with genres as diverse as country due to the vocal delivery and oldschoolhiphop. One weakness addressed by several reviewers is the unoriginality of the music, especially in comparison to the duo's previous collaborations.|$|E
5|$|Thor {{closely resembles}} other Indo-European deities {{associated}} with the thunder: the Celtic Taranis, the Baltic Perkūnas, the Slavic Perun, and particularly the Hindu Indra, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the vajra are obvious parallels. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> Indra's slaying of Vritra with Thor's battle with Jörmungandr. Although in the past {{it was suggested that}} Thor was an indigenous sky god or a Viking Age import into Scandinavia, these Indo-European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately derived from a Proto-Indo-European deity.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the revelation}} of the character's new design as a cyborg ninja, writers noted how Raiden distanced himself from his {{previous}} appearance that imitated Solid Snake. They also emphasized how Raiden becomes {{a different type of}} game hero with a new, direct fighting style. Since Raiden has become more powerful than Solid Snake in physical strength and weaponry to the point of exaggeration, writers <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> him favorably to other popular game heroes and find his actions still in-character considering the fight scenes throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|Warriors have {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{but it has}} also been criticised for being confusing due to its large number of characters. Critics <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> it to the Redwall series, though one reviewer commented that the series is less elegantly written. Although nominated for several awards, Warriors has yet to receive any major literary prizes. The series has reached the New York Times Bestseller List and has found popularity in many countries, including Trinidad, Germany and China.|$|E

5|$|Kojima Productions <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> Raiden and Solid Snake as {{to their}} {{experiences}} and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation {{to make a new}} sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution.|$|E
5|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} this video, which premiered on VH1 Classic on 8 August 2006. There are {{similarities between}} the video for Meat Loaf's version of the song, and that the video for that of Celine Dion, with Meat Loaf being haunted {{by the memory of}} his lover. It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, blue tint for those after her death. Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut).|$|E
5|$|Shot {{mostly on}} {{location}} on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, Jaws {{was the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean. As a result, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Shrewsbury {{sequence}} {{has been}} particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Film critics <b>have</b> <b>compared</b> it to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin and the Battle on the Ice sequence in Alexander Nevsky, both directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Kenneth Branagh's Henry V used Welles's Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff {{in a way that}} was more influenced by Chimes at Midnight than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of Chimes at Midnight starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that Chimes at Midnights use of wide angle lenses, low-key lighting and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced My Own Private IdahoGus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of comparative philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established {{the science of}} myth. Since the Romantics, all study of myth has been comparative. Wilhelm Mannhardt, James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed the comparative approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871 Edward Burnett Tylor published his Primitive Culture, in which he applied the comparative method {{and tried to explain}} the origin and evolution of religion.* Robert A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 16 Tylor's procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. Max Müller applied the new science of comparative mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions.
