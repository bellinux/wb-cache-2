5|$|Enterprise {{was armed}} with two 100-pounder smoothbore, muzzle-loading Somerset cannon and two rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns. The breech-loading guns {{were of a}} new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an {{armoured}} target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> the battery.|$|E

5|$|Many of the <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> {{the first}} España were {{recovered}} and employed in coastal fortifications, {{some of which}} remained in service until 1999. Six of Jaime Is 12-inch guns were also salvaged and similarly employed after she was broken up in the 1940sthey too remained in service until they were decommissioned in the mid-1990s. The second España was never raised, and her wreck was discovered in the early 1980s. Several expeditions to survey the wreck took place between February and May 1984.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 27, sentries {{informed}} Magaw that Percy's troops were launching an attack supported by two frigates sailing up the Hudson. Magaw ordered {{an attack on the}} frigates, and both British ships were badly damaged by the <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> Fort Lee and Fort Washington. The frigates could not elevate their own guns to the height of the American positions. The British towed away the frigates, but an artillery duel continued for some time between British and American gunners.|$|E
5|$|SMS Helgoland, {{the lead}} ship of her class, was a {{dreadnought}} battleship of the German Imperial Navy. Helgolands design represented an incremental {{improvement over the}} preceding , including {{an increase in the}} bore diameter of the main <b>guns,</b> <b>from</b> 28cm (11in) to 30.5cm (12in). Her keel was laid down on 11 November 1908 at the Howaldtswerke shipyards in Kiel. Helgoland was launched on 25 September 1909 and was commissioned on 23 August 1911.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and Patiala Infantry, (Chaytor's Force) {{advanced}} on 20 September eastwards {{across the}} Jordan Valley toward the strongly entrenched Shunet Nimrin position, and Derbasi on the Ottoman left flank. The 6th Light Horse and 7th Light Horse Regiments, {{with a company}} of Patiala Infantry, were shelled by <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> El Haud {{in the foothills of}} Moab as they moved across the valley. Positions east of the Jordan River, including Mellaha, continued to be strongly held by Fourth Army units.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{attempted}} {{to build on}} their success against Convoy Faith by carrying out further medium-altitude attacks on convoys. III./KG 40 sank another four ships between July and September 1943, but suffered heavy losses from Allied aircraft and anti-aircraft <b>guns.</b> <b>From</b> October, Heinkel He177s largely took over the Condors' anti-shipping role, and the last Condor sorties were made over the Atlantic in early 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E

5|$|To {{the west}} of the Grand Sea Battery are {{landscaped}} gardens, built on top of earlier gun positions along the site. Five 19th-century smooth-bore <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> the Napoleonic period are on display, forming a saluting battery.

5|$|After a quick {{visit to}} Venezuela and Panama, in April 1948 Castro {{traveled}} {{to the city of}} Bogotá, Colombia where the Pan-American Conference was taking place. Fidel's Cuban student group along with others attempted to organize the 1948 Pan-American Students Conference in opposition, sponsored by the government of Argentine President Juan Perón. Instead the assassination of popular leftist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala led to widespread rioting that {{came to be known as}} the Bogotazo. Leaving 3000 dead, the riots revolved around clashes between the governing Conservatives – backed by the army – and leftist Liberals with support from socialists. Along with his fellow Cuban visitors, Castro joined the Liberal cause by stealing <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> a police station, but subsequent police investigations concluded that neither Castro nor any of the other Cubans had been involved in the killings.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E

5|$|At Nazareth, {{the initial}} {{attack by the}} Gloucester Hussars was {{strongly}} opposed during street fighting. The Congestion created by prisoners was increased by numerous German lorries parked along the narrow streets. As they were continuing their attack, the Gloucester Hussars were fired on by machine <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> the buildings on the high ground to the north-west and from balconies and windows. At 08:00 the Gloucester Hussars were reinforced by two squadrons and three troops of the 18th Lancers followed by a squadron of the 9th Hodson's Horse. They were subsequently counter-attack by German office workers who, despite being almost annihilated by the 13th Cavalry Brigade's machine guns, held off the British cavalry attack.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{decision}} was made, French shipyards were heavily committed to producing vessels for the French Navy. So, despite its intention to develop a French concept, the KSCS engaged Yarrow Shipbuilders in Glasgow, Scotland, to build the ships. Unlike the French, who preferred to install guns of their own manufacture, Yarrow was happy to order the <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> the Czechoslovak firm Škoda. The initial Yarrow design {{was based on an}} enlarged version of the British Shakespeare class, with five Skoda 14 cm/56 naval guns. Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion of one of the guns, to be replaced with a seaplane mounting. The final version replaced the seaplane mounting with improved anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|By 13 February 1942, the Japanese {{had already}} reached Pasir Panjang Ridge (present Kent Ridge Park) after {{destroying}} the Allied artillery force on Chwee Chian Hill (where Poh Ern Shih Temple stands today). This location {{was near the}} Alexandra area where the main ammunition stores and a military hospital were situated. The men of the 1st Battalion, Charlie Company, Malay Regiment, led by Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi fought bravely to the last. Many Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> Labrador assisted the Malay Regiment in their 48-hour struggle against the Japanese by firing high-explosive shells at enemy troops. However, with Japanese reinforcements, the Malay Regiment were finally surrounded and massacred. Three lucky ones, together with Lieutenant Abbas Abdul-Manan managed to escape and later rejoined 30 surviving soldiers of a British battalion in the nearby area.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, the Japanese Empire {{gained control}} of former German {{possessions}} in the central Pacific per {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Versailles. Due to Japan's warm relations with the British Empire and the United States at the time, Hiei and other Japanese warships became significantly less active after the war. Other than a patrol alongside Haruna and Kirishima off the Chinese coast in March 1919, Hiei remained in the Japanese home ports. On 13 October 1920, she was placed in reserve. Following the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923, the capital ships of the Japanese Navy assisted in rescue work {{until the end of the}} month. Hiei arrived at Kure Naval Base on 1 December 1923 for a refit which increased the elevation of her main <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> 20 to 33 degrees and rebuilt her foremast.|$|E
5|$|In March 1892, the cattlemen sent {{agents to}} Texas from Cheyenne and Idaho to recruit gunmen and finally {{carry out their}} plans for exterminating the homesteaders. The cattle barons have always used hired <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> Texas to take out {{suspected}} rustlers and scare away the nesters in Wyoming. One particular act of violence perpetrated by the Texans was recounted by cowboy John J. Baker, where the Texans ambushed and killed nine trappers whom they mistook for rustlers in Big Dry Creek, Wyoming. They received a $450 bonus for the slaughter.|$|E
5|$|In the RAF, Marcinkus {{carried out}} {{multiple}} tasks, including various training missions, night combat and bomber escort. In June, Marcinkus and his squadron members engaged in prolonged air combat with the Luftwaffe. As later reports confirm, the Germans lost four Me 109 fighter aircraft, {{one of which}} was shot down by Marcinkus. The original report submitted by Marcinkus claiming one Me 109 shot down on 21 June 1941 is held in The National Archives; he states that he fired two short bursts from his <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> 100 yards behind the German. Sergeant Blasil, also of 1 Squadron, witnessed the plane break up in the air. On the allied side, one American pilot was missing. The last mission Marcinkus carried out as a RAF pilot was on 12 February 1942.|$|E
