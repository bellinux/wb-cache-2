This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.|$|E

Khitan shares some terms with the Altaic but non-Mongolic Turkic spoken by the Uighur peoples, who shared the steppes of North Asia with the Khitans for several hundred years.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Maya civilization {{is divided into}} three {{principal}} periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods. These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged. Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline. <b>Definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|The uncoordinated use of {{the metric}} system by {{different}} scientific and engineering disciplines, particularly in the late 19th century, resulted in different choices of base units even though all {{were based on the}} same <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> units of the metre and the kilogram. During the 20th century, efforts were made to rationalise these units, and in 1960, the CGPM published the International System of Units, which has since then been the internationally recognised standard metric system.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{separate}} <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term Wicca {{that have been}} used in Paganism and Pagan studies since circa 1980. The first developed in England during the 1960s. Broad and inclusive, it covers most, if not all, forms of modern Pagan Witchcraft, especially if they share sufficient theological beliefs and ritual practices to be considered denominations within a common religious movement. In contrast, the second developed in the United States during the late 1970s. It refers specifically to the Gardnerian tradition of Witchcraft and those descended from it with little variation, namely Alexandrian and Algard Witchcraft, which are together known as British Traditional Wicca.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create a hierarchy of clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
5|$|Population in the Sava River basin is {{estimated}} at 8,176,000, and it includes four capitals—Belgrade, Ljubljana, Sarajevo and Zagreb. All of them, except Sarajevo, are also located directly on the river banks and represent the three largest settlements found along the Sava River course. Belgrade, located at {{the confluence of the}} river, is the largest city in the basin with urban population of 1,135,502. Ten municipalities where the city is situated have combined population of 1,283,783 as suburban settlements are added, while the Belgrade metropolitan area encompasses population of 1,639,121. Zagreb is the second largest city on the river, comprising population of 688,163 living in the city itself, and 790,017 in the city-administered area. Together with the Zagreb County, largely corresponding to various <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's metropolitan area, it has a combined population of 1,110,517.
