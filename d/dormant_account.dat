The <b>Dormant</b> <b>Accounts</b> Action Plan was recently adopted by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The National Substance Misuse Strategy incorporates an integrated approach to substance misuse bringing together alcohol use and misuse and the misuse of other substances. In line with the Strategy, funding will be provided from the <b>Dormant</b> <b>Accounts</b> Fund towards programmes and projects supporting a range of prevention and awareness raising initiatives designed to tackle drug and alcohol misuse among the general population. “This funding will support an integrated and evidence-based approach to prevention and education interventions aimed at tackling problem drug and alcohol misuse at the local level. I believe that Task Forces are well placed to deploy the funding available to best effect, as they have local knowledge and a track record of engaging local communities around substance misuse issues “ said the Minister. Drug and Alcohol Task Forces have been identified as the appropriate structures through which the measure will be implemented. Funding of € 50, 000 will be available to each Task Force equating to a total of € 1. 2 million for 2015. Ends Note to Editors The <b>Dormant</b> <b>Accounts</b> Act 2001 together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 and the <b>Dormant</b> <b>Accounts</b> (Amendment) Acts 2005 - 2012 provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (i. e. banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings and in this regard, institutions/undertakings are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of <b>dormant</b> <b>accounts</b> and unclaimed life assurance policies. The legislation also provides for a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed. In each year monies may be disbursed in accordance with Part 6 of the 2012 Act, from the Account, but only for the purposes of programmes or projects to assist: 1. the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; 2. the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged or 3. persons with a disability (within the meaning of the Equal Status Act 2000). Pobal administers <b>Dormant</b> <b>Accounts</b> Measures on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and certain other Departments, including the Department of Health. The specific objectives of the substance misuse measure are: •	to develop a greater understanding of the dangers of problem drug and alcohol use among the general population; •	to promote healthier lifestyle choices among young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of problem drug use; •	to promote healthier lifestyle choices throughout society in relation to alcohol by influencing and raising awareness among the general population...|$|R

40|$|In {{this note}} I revive a {{lingering}} (albeit <b>dormant)</b> <b>account</b> of rigid designation {{from the pages}} of Mind with the aim of laying it to rest. Why let a sleeping dog lie when you can put it down? André Gallois (1986) has proposed an account of rigid designators that allegedly squares with Saul Kripke’s (1980) characterisation of them as terms which designate the same object in all possible worlds, but on which, contra Kripke, identity sentences involving rigid designators may be merely contingently true. This suits Gallois, as he finds the notion of contingent identity coherent. Thus, the thrust of Gallois ’ thesis is that his account of rigidity is preferable to Kripke’s because his accommodates a coherent metaphysical viewpoint, whereas Kripke’s doesn’t. Gallois has thwarted one unconvincing challenge (see Carter 1987; Gallois 1988) and his account, as yet, remains untainted. But not for long, I hope. 1 Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the notion of contingent identity is coherent, that, in other words, it makes—or can make—sense to say that certain (possible) objects are identical in one world but distinct in another. What I shall argue here is that Gallois ’ account of rigidity would prevent us from expressing the contingent nonidentity of objects; if so, this is a significant failing of the account, for, as it will emerge, clearly Gallois is committed to the contingency of non-identity. 1 Gallois (1990) has gone on to propose a “companion ” analysis of identity sentences involving temporal operators that accommodates what he calls the occasional identity of objects—the view that some objects may be identical at one time but distinct at another. But there are pivotal points of disanalogy between Gallois ’ accounts of contingent identity and occasional identity; so my comments here should be regarded as applying solely to his position on the contingency of identity...|$|E
40|$|M. A. This study {{determines the}} role of crisis {{management}} in the <b>dormant</b> <b>account</b> crisis that faced three Swiss banks from 1995 until 2000. This research topic involving the Swiss banks was selected for numerous reasons. Firstly, there was an immense amount of media interest from around the world. Secondly, the geographical area that the crisis was focused in-the western world- is arguably the world's financial powerhouse. Thirdly, the issues surrounding the crisis itself were highly emotive and had {{its roots in the}} period shortly before World War Two. Fourthly, on closer investigation very little research had been done on Western corporate financial crises and most importantly, no research had been done on the way the Swiss banks managed their crisis. All of these issues combined provided a very interesting platform on which to begin researching the value of effective crisis management, from a strategic standpoint, for a western corporate financial company. To facilitate an effective and objective analysis of the case study, an extensive literature study had to be undertaken. The origins of public relations had to be researched to understand how the profession had developed. In addition, crisis management also had to be studied to understand how this discipline of public relations works. From there, {{the role of}} public relations had to be studied to comprehend exactly what should have been done, in terms of how crisis management is an element of public relations, for the Swiss banks before the crisis began. Following on from this it was established, from the literature study, that planning for a crisis is one of the foundations of crisis management. AThe most important aspects of and contributors to crisis planning were then considered. It was also established that crises have different stages that they pass through. This was then investigated as well as the relevant aspects needed to manage each stage. An important aspect encountered in each crisis is the media. The different parts of media training were studied. followed by arguably {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of crisis management- managing the media...|$|E
