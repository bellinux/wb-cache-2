5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the <b>good</b> <b>ones.</b> Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E
25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many <b>good</b> <b>ones,</b> and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E
25|$|Hunter's first studio {{album of}} the 1980s was Short Back 'n' Sides (1981), {{produced}} in collaboration with Ronson and Clash guitarist Mick Jones. Ronson's input on Hunter's next album, All of the <b>Good</b> <b>Ones</b> Are Taken (1983), was restricted to playing guitar on a single track. The title track became a minor hit in the US, after MTV put the song's video into heavy rotation. In the same year, Ronson travelled to Canada to produce the Payolas' album Hammer on a Drum, to which Hunter contributed backing vocals.|$|E

25|$|John Donne {{was under}} the matronage of Lucy Russell {{during the time that}} Boulstred fell ill and died. As {{previously}} mentioned, he visited her when she was sick and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. After she died, he wrote two poems in her honor, “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” and “Elegy Upon the Death of Mistress Boulstred.” The former poem characterizes Death as an “all-consuming glutton who swallows the good” and argues that Boulstred was one of the <b>good</b> <b>ones.</b> The latter poem says that Death is no longer needed because Boulstred was the epitome of virtue, and now that she is dead, it is like the entire world is dead. Donne most likely wrote these elegies in the hopes of getting a reward from his literary matron Lucy Russell.|$|E
25|$|Given the Singapore government's {{focus on}} efficiency, {{the country has}} been said to {{emphasize}} a largely green-light approach towards administrative law. Public administration is not seen as a necessary evil but a positive attribute, and the objective of administrative law is not primarily to stop bad administrative practices but to encourage <b>good</b> <b>ones.</b> In this approach, recourse to the judiciary is not the first line of defence against administrative abuses of powers. Instead, it is perceived that control can and should come internally from Parliament and the executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy. In other words, instead of redressing bad government through the courts, good government should be sought through the political process and public avenues. Courts play a supporting role by articulating clear rules and principles by which the Singapore government may abide and conform to the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia faces many historical, cultural, {{social and}} {{political}} obstacles that have restricted progress in education for many centuries. According to UNESCO reviews, most people in Ethiopia feel that work {{is more important than}} education, so they start {{at a very early age}} with little to no education. Children in rural areas are less likely to go to school than children in urban areas. Though gradually improving, most rural families cannot afford to send their children to school because parents believe that while their children are in school they cannot contribute to the household chores and income. Social awareness that education is important is something that Ethiopia lacks but has improved gradually. There is a need to change the importance of education in the country's social structure, and children should be encouraged and required to attend school and become educated. The society of Ethiopia expects teachers and parents to use corporal punishment to maintain order and discipline. Most believe that through punishing children for bad habits they in turn learn <b>good</b> <b>ones.</b> Also since the mid-1970s there was a drastic loss of professionals who left the country, mostly for economical reasons. Many educated Ethiopians sought higher salaries in foreign countries thus many of those who managed to finish higher education emigrated from Ethiopia creating an endless shortage of qualified professionals in every sector of the country. Now the custom of sending academics abroad with the risk of a brain drain is being replaced by expansion of masters and doctoral programs to up-grade academic staff. Instead, foreigners have been funding programs for leadership, management and pedagogic skills or sending staff to help strengthen teaching and management practices.|$|E

Even so, on those occasions when Gilbert wrote in unvaried metre, Sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition, such as [...] "Love is a plaintive song" [...] (Patience) and [...] "A man who would woo a fair maid" [...] (The Yeomen of the Guard).|$|E

ReFS resiliency features enhance the mirroring feature provided by Storage Spaces and can detect whether any mirrored copies of files become corrupt using background data scrubbing process, which periodically reads all mirror copies and verifies their checksums then replaces bad copies with <b>good</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
