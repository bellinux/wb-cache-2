The effects of 254 nm ultraviolet light (UV) radiation on aerobic plate counts (APC), and populations of Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli on eggshells surfaces were investigated. In the first experiment, eggs were exposed to UV treatment of (7. 35 mW/cm?) for 0, 15, 30, and 60 s on a hand operated egg roller. Three eggs were collected from each exposure treatment for evaluation of treatment effects on APC. In the second experiment, the UV lights were placed in a chamber equipped with a commercial style <b>egg</b> <b>conveyor.</b> UV treatment of 7. 5 mW/cm? and time intervals of 0, 12, 36, and 48 s were used. Three eggs were placed consecutively on the conveyor and passed through the chamber, the center egg was selected for APC evaluation and three sets of eggs were evaluated per treatment. In all remaining experiments, eggs were exposed to UV treatment of a minimum of 18 mW/cm? for 4 min in a UV sanitation machine. The machine contained a chamber equipped with UV lights and conveyor system to carry a commercial style eggflat. In the third experiment, 42 eggs were placed on an egg flat (6 rows, 7 columns) and passed through UV sanitation machine. Seven eggs were collected, one from each column. In the fourth experiment, Salmonella typhimurium was inoculated on 14 unwashed clean eggs. Seven eggs inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium were placed on the egg flat, surrounded with other unwashed clean eggs, and passed through the UV sanitation machine. In the fifth experiment, Escherichia coli was inoculated on 14 unwashed clean eggs. Seven eggs inoculated with Escherichia coli were placed on the egg flat, surrounded with other unwashed clean eggs, and passed through the UV sanitation machine...|$|E
40|$|Hockett (1955) once {{described}} {{the problem of}} speech recognition with the metaphor of recognizing colored <b>eggs</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> belt {{after they have been}} crushed by a wringer. After the wringer, the different colors run into each other, {{and it is difficult to}} say where a given color starts and ends. This metaphor correctly indicates that speech sounds are neither separable—that is, there is no point in time at which the speech signal is influ-enced by only one phoneme—nor invariant, because the acoustic form for a given phoneme will be influenced by the surrounding phonemes. One example is the case of fricative–vowel syllables in American English. Although /s / is supposed to be pronounced with unrounded lips, a following rounded vowel leads to some anticipatory lip rounding, making the fricative more /S/-like. How are such coarticulated phonemes then recognized? A number of studies have shown that coarticulation is compensate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims {{to design and}} develop a force air system of eggs {{incubator}} to incubate various types of <b>eggs</b> through a <b>conveyor</b> rotating system. This incubator was equipped with temperature and humidity sensors to measure and control the condition in the incubator. The incubator body was fabricated by stainless steel that provides less bacterial cross contamination between the incubator and the hatched chicks. It was designed to automatically change the parameters to the suitable condition to fit {{the various types of}} eggs. Direct current geared motor with low speed was used to rotate chained steel mat at the bottom and automatically change the position of egg to avoid the embryo sticks onto the shell. The entire elements were controlled by microcontroller devices to process the data from sensors and execute the control element of the machine. LabVIEW system was applied for temperature and humidity data recording. The evaluation of the shaft for egg turning system was analysed. The safety factor was determined at 5. 88 by manual calculation and 9. 6 by software simulation respectively. This indicated that the safety factor of the shaft has achieved the required standard which must be higher than 0. 99. The test run experiment on quail eggs, showed the stable temperature in incubation chamber of 37. 5 oC and 49. 86 % of relatively humidity (RH) were achieved. Therefore, the usage of conveyor instead of turning 45 o for eggs rotation system has shown the potential to replicate natural hatching and produce higher hatching rate of 94. 17 %. This machine also provides an accurate temperature and humidity condition in the incubator as well as less bacterial cross contamination...|$|R
