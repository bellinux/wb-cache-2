5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons for doing so are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
25|$|TeX is {{an example}} of a {{computer}} typesetting system that makes use of ligatures automatically. The Computer Modern Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl. When TeX finds these combinations in a text, it substitutes the appropriate ligature, unless overridden by the typesetter. Opinion is divided over whether it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures.|$|E

25|$|In {{parody of}} the college’s Oxbridge traditions, the first year {{students}} will occasionally disrupt the formality of the meal by hurling buns at their fellow undergraduates. When this occurs, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the second years to eject all offending first years, or occasionally fellow upper years, from the hall. This is generally done with much struggle, however with little injury {{to any of the}} parties concerned. As the artillery is traditionally limited to simple bread rolls, no significant damage results from these incidents.|$|E
25|$|Each episode {{should run}} for 27 minutes and 15 seconds, however, if any episode runs over or under then it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of {{post-production}} to cut or add scenes where appropriate. As {{noted in the}} 1994 behind-the-scenes book, EastEnders: The First 10 Years, after filming, tapes {{were sent to the}} videotape editor, who then edited the scenes together into an episode. The videotape editor used the director's notes so they knew which scenes the director wanted to appear in a particular episode. The producer might have asked for further changes to be made. The episode was then copied onto D3 video. The final process was to add the audio which included background noise such as a train or a jukebox music and to check it met the BBC's technical standard for broadcasting.|$|E

25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of a recon leader? To recon {{the front line}} – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about {{the majority of the}} Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

Each character begins with only the [...] "Freelancer" [...] class; {{to gain access to}} new jobs, players must acquire crystal shards. This system is [...] an improved version of the one in Final Fantasy III; several older jobs were either reused or revamped for Final Fantasy V, such as the Black Mage and Thief.

500|$|A CAP {{flight is}} a semi-independent unit {{that is used}} mainly as a stepping-stone for a new unit until they are {{large enough to be}} {{designated}} a squadron. Due to their transitory nature, there are very few flights within the CAP structure at any one time. A flight will be assigned to a squadron [...] "parent", and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the flight and squadron commanders to work together to build the flight into a full and independent squadron. Flights are also used as temporary units within a squadron. These flights are dismissed after the activity or meeting they were created for. A flight within a squadron is assigned a letter, so a flight could be designated [...] "Charlie Flight, Thunderbolt Squadron", for example. In larger squadrons, flights are permanent subunits and cadets are assigned to them.|$|E
500|$|Absent {{mothers and}} abusive fathers are another {{theme in the}} novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could {{remember}} her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house {{to the extent that}} Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{decision}} written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision. Associate Justice Elena Kagan recused herself {{from participating in}} the case, as she had signed the government's brief during her tenure as Solicitor General of the United States. Declining to review using a standard set out in National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States (1979), the Court instead used a standard set out in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984). Chevron, a landmark case regarding deference to government agencies, instituted a two-part test: The job of the reviewing court is to first establish whether Congress has unambiguously spoken about the matter. If so, the court is to follow Congress' intent. If not, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the court {{to determine whether the}} agency's statutory interpretation was a reasonable one. National Muffler, on the other hand, requires that reviewing courts take into account [...] "whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose" [...] and states that courts may examine a statutory interpretation made years after the passage of the original act on the merits. The Mayo Foundation had requested that the Court rule according to the National Muffler standard, while the United States argued that the Court should use the Chevron standard, arguing that National Muffler had been superseded. The Court had in fact cited both cases in opinions since 1984, but agreed with the Government's position, stating {{that it would not be}} wise to [...] "carve out an approach to administrative review good for tax law only".|$|E

2500|$|Logic arose (see below) from {{a concern}} with {{correctness}} of argumentation.

That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> {{of the theory of}} rationality.

2500|$|Transforming {{assembly}} language into machine code <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of an assembler, and the reverse {{can at least}} partially be achieved by a disassembler. Unlike high-level languages, there is a one-to-one correspondence between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. However, in some cases, an assembler may provide pseudoinstructions (essentially macros) which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality. For example, for a machine that lacks a [...] "branch if greater or equal" [...] instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine's [...] "set if less than" [...] and [...] "branch if zero (on {{the result of the}} set instruction)". Most full-featured assemblers also provide a rich macro language (discussed below) which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences.|$|E
