Besides describing in detail the calculations <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> paper (arXiv: 0810. 3889), we also include the mixing effects of the Flavor-Changing Neutral-Current (FCNC) operators for t→ q+γ and t→ q+Z, which were not considered <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> paper. The results for t→ q+g {{are the same as}} <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> paper. But the mixing effects can either be large or small, and increase or decrease the branching ratios for t→ q+γ and t→ q+Z, depending on the values of the anomalous couplings (κ^g,γ,Z_tq/Λ, f^g,γ,Z_tq and h^g,γ,Z_tq).

However, f-wave pairing gives way to singlet pairings for sufficiently large values of off-site repulsions. Among the singlet pairings, i-wave and extended s-wave pairings are good candidates which do not break time reversal symmetry below T_c in agreement with the experiments. Comment: 12 page...|$|R
