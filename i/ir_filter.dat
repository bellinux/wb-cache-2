50|$|In {{conventional}} photography, the <b>IR</b> <b>filter</b> {{is used to}} {{make the}} spectral response of the CMOS sensor more like that of the human eye. In this way, the pictures gathered by the sensor more closely resemble the world as we see it. In astro-photography, many objects of interest emit strongly in the red H-α line, which is heavily attenuated by the <b>IR</b> <b>filter</b> on the 20D. The <b>IR</b> <b>filter</b> of the 20Da passes 2.5 times more light at around this 656 nm wavelength as the filter of the 20D, allowing more fine detail to be revealed in long exposures of emission nebulae. As a side effect, the color balance is slightly altered in normal daylight photography.|$|E

Therefore, this paper analyses the refraction of <b>IR</b> <b>filters</b> and finds <b>IR</b> <b>filters</b> will bring about the biggish radial distortion on imaging process. And then, this paper directly uses Zhang’s technique to calibrate the parameters of IR cameras in infrared environment by adjusting the imaging conditions of calibration.

5000|$|According to the TV program, the {{demonstration}} of imaging an object in a complete darkness was fabricated. The demonstration was performed by comparing the SMPD and the existing CMOS sensors (camera). Their images were compared as the light was dimmed down to a darkness. During {{the demonstration}}, only the SMPD was able to show the image in darkness, while the CMOS sensors could not. The demonstration looked successful; however, later {{it turned out that}} the testing condition was not identical to both cases. Here is the explanation. An object emits both visible lights and infra-red waves. Under darkness, an object emits only infra-red waves. Typical CMOS sensors can detect both visible lights and infra-red waves. However, when they detect both visible and infra-red waves, the images become less identical to what humans see with their eyes. Thus, typically the CMOS sensors has a filter that block infra-red (IR) waves. Thus, the CMOS sensors could not detect anything in the darkness during the demonstration. On the other hand, the SMPD sensor did not have an <b>IR</b> <b>filter,</b> and thus was able to 'see' the images in the darkness. When the TV program put an <b>IR</b> <b>filter</b> in front of the SMPD sensor, the SMPD sensor image disappeared. [...] Thus, the demonstration in the darkness showed the outcome of the existence of an <b>IR</b> <b>filter,</b> instead of the true performance of the SMPD sensor. The performance comparison under the identical environment was never demonstrated since then. This experiment is a main evidence to support the technical fraud by the SMPD technology.|$|E

Each channel is allocated its own complement of filters: 48 elements for the UVIS (42 filters, 5 quads, and 1 UV grism) and 17 slots for the <b>IR</b> (15 <b>filters</b> and 2 grisms). While {{a majority of the}} UVIS filters exhibit excellent performance consistent with or exceeding expectations, a subset show significant filter ghosts. Procurement of improved replacement filters is in progress and a summary of the characterization tests being performed on the new filters is presented. In the IR channel, while no filter ghosting was detected in any of the filters during thermal vacuum testing, the grisms were found to be installed incorrectly; they have been removed and will be reinstalled.

40|$|The Infrared {{spectral}} region {{is a rich}} one for variable star work, especially of cooler stars, {{but it has been}} hard to do IR photometry because of high, variable background, and specialized telescopic equipment that is usually required to obtain meaningful data. Typically telescopes with IR detectors have been at high elevations, to minimize water vapor absorption. Nearly all the filters produced for astronomical work at observatories around the world have not been optimized for use at anything other than the highest and driest of observatories. This has made it difficult for amateur astronomers to contribute to this field. Now, however, this is no longer the case. The IAU's Infrared Working Group (IRWG) has designed and tested a set of <b>IR</b> <b>filters</b> less sensitive to water vapor, permitting observations at any site where precise optical photometry can be carried out.

50|$|In digital {{photography}} {{the majority of}} filters used with film cameras have been rendered redundant by digital filters applied either in-camera or during post processing.

Not using optical filters in front of the lens has the advantage of avoiding the reduction of image quality caused by the presence of an extra optical element in the light path and may be necessary to avoid vignetting when using wide-angle lenses.|$|E
