5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of <b>insect</b> <b>repellent</b> (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as <b>insect</b> <b>repellent.</b> Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E

25|$|The best {{means of}} {{prevention}} is overall mosquito {{control and the}} avoidance of bites {{in areas where the}} disease is common. This may be partly achieved by decreasing mosquitoes' access to water and with the use of <b>insect</b> <b>repellent</b> and mosquito nets. There is no vaccine and no specific treatment as of 2016.

It has <b>insect</b> <b>repellent</b> properties (Jahn 1991 a, b; 1992), and is an active ingredient in some commercial mosquito repellents (Fradin & Day 2002). Eucalyptus globulus is the principal source of eucalyptus oil worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Although Osage oranges are {{commonly}} believed to repel insects, there is insufficient {{evidence to support}} this. Research has shown that compounds extracted from the fruit, when concentrated, may repel insects. However, the naturally occurring concentrations of these compounds in the fruit are far too low to make the fruit an effective <b>insect</b> <b>repellent.</b> In 2004, the EPA insisted that a website selling M. pomifera fruits online remove any mention of their supposed pesticidal properties as false advertisements.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2 of the 2007 ALDS {{against the}} Cleveland Indians, Chamberlain was {{pitching}} {{in the bottom}} of the eighth with the Yankees leading 1–0.

Chamberlain threw 2 wild pitches, yielding the tying run. The Indians went on to win the game 2–1. The Yankees would then lose the Division Series against the Indians in 4 games in the best-of-five series.|$|E

25|$|Another method {{targeting}} the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried {{in some areas}} of North America and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering praziquantel to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans. Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common <b>insect</b> <b>repellent</b> DEET prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice. Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing mosquito bites {{in areas}} where the disease occurs and proper use of condoms. Efforts to prevent bites include the use of <b>insect</b> <b>repellent,</b> covering much of the body with clothing, mosquito nets, and getting rid of standing water where mosquitoes reproduce. There is no effective vaccine. Health officials recommended that women in areas affected by the 2015–16 Zika outbreak consider putting off pregnancy and that pregnant women not travel to these areas. While there is no specific treatment, paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with the symptoms. Admission to hospital is rarely necessary.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{prevention}} of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites {{in areas where}} yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for {{prevention of}} yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures of controlling mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever. Use of EPA-registered <b>insect</b> <b>repellent</b> is recommended when outdoors. Exposure for even a short time is enough for a potential mosquito bite. Long-sleeved clothing, long pants, and socks are useful for prevention. The awareness of peak mosquito exposure is from dusk to dawn. The application of larvicides to water-storage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. Adult mosquitos can be killed through insecticide spray usage, which decreases the transmission of yellow fever.|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} between <b>insect</b> <b>repellents</b> and the olfactory system {{have been widely}} studied, however relatively {{little is known about}} the effects of repellents on the gustatory system of insects. In this study, we show that the gustatory receptor neuron (GRN) located in the medial styloconic sensilla on the maxillary palps of gypsy moth larvae, and known to be sensitive to feeding deterrents, also responds to the <b>insect</b> <b>repellents</b> DEET, IR 3535, and picaridin. These repellents did not elicit responses in the lateral styloconic sensilla. Moreover, behavioral studies demonstrated that each repellent deterred feeding.

40|$|Many insects such as {{mosquitoes}} cause life-threatening {{diseases such}} as malaria, yellow fever and West Nile virus. Malaria alone infects 500 million people annually and causes 1 - 3 million death per year. Volatile <b>insect</b> <b>repellents,</b> which are detected through the sense of smell, have long been used to protect humans against insect pests. Antifeed-ants are non-volatile aversive compounds that are detected through the sense of taste and prevent insects from feeding on plants. The molecular targets and signaling path-ways required for sensing <b>insect</b> <b>repellents</b> and antifeedants are poorly understood. Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Ca 2 +-permeable cation channels exist in organisms ranging from C. elegans to D. melanogaster and Homo sapiens. Drosophila has 13 fam-ily members, which mainly function in sensory physiology such as vision, thermotaxis and chemotaxis. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiate olfactory signaling cas-cades in mammals and in nematodes C. elegans. However, the mechanisms of G protein signaling cascades in insect chemosensation are controversial.
