50|$|Transfusion-related {{immunomodulation}} {{refers to}} the transient depression {{of the immune system}} following transfusion of blood products. This effect has been recognized in groups of individuals who have undergone kidney transplantation or have had multiple miscarriages. Some research studies have shown that, because of this <b>immune</b> <b>depression,</b> blood transfusions increase the risk of infections and cancer recurrence. However, other studies have not shown these differences and the degree of impact transfusion has on infection and tumor recurrence is not well understood. The Blood Products Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration recommends that all transfused blood products undergo leukocyte reduction in order to offset the contribution of donor white blood cells to immune suppression.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} subchronic trypanosomiasis upon immune {{responses}} {{were examined in}} Trypanosoma gambiense infection and in subcurative treatment of T. brucei- and T- equiperdum-infected mice. About 60 % of the mice infected with T. gambiense developed a subchronic infection similar to human trypanosomiasis, characterized {{by the absence of}} circulating trypanosomes. The animals died between 1 and 12 months after infection with elevated serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels (16 times the normal level). After 1 month of infection, the mice showed a normal primary antibody response against sheep erythrocytes, as tested by hemagglutination, despite their high serum IgM levels. After more than 1 month of infection, about 20 % of the mice showed depressed hemagglutination titers (25 % of control), whereas all relapsed mice that contained circulating parasites showed a pronounced suppression. Elimination of the blood parasites with Berenil treatment restored immune competence, which persisted until the relapse of the animals. Identical results were obtained in T. brucei-infected mice. Berenil treatment abolished the <b>immune</b> <b>depression</b> against sheep erythrocytes, but did not cure the animals, which relapsed with {{the development of a new}} state of <b>immune</b> <b>depression.</b> T. gambiense and T. brucei infections were always followed by a marked increase of serum IgM levels. Hypergammaglobulinemia was also induced in relapsing T. equiperdum-infected mice treated with Berenil. No <b>immune</b> <b>depression</b> against sheep erythrocytes could be detected.

This investigation centered on dendritic cells as potentially decisive in this phenomenon. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, initially 19 days old, had free access for 14 days {{to a complete}} diet or to a low-protein formulation that induced wasting deficits of protein and energy. Mice were sensitized by i. p. injection of sheep red blood cells on day 9, at which time one-half of the animals in each dietary group received a simultaneous injection of 10 (6) syngeneic dendritic cells (JAWS II). All mice were challenged with the immunizing antigen in the right hind footpad on day 13, and the 24 -hour delayed hypersensitivity response was assessed as percentage increase in footpad thickness. The low-protein diet reduced the inflammatory immune response, but JAWS cells, which exhibited immature phenotypic and functional characteristics, increased the response of both the malnourished group and the controls. By contrast, i. p. injection of 10 (6) syngeneic T cells did not influence the inflammatory immune response of mice subjected to the low-protein protocol. Antigen-presenting cell numbers limited primary inflammatory cell-mediated competence in this model of wasting malnutrition, an outcome that challenges the prevailing multifactorial model of malnutrition-associated <b>immune</b> <b>depression.</b> Thus, a new dendritic cell-centered perspective emerges regarding the cellular mechanism underlying <b>immune</b> <b>depression</b> in acute pediatric protein and energy deficit...|$|E

40|$|Although <b>depression</b> and <b>immune</b> {{changes in}} elderly {{subjects}} constitute a considerable health risk, mechanisms underlying {{the association between}} <b>depression</b> and <b>immune</b> function are unclear. The question of whether personality and social support can explain the variation in <b>immune</b> function during <b>depression</b> was addressed in 21 elderly depressive and 23 control subjects. The following variables were studied: neuroticism, extraversion, received social support, depression-related immune parameters [i. e. numbers of lymphocytes, lymphocyte subsets CD 3 +, CD 8 +, natural killer-like T cells (NKT), CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, and interleukin- 6 (Il- 6) ]. We found that neuroticism reduced the association between depression and Il- 6 (from 62 to 22. 4 %) and between depression and CD 3 + (from 27. 6 to 21. 6 %), and was also directly related to Il- 6 (i. e. adjusted for age and depression). Social support reduced the association between depression and NKT cells from 25 to 18 %, while it was also directly related to NKT cells. Extraversion, adjusted for age and depression, was negatively related to CD 4 /CD 8 ratio. Subjects with high extraversion and high social support had more NKT cells. We concluded that changes in <b>immune</b> function during <b>depression</b> can partly be explained by neuroticism and received social support, whereas immune function is also directly related to these psychosocial variables. Neuroticism may exert its contribution to the risk for depression partly via Il- 6 production. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To specify the characteristics of diabetic foot infections in which surgical samples have isolated one or several germs including group B Streptococcus, study its risk factors and determine its course. Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated the records of all patients admitted to the University Hospital of Geneva from January 1999 through October 2004, with diagnoses of severe foot infection (+/- osteomyelitis) documented during surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-five severe diabetic foot infections were identified, 21 with osteomyelitis. The most common risk factors were age older than 60 years (n= 10), chronic renal failure (n= 7), severe arteriopathy (n= 6), and <b>immune</b> <b>depression</b> (n= 2). Most lesions were classified as grade 3 or 4 of Wagner's classification. 80 % of the surgical samples were polymicrobial. Blood cultures were positive in 4 patients, one in septic shock.

40|$|The {{tolerance}} {{model of}} acute (i. e., wasting) pre-pubescent protein and energy deficits proposes that the <b>immune</b> <b>depression</b> characteristic of these pathologies reflects an intact anti-inflammatory form of immune competence {{that reduces the}} risk of autoimmune reactions to catabolically released self antigens. A cornerstone of this proposition is the finding that constitutive (first-tier) interleukin(IL) - 10 production is sustained even into the advanced stages of acute malnutrition. The IL- 10 response to inflammatory challenge constitutes a second tier of anti-inflammatory regulation and was the focus of this investigation. Weanling mice consumed a complete diet ad libitum, a low-protein diet ad libitum (mimicking incipient kwashiorkor), or the complete diet in restricted daily quantities (mimicking marasmus), and their second-tier IL- 10 production was determined both in vitro and in vivo using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and anti-CD 3 as stimulants of innate and adaptive defences, respectively. Both early (3 days) and advanced (14 days) stages of wasting pathology were examined and three main outcomes emerged. First, classic in vitro systems are unreliable for discerning cytokine production in vivo. Secondly, in diverse forms of acute malnutrition declining challenge-induced IL- 10 production may provide an early sign that anti-inflammatory control over immune competence is failing. Thirdly, and most fundamentally, the investigation provides new support for the tolerance model of malnutrition-associated inflammatory <b>immune</b> <b>depression...</b>|$|E

The numerous studies which have focused on the link between DHEA and car-diovascular disease have generally been inconsistent, generating much debate and controversy on this issue. The present article is an analysis of studies on the relationship between endogenous DHEA or DHEA-S, obesity and cardiovascular disease risk, as well as DHEA treatment studies. Elev-ated plasma levels of free DHEA are associated with reduced obesity in both men and women, and with smaller abdominal body fat accumulations in men. However, contradictory results have been reported regarding the relationships between the sulfate ester DHEA-S and adiposity. Age differences in the populations studied may have been a confounding factor in these associations. On the other hand, DHEA-S level is not a predictor of cardiovascular disease endpoints in women, and appears to be a relatively weak one in men.

The lack of correlation between antibody titres and levels of immune complexes suggests that these immune complexes contain antigens other than those derived exclusively from the parasite. Although few of the symptoms of this disease {{are likely to be}} due to deposition of circulating <b>immune</b> complexes, the <b>depression</b> of delayed hypersensitivity reactions to the parasite found in patients with generalized onchocerciasis may be due to IgM immune complexes exerting an immuno-regulatory role on T cell function...|$|R
40|$|Early life {{environmental}} exposure could represent a critical {{period for the}} onset of permanent alterations in the structure and function of different organs and induces a stronger chronic inflammation, exacerbating the common age related diseases {{as well as an}} <b>immune</b> system <b>depression</b> in oldness. We evaluate the effect of early life permethrin treatment (1 / 50 LD 50, from 6 th to 21 st day of life) on heart of adult rats and on several immune system and inflammation mediators as Nurr- 1, NF-kB p 65 and Nrf- 2 leukocyte proteins expression in adult and old rats. Increased DNA damage, decrease in plasma membrane fluidity, increase in cholesterol content, protein and lipid oxidation have been measured in cardiac cells population from adulthood rats treated with permethrin in neonatal period. Moreover the treatment with pesticide induced higher level of cholesterol, IL- 1, IL- 2, IFN-rat-Rantes and IL- 10 cytokines and decreased albumin content in plasma of rats. Lower cholesterol level and perturbation in the phospholipid lateral diffusion together with a decrease in GSH level and increase in GPx activity were measured in heart mitochondria from treated group. At leukocyte level we observed that Nurr 1 protein level, as well as, lipid hydroperoxides and vitamin D plasma concentration increased, while inflammatory cytokines as IL- 1 , IL- 2, IL- 13, catecholamines as adrenalin and noradrenalin, and plasma levels decreased with respect to the control group. The results confirm the hypothesis that early life {{environmental exposure}} to xenobiotics represents a crucial period for the onset of permanent alterations in the structure and function of different organs and body systems as immune system whose changes will influence the health status in oldness...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{inflammation}} {{theory of}} depression, proposed over 20 years ago, {{was influenced by}} early studies on T cell responses and since then has been a stimulus for numerous research projects aimed at understanding the relationship between <b>immune</b> function and <b>depression.</b> Observational {{studies have shown that}} indicators of immunity, especially C reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6, are associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders, although the evidence from randomized trials remains limited and only few studies have assessed the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in depression. In this paper, we review current knowledge on the interactions between central and peripheral innate and adaptive immune molecules and the potential role of immune-related activation of microglia, inflammasomes and indoleamine- 2, 3 -dioxygenase in the development of depressive symptoms. We highlight how combining basic immune methods with more advanced ‘omics’ technologies would help us to make progress in unravelling the complex associations between altered immune function and depressive disorders, in the identification of depression-specific biomarkers and in developing immunotherapeutic treatment strategies that take individual variability into account...|$|R
