50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Playing the Game was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors cut, in Reel 5, the closeup of foreman <b>holding</b> <b>gun</b> against Mexican's heart.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the most}} basic implementation, the holding beam tube uses three {{electron}} guns; one for writing, one for reading, and a third [...] "holding gun" [...] that maintains the pattern. The general operation {{is very similar to}} the Williams tube in concept. The main difference was the <b>holding</b> <b>gun,</b> which fired continually and unfocussed so it covered the entire storage area on the phosphor. This caused the phosphor to be continually charged to a selected voltage, somewhat below that of the secondary emission threshold.|$|E

50|$|Three men {{riding on}} a {{motorcycle}} <b>holding</b> <b>guns,</b> came into the village of Mong in Mandi Bauddin on Friday morning. Two of the perpetrators went inside the mosque and started firing immediately, killing eight people. The attackers managed to escape after the attack.|$|R
50|$|Reading was {{accomplished}} by scanning the reading gun across the storage area. This gun was set to a voltage that would cross the secondary emission threshold for the entire display. If the scanned area held the <b>holding</b> <b>gun</b> potential {{a certain number of}} electrons would be released, if it held the writing gun potential the number would be higher. The electrons were read on a grid of fine wires placed behind the display, making the system entirely self-contained - the Williams tube's read plate was in front of the tube, and required continual mechanical adjustment to work properly. The grid also had the advantage of breaking the display into spots without requiring the tight focus of the Williams system.|$|E
