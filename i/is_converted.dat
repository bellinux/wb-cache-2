5|$|The {{light energy}} {{captured}} by chlorophyll a is initially {{in the form}} of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to sucrose (common table sugar) for export {{to the rest of the}} plant.|$|E

5|$|The uranium {{fraction}} diagrams in {{the presence}} of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.|$|E
5|$|When {{carbonate}} is added, uranium <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to {{a series}} of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.|$|E
