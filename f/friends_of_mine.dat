In 2007 alone, Stevens played piano on The National's album Boxer, {{produced}} and contributed many instrumental tracks to Rosie Thomas's album These <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mine,</b> multiple instruments on Ben + Vesper's album All This Could Kill You and oboe and vocals to David Garland's 2007 album Noise in You.|$|E
25|$|Over the 2005 winter holidays, Stevens {{recorded}} {{an album}} with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas {{were having a}} baby together, but were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools' prank. In December 2006, the collaborative recordings were digitally released by Nettwerk as a Rosie Thomas album titled These <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mine.</b> The album was released in physical form on March 13, 2007.|$|E

500|$|... b. [...] The seven-page {{treatment}} was titled Insomnia Cafe. The first script was originally titled Friends Like Us, but {{was changed to}} Six of One to avoid confusion with These <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mine.</b> By the time the series was commissioned, the title was just Friends.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} {{helped push}} their romance into [...] "top gear". Kate {{went to the}} police station to see Mark and they ended up kissing in front of his colleagues. McGregor called his first on-screen kiss with Brewer [...] "awkward". Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> have mentioned it, but I think it's because of what they do and where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, so we do seem quite different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!" [...] He added that Mark and Kate's relationship [...] "may not be the easiest of rides." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy {{involving}} young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted {{the group to}} share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become [...] "new, surrogate family members." [...] However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life, and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched Insomnia Cafe, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were. NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed. Kauffman and Crane began writing a pilot script for a show now titled Friends Like Us, which took three days to write. Littlefield wanted the series to represent Generation X and explore {{a new kind of}} tribal bonding, but the trio did not share his vision. Crane argued {{that it was not a}} series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching. NBC liked the pilot script and ordered the series under another title, Six of One, mainly due to the similar title it shared with the ABC sitcom These <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mine.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, she {{commented on}} the denial of crimes in Prijedor: [...] "Current Serb {{authorities}} in Prijedor are constantly trying to erase the part of history between 1992 and 1995 and ensure that it isn't written about or spoken about. That hurts us the most. That part of history belongs to us, the citizens of Prijedor, and we can never forget nor are we allowed to because of the civilians who were killed here." [...] She said that she carries [...] "emotions, emotions and sadness for all those <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> who are no longer here and were killed just because they had different names. It is incomprehensible that in Prijedor, the town where we lived together, {{that that kind of}} crime could occur." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, {{but the bottom line is}} really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you. There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me. Sad for me when <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> died because of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine.</b> Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
