500|$|Today they {{finished}} shooting my {{portion of the}} picture and I am certainly glad it's over with. [...] All I do is sing [...] "Hate to Get Up in the Morning" [...] as I did in the show, but the camera is a severe judge and I am afraid even with the great amount of care and fuss they can't improve what the Fates decreed to be a homely face. [...] As for my voice, I made a recording. [...] When the record was first played on the set, one of the electricians, who didn't know whose voice it was, said, [...] "If the guy who wrote that song could hear the record, he would turn over in his grave"--which gives you a fair idea. [...] However <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> it won't be too bad.|$|E
500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Maryan Nuh Muse, in the 400 metres. Muse had {{previously}} competed {{on behalf of}} Somalia at international youth athletic competitions around the world. Prior to the competition, she spoke {{of the difference in}} the quality of the training facilities in Somalia compared to those in other countries, saying [...] "A number of countries will be participating among them Jamaica and United States; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> to shine. We don’t have the same training facilities, theirs is better than ours. I know they are determined to win but we are also equally determined." [...] She competed in the sixth heat of the 400 metres competition on 13 August; she came in last place with a time of 1:10:14, over 18 seconds behind the heat's winner Salwa Eid Naser of Bahrain.|$|E
500|$|Born in Jamaica to an English mother, Johnson {{played for}} the England Schoolboys team by virtue of going to school in England. He was called up to the England U21 squad in December 1997 for a 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship {{qualification}} play-off game against Greece, but remained an unused substitute. After the game, he said: [...] "My chances with England are virtually gone now..I am ready if Jamaica come in for me. I was hoping for a game on Wednesday – and I still {{might have had a}} chance with England had they qualified for the last eight but that's the way it goes. I have enjoyed the experience of being with England but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> to hear from Jamaica." [...] Johnson played his first senior international football in 1998, making a nine-minute cameo for the England B team under Glenn Hoddle in a 4–1 victory over Russia at Loftus Road.|$|E

50|$|He {{said the}} reputation: Yes, this episode remains Alogidh {{non-existent}} in my career. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> that <b>I</b> would bring actual achievements with the Egyptian national team, {{but there are}} many circumstances prevented that, including poor preparation and poor planning and confusion. Egypt's strongest team of Africa but the conditions did not allow us to qualify and these things that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> that <b>I</b> add to Register.|$|R
2500|$|Rosberg {{was delighted}} {{at his first}} podium finish, and was looking towards {{the rest of the}} year for similar results. [...] "I think we have a solid car to start the season with. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> to have a nice {{development}} through the season and I think we can have a good year.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked how}} she felt Bianca and Maggie (BAM) fans would respond to the Reese and Bianca pairing, Riegel stated, [...] "I'm pretty sure BAM fans will never be entirely {{satisfied}} until they have their two favorite girls together forever. But Lizzie's [...] been so successful on Y , and is so obviously happy there, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> {{they are able to}} embrace this pairing for the time being." ...|$|E
2500|$|The BAP System was {{developed}} by Clint Ballard, a chess aficionado and software-company president, who named it the Ballard Anti-draw Point system (BAP). [...] Ballard explained {{the purpose of the}} BAP System: [...] "The usual flurry of last round draws in almost all tournaments makes chess unmarketable on TV. [...] No excitement, no drama, no TV money for chess. [...] Chess will NEVER succeed in the American TV market until we eliminate the draw as anything other than a very rare outcome. [...] With my anti-draw point system, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> to make 100% of games fighting games with risk and uncertainty, i.e. dramatic potential." ...|$|E

On his casting, Mead said, [...] "I'm {{thrilled to be}} joining Casualty. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> [...] will charm audiences and they will get behind him. I can't wait to get started and to learn all of the medical jargon!" [...] Kent said, [...] "As the character Lofty was being developed, we couldn't think of anyone else to better to play him. We can't wait to start filming and are thrilled to have Lee join the team. With a very different background {{to most of the}} other nurses, his clumsy charm is sure to win everyone over."

2500|$|Norway's Dagbladet {{reported}} that Doncaster Belles favoured a typically English style: [...] "heavy, solid and with many long balls." [...] Although the Belles were a completely amateur outfit, the BBC {{reported that}} they would present {{a much more difficult}} challenge than Fulham had been accustomed to that season. In the 2001–02 National Division Doncaster Belles had finished as runners-up for the third season in succession. In the Premier League Cup they suffered a shock semi final defeat by Birmingham City, collapsing from 31 ahead to lose 43 to the Northern Division leaders. In April 2002 they had [...] "stunningly" [...] inflicted a 40 defeat on Arsenal, the eventual champions' first league defeat in over two and a half years. Manager Julie Chipchase accepted that Fulham were favourites but noted the strength of her own squad: [...] "It's an unusual situation for us to go into a match as the underdogs and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> it will work in our favour. The pressure will be on Fulham but they have some excellent international class players just as we do and it will all be down to who performs on the day." ...|$|E
