50|$|A {{perlocutionary act}} (or perlocutionary effect) is a speech act, as viewed {{at the level}} of its consequences, such as persuading, convincing, scaring, enlightening, inspiring, or {{otherwise}} affecting the listener.

50|$|Speech Act Theory, {{pioneered by}} J.L.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{about the}} application of pragmatic theory. The writer limits her discussion on locutionary and <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> of the utterance which is produced by " Ratrimo ". The functions of" Ratrimo " are to refreshing the mind through its funny picture and criticizes the situation which happens in Indonesia through its utterance. The creator of "Ratrimo", Leak only uses short utterances in his caricature to express his idea. Thus, the understanding of locutionary and <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> is very useful to avoid misinterpretation of the creator's idea and message. In this study, the writer wants {{to find out the}} most frequent type of locutionary and <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> which occur in " Ratrimo ". The writer uses Langacker and Searle theory in analysing her data. Langacker divides locutionary act into three types namely declarative, interogative and imperative while Searle categorizes <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> into five types namely representatives, directives, commisives, expressives and declarations. The writer collects thirty data. In analysing her data, the writer uses descriptive research to describe the types of locutionary and <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> which occur in " Ratrimo. Besides, the writer also uses qualitative research to observe the particular setting or context of the data. The writer puts the result of the analysis in the table in order to make easier in counting the most frequent type of locutionary and <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> which occur in " Ratrimo". After doing her analysis, the writer finds that the most frequent type of locutionary act which occur in " Ratrimo " are declarative type while the most frequent type of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> which occur in "Ratrimo" are directives-requesting.

Besides, classifying the type of expressive illocutionary actin the comic, it is also studied the techniques used by translator in translating expressive <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> from source text to the target text. By using techniques used by translator, it could be seen the quality of translation in the term of accuracy of translation. This is descriptive qualitative research {{in the form of}} embedded research with single-case study design. The data collecting was conducted through content analysis. In this research it can be found that there are 31 expressive <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> in the Big Bad Wolf: The Baddest Day comic and its translation Serigala Jahat: Hari Terburuk. The 61 % of the data are considered as accurate translation, and the 31 % of the data are considered as less accurate translation.

5000|$|Unlike {{the notion}} of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act,</b> which {{describes}} the linguistic function of an utterance, a perlocutionary effect is in some sense external to the performance. It may be thought of, in a sense, as {{the effect of the}} <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> via the locutionary act. Therefore, when examining perlocutionary acts, the effect on the hearer or reader is emphasized.|$|R
5000|$|His last key {{departure}} from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that {{four of his}} universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed. As opposed to Austin who thinks all <b>illocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.” ...|$|E

(2) The uttering of a performative is, or is part of, {{the doing}} {{of a certain}} kind of action (Austin later deals with them under the name <b>illocutionary</b> <b>acts),</b> the {{performance}} of which, again, would not normally be described as just [...] "saying" [...] or [...] "describing" [...] something (cf. Austin 1962, 5).|$|E
50|$|The {{historian}} Quentin Skinner developed {{classical and}} postmodern theories on performative texts into a concrete research method.

40|$|Starting {{with the}} curiosity {{of the writer}} when find out that one {{function}} of indirect forms is for being polite, the writer decides to make a further investigation related to <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> and politeness strategy. This study deals with the relationship between <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> and politeness strategy. In this study, the writer uses the theory of Searle (1962) for <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act,</b> and the theory of Brown and Levinson (1978) for politeness strategy. The source of the data is the utterances which produced by the four dominant characters in "Never Been Kissed" movie, which is taken from scene 25 to 35 (excluded scene 33). The four dominant characters are Josie Geller, Rob, Gus, and Sam Coulson. The main instrument {{of this study is}} the writer herself and the data collection were done by the writer herself based on the script of the movie, which was taken from the internet. In conducting this research, the writer uses the combination of qualitative and descriptive approach. In analyzing the data, the writer presents the data into three tables. Table 1 deals with the type of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> and politeness strategy, Table 2 deals with the relationship of each type of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> and politeness strategy, and Table 3 deals with the relationship between the type of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> and politeness strategy. The writer found out that the five types of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> and the four types of politeness strategy occurs in "Never Been Kissed" movie. Besides, the writer also notices that there were some relations between <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> and politeness strategy in "Never Been Kissed" movie. But the relationships between them are not much found. It happens because the source of the data (i. e. scene 25 to 35, excluded scene 33) is the climax of the story and the conflict between characters is arising. Since the conflict is arising, in some cases, in expressing their idea the characters don't use politeness strategy. They prefer to say something directly and it threatened the face of the hearer. Therefore, the writer found out that many of the utterances that produced by the characters did not become any part of politeness strategy...|$|R

The data were utterances in the form of words, phrases, and sentences spoken by the main characters in the movie. After being collected, the data were organized and analyzed based on Searle and Leech’s theory of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act.</b> To gain the trustworthiness of the data in this study, triangulation was applied. This study reveals some findings. First, there are four types of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> performed by the main characters in the movie. They are representative act, directive act, expressive act, and commissive act. Representative act is found as the most dominant type performed by the main characters. The main characters employ representative act to convey their ideas to each other. On the other hand, declarative act is not performed by the main characters in the movie since performing felicitous declarative act needs particular authorities and circumstances. Second, there are three functions of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> performed by the main characters in this movie. They are collaborative function, competitive function, and convivial function.

5000|$|Many {{define the}} term [...] "illocutionary act" [...] with {{reference}} to examples, saying for example that any speech act (like stating, asking, commanding, promising, and so on) is an <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act.</b> This approach has generally failed to give any useful hints about what traits and elements make up an illocutionary act; that is, what defines such an act. It is also often emphasised that Austin introduced the <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> {{by means of a}} contrast with other kinds of acts or aspects of acting: the <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act,</b> he says, is an act performed in saying something, as contrasted with a locutionary act, the act of saying something, and also contrasted with a perlocutionary act, an act performed by saying something.

5000|$|If we {{adopt the}} notion of illocutionary force as an aspect of meaning, then {{it appears that the}} (intended) 'force' of certain sentences, or utterances, is not quite obvious. If someone says, [...] "It sure is cold in here", there are several {{different}} <b>illocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> that might be aimed at by the utterance. The utterer might intend to describe the room, in which case the illocutionary force would be that of 'describing'. But she might also intend to criticise someone who should have kept the room warm. Or it might be meant as a request to someone to close the window. These forces may be interrelated: it may be by way of stating that the temperature is too cold that one criticises someone else. Such a performance of an illocutionary act by means of the performance of another is referred to as an indirect speech act.|$|E
5000|$|Derrida {{highlights}} Austin's {{theory of}} <b>illocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> in the [...] "Parasites..." [...] section because {{he finds it}} in contradiction {{to the definition of}} communication he has formulated in [...] "Writing & Telecommunication". There he considers all communication in terms traditionally reserved for writing. Derrida lists three traits of writing. First, it subsists without the subject who inscribed it. Second, the meaning of the text is never constrained by its context. [...] "The sign", Derrida explains, [...] "possesses the characteristic of being readable even if the moment of its production is irrevocably lost and even if I do not know what its alleged author-scriptor intended to say at the moment he wrote it". Third, this possibility of rupture from its origin is provided by a text's elements (e.g. words) being separated by spacing. Derrida says that these traits [...] "are valid not only for all orders of 'signs' and for languages in general but moreover, beyond semio-linguistic communication, for the entire field of what philosophy would call experience".|$|E
5000|$|The {{notion of}} an <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> is closely {{connected}} with Austin's doctrine of the so-called 'performative' and 'constative utterances': an utterance is [...] "performative" [...] if, and {{only if it is}} issued {{in the course of the}} [...] "doing of an action" [...] (1975, 5), by which, again, Austin means the performance of an <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> (Austin 1975, 6 n2, 133). According to Austin's original exposition in How to Do Things With Words, an <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> is an act (1) for the performance of which I must make it clear to some other person that the act is performed (Austin speaks of the 'securing of uptake'), and (2) the performance of which involves the production of what Austin calls 'conventional consequences' as, e.g., rights, commitments, or obligations (Austin 1975, 116f., 121, 139). Thus, for example, in order to make a promise I must make clear to my audience that the act I am performing is the making of a promise, and in the performance of the act I will be undertaking an obligation to do the promised thing: so promising is an <b>illocutionary</b> <b>act</b> in the present sense. Since Austin's death, the term has been defined differently by various authors.|$|R

5000|$|According to a later account, which Searle {{presents}} in Intentionality (1983) {{and which}} differs {{in important ways}} from the one suggested in Speech Acts, <b>illocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> are characterised by their having [...] "conditions of satisfaction" [...] (an idea adopted from Strawson's 1971 paper [...] "Meaning and Truth") and a [...] "direction of fit" [...] (an idea adopted from Elizabeth Anscombe).

50|$|One type of {{explanation}} {{at the level}} of assertion exploits the view that assertion implies or expresses belief in some way so that if someone asserts that p they imply or express the belief that p. Several versions of this view exploit elements of speech act theory, which can be distinguished according to the particular explanation given of the link between assertion and belief. Whatever version of this view is preferred, whether cast in terms of the Gricean intentions (see Paul Grice) or in terms of the structure of Searlean <b>illocutionary</b> <b>acts</b> (see speech act), it does not obviously apply to explaining the absurdity of the commissive version of Moores paradox. To take one version of this type {{of explanation}}, if someone asserts p and conjoins it with the assertion (or denial) that he does not believe that p, then he has in that very act contradicted himself, for in effect what the speaker says is: I believe that p and I do not believe that p. The absurdity of asserting p & I do not believe that p is thus revealed as being of a more familiar kind. Depending on ones view of the nature of contradiction, one might thus interpret a speaker of the omissive Moorean sentence as asserting everything (that is, asserting too much) or asserting nothing (that is, not asserting enough).|$|E
5000|$|Searle {{used this}} notion of [...] "direction of fit" [...] to create a {{taxonomy}} of <b>illocutionary</b> <b>acts.</b> Although Elizabeth Anscombe never employed the term [...] "the direction of fit", Searle has strongly argued that the following passage from her work Intention was, by far, [...] "the best illustration" [...] {{of the distinction between}} the tasks of [...] "getting the words (more strictly their propositional content) to match the world… that of getting the world to match the words": §32. Let us consider a man going round a town with a shopping list in his hand. Now {{it is clear that the}} relation of this list to the things he actually buys is one and the same whether his wife gave him the list or it is his own list; and that there is a different relation where a list is made by a detective following him about. If he made the list itself, it was an expression of intention; if his wife gave it him, it has the role of an order. What then is the identical relation to what happens, in the order and the intention, which is not shared by the record? It is precisely this: if the list and the things that the man actually buys do not agree, and if this and this alone constitutes a mistake, then the mistake is not in the list but in the man's performance (if his wife were to say: “Look, it says butter and you have bought margarine”, he would hardly reply: “What a mistake! we must put that right” and alter the word on the list to “margarine”); whereas if the detective's record and what the man actually buys do not agree, then the mistake is in the record.|$|E
