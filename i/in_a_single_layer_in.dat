40|$|The {{collective}} {{properties of}} different quasiparticles in various graphene based structures in high magnetic field have been studied. We predict Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and superfluidity of 2 D spatially indirect magnetoexcitons in two-layer graphene. The superfluid density {{and the temperature}} of the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition are shown to be increasing functions of the excitonic density but decreasing functions of magnetic field and the interlayer separation. The instability of the ground state of the interacting 2 D indirect magnetoexcitons in a slab of superlattice with alternating electron and hole graphene layers (GLs) is established. The stable system of indirect 2 D magnetobiexcitons, consisting of pair of indirect excitons with opposite dipole moments, is considered in graphene superlattice. The superfluid density and {{the temperature of the}} Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition for magnetobiexcitons in graphene superlattice are obtained. Besides, the BEC of excitonic polaritons in GL embedded in a semiconductor microcavity in high magnetic field is predicted. While superfluid phase in this magnetoexciton polariton system is absent due to vanishing of magnetoexciton-magnetoexciton interaction <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> the limit of high magnetic field, the critical temperature of BEC formation is calculated. The essential property of magnetoexcitonic systems based on graphene (in contrast, e. g., to a quantum well) is stronger influence of magnetic field and weaker influence of disorder. Observation of the BEC and superfluidity of 2 D quasiparticles in graphene in high magnetic field would be interesting confirmation of the phenomena we have described.

40|$|The {{objective}} of tissue engineering is to regenerate functional tissues. Engineering functional tissues {{requires an understanding}} of the mechanisms that guide the formation and evolution of structure in the extracellular matrix (ECM). In particular, the three-dimensional (3 D) collagen fiber arrangement is important as it is the key structural determinant that provides mechanical integrity and biological function. In this review, we survey the current knowledge on collagen organization mechanisms that can be applied to create well-structured functional lamellar tissues and in particular intervertebral disc and cornea. Thus far, the mechanisms behind the formation of cross-aligned collagen fibers in the lamellar structures is not fully understood. We start with cell-induced collagen alignment and strain-stabilization behavior mechanisms which can explain a single anisotropically aligned collagen fiber layer. These mechanisms may explain why there is anisotropy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> the first place. However, they cannot explain why a consecutive collagen layer is laid down with an alternating alignment. Therefore, we explored another mechanism, called liquid crystal phasing. While dense concentrations of collagen show such behavior, {{there is little evidence that}} the conditions for liquid crystal phasing are actually met in vivo. Instead, lysyl aldehyde-derived collagen cross-links have been found essential for correct lamellar matrix deposition. Furthermore, we suggest that supra-cellular (tissue-level) shear stress may be instrumental in the alignment of collagen fibers. Understanding the potential mechanisms behind the lamellar collagen structure in connective tissues will lead to further improvement of the regeneration strategies of functional complex lamellar tissue...|$|E

40|$|Organisms {{can develop}} {{normally}} and thrive in dynamic environments. The interplay between {{the environment and}} the biomechanics of morphogenesis can help us understand how development operates in a changing world. Effects of salinity on blastula expansion in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus were used to investigate interactions among the environment, development, and mechanics. Salinity fluctuations, which are common in Dendraster's habitat, affect embryonic cell size. The hyaline layer, an extracellular matrix layer closely associated with the outside of the blastula, is hypothesized to resist blastula expansion. Four models describing how the hyaline layer responds to blastula expansion were compared. In three models the hyaline resists expansion as either an elastic, plastic, or viscous layer. In these models, salinity-driven changes in cell size were predicted to cause changes in the ratio of blastocoel volume to cell volume. In a fourth model, the hyaline is a perfectly accommodating layer that allows the embryo to expand freely as cells divide <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer.</b> <b>In</b> this model, salinity changes were predicted not to affect the blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratio. To test these hypotheses, Dendraster embryos were placed in either 25 ‰ or 32 ‰ seawater wells and switched to wells of either the same or the other salinity. In a second experiment, Dendraster embryos were raised in 32 ‰ seawater until the 16 -cell stage, at which point a subset of embryos were moved to 25 ‰ seawater for one cleavage stage and then moved back to 32 ‰ {{for the duration of the}} experiment. In both experiments blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratios were not affected by the salinity treatment. These results suggest that the hyaline layer does not resist blastula expansion in Dendraster, thereby maintaining a constant blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratio, despite salinity variation...|$|E
40|$|The δ 18 O and δ 13 C {{values of}} brachiopod shell calcite are {{commonly}} used as proxies for ancient environmental marine conditions and secular changes in ancient ocean chemistry. The variability of δ 18 O and δ 13 C across modern shelf settings is, however, not well documented. This study presents δ 18 O and δ 13 C data from 407 Holocene (< 5000 yr BP) and living brachiopods collected from 220 sites across ∼ 3000 km along Australia’s southern shelf, the largest cool-water carbonate shelf in the modern world. Significant isotopic variability is present in separate specimens, at individual sites, and across the entire region. Individual specimens analyzed at multiple shell positions have an isotopic range of values up to 1. 3 ‰ and 1. 9 ‰ for δ 18 O and δ 13 C respectively. Multiple brachiopods at a single site have values that vary as much as 2. 1 ‰ for δ 18 O and 1. 8 ‰ for δ 13 C. Regional variability ranges {{on the order of}} 3. 6 ‰ and 3. 4 ‰, for δ 18 O and δ 13 C respectively. The distribution of intrasite variability can be divided into areas of high and low variability. Areas characterized by low variability occur in zones of relatively consistent shelf water conditions. High-variability zones usually correspond to areas of seasonal upwelling onto the shelf, and this aspect is interpreted to be the main cause of isotopic variability. Upwelling waters are cold, leading to higher δ 18 O values, and are commonly rich in respired dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nutrients, promoting active phytoplankton growth and leading to variable δ 13 C values. The extensive spatial coverage across this vast latitude-parallel region provides a valuable baseline illustrating the isotopic range that could occur <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> the rock record. Furthermore, changes in isotopic signatures measured across stratigraphy might not necessarily reflect secular changes in ocean chemistry but, instead, could be recording local changes in shelf circulation and upwelling intensity.

40|$|Isolated male epispadias defect {{is present}} in 10 % of cases of epispadias-exstrophy complex. Many {{surgical}} technique have been described for repair of male epispadias. The aim of surgical repair is to get cosmetically acceptable and functional penis with a ventrally located urethra opening {{at the tip of}} the glans and moreover to give the patient a urinary continence. Surgical repair of epispadias malformation remains debatable as evident by the different techniques adopted. We present two cases of our experience where we used the complete penile disassembly tecnique by Mitchell-Caione in wich we acts on the voluntary control of urination by the reapproximation of the muscular plane of pelvic diaphragm and elevator muscle around the posterior urethra reconstructed. Epispadias repairs was performed on two incontinent male epispadias patient, aged 2 to 3 years. Both cases were untreated. Complete disassembly of penil components was performed to the corporal attachments down to the horizontal branches of pubic bones. The corporal bodies and the glans were split on the sagittal plane according to Grady-Mitchell. The central portion of the urethral plate was preserved intact. An electric stimulator was used to identify and reapproximate at the midline the muscular fibers that constitute the periurethral muscular complex, as a part of the anterior perineal membrane. “Z plasties” were necessary according to initial urethral length and width: the urethra was reconstructed over a double catheters, using 5 / 0 polyglicolic acid interrupted sutures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer.</b> <b>In</b> one patient we sutured symphisis pubis opened precedently, using 1 / 0 polyglicolic acid. The urethra was placed ventrally in the reconstructed shaft under the two corpora as Mitchell technique. Glanduloplasty was then performed. Patients were followed up for one month (June 2012). The penis of the two patients had a satisfactory cosmetic appearance with no dorsal chordee. Morover, our patients obtained urinary continence. The limitation of our study was the low follow-up. The electric stimulator used to identify pelvic muscle components in the sagittal plane for reapproximate the posterior tabularized urethra to form the periurethral muscle complex and the “Z-plasties” that elongated the urethra significantly. This procedure seems to be satisfactory for the repair of cases of isolated male epispadias because we have good results in cosmetic appearance and in urinary continence.

40|$|A {{study of}} petrological and geochemical {{variations}} through the upper Critical Zone of the Bushveld Complex at Amandelbult section of R. P,M. was undertaken. The sequence at this locality may {{be divided into}} seven "units" two of which appear to be complete, possessing the sequence harzburgite-pyroxenite-norite-anorthosite. The other five Units lack basal, intermediate or upper members. Considerable lateral variations are apparent in this sequence, but these are restricted to the Lower Pseudo Reef-Merensky Reef interval, tne same portion of the succession which is affected by pothole structures. The single most important petrographic feature of genetic significance is the occurrence of annealed, recrystallized anorthosite immediately underlying ulstramafic layers. This, together with the undulatory nature of the contact between the two rock layers, suggests that the ultramafic layer was emplaced as a hot liquid over a pre-existing, crystalline anorthosite floor, and that some remelting of this layer occurred. Variations in the chemical make-up of constituent silicate minerals reveal {{a number of significant}} processes which may have been operative in the magma chamber prior to crystallization, Olivine grains, for instance, exhibit extremely wide chemical variations both within single layers and from one layer to the next. These variations are best explained by re-equilibration processes with spinel and base metal sulphides, rather than by wide variations in original liquidus compositions. It appears that the compositions of the initial liquids from which each basal olivine-bearing layer crystallized, were approximately similar. Variations in the iron-magnesium ratio of ortho-pyroxenes indicate well defined continuous fractionation trends in units which are considered to be complete. Magnesian compositions are recorded in ultramfic members, while increasingly iron-enriched values are recorded upwards through the sequence pyroxenite-norite-antorthosite. Plagioclase grains exhibit less well defined fractionation trends, {{but it is clear that}} an upward increase in An is encountered through indivitual Units. This is in direct contrast to the trend exhibited by orthopyroxene. A further feature of plagioclase grains is the considerable degree of chemical zonation exhibited by them. In cumulus grains this is commonly manifested as strongly reversed rims, while in intercululus grains normal zoning is ubiquitous. Whole-rock chemical variations through the succession indicate that cyclical variations occur through successive Units, but that these merely reflect changes in modal mineralogy and not liquid fractionation trends. Such trends can be shown for selected element ratios, where these elements are known to partition into a single mineral phase. Rations of pyroxene components such as the nickel/scandium ratio, exhibit a saw tooth pattern through successive Units, while ratios of plagioclase components such as the strontium/alumina ratio have unique, fairly constant values for each individual Unit but different values for successive Units. The latter type of cyclicity is not always strictly confined to lithologically recognized boundaries between Units, and a slight overlap into overlying ultramafic layers is apparent. An investigation of variations in trace element levels <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>in</b> five widely separated boreholes revealed that there is some evidence for a lateral fractionation trend from the southwest (more primitive) to the northeast (more evolved), although the small number of data points available preclude definite conclusions. There exists in the data some evidence that the Giant Mottled Anorthosite differs chemically from the other anorthosites in the study section, and that it more closely resembles rocks of the Main Zone. This evidence is particularly apparent in variations of the chromium/aluminium ratio of orthoyroxene grains, and in the An content of plagioclase grains, both of whose trends exhibit distinct inflections at the base of this member. The features of the succession at Amandelbult are best explained by the model of Eales et al. (in press, a), which visualizes the input of a number of pulses of new, hot liquid into a magma chamber containing the fractionated residua of previous influxes. At a critical point in time, just prior to the mafic Merensky Reef input, a large input of gabboic liquid was intruded at high levels in the chamber. The lower portions of this liquid mixed with the residua of earlier mafic inputs, which in turn mixed with new inputs of mafic, typical Critical Zone liquids. Thus the lower portions of the study section represent mixtures of new Critical Zone liquids with the residua of previous such influxes, while the upper portions have the added complication of mixture with a Main Zone-type liquid. The unique chemical character of the Giant Mottled Anorthosite appears to be a direct manifestation of the influence of the Main Zone liquid. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|E
