Nor let the {{thoughts}} of the badness of thy cause terrify thee overmuch. Cause thou hast indeed to be humble, and thou dost well to cover thy face with shame; {{and it is no}} matter how base and vile thou art in thine own eyes, provided that it comes not by renewed acts of rebellion, but through a spiritual sight of thine imperfections. Only let me advise thee here to stop. Let not thy shame nor thy self-abasing apprehension of thyself, drive thee from the firm and permanent ground of hope, which is the promise, and the doctrine of an Advocate with the Father. No; let not the apprehension of the badness of thy cause do it, forasmuch as he did never yet take cause in hand that was good, perfectly good of itself; and his excellency is, to make a man stand that has a bad cause; yea, he can make a bad cause good, in a way of justice and righteousness.|$|E

You should {{like to know what}} I was doing the first of May. Let me see--I cannot recollect. I have all the Examiners ready to send--they will be a great treat to you when they reach you. I shall pack them up when my business with Abbey has come to a <b>good</b> <b>conclusion,</b> and the remittance is on the road to you. I have dealt round your best wishes like a pack of cards, but being always given to cheat myself, I have turned up ace. You see I am making game of you. I see you are not all happy in that America. England, however, would not be over happy for you if you were here. Perhaps 'twould be better to be teased here than there. I must preach patience to you both. No step hasty or injurious to you must be taken. You say let one large sheet be all to me. You will find more than that in different parts of this packet for you. Certainly, I have been caught in rains. A catch in the rain occasioned my last sore throat; but as for red-haired girls, upon my word, I do not recollect ever having seen one. Are you quizzing me or Miss Waldegrave when you talk of promenading? As for pun-making, I wish it was as good a trade as pin-making. There is very little business of that sort going on now. We struck for wages, like the Manchester weavers, but to no purpose. So we are all out of employ. I am more lucky than some, you see, by having an opportunity of exporting a few--getting into a little foreign trade, which is a comfortable thing. I wish one could get change for a pun in silver currency. I would give three and a half any night to get into Drury pit, but they won't ring at all. No more will notes you will say; but notes are different things, though they make together a pun-note as the term goes. If I were your son, I shouldn't mind you, though you rapt me with the scissors. But, Lord! I should be out of favour when the little un be comm'd. You have made an uncle of me, you have, and I don't {{know what to make of}} myself. I suppose next there will be a nevey. You say in my last, write directly. I have not received your letter above ten days. The thought of your little girl puts me in mind of a thing I heard a Mr. Lamb say.

A belief-dependent process uses prior beliefs to produce new beliefs; a belief-independent process does not, using other stimuli instead.

50|$|Lerner and Tetlock {{say that}} when people expect to need to justify their {{position}} to external parties, and they already know those parties' views, they will tend to adopt a similar position to theirs, and then engage in confirmatory thought {{with the goal of}} bolstering their own credibility rather than reaching a <b>good</b> <b>conclusion.</b> However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification. Lerner and Tetlock say that people only push themselves to think critically and logically when they know in advance they will need to explain themselves to external parties who are well-informed, genuinely interested in the truth, and whose views they don't already know. Because those conditions rarely exist, they argue, most people are engaging in confirmatory thought most of the time.|$|E

5000|$|The sect had {{particularly}} {{developed and}} grown in northern Africa. There was growing unrest and threats of riots in Carthage {{connected to the}} bishop controversy. Constantine, hoping to defuse the unrest, gifted monies to the non-Donatist Bishop Caecilian as payment for church buildings that had been damaged or confiscated during the prior period of persecution. No gifts {{were made to the}} Donatists (it appeared that Constantine was not fully aware of the seriousness of the dispute, thus his gifts only made matters worse). The Donatists appealed to Rome for equal treatment; Constantine tasked Miltiades to sort the issue which led to the 313 commission mentioned above. The Donatists refused to abide by the decision of the Roman Council and demanded a local council to hear the dispute. This attempt failed to produce a good hearing and the Donatists appealed directly to the Emperor. In a surviving letter, Constantine shows frustration that the church cannot come to a <b>good</b> <b>conclusion</b> and he calls for a larger council, what is now known as the Council of Arles in 314. Again, the decision went against the Donatists and again they appealed to Constantine. The Emperor demanded that all parties be brought to Rome for a hearing; Constantine ruled in favor of Caecilian and warned against unrest. A delegation from Rome traveled to Carthage to seek a compromise, which failed. Donatist extremists were stirring up protests and violence in the streets. The Donatists refused to accept any compromise or decision in favor of the Catholic bishop.After the Constantinian shift, when other Christians accepted the emperor as a leader in the Church, the Donatists continued to see the emperor as the devil. After several attempts to bring reconciliation, in 317 Constantine issued a severe edict that threatened the death penalty to anyone who disturbed the peace of the empire. Another edict followed that called for the confiscation of all Donatist church property. In Carthage, Donatus refused to surrender buildings and the local Roman governor called for a [...] "police" [...] action, sending troops in to deal with the Donatists. The historical records are unclear, but it appears that some Donatists were killed and clergy were sent into exile.|$|E

Because of the long pedicle with good mobility and the frequent intraabdominal position of the neonatal ovarian cyst, we attempted to manage it via the transumbilical route. Methods All patients were treated under intubation general anesthesia. Semicircular infraumbilical incision was made, and the abdomen was entered through a transverse fascial incision. The partially collapsed cyst after aspiration was exteriorized through the incision for cystectomy, partial deroofing, or adnexectomy.

The {{aim of this}} study is to assess the intratest, interobserver, and intraobserver reproducibility of nasal mucociliary transport rate (NMTR) measurement. Materials and Methods. Twenty-two subjects were evaluated to determine intratest reproducibility and a group of 35 subjects was examined to determine inter- and intraobserver reproducibility. Rhinoscintigraphy with 99 mTc-MAA was used to measure NMTR in all study subjects. Paired NMTR measurements were compared using a range of statistical methodologies. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and repeatability coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were applied to assess the degree of intratest, interobserver, and intraobserver variation. Results. Statistical analysis of test and retest experiments demonstrated the statistical equivalence of intratest NMTR measurements, interobserver NMTR measurements, and intraobserver NMTR measurements. The intratest ICC, interobserver ICC, and intraobserver ICC were 0. 96, 0. 83, and 0. 91, respectively, indicating that intratest and intraobserver reproducibility are excellent and interobserver reproducibility is <b>good.</b> <b>Conclusions.</b> Rhinoscintigraphy using 99 mTc-MAA results in highly reproducible {{measurement of}} NMTR.
