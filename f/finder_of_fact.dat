The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> determines did occur.|$|E

The jury determines the truth or falsity of factual allegations and renders a verdict on whether a criminal defendant is guilty, or a civil defendant is civilly liable. [...] Sometimes a jury makes specific findings of fact in what is called a [...] "special verdict." [...] A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt, or civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages, if awarded, is called a [...] "general verdict." ...|$|E

50|$|All of {{the above}} applies only to trial courts. Appellate courts in the United States are not <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> so they do not use juries or receive {{evidence}} into the record; that is the trial court's job.

40|$|We apply {{concepts}} {{from the}} small, but growing {{literature on the}} economics of experts to forensic science.

We suggest changes in the organization of forensic science that will improve error prevention, detection, and correction. In particular, a right of forensic expertise for the defense would bring the adversarial process of criminal courts closer to an 'equality of arms' and increase the probability that the biases in the system will be neutralized, errors minimized, and truth discovered. It is our contention that by including competing forensic experts among a series of needed changes, we are wresting decision making from the forensic experts and returning it to the <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> the judge or jury. ...|$|R

50|$|Forensic psychiatrists {{are often}} {{called to be}} expert {{witnesses}} in both criminal and civil proceedings. Expert witnesses give their opinion about a specific issue. Often the psychiatrist will have prepared a detailed report before testifying. The primary duty of the expert witness is to provide an independent opinion to the court. An expert is allowed to testify in court with respect to matters of opinion only when the matters in question are not ordinarily understandable to the <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> be they judge or jury. As such, prominent leaders {{in the field of}} forensic psychiatry, from Thomas Gutheil to Robert Simon and Liza Gold and others have identified teaching as a critical dimension in the role of expert witness. The expert will be asked to form an opinion and to testify about that opinion, but in so doing will explain the basis for that opinion which will include important concepts, approaches, and methods used in psychiatry.|$|R
40|$|According to the psychologists, <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> erroneously [...] -though unknowingly [...] -place {{too much}} weight on {{eyewitness}} testimony.

The psychologists' arguments for admitting eyewitness experts and the courts' explanations for excluding this testimony are fraught with difficulties. However, alternative remedies [...] -those currently existing as well as potential remedies [...] -similarly fail to resolve the problem. This thesis constitutes the first of a two-part work.

40|$|In {{this essay}} {{reviewing}} Brian Leiter’s recent book Naturalizing Jurisprudence, I focus on two positions that distinguish Leiter’s {{reading of the}} American legal realists from those offered in the past. The first is his claim that the realists thought the law is only locally indeterminate – primarily in cases that are appealed. The second is his claim {{that they did not}} offer a prediction theory of law, but were instead committed to a standard positivist theory. Leiter’s reading is vulnerable, because he fails to discuss in detail those passages from the realists that inspired past interpretations. My goal is to see how Leiter’s reading fares when these passages are considered. I argue that Leiter is right that the realists’ indeterminacy thesis has only a local scope. Those passages that appear to claim that the law is globally indeterminate actually address three other topics: judicial supremacy, judges’ roles as <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> and the moral obligation to adjudicate as the law commands. With respect to the prediction theory, however, I conclude that Leiter’s position cannot be defended. Indeed the realists offered two ‘prediction’ theories of law. According to the first, which is best described as a decision theory, the law concerning an event is whatever concrete judgment a court will issue when the event is litigated. According to the second, the law is reduced, not to concrete judgments, but to regularities of judicial (and other official) behavior in a jurisdiction. I end this essay with the suggestion that the realists’ advocacy of the second prediction theory indirectly vindicates Leiter’s reading of the realists as prescient jurisprudential naturalists...|$|R

5000|$|A trier of fact, or <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> is a person, {{or group}} of persons, who {{determine}}s facts in a legal proceeding, usually a trial. To determine a fact is to decide, from the evidence, whether something existed or some event occurred.

40|$|Legislation in New South Wales {{enables the}} Supreme Court to impose {{easements}} against {{the wishes of}} a landowner where this {{is found to be}} reasonably necessary for the effective use and development of neighbouring land. What is reasonably necessary is determined through a cost-benefit analysis based on the respective preferences of the putative dominant and servient owners. This article explores two ways in which the concepts of subjectivity (judgments based on the actual views of a particular subject) and objectivity (judgments based on an assessment of external objects) are represented in this calculus. Firstly, the article examines whether the preferences of the putative dominant and servient owners are assessed on a subjective or objective basis: does the court respect what people do want or what they should want? Secondly, to what extent does the court cede authority over the cost-benefit analysis to councils (as the relevant subject with planning powers), rather than retaining the role (as the <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> objective <b>fact)</b> for itself...|$|R
40|$|Factfinders {{in civil}} cases must often make a {{constellation}} of decisions, such as assigning responsibility and blame, making compensation and (sometimes) giving out punishment. These decisions are likely to evoke numerous social and moral concerns and, therefore, inevitably implicate a variety of instrumental and symbolic goals. We argue that descriptions of legal decision making that fail to consider the psychological interplay among these different goals are likely to come up short {{in their efforts to}} explicate the ways in which jurors and other factfinders make decisions in civil cases. Instead, we suggest that decision making in civil cases can profitably {{be thought of as a}} process by which decision makers attempt to maximally satisfy a wide variety of goals in parallel. In contrast to many traditional legal and economic portrayals of legal decision making which posit that decision makers can pursue single motives as instructed, Part I argues that jurors and other <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> deciding civil cases ought to be thought of as pursuing many different goals simultaneously. This Part briefly describes many of the goals that may underlie decision making in civil cases and introduces a set of basic goal management principles that define how these goals interrelate. Part 11 describes social psychological research that suggests that legal decision makers may be motivated to pursue a variety of goals in addition to the traditional goals of determining fault, compensating plaintiffs, and deterring defendants. Different motives for distributing resources, value expressive goals and a need to restore the proper relative moral balance between the parties may all play a role in civil decision making. In Part 111, we propose that decision makers may attempt to simultaneously satisfy these multiple goals through a process of parallel constraint satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a lot}} of talk {{these days}} about the role of a judge, {{especially}} among trial court judges. Frequently the discussion is framed in terms of whether the judiciary should be expected to behave in one of two polar-opposite ways. Should they be primarily almost aloof <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> impartial and nearly devoid of intimate contact with and knowledge of litigants and their circumstances? Or should they be one of many possible partners to a diagnostic, therapeutic oriented response process to ameliorate underlying and messy problems of litigants? These choices confront judges with the creation and development of drug courts, domestic abuse courts, gun courts, mental health courts, community courts, and other courts revolving around social maladies. These are not negligible choices with few consequences. The contention of this article is that changes in judicial roles have profound implications, even though the advocates of particular role changes might see them as improvements {{in the manner in which}} judges make decisions and carry out their responsibilities. To support this argument, the article tries to sort out some of the implications of what has happened to the judicial role in past several years. Certainly there are few judges who would claim that judging today is just like it was 30 years ago, or like they think it was 30 years ago. For this reason, I think that there is a need for a deliberative and purposive discussion on the judicial role—past, present, and future. The intended contribution of this article is to encourage that dialogue by synthesizing scholarly observations on the importance of the judicial role, to suggest what have been implications of past role changes, and to recommend what should be on the future agenda of action and research...|$|R
5000|$|With bench trials, {{the judge}} {{plays the role}} of the jury as <b>finder</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in {{addition}} to making conclusions of law. In some bench trials, both sides have already stipulated to all the facts in the case (such as civil disobedience cases designed to test the constitutionality of a law).

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined {{individual and}} group decision mak-ing when decision criteria led to outcomes that violated distribu-tive justice. In Experiment 1, noncompliant individual jurors in a civil trial biased their determinations of negligence to award damages when the decision criteria prohibited an award. Experi-ment 2 replicated this effect at the group level and revealed that juries also biased their attributions of negligence to justify reduc-ing damages when the decision criteria required an excessive award. In both cases of noncompliance, juries recruited a biased subset of information during deliberations that sustained their decisions. Finally, noncompliant juries were marked by {{the advent of a}} “trigger ” person who raised justice concerns. Impli-cations for other decision-making groups and for the courts are discussed. For two centuries in the United States, juries of ordi-nary people have been considered bulwarks standing between potentially oppressive governmental agencies and private citizens. The framers of the U. S. Constitu-tion considered the jury in criminal trials to be among the basic safeguards against liberty-threatening incur-sions by a central government (Rakove, 1996). However, the power of the criminal jury to protect the prosecuted from the prosecutor, often despite overwhelming evi-dence of guilt, {{flies in the face of}} the judiciary’s view of a circumscribed role for the jury as <b>finders</b> <b>of</b> the <b>facts</b> and nothing more. Although the fact-finder role of the jury is the judicially preferred model of jury functioning, juries may nevertheless act as a purveyor of commonsense jus-tice, the application of a rough and ready sense of what is just and what is not (Finkel, 1995). Jurors may not only disobey the law in criminal trials (Horowitz, 1985, 1988) but they may consider issues of fairness when determining negligence in a tort (civil...|$|R
