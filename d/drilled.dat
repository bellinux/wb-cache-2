40|$|Bone <b>drilling</b> is an {{important}} and the most frequent operation in orthopaedics and other bone surgical procedures. Prediction and control of <b>drilling</b> force and torque are critical to safe and efficient surgeries. This paper studies the <b>drilling</b> force and torque arising from bone <b>drilling</b> process. <b>Drilling</b> parameters such as <b>drilling</b> speed, feed rate, <b>drill</b> size and <b>drill</b> condition (sharp and worn) were changed to measure the force and torque {{in the direction of}} the <b>drill</b> penetration. Experimental results demonstrated lower <b>drilling</b> force using a sharp <b>drill</b> compared to a worn <b>drill</b> for similar <b>drilling</b> conditions. Contrary to the <b>drilling</b> force, lower torque was measured using a worn <b>drill</b> compared to a sharp <b>drill.</b> The <b>drilling</b> force was found to decrease with increase in <b>drill</b> speed and increased with rise in the feed rate using both types of <b>drills.</b> A linear drop in <b>drilling</b> torque was measured with increase in <b>drilling</b> speed. This study provided scientific information to orthopaedic surgeons and technicians to use appropriate surgical <b>drill</b> and cutting parameters to avoid overstressing of the bone tissue and <b>drill</b> breakage during <b>drilling</b> operations...|$|R

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and <b>drilled</b> before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they <b>drilled</b> holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo test a {{modified}} otologic <b>drill</b> under different <b>drilling</b> conditions {{for its ability}} to identify <b>drilling</b> faults and stop <b>drilling.</b> MethodsBased on force analysis and previous works, anotologic <b>drill</b> was modified and equipped with three sensors. Under various conditions, the <b>drill</b> was used to simulate three <b>drilling</b> faults and normal <b>drilling,</b> and signals from the <b>drill</b> were analyzed to extract the characteristic signal. A multi–sensor information fusion system and a stop program were designed to recognize <b>drilling</b> faults and stop <b>drilling.</b> ResultsSignals from each sensor changed consistently in response to <b>drilling</b> condition changes, with high repeatability and regularity. The average identification rate was 72. 625 %, 68. 575 %, 70. 5 % and 81. 3 % respectively for the three simulated <b>drilling</b> faults and normal <b>drilling.</b> The stop program stopped <b>drilling</b> in 0. 2 ~ 0. 3 seconds when a <b>drilling</b> faults was detected. ConclusionsThis study shows that the forces acting on the <b>drill</b> bit change predictably in the three simulated <b>drilling</b> conditions; that using suitable BP neural networks, the <b>drilling</b> faults can be reliably identified, and that a stop program based upon characteristic signal recognition can stop <b>drilling</b> quickly upon detecting <b>drilling</b> faults. This lays a foundation for development of a system capable of predicting <b>drilling</b> faults and automatic <b>drill</b> control.

50|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of core <b>drill</b> or annular cutter {{is that it}} can not <b>drill</b> blind holes. A core <b>drill</b> due to its hollow geometry can only make through holes.

The cost of a core <b>drill</b> is high compared to twist <b>drill,</b> but the cost per hole made with core <b>drill</b> is less as compared to twist <b>drills,</b> this is because a single core <b>drill</b> makes 5 to 10 times more holes than a twist <b>drill.</b>|$|R
