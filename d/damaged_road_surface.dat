25|$|During World War II, {{the median}} strips of some autobahns were paved over {{to allow their}} {{conversion}} into auxiliary airstrips.

Motor vehicles, such as trucks, could not carry goods or troops as quickly or in as much bulk and in the same numbers as trains could, and the autobahns could not be used by tanks as their weight and caterpillar tracks <b>damaged</b> the <b>road</b> <b>surface.</b> The general shortage of petrol in Germany during much of the war, as well as the low number of trucks and motor vehicles needed for direct support of military operations, further decreased the autobahn's significance.

After the war, numerous sections of the autobahns were in bad shape, severely damaged by heavy Allied bombing and military demolition. Furthermore, thousands of kilometres of autobahns remained unfinished, their construction brought to a halt by 1943 due to the increasing demands of the war effort.|$|R
5000|$|Regular {{intercity}} bus {{services by}} steam-powered buses were pioneered in England in the 1830s by Walter Hancock and by associates of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney among others, running reliable services over road conditions which were too hazardous for horse-drawn transportation.

Indeed, the wide tires of the steam carriages (designed for better traction) caused virtually no damage to the streets, whereas the narrow wheels of the horse-drawn carriages (designed to reduce the effort required of horses) tended to cause rutting.|$|R

Generation of low-frequency ground vibrations by heavy lorries is considered theoretically for both vehicles accelerating (decelerating) with a constant accelerotion and vehicles travelling at constant speed on damaged or bumpy. surfaces. In the case of damaged or bumpy surfaces, excitation of axle-hop reson(tnces is taken into account, whereas an accelerating or braking vehicle is modelled as a point horizontal tractionforce applied to the ground and moving along with the vehicle.

30|$|In our study, we {{determined}} the ecological effects of established fire trails on plant assemblages in edge habitats adjacent to fire trails in woodlands in Blue Mountains National Park (BMNP). This region in southeastern Australia {{is one of}} the most fire-prone regions in the world (Hammill and Tasker 2010). With its large number of endemic species and high biodiversity value, it has been named a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Area (Hammill and Tasker 2010). As a fire-prone area of World Heritage significance, the BMNP provides insights into the ecological impacts of fire management activities that are potentially valuable in the management of fire-prone systems across the world. A key difference between our study and previous research on roads and other transport corridors is the low amount of vehicle traffic that fire trails receive, with fire trails often permanently closed to the public and used only during active fire fighting or hazard-reduction activities. This not only lowers vehicular <b>damage</b> to <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> and adjacent vegetation, but considerably reduces the impacts of vehicles as a vector of weed dispersal. Furthermore, during hazard-reduction burning, fires are initially set in vegetation alongside fire trails before being directed into the vegetation interior. Thus, the relative intensity of fire experienced in fire-trail edge habitats may be lower than that experienced in the interior of vegetation.|$|R
