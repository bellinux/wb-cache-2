The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for.</b> Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|Once Edward's {{force had}} {{gathered}} sufficient strength, {{he dropped the}} ruse and headed south towards London. Fighting off Exeter's and Oxford's attacks, he besieged Warwick at Coventry, hoping to engage the earl in battle. Although Warwick's force had more men than Edward's army, the earl refused the challenge. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the arrival of Clarence, who wanted to use their combined strength to overwhelm the Yorkists. When he learned of this, Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence {{to return to the}} House of York, an offer that Clarence readily accepted. Reconciled, the royal brothers moved towards Coventry, and Clarence urged Warwick's surrender. Infuriated with his son-in-law's treachery, Warwick refused to speak to Clarence. Unable to fight the earl at this time, Edward turned again towards London.|$|E

25|$|Kelly {{asserted}} {{that he was}} not present, and that Fitzpatrick's wounds were self-inflicted. Kenneally, who interviewed the remaining Kelly brother, Jim Kelly, and Kelly cousin and gang providore Tom Lloyd, in addition to closely examining the 1881 report by the Royal Commission on the Police Force of Victoria, wrote that Fitzpatrick was drunk {{when he arrived at the}} Kellys, that while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Dan, he made a pass at Kate, and Dan threw him to the floor. In the ensuing struggle, Fitzgerald drew his revolver, Ned appeared, and with his brother seized the constable, disarming him, but not before he struck his wrist against the projecting part of the door lock, an injury he claimed to be a gunshot wound. Upon what Kelly claimed was Fitzpatrick's false evidence, his mother, Skillian and Williamson were convicted. A reward of £100 was offered for Kelly's arrest. Kelly claimed that this injustice exasperated him, and led to his taking to the bush. Just before Kelly was taken away from Benalla after the Glenrowan shootout, Senior-Constable Kelly reported he interviewed Kelly in his cell and that he admitted to shooting Fitzpatrick.|$|E

25|$|The person {{detained}} as {{an alleged}} militant {{turned out to}} be Akhmed Chataev (Chatayev), a one-handed ethnic Chechen refugee and Russian citizen who has received refugee status in Austria and who had lived in Pankisi for more than two years. On September 6, Information Center of Kakheti announced that Chatayev, described as Umarov’s personal representative in Europe (according to other sources, Chatayev was rather a former special envoy of the late Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov), who had briefly disappeared after the special operation in Lopota Gorge. Chatayev insisted that he had been brought by two Georgian Interior Ministry's counter-terrorist department officials, Sandro Amiridze and Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, as a negotiator to talk with a group of 17 Chechen and Kist militants that intended to travel to Chechnya via Dagestan. According to Chatayev, he was unarmed and was wounded when an unknown shooter suddenly shot him in his left leg as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a reply from the authorities after relaying by phone the group's refusal to disarm. After that, he hid and barely survived for 10 days without any food nor water before surrendering to the Border Police, but his wound got seriously infected and a part of his foot was later amputated in the Gori Military Hospital, where he spent the next 10 days.|$|E

500|$|... "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode David X. Cohen wrote for The Simpsons.

The idea for [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] came to {{him while he was}} working on another script for the show. Cohen could not concentrate on his task because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> lunch, and {{on the back of the}} script he scribbled, [...] "Lisa becomes a vegetarian?". Cohen showed the note to writer Brent Forrester, who liked the idea. Show runner David Mirkin then approved the story when Cohen pitched it to him. Mirkin had just become a vegetarian himself, and later noted that many of Lisa's experiences in the episode were based on his own.|$|E
500|$|From November 2008 to January 2009, Morrissey {{returned}} to the theatre {{for the first time}} in nine years to appear in the Almeida Theatre's British premiere of Neil LaBute's In a Dark Dark House. He played Terry, one of two brothers who had been abused as a child, opposite Steven Mackintosh and Kira Sternbach. He took the role because he liked LaBute's previous play, The Mercy Seat (2002). After accepting the part, he researched the character by reading case studies of adults who were abused when they were children. He learned about how they coped with the shame of their abuse, and incorporated those feelings into his acting. He was also able to consult LaBute during rehearsals but avoided asking him exactly how to play Terry. In a Daily Telegraph review that criticised the play, Charles Spencer wrote that Morrissey's was the best performance [...] "as the blue-collar older brother who reveals extraordinary depths of grief, damage and forgiveness that finally light up this dark, flawed play." [...] Benedict Nightingale of The Times initially believed that Morrissey's acting was [...] "a bit stiff, almost as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his cues rather than reacting instantaneously to their content" [...] but found him more impressive as the play went on.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{was an avid}} and {{accomplished}} golfer; there was always time to try getting {{in a game of}} golf. [...] "Perry Como Putters" [...] were sold by MacGregor, each stamped with a Como facsimile autograph. His colleagues held an annual Perry Como Golf Tournament to honor him and his love for the game. Como's guests on the October 3, 1962, broadcast were Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player. The four golfers played 18 holes for the cameras at Sands Point, New York, where the Comos made their home in the television years. Como also enjoyed fishing and he could be found out on his boat almost daily after the family moved to Florida. Perry's catches would usually {{turn out to be the}} Como family's dinners. Como also used his boat as a rehearsal hall with pre-recorded instrumental tapes sent to him by RCA Victor. Perry would work on material while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the fish to bite. Having enjoyed golfing and fishing in the North Carolina mountains for several years, Como built a vacation home in Saluda, North Carolina, in 1980. He discouraged photos of his home, as it was his private place to get away from the celebrity life.|$|E

500|$|While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> {{his paper}} to be published, O'Neill {{organized}} a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton {{to discuss the}} possibility of colonizing outer space. The conference, titled First Conference on Space Colonization, was funded by Stewart Brand's Point Foundation and Princeton University. Among those who attended were Eric Drexler (at the time a freshman at MIT), scientist-astronaut Joe Allen (from Astronaut Group 6), Freeman Dyson, and science reporter Walter Sullivan. Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on the planned Space Shuttle. O'Neill thought of the attendees as [...] "a band of daring radicals". Sullivan's article on the conference was published {{on the front page}} of The New York Times on May 13, 1974. As media coverage grew, O'Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space. To stay in touch with them, O'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress. A few months later he heard Peter Glaser speak about solar power satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. O'Neill realized that, by building these satellites, his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction. According to O'Neill, [...] "the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth".|$|E
500|$|After co-starring on 2004's {{fourth season}} of The Shield on cable network FX, Close told network {{president}} John Landgraf {{that she would}} be open to star in another series, suggesting a spin-off for her Shield character, Captain Monica Rawling. Landgraf pitched Damages to Close, who agreed to play Patty so long as the series was shot in New York City, where she resides. To prepare for her role, Close met New York attorney Mary Jo White and her partner Lorna Scoffield, as well as litigator Patricia Hines, from whom Close learned [...] "some extraordinary things". The producers sought after Byrne to play Ellen, but she was unavailable during the first round of auditions as she was filming 28 Weeks Later. She says the opportunity [...] "came up again, so I went in, auditioned, and got the role". Like Close, Byrne spent time with a female lawyer in New York and read books written by litigators Alan Dershowitz and David DuBois, while Donovan talked to his uncle, a New York corporate lawyer. He visited Manhattan's Centre Street courts, where he [...] "followed the most intense murder trial". Ivanek was so eager to work on the series that he auditioned for two different roles, and was cast as Ray. Todd Kessler said that Danson's 1979 film The Onion Field was [...] "a huge influence on Glenn, Daniel and myself, and that was something that had always stuck in our minds. And when we sought out to cast this role of Arthur Frobisher, Ted kind of came into focus." [...] In preparation for his role, the producers asked Danson to meet with CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations and watch documentaries such as , which examines the collapse of Enron. They also suggested that Danson meet with Close's acting coach Harold Guskin. The producers said that David and Katie were the hardest characters to cast. Noah Bean, who felt that he gave [...] "an awful first audition" [...] for the role of David, was called in for a second reading as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> an elevator to leave the building, and was ultimately cast. British actress Anastasia Griffith's agent informed her of the audition for the role of Katie only two hours before it began. When she met the producers, they were initially concerned about a Brit playing an American, especially since Australian Byrne had already signed on. [...] "To put their fears at rest", Griffith addressed the producers in an American accent from beginning to end of the audition. After being cast, Griffith and Byrne visited New York University dialect coach Deborah Hecht to perfect their accents.|$|E
