5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E
5|$|Mario's {{abilities}} in Super Mario 64 {{are far more}} diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and {{three times in a}} row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E

5|$|William Easton, an {{insurance}} executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed {{to heart disease}} after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, {{where he and his}} janitor, Hank, awaken in vises designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> for long and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and a shotgun aimed at seats of a carousel. It is shown that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
25|$|When using a Leica for indoor shots, Vishniac {{sometimes}} {{brought a}} kerosene lamp (visible {{in some of}} his work) if there was insufficient light, keeping his back to a wall for support, and holding <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The Rolleiflex was used mostly for outdoor scenes.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, Houdini {{introduced}} the Chinese Water Torture Cell, {{in which he}} was suspended upside-down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet full to overflowing with water, holding <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> for more than three minutes. He would go on performing this escape {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|Pohebits-quasho ("Iron Jacket") was a Comanche {{chieftain}} {{and medicine}} man whom the Comanche believed {{had the power}} to blow bullets aside with <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> His name probably resulted from his habit of wearing a Spanish coat of mail into battle, which protected him from most light weapons fire.|$|E
25|$|Aslan {{goes to the}} Witch's palace and, with <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{brings the}} statues of her petrified enemies back to life. He leads them all to aid Peter, Edmund, and the Narnian army, who are {{fighting}} the Witch's army. At {{the conclusion of the}} battle, Aslan leaps upon the Witch and kills her.|$|E

25|$|In late 2006, Elefante {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to consider something he had never done in his career: catch <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Even with his reduced schedule, he needed a break. The brothers closed the label, and Elefante could finally take some {{time away from the}} industry. This proved more challenging than expected, and despite his best intentions, he served as producer on three albums in 2007.|$|E
25|$|One {{afternoon}} Ondine {{was walking}} near some stables {{when she heard}} the familiar snoring of her husband. When she entered the stable, she saw Sir Lawrence lying in the arms of another woman. Kicking her husband awake, she cursed him such that he would have breath so long as he remained awake, but if he ever fell asleep <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> would be taken from him and he would die.|$|E
25|$|Wayne {{begins with}} three health points {{which can be}} {{replenished}} using first aid kits. The number of health points can increase by a single point if the player can find health power-ups. Sprinting, melee combat, and hanging from objects deplete the player's stamina meter, which causes the screen to blur, and Wayne to pause so as to get <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> back. As with the health meter, the amount of available stamina can be increased by power ups. Unlike health, however, the stamina meter refills over time.|$|E

25|$|Swami Rama, a yogi {{skilled in}} {{controlling}} his heart functions, was {{studied at the}} Menninger Foundation {{in the spring and}} fall of 1970 and was alleged by some observers at the foundation to have telekinetically moved a knitting needle twice from a distance of five feet. Although Swami Rama wore a face-mask and gown to prevent allegations that he moved the needle with <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> or body movements, and air vents in the room had been covered, at least one physician observer who was present at the time was not convinced and expressed the opinion that air movement was somehow the cause.|$|E
25|$|Vishniac {{is notable}} for his {{photographs}} of insects mating, sea bass feasting and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures {{for hours in}} the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie {{for over an hour}} in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an extension tube. He had even trained himself to hold <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{is married}} to Nancy and {{is part of the}} human couple {{at the center of the}} play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E

25|$|Ed Harris did not {{actually}} breathe the fluid. He held <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) {{below the surface of}} the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up. Actors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.|$|E
25|$|On August 20, 1057, Isaac Komnenos {{drew out}} his forces and {{arranged}} them for battle at a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Haidos. Kekaumenos commanded the left wing, Romanos Skleros the right, and Komnenos positioned {{himself in the}} centre. On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing their troops to the rebel camp, he proceeded to capture Romanos Skleros {{and was on the}} cusp of victory when he hesitated, unsure of his next move. Komnenos, on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea, was able to catch <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and review what was happening on his left.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 2014, Phil Everly died at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, 16 {{days before}} his 75th birthday, of lung disease. Phil's widow Patti openly blamed her husband's death on his smoking habit, which caused him to develop chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, and recounted Phil spending his final years having to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went and taking 20 different types of medications per day. She stated that although Phil had stopped smoking in 2001, his lungs had already sustained permanent damage. Phil's last public appearance was in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of Fame, and he was then struggling to catch <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he addressed the crowd. Patti established the Phil Everly Memorial COPD Foundation in 2014.|$|E
