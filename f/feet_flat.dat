50|$|Relative to the skeletally mature foot structure, it is {{expected}} that an infant and young child should display a <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> posture with a lower medial longitudinal arch and everted heel position. Consistently across many studies, paediatric <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> posture has been found to reduce with age. Normative data has been compiled from multiple studies using the Foot Posture Index (FPI-6) to show that children’s <b>feet</b> become less <b>flat</b> with increasing age, that adult’s <b>feet</b> are least <b>flat,</b> and that older people’s feet become flatter. The normal findings of <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> versus children’s age estimate 45% of pre-school children, and 15% of older children (average age 10 years) have <b>flat</b> <b>feet.</b> Few flexible <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> {{have been found to be}} symptomatic, hence only painful <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> should be diagnosed and treated.

2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> on the floor or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E

[Subjects and Methods] Qualisys Track Manager Software ver. 2. 8 (Qualisys, Sweden) was used to perform measurements on 14 female university students in their 20 s. To measure movements, the subjects were asked to walk while wearing high-heeled shoes and reflective stick-ers on their hip joints, knee joints, and ankle joints, the changes in joint angles were measured at heel strike, <b>foot</b> <b>flat,</b> and toe off. [Results] Analysis of the amount of change according to heel height changes during gait showed that the angle of the hip joints was reduced with an increase in heel-height. Although the changes were not significant, the angle of the knee joints was reduced during heel strike, <b>foot</b> <b>flat,</b> and midstance, and it was increased during toe off. In contrast, the angle of the ankle joints was increased by a significant amount during heel strike, <b>foot</b> <b>flat,</b> midstance, and toe off. [Conclusions] During gait with high heels, the movements of the lower extremities of women in their 20 s were reduced significantly with an increase in heel height. Therefore, it is concluded that the restrictions on gait can only be reduced by wearing low-heeled shoes...|$|R

5000|$|The Hubscher {{maneuver}} (or Jack's test) is {{a method}} of evaluating the flexibility of a pes planus or <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> type. The test is performed with the patient weight bearing, with the <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> on the ground, while the clinician dorsiflexes the hallux and watches for an increasing convexity the Arches of the foot. A positive result (arch formation) results from the flatfoot being flexible. A negative result (lack of arch formation) results from the flatfoot being rigid. In a Jack's test, the patient raises the rearfoot off the ground, thus passively dorsiflexing the hallux in Closed Kinetic Chain. This will result in an increase of the arch height in cases of Dynamic (Flexible) <b>Flat</b> <b>Foot.</b> If the deformity is a Static (rigid) <b>Flat</b> <b>foot,</b> {{the height of the}} arch will be unaffected by raising up the heel on the forefoot.|$|R

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>feet</b> {{can also}} develop {{as an adult}} ("adult {{acquired}} flatfoot") due to injury, illness, unusual or prolonged stress to the foot, faulty biomechanics, {{or as part of}} the normal aging process. This is most common in women over 40 years of age. Known risk factors include obesity, hypertension and diabetes. <b>Flat</b> <b>feet</b> can also occur in pregnant women as a result of temporary changes, due to increased elastin (elasticity) during pregnancy. However, if developed by adulthood, <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> generally remain <b>flat</b> permanently. If a youth or adult appears flatfooted while standing in a full weight bearing position, but an arch appears when the person plantarflexes, or pulls the toes back {{with the rest of the}} <b>foot</b> <b>flat</b> on the floor, this condition is called flexible flatfoot. This is not a true collapsed arch, as the medial longitudinal arch is still present and the windlass mechanism still operates; this presentation is actually due to excessive pronation of the foot (rolling inwards), although the term 'flat foot' is still applicable as it is a somewhat generic term. Muscular training of the feet is helpful and will often result in increased arch height regardless of age.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Flat</b> <b>foot</b> in {{children}} {{during the first}} years of life evokes significant parental concern. <b>Flat</b> <b>foot,</b> intoeing and femoral anteversion may well be differential dimensions of developmental pathodynamics with potential for inter-related developmental correction. While correlation of femoral anteversion with intoeing is documented, its relationship with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> remains unclear. Objective: The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> and internal rotation of hip, indirectly femoral anteversion. Methods: 651 Children, 339 boys and 312 girls, aged 3 - 6 years, were examined and Contact Index II for <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> as well as internal rotation of hip measured. 82 children with other foot and leg deformities were excluded from further analysis. Results: Out of 569 children, 95 (16. 7 %) had <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> - 56 bilateral, 39 unilateral - with Contact Index II of 0. 88 or above. All children with <b>flat</b> <b>feet</b> (and none of the normal 474) had raised internal rotation of hip (mean 69. 9 °, range 62 - 80 °). Conclusion: Regression analysis established an unequivocal and highly significant statistical relationship between <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> and increased internal rotation of hip (F = 168. 1, p < 0. 001, r = 0. 53) {{in children}} between 3 and 6 years. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background In {{patients}} with Down syndrome (DS) {{one of the}} most common abnormalities is <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> which can interfere significantly with normal daily activities, such as gait. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the relationship between the <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> and the gait alterations in DS children. Method Twenty-nine {{patients with}} DS and 15 non-affected subjects were assessed using 3 D Gait Analysis, using an optoelectronic system, force platforms and video recording. The degree of <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> was assessed using the arch index and kinematic and kinetic parameters were identified and calculated from 3 D Gait Analysis for each study participant. Results Data showed that ankle plantarflexion moment and ankle power during terminal stance were significant to differentiate the patients with and without flat feet: their peak values were significantly lower for the patients with <b>flat</b> <b>foot.</b> In addition, the research for correlation demonstrated that the higher the arch index value, the lower the peak of ankle moment and of the generated ankle power during terminal stance and the minimum of absorbed ankle power. Conclusions Children with <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> displayed a less functional gait pattern in terms of ankle kinetics than children without <b>flat</b> <b>foot,</b> suggesting that the presence of <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> may lead to a weaker efficient walking. Then, the increasing <b>flat</b> <b>foot</b> tended to result in lower push-off ability, leading a less functional walking...|$|R
