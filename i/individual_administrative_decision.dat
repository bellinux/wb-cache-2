40|$|The {{regulation}} of the legal nature of an appeal proceeding or a judgment crowning the proceeding is ambiguous and unclear. The National Appeals Chamber which issues a judgment decides upon the validity of a contract, the obligations of the contracting authority, ﬁnancial penalties, and, indirectly, the actions taken by contractors. The inﬂuence of such decisions is of theoretical and practical signiﬁcance and justiﬁes an analysis presented in the paper. Thus the constitutive features of judgments handed down by a public administration body have been analysed and compared with typical forms of law enforcement (judicial decisions of the common courts, decisions issued by arbitration courts and <b>individual</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions).</b> The latter have been given particular attention. The deliberations {{were based on the}} position of the doctrine of the law on public procurements, provisions of civil law and administrative law, as well as judicial decisions and judgments issued by the National Appeals Chamber. These were then analysed in the light of normative regulations of the Act on Public Procurements. The analysis revealed a multitude of problems resulting from the adoption by the legislature of atypical forms of action by the National Board of Appeal. The analysis provides the basis for further research aimed to create a coherent system regulating public procurements to ensure its proper functioning and to reduce the possibility of further interpretative problems. 2141471676 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R
40|$|Hensikten med denne undersøkelsen var å belyse et lite studert område, nemlig: Stemmer enkeltvedtak overens med hjelpen hjemmeboende personer med demens får, og om tap av ferdigheter påvirker vedtakene og hjelpen som gis. Materiale: I alt 460 hjemmeboende personer med demens fra 24 kommuner i alle landets fem helseregioner ble inkludert i undersøkelsen. Alle fikk hjelp fra hjemmebaserte tjenester og hadde en demenssykdom diagnostisert av lege og/eller hjemmesykepleien antok at det forelå demens på grunnlag av en Klinisk Demensvurdering I alt 489 pasienter ble rekruttert, 249 med demensdiagnose og 240 uten. Blant de 240 med antatt demens hadde 211 en KDV skåre 1 eller høyere. Disse ble inkludert, mens de 29 med lavere skåre ble ekskludert. Metode: Pasienten ble vurdert med Klinisk Demensvurdering og et skjema som måler funksjoner i dagliglivet, Rapid Disability Rating Scale- 2. Enkeltvedtak for pasientene ble samlet inn og kategorisert ved hjelp av kvalitativ innholdsanalyse slik at kategoriene stemte overens med hjelpetiltakene som ble tilbudt. Hjelp til pasientene ble registret i en sju dagers periode. Resultater: Vi fant liten sammenheng mellom vedtakene og utført hjelp, og liten sammenheng mellom behov for hjelp og utført hjelp. Åttiseks prosent av vedtakene ble fulgt opp av hjemmetjenesten, men svært mange får hjelp uten vedtak. Undersøkelsen viser at mange som har behov for hjelp, ikke får hjelp. Undersøkelsen viser at det ikke er lovverket som svikter, men håndhevelsen av gjeldende lover og forskrifter. he {{purpose of}} this study was to look more closely at a {{previously}} neglected area namely: Do <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions</b> for provisions of care correspond to the actual care given to persons with dementia living at home, and does the loss of skills effect the decision and care provided?The method used was collection of data, which was than categorised by a qualitative analysis of content. Although <b>individual</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions</b> are governed by law, and most local authorities have passed guidelines on how these decisions should be formulated, and how the care should be provided, our study showed a large variation in the quality of provisions and professional practice. Four hundred and sixty persons with dementia, from all health regions, were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were patients with known dementia, diagnosed by a doctor and/or assumed to be demented by the community nurse. In total, 489 patients were recruited, 249 with a confirmed diagnosis of dementia, and 240 without. Of these 240 patients, with assumed dementia, 211 had a KDV score of one or greater. These were included, whilst the 29 with lower scores were excluded from the study. Data for the study was thus collected from 460 patients. The results show little relationship between the <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions</b> for care, the need for care, and actual care provided. Eighty-six percent of <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions</b> were followed up by the home services, but many receive help without formal decisions. The study also found many in need of help who did not receive it. Routines for arriving at and formalising <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions</b> were incomplete. The study shows a failure of implementation of existing laws, regulations and patient rights, rather than a failure of the laws and regulations themselves ISBN 91 - 7997 - 148 - 2 </p...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the issue of <b>administrative</b> <b>decision,</b> which {{represents}} one of the principal forms of the realization of public administration in the Czech Republic. Even if the Czech legislation provides for its issuance a number of requirements in relation to its content and form, in practice, however, there are violations of these legal conditions and requirements and then we talk about a defective <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> According to how to remedy the defective administrative acts, distinction is made between formally defective <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions,</b> factually inaccurate decisions, unlawful decisions, and next to them, separately null <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions.</b> The main attention is paid to the nullity, because only the nullity represents the most serious and also irremovable defect of an <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> As the null decision does not exist from the perspective of law, it is not able to affect the rights and duties of its recipients.

40|$|The problem {{statement}} {{addressed in this}} study is as follows: to what extent does EU law compel a Dutch stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement to be revoked if they are not compliant with that law? The {{problem statement}} presumes that Dutch law has a system in place with respect to the revocation of a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement. In this study it is made clear {{that there is no such}} system. As a rule, revoking a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement leads to contentment as well as resistance. To overcome the resistance and thereby to create consensus as to contentment, there must be systematic rules governing the revocation. Based on dogmatics, a system can be created, avoiding a situation in which there are only intuitive judgments which, because they lack structure, cannot lead to the certainty and predictability of the law. In that regard this study provids points to consider in the General Administrative Law Act about the revocation of a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> In view of the principle of national procedural autonomy, the starting point is that, in the absence of EU rules on this subject, EU law does not compel a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement to be revoked if they are not compliant with that law. There are circumstances, however, in which EU law recognises such an obligation. An EU law duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is more powerful in force than the EU duty to revoke a national stable judgement. The European Court of Justice seems to have recognised that from the characterization of administration versus justice it follows that the administrative body’s freedom to revoke its stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is greater than the court’s freedom to revoke its stable judgement. The the EU duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> unfavourably is more powerful in force than the EU duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> favourably. An explanation for this difference can be found in the fact that the EU law duty to recover – which can mean under Dutch law that a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is revoked unfavourably – is not so much about the interests of an individual (as is the case with the EU law duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> favourably), but rather about the general interests of the European Union itself, such as (in the case of EU (agricultural) aid) the justified allocation of financial resources and (in the case of state aid) the prevention of a distortion of competition...|$|R
