40|$|A {{beamforming}} system (ASY) comprises a modular transducer assembly (MTA) {{composed of}} a plurality of transducer modules (TM 1, TM 2, TM 3). A transducer module comprises a plurality of interfaces having different geometrical orientations. An interface allows the transducer module to be physically coupled to another transducer module. In a reconnaissance phase, the beamforming system identifies transducer modules that {{are present in the}} modular transducer assembly (MTA). The beamforming system further identifies a structure in accordance with which the transducer modules have been physically coupled to each other.

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{discusses}} several {{investigations of the}} peripheral neural code for the directional axis of acoustical particle motion in the saccule of two fishes: goldfish (Carassius auratus) and toadfish (Opsanus tau). Most saccular afferents are directional {{in the manner of}} hair cells, having a cosine-shaped <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> <b>pattern.</b> The saccular sensory epithelia are orientated almost vertically in a parasagittal plane. In the horizontal plane, these epithelia are orientated obliquely with respect to the midline. Hair-cell stereocilia project perpendicularly. Thus, directional response patterns of saccular afferents tend to be orientated in azimuth parallel to the orientation of the epithelia in the head. The oblique angle of the toadfish saccule is greater than that of the goldfish, and the range of best directions in the horizontal plane for each species reflects those differing orientations. The azimuth of acoustical particle motion could be computed by comparing the relative activation of the two saccules, as is the case for the ears of most terrestrial vertebrates. The spatial patterns of saccular hair-cell orientation of most fishes thus appear to have little function in azimuthal source location, but for toadfish are probably most important for determining the elevation of monopole sources...|$|E

Previous physiological and neuroanatomical {{studies have indicated that}} binaural convergence is present in the ascending auditory system of the toadfish. In this study, we introduce a new technique, otolith tipping, to reversibly alter directional auditory input to the central nervous system of a fish. The normal <b>directional</b> <b>response</b> <b>pattern</b> (DRP) was recorded extracellularly for auditory cells in the first-order descending octaval nucleus (DON) or the midbrain torus semicircularis (TS) using particle motion stimuli in the horizontal and mid-sagittal planes. The same stimuli were used during tipping of the saccular otolith to evaluate changes in the DRPs. Post-tipping DRPs were generated and compared with the pre-tipping DRPs to ensure that the data had been collected consistently from the same unit. In the DON, ipsilateral or contralateral tipping most often eliminated spike activity, but changes in spike rate (±) and DRP shape were also documented. In the TS, tipping most often caused a change in spike rate (±) and altered the shape or best axis of the DRP. The data indicate that there are complex interactions of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the DON and TS resulting from the convergence of binaural inputs. As in anurans, but unlike other terrestrial vertebrates, binaural processing associated with encoding the direction of a sound source begins in the first-order auditory nucleus of this teleost...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} directionally {{selective}} (DS) retinal ganglion cells to respond selectively to stimulus motion {{in one direction}} is a classic unresolved example of computation in a local neural circuit. Recent evidence indicates that DS responses occur first in the retina in the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells (interneurons presynaptic to the ganglion cells). We report that the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of starburst-cell dendrites and DS ganglion cells are highly sensitive to the polarity of the transmembrane chloride gradient. Reducing the transmembrane chloride gradient by ion substitution or by blocking the K–Cl cotransporter resulted in the starburst cells responding equally to light moving in opposite directions. Conversely, increasing the chloride gradient by blocking the Na–K–Cl cotransporter eliminated responses to light moving in either direction. Moreover, in each case, blocking the chloride cotransporters or reducing the transmembrane chloride gradient eliminated the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of DS ganglion cells in a manner opposite that of the starburst cells. These results indicate that chloride cotransporters {{play a key role}} in the generation of direction selectivity and that the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of starburst cells and DS ganglion cells are exquisitely sensitive to the chloride equilibrium potential. The findings further suggest that the <b>directional</b> <b>responses</b> of DS ganglion cells are mediated in part by the directional release of γ-aminobutyric acid from starburst dendrites and that the asymmetric distribution of the two cotransporters along starburst-cell dendrites mediates direction selectivity. A model of direction selectivity in the retina that incorporates these and other findings is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{directivity}} index is a parameter that {{is commonly used}} to characterize the performance of directional hearing aids, and is determined from the measured <b>directional</b> <b>response.</b> Since this response is different for a hearing aid worn on a person as compared to when {{it is in a}} free field, {{directivity index}} measurements of hearing aids are usually done under simulated real-ear conditions. Details are provided regarding the NIST system for measuring the hearing aid directivity index under these conditions and how this system is used to implement a standardized procedure for performing such measurements. This procedure involves a sampling method that utilizes sound source locations distributed in a semi-aligned zone array on an imaginary spherical surface surrounding a standardized acoustical test manikin. The capabilities of the system were demonstrated over the frequency range of one-third-octave bands with center frequencies from 200 Hz to 8000 Hz through NIST participation in an interlaboratory comparison. This comparison was conducted between eight different laboratories of members of Working Group S 3 /WG 48, Hearing Aids, established by Accredited Standards Committee S 3, Bioacoustics, which is administered by the Acoustical Society of America and accredited by the American National Standards Institute. Directivity measurements were made for a total of six programmed memories in two different hearing aids and for the unaided manikin with the manikin right pinna accompanying the aids.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism involved in rendering the variety in the cellular response. To investigate the variety of the cellular responses against exogenous stimuli at the gene expression level, we attempted to describe the cellular responses with comprehensive gene expression profiles, dissect them into multiple <b>response</b> <b>patterns,</b> and characterize the <b>response</b> <b>patterns</b> according to the information accumulated so far on the genes included in the patterns. We comparatively analyzed in parallel the gene expression profiles obtained with DNA microarrays from normal human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) stimulated with multiple cytokines, interleukin- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-β, interferon-γ, and oncostatin M, which are profoundly involved in various functional responses of endothelial cells. These analyses revealed that the cellular responses of HCAECs against these cytokines included at least 15 <b>response</b> <b>patterns</b> specific to a single cytokine or common to multiple cytokines. Moreover, we statistically extracted genes contained within the individual <b>response</b> <b>patterns</b> and characterized the <b>response</b> <b>patterns</b> with the genes referring to the previously accumulated findings including the biological process defined by the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO). Out of the 15 <b>response</b> <b>patterns</b> in which at least one gene was successfully extracted through the statistical approach, 11 <b>response</b> <b>patterns</b> were differentially characterized by representing the number of genes contained in individual criteria of the biological process in the GO only.

To examine this possibility, this experiment determined the effects of morphine on the <b>response</b> <b>patterning</b> of 4 pigeons during a fixed-interval 1 -min schedule of food delivery with interpolated temporal discrimination trials. Twenty of the 50 total intervals were interrupted by choice trials. Pecks to one key color produced food if the interval was interrupted after a short time (after 2 or 4. 64 s). Pecks to another key color produced food if the interval was interrupted after a long time (after 24. 99 or 58 s).
