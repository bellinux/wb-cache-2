50|$|For many years, the {{functionality}} of the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> {{remained an}} unsolved mystery.

50|$|Due to {{the general}} inaccessibility of the pouches in horses, they can be an area of {{infection}} by fungi and bacteria, and these infections can be extremely severe and hard to treat. The condition <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> tympany affects several breeds, including the Arabian horse. The condition predisposes young horses to infection, often including severe swelling and often requires surgery to correct. The <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> is also the site of infection in equine strangles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> empyema is {{characterized}} by the accretion of purulent, bacteria infested exudate in the pouch. The bacteria is primarily Streptococcus equi, the infectious agent of strangles. Clinically apparent symptoms include painful swelling of the parotid area and recurrent infected nasal discharge, and in severe circumstances, difficulty breathing and abnormal head carriage may be observable. Fever, anorexia, difficulty swallowing and soft palate displacement {{may or may not be}} seen. Empyema is often secondary to <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> tympany (distention of the pouches with air) in foals and weanlings. Arabians, in particular, are inclined to <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> tympany, as many have a congenital defect in the pharyngeal orifices of the pouches. The infection can also be due to the rupture of the nearby retropharyngeal lymph nodes, usually caused by an abscess.|$|E

40|$|Histochemical {{characterization}} of the equine <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> was performed using lectins combined with sialidase digestion and deglycosylation pre-treatments. The goblet cells contained O- and N-linked oligosaccharides with -Fuc, GlcNAc moieties whereas -GalNAc, -Gal-(1 – 3) -GalNAc, -Gal-(1 – 4) -GlcNAc and -Gal residues belonged only to O-linked glycoproteins. The acinar and ductal cells expressed -Man/-Glc in N-linked oligosaccharides, GlcNAc in both O- and N-glycoproteins and -GalNAc, -Gal-(1 – 3) -GalNAc, -Gal-(1 – 4) -GlcNAc and -Gal residues included in O-linked glycoproteins. The Golgi area of the epithelial lining expressed -Fuc in O-linked glycoproteins, internal GlcNAc in N-linked glycoproteins and large amounts of sialic acid residues linked to subterminal -GalNAc, Gal 1, 4 GlcNAc and Gal 1, 3 GalNAc. High amounts of sulpho-carbohydrates and of sialic acids (2, 3 – 6), linked to-/-Gal and sialic acids (2 – 6) linked to -GalNAc, were also demonstrated. Such diversity of the mucin saccharide residues may be implicated in the binding of macromolecules {{such as those of}} bacterial or viral etiology, thus playing a role in the organism’s host-defense mechanism in the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> mycosis (GPM) is a {{fungal disease}} that is rare but {{potentially}} life-threatening. GPM is of unknown pathogenesis currently and no predisposing {{factors have been}} identified. Fungal plaque is usually located in the medial <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch,</b> near the internal carotid artery. Clinical signs include unilateral or bilateral epistaxis due to erosion of the artery walls, nasal discharge and cranial nerve dysfunction. GPM is a dangerous condition as spontaneous fatal hemorrhaging can occur, usually {{within a few days}} to weeks after the first bout of epistaxis,. The most common fungus associated with GPM is Aspergillosis.|$|E
50|$|Possible {{complications}} {{include the}} horse becoming a chronic carrier of the disease, asphyxia due to {{enlarged lymph nodes}} compressing the larynx or windpipe, bastard strangles (spreading {{to other areas of}} the body), pneumonia, <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> filled with pus, abscesses, purpura haemorrhagica, and heart disease. The average length for the course of this disease is 23 days.|$|E
5000|$|The {{guttural}} pouches {{connect the}} middle ear to the pharynx. The opening into the pharynx is called the nasopharyngeal ostium, which is composed of the pharyngeal wall laterally and a fibrocartilaginous fold medially. This opening leads to a short soft tissue passageway into the respective <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch.</b> The openings are located rostrally to enable drainage of mucous when the head is lowered and prevent fluid build-up. [...] The plica salpingopharyngea, a mucosal fold at the caudal portion of the Eustachian tube, forms an uninterrupted channel between the medial lamina of the Eustachian tube and the lateral wall of the pharynx. The plica salpingopharyngea can sometimes act as a one-way valve trapping air in the pouch, causing <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> tympany''''. Each pouch is moulded around the stylohyoid bone which divides the medial and lateral compartments. The medial compartment is much larger, and protrudes more caudally and ventrally.|$|E
40|$|Selective brain cooling (SBC) {{is defined}} as the {{lowering}} of brain temperature below arterial blood temperature. Artiodactyls employ a carotid rete, an anatomical heat exchanger, to cool arterial blood shortly before it enters the brain. The survival advantage of this anatomy traditionally is believed to be a protection of brain tissue from heat injury, especially during exercise. Perissodactyls such as horses do not possess a carotid rete, and it has been proposed that their <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> serve the heat-exchange function of the carotid rete by cooling the blood that traverses them, thus protecting the brain from heat injury. We have tested this proposal by measuring brain and carotid artery temperature simultaneously in free-living horses. We found that despite evidence of cranial cooling, brain temperature increased by about 2. 5  °C during exercise, and consistently exceeded carotid temperature by 0. 2 – 0. 5  °C. We conclude that cerebral blood flow removes heat from the brain by convection, but since SBC does not occur in horses, the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> are not surrogate carotid retes...|$|R
50|$|The <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> {{are located}} behind the cranial cavity, caudally {{the skull and}} below {{the wings of the}} atlas (C1). They are {{enclosed}} by the parotid and mandibular salivary glands, and the pterygoid muscles. The ventral portion lays on the pharynx and beginning of the esophagus, with the retropharyngeal lymph nodes located between the ventral wall and pharynx. The left and right pouches are separated by the longus capitis and rectus capitis ventralis muscles dorsomedially. Below these muscles, the two pouches fuse to form a median septum.|$|R

5000|$|The genus Equus has {{a unique}} part of the {{respiratory}} system called the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch,</b> which is thought to equalize air pressure on the tympanic membrane. These (left and right, separated by a narrow septum) is located in [...] "Vyborg's triangle", between the mandibles but below the occiput. With a capacity of 300 to 500 ml, it fills with air when the horse swallows or exhales.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> tympany is an {{uncommon}} ailment in which excessive amounts of air become {{trapped in the}} pouch, resulting in abnormal expansion. Tympany is usually unilateral, {{but in some cases}} can affect both pouches. It is seen most often in young foals and is more common in females than in males. Tympany results in non-painful, soft swelling beneath the ear and behind the jaw. Additional symptoms may include roaring, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing and/or aspiration pneumonia. Diagnosis is achieved through radiography and endoscopic evaluation. The specific cause of <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> tympany is not known, but it is suspected that it is more common when there are defects of the plica salpingopharyngeus, and/or the pharyngeal orifice where they act as a one-way valve that does not allow air to escape. Because of the risk of secondary infection, it is crucial that tympany be treated as soon as possible. Treatment protocols may include, but are not limited to, surgical intervention and in cases where surgery is not an option, insertion of a transnasal Foley balloon catheter in an attempt to remodel the pharyngeal orifice.|$|E
50|$|In the equids (horses) {{and some}} rodent-like {{species such as}} the desert hyrax, an evagination of the eustachian tube {{is known as the}} <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> and is divided into medial and lateral {{compartments}} by the stylohyoid bone of the hyoid apparatus. This is of great importance in equine medicine as the pouches are prone to infections, and, due to their intimate relationship to the cranial nerves (VII, IX, X, XI) and the internal and external carotid artery, various syndromes may arise relating to which is damaged. Epistaxis (nosebleed) is a very common presentation to veterinary surgeons and this may often be fatal unless a balloon catheter can be placed in time to suppress bleeding.|$|E
40|$|The M-protein {{genes of}} Streptococcus equi {{isolated}} from 17 outwardly healthy horses after 4 strangles outbreaks had ended, including a quarantined animal, {{were compared with}} those of 5. equi isolates from 167 active cases of strangles across 4 countries. The healthy horses included 16 persistent 5. equi carriers, at least one from each of the four outbreaks. These carriers, despite being outwardly healthy, had empyema of the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch(es),</b> an enlargement of the equine Eustachian tube. A persistent carrier from two of these outbreaks, the quarantined animal and a healthy animal with normal <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches,</b> from which 5. equi was isolated only once, were colonized by variant 5, equi with truncated M-protein genes (24 % of outwardly healthy animals with 5. equi). The truncated M-protein genes had in-frame deletions in slightly different positions between the signal sequence and the central repeat region, equivalent to approximately 20 % of the mature expressed protein. Immunoblotting with antibody to recombinant M-protein confirmed that the variants expressed a truncated form of the M-protein. In contrast to the outwardly healthy 5. equi carriers, only 1 / 167 of 5. equi isolates from strangles cases possessed a truncated M-protein gene (< 1 %; Fisher's exact test, P = 0. 0002). Compared with isolates from healthy horses with a truncated WI-protein, much more of the N terminus of the truncated M-protein was retained in the variant 5. equi from a strangles case. Variant 5 equi from outwardly healthy animals were more susceptible to phagocytosis by neutrophils in vitro than typical isolates. This is the first report of detection of 5, equi with a truncated M-protein. The distribution of the variants between strangles cases and carriers suggests that the 80 % of the M-protein retained in the variants may contribute to colonization whilst the deleted portion of the gene may be needed for full virulence. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Dysphagia is {{difficulty}} in eating or swallowing feed or water despite having good appetite.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the carbohydrate composition of mucosubstances in the equine <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> using conventional histochemical tests in conjunction with glycolytic digestion to degrade different classes of glycosoaminoglycans. In the goblet cells, the mucopolysaccharides contained chondroitin sulfate B, heparin, heparan sulfate and sialic acid residues. The acinar cells also expressed these substances (except for heparin), whereas the ductal cells produced chondroitin sulfate B and sialic acid. Neutral sugars were also found in each cell type. The diversity of the glycocomponents found in the auditory tube suggests that they may have important functional roles. Indeed, the glycosoaminoglycans provide a hydrophilic environment that prevents dehydration and desiccation of the guttural membranes during air passage. Additionally, these glycomolecules may be involved in the pathogenesis of some bacterial disease in horses, such as equine strangles. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The {{epithelium}} is pseudostratified and ciliated containing mucous-secreting goblet cells; lymph nodules {{are also}} present. The compartments of each <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> contain many important structures including several cranial nerves and arteries that lie directly against the pouch {{as they pass}} {{into and out of}} foramina in the caudal aspect of the skull. The glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory and hypoglossal nerves; the sympathetic trunk leaving from the cranial cervical ganglion; and the internal carotid all cause a mucosal fold indent within the medial compartment, visible when viewed endoscopically. The facial nerve is in contact with the dorsal part of the pouch. The external carotid artery passes ventral to the medial compartment before crossing to the lateral wall of the lateral compartment. The pouch also covers the temporohyoid joint.|$|E
50|$|If the {{drainage}} tract becomes blocked for any reason, the mucous secretions can accumulate and cause the pouch to distend, producing a visible and palpable protrusion behind the mandible. The exudate may become contaminated with pathogens. The bacteria Streptococcus equi, the causative agent of strangles, is commonly involved. Mycotic infections can also occur. Some visible symptoms of <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> disease include abnormal {{head and neck}} carriage, nasal discharge, painful swelling and occasional abnormal functioning of the structures associated with the pouch. Secondary problems may include inflammation {{of the middle ear}} due to migration of the infection along the auditory tube; nasal bleeding caused by damage to the internal carotid artery; with vagus nerve involvement there may be laryngeal hemiplegia (roaring) or difficulty swallowing (also if glossopharyngeal nerve is involved); and Horner’s syndrome from the involvement of sympathetic nerves. Involvement of the facial nerve is rare.|$|E
50|$|All {{vertebrates}} have a pharynx, {{used in both}} {{feeding and}} respiration. The pharynx arises during development in all vertebrates {{through a series of}} six or more outpocketings on the lateral sides of the head. These outpocketings are pharyngeal arches, and they give rise to a number of different structures in the skeletal, muscular and circulatory systems. The structure of the pharynx varies across the vertebrates. It differs in dogs, horses and ruminants. In dogs a single duct connects the nasopharynx to the nasal cavity. The tonsils are a compact mass which point away from the lumen of the pharynx.In the horse the auditory tube opens into the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch</b> and the tonsils are diffuse and raised slightly. Horses are unable to breathe through the mouth as the free apex of the rostral epiglottis lies dorsal to the soft palate in a normal horse. In ruminants the tonsils are a compact mass which point towards the lumen of the pharynx.|$|E
40|$|Strangles is {{an upper}} {{respiratory}} tract infection in horses, which is highly contagious {{and one of the}} more costly diseases of the horse. Three recombinant antigens were used to vaccinate horses, which were then experimentally challenged with Streptococcus equi, the causative agent for strangles.

The neck was held stiffly. Radiography of the cervical region showed a focal area of increased radio-opacity over the dorsal, caudal and lateral aspect of the dorsal spinous process of C 2. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a hypoechoic area approximately 15 cm in diameter superimposed over the dorsal spinous process of C 2. An aspirate was taken of the mass, which revealed purulent exudate confirming the diagnosis of an abscess. The abscess was lanced with a scalpel blade and samples of the purulent material revealed a pure culture of Streptococcus equi subsp. equi. The <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> (Eustachian tube diverticulae (ETD)) were then evaluated endoscopically and multiple chondroids were seen filling most of the right ETD.

5000|$|Adults of {{this species}} can reach a total length of up to 60 cm, with the tail {{accounting}} for more than half. Sexes are not strongly dimorphic, but males can be distinguished from females as males have a wider cloacal opening, {{the base of the}} tail is wider, the head is usually larger with a larger beard and possess hemipenes. Males also have more pronounced femoral pores than females (these can be seen as waxy bumps {{on the underside of the}} back legs). Bearded dragons vary widely in colour, including brown, reddish-brown, red, yellow, white, and orange. They are capable of undergoing moderate changes in the shade of their colour to help regulate temperature. The specialized scales along both sides of the throat, neck, and head form many narrow spines which run down the side of the body to the tail. When feeling threatened, a bearded dragon will flatten its body against the ground, puff out its spiny throat and open its jaws to make itself appear larger. The bearded dragon is so named because of the pouch-like projection (also called the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouch)</b> on the underside of the neck and chin area which typically turns darker than the rest of the body. It also boasts spiny projections. Both of these characteristics appear similar to a human's beard. Males typically have a darker [...] "beard" [...] than females, and during mating season and courtship it will typically darken to near-black. The bearded dragon, like most agamid lizards, has strong legs which enable it to lift its body completely off the ground while it moves. This is done to reduce the heat taken in from the ground, as well as to increase the air flow over the belly to cool itself further.|$|E
5000|$|Tumors {{related to}} squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) can appear {{anywhere on the}} body, but they are most often located in non-pigmented skin near mucocutaneous junctions (where skin meets mucous membranes) such as on the eyelids, around the nostrils, lips, vulva, prepuce, penis or anus. The tumors are raised, fleshy, often ulcerated or infected and may have an irregular surface. Rarely, primary SCC develops in the esophagus, stomach (non-glandular portion), nasal passages and sinuses, the hard palate, gums, <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> and lung. The eyelid {{is the most common}} site, accounting for 40-50% of cases, followed by male (25-10% of cases) and female (10% of cases) genitalia. Horses with lightly pigmented skin, such as those with a gray hair coat or white faces, are especially prone to developing SCC, and some breeds, such as Clydesdales, may have a genetic predisposition. Exposure of light-colored skin to UV light has often been cited as a predisposing factor, but lesions can occur in dark skin and in areas that are not usually exposed to sunlight, such as around the anus. [...] Buildup of smegma ("the bean" [...] in horseman's terms) on the penis is also linked to SCC and is thought to be a carcinogen through penile irritation. Pony geldings and work horses are more prone to developing SCC on the penis, due to less frequent penile washing when compared to stallions.

Vital parameters were all within normal limits. The left eye was atrophied and avisual due to previous uveitis. Mild submandibular lymphadenopathy was palpated. The patient was offered a small amount of hay and was observed to prehend and chew normally but when swallowing he tucked and shook his head and then dropped the hay. An oral exam revealed a large ulcerated lesion on the right caudolateral aspect of the tongue. No significant abnormalities were found on endoscopic exam of his nasopharynx or <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches.</b> The problem list consisted of the ulcerative lingual lesion and associated submandibular lymphadenopathy, hypersalivation, dysphagia, quidding, and weight loss. Differential diagnoses included lingual foreign body, abscess, neoplasia, trauma, or a primary infection such as actinobacillus lignieresii (wooden tongue). Secondary glossitis was considered likely with a foreign body, neoplasia, or trauma. Radiograph and ultrasound examinations were negative for a foreign body or abscess. Fine needle aspirates and biopsy samples were obtained under short duration anesthesia and were definitive for squamous cell carcinoma. Due to the location and extent of disease surgical resection was impossible and humane euthanasia was recommended. 	 This case report will discuss the presentation, possible etiologies, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of both equine squamous cell carcinoma and EOTRH...|$|R
40|$|Strangles {{is caused}} by host {{restricted}} pathogen Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) and is the most frequently diagnosed equine disease. This highly contiguous disease accounts for approximate 30 % of recorded incidents of equine disease annually (Harrington, Sutcliffe, & Chanter, 2002). Strangles is characterized by abscessation of the lymph nodes {{of the head and}} neck. The severity of this disease varies largely depending on the immune status of the affected animal (Sweeney et al., 2005). Diagnosis of strangles can be complicated by the presence of other beta haemolytic streptococci, especially the closely related S. zooepidemicus. Moreover, the current method used to detect S. equi in the carriage state – via samples from the <b>guttural</b> <b>pouches</b> of apparently healthy horses after recovery from strangles - is not always practical. Currently there are two vaccines for strangles available in NZ. One is a non-encapsulated and attenuated strain of S. equi, Pinnacle® IN (Ford Dodge, USA), which is administered intranasally. Another is an inactivated bacterin, Equivac® S (Pfizer, NZ), used intramuscularly. However, the efficacy of these two vaccines to the three NZ S. equi strains is not clear. Also the level of induced antibodies with the sera of inoculated animals is unkown. In this study, an enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect fluorescent-antibody assay (IFA) were developed to detect specific antibodies in sera from horses either infected with S. equi, or vaccinated with Pinnacle or Equivac S, or unvaccinated. Four peptides synthesized by GenScript (GenScript, USA) were used for the ELISA study. Of these, three peptides targeted the N-terminal variable regions of S. equi strains 99, 100 and the vaccine strain. The other was a PEPK repeats peptide, corresponding to a region present in the N-terminal region of the S. equi protein SzPSe. Both ELISA and IFA results showed that relatively high levels of antibodies were induced following vaccination or infection. Also, the induced antibodies demonstrated cross-reactivity to all three S. equi strains tested. ELISA for the PEPK peptide produced higher ODs than seen with the three SeM peptides, suggesting that there were more antibodies against PEPK peptide within the sera. The IFA results showed a difference in titre between pre-vaccinated horses and post-vaccinated horses; whilst the ELISA results did not. This may be due to serological reactivity between those four peptides and ‘natural antibodies’ induced by exposure to the closely related S. zooepidemicus. Further evidence in support of this result was seen in western blotting, which showed that ‘natural antibodies’ in serum from pre-vaccinated horses reacted serologically with proteins from S. equi. IFA was shown to be the better method for the diagnosis of strangles and {{for the study of the}} antibody responses after vaccination or infection. ELISA and IFA results also showed that the observed antibody levels induced by Pinnacle and Equivac S were similar, indicating the comparable efficacy of these two vaccines. All of the vaccinated horses had high levels of pre-existing antibodies within their sera, even one year after vaccination. This may suggest that an increase in the interval of booster time could be acceptable. However, it is acknowledged that antibody titres do not necessarily equal protection from infection. Western blotting results indicated that a stronger immunity was formed after natural infection than seen in horses after. This is because after infection the entire immune system (both humoral and cell-mediated) will be stimulated...|$|R
