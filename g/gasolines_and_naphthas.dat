We develop an econometric framework for the demand <b>and</b> pricing of <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> diesel cars.

Our empirical results show that the relative pricing of <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> diesel cars is consistent with price discrimination of a monopolistic type, e®ectively segmenting low mileage from high mileage consumers. On average, about 75 to 90 percent of the price di®erentials between <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> diesel cars can be explained by markup di®erences.

Saudi Arabia has been leading the regional shift by working to implement projects that will improve <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> diesel qualities. To comply with mandatory sulfur specifications for <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> diesel between 2013 and 2016, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia plans to construct multiple clean-fuel projects that will improve <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> diesel qualities. Saudi Arabia is seeking to reduce sulfur content in diesel <b>and</b> <b>gasoline</b> to 10 parts per million (ppm) and to lower benzene content in gasoline to 1  %. With these new fuel specifications, Saudi Arabian refining operations will comply with international standards. This will represent a dramatic reduction in sulfur levels from 2012, when Saudi Arabia’s maximum sulfur level for diesel was greater than 500  ppm. The planned upgrades and revamps are necessary to meet future market demand for higher-value, lower-sulfur transportation fuels.|$|R

40|$|Asymmetric {{movements}} of <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> {{crude oil prices}} have {{been the focus of}} many studies since 1990 s. Recent volatile crude oil prices in the global market have reignited interest in the link between <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> crude oil prices. Asymmetry between <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> crude oil prices is defined as the process of non-symmetric response of gasoline prices to changes in crude oil prices. This study presents a survey of papers which address various aspects and explanations of asymmetry between <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> crude oil prices. The studies in this literature cover different stages of the market between retail <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> crude oil. Although the different studies employ different methodologies to uncover asymmetry, the reliability of some of the methods has been questioned. Several explanations are offered for asymmetry like retailer's market power, asymmetric role of inventories, consumer search costs and so on. With the exception of market power explanation, the explanations are compatible with competitive market hypothesis. The review, highlights inconsistencies between economic theories and employed models, and identifies importance of distinguishing between margin and pass-through rate in future investigation.
