500|$|Gordon {{was chosen}} as the showrunner for the series by Killen. Gordon commended the pilot script at first glance. Gordon {{originally}} read the script on a flight to New York City. [...] "I read the pilot, and once I got past my envy, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> by the voice," [...] he stated. [...] "So few writers have real voices. Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife. He said that The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects that you have to decide which format to use each week. He compared it to Awake, saying, then, [...] "What makes an Awake episode?" [...] "Pilot" [...] was written by Killen, and directed by David Slade.|$|E

500|$|Raised as a Lutheran, Gingrich was a Southern Baptist in {{graduate}} school. He converted to Catholicism, Bisek's faith, on March 29, 2009. He said: [...] "over {{the course of}} several years, I gradually became Catholic and then decided one day to accept the faith I had already come to embrace". He decided to officially become a Catholic when he saw Pope Benedict XVI, during the Pope's visit to the United States in 2008: [...] "Catching a glimpse of Pope Benedict that day, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> by the happiness and peacefulness he exuded. The joyful and radiating presence of the Holy Father was a moment of confirmation about the many things I had been thinking and experiencing for several years." [...] At a 2011 appearance in Columbus, Ohio, he said, [...] "In America, religious belief is being challenged by a cultural elite trying to create a secularized America, in which God is driven out of public life." ...|$|E

500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, {{he was a member of}} our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E
500|$|Schwimmer {{made his}} directorial feature {{debut in the}} 2007 British comedy film Run Fatboy Run. The film stars Simon Pegg {{as a man who}} signs up for a {{marathon}} (he is out of shape) to convince his former fiancée and five-year-old son that he has turned his life around. When asked why he decided to direct the film, Schwimmer said: [...] "As a director, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> by the challenge that I thought the script presented, which was that it was kind of three films in one. You had some great, big physical comedy, and I thought funny dialogue and characters. And then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect". Run Fatboy Run garnered mixed reception, with the New York Daily News rating it one-and-a-half out of five stars and writing, [...] "Most disappointing is how Schwimmer—who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters—manages to bumble 'Fatboy's' tender moments". USA Today, however, was favorable towards Schwimmer, reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse [...] "having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera". For his directorial work, he was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Debut Director.|$|E
500|$|Peel (presumably one of {{the liberal}} proprietors with {{excellent}} regulations who assured his support) introduced his Bill in 1802. [...] In doing so Peel {{said that he was}} convinced of the existence of gross mismanagement in his own factories, and having no time to set them in order himself, was getting an Act of Parliament passed to do it for him [...] but (given his dealings with the Manchester Board of Health) this may well have been a pleasantry, rather than the whole truth[...] [...] In 1816 Peel introduced a further Factory Bill; his explanation to the consequent Select Committee of the need for further legislation included this account of the origins of the 1802 Act: The house in which I have a concern gave employment at one time to near one thousand children of this description. [...] Having other pursuits, it was not often in my power to visit the factories, but whenever such visits were made, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> with the uniform appearance of bad health, and, in many cases, stinted growth of the children; the hours of labour were regulated by the interest of the overseer, whose remuneration depending on the quantity of the work done, he was often induced to make the poor children work excessive hours, and to stop their complaints by trifling bribes ...|$|E

500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|Ryan Nakashima of Associated Press was {{generally}} {{impressed with the}} film's 4K resolution picture quality, though the visual-effects shots that comprised {{about a third of}} the movie were done in 2K resolution to save on cost and time.

In a distant shot of Smith's son Jaden running down a riverbed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> by how many small rocks were defined clearly from such a distance.

2500|$|Other {{works for}} the theater were a score for Euripides' The Bacchae (2009, {{directed}} by JoAnne Akalaitis), and Kepler (2009), yet another operatic biography of a scientist or explorer. The opera {{is based on the}} life of 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler, against the background of the Thirty Years' War, with a libretto compiled from Kepler's texts and poems by his contemporary Andreas Gryphius. It is Glass's first opera in German, and was premiered by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and Dennis Russell Davies in September 2009. LA Times critic Mark Swed and others described the work as [...] "oratorio-like"; Swed pointed out the work is Glass's [...] "most chromatic, complex, psychological score" [...] and [...] "the orchestra dominates (...) <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> by the muted, glowing colors, the character of many orchestral solos and the poignant emphasis on bass instruments".|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times’ Roger Ebert {{responded to}} these criticisms by saying: Terrence Malick's [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] has been praised for its painterly images and evocative score, but criticized for its muted emotions: Although passions erupt in a deadly love triangle, all the {{feelings}} are somehow held at arm's length. This observation is true enough, {{if you think}} only about {{the actions of the}} adults in the story. But watching this 1978 film again recently, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> more than ever with the conviction that {{this is the story of}} a teenage girl, told by her, and its subject is the way that hope and cheer have been beaten down in her heart. We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion: It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.|$|E
2500|$|After Barrera’s {{death in}} 2001—his body {{reportedly}} {{found in the}} exact spot where he found the girl’s body fifty years before—the area became a popular tourist attraction where visitors bring more dolls. The locals describe it as “charmed”—not haunted—even though travelers claim the dolls whisper to them. Professional photographer Cindy Vasko visited the nightmarish island in 2015 and described it as the [...] "creepiest place [...] ever visited". The excursion began through maze-like canals, surrounded by lush greenery and beautiful singing birds, but soon her boat was slowed down by a swarm of lily pads and the canal fell ominously silent. She told MailOnline: [...] "At {{the end of the}} journey, the trajinera turned along a bend in the waterway and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> by a surreal vision of hundreds, maybe thousands, of dolls hanging from trees on the tiny island."
