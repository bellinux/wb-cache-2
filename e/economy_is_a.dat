25|$|Given {{the small}} {{population}} of the region (compared with the Central Canadian provinces or the New England states), the regional <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> net exporter of natural resources, manufactured goods, and services. The regional economy has long been tied to natural resources such as fishing, logging, farming, and mining activities. Significant industrialization {{in the second half}} of the 19th century brought steel to Trenton, Nova Scotia, and subsequent creation of a widespread industrial base to take advantage of the region's large underground coal deposits. After Confederation, however, this industrial base withered with technological change, and trading links to Europe and the U.S. were reduced in favour of those with Ontario and Quebec. In recent years, however, the Maritime regional economy has begun increased contributions from manufacturing again and the steady transition to a service economy.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{literacy}} bolsters {{both the}} informal and formal economies in Veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy. While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence {{was found that}} the informal <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> complex adaptive system.|$|E

500|$|During {{the time}} that he lived at 38 Rue Vanneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845), Marx engaged in an {{intensive}} study of [...] "political economy" [...] (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill, etc.), the French socialists (especially Claude Henri St. Simon and Charles Fourier) and the history of France. The study of political <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> study that Marx would pursue {{for the rest of his}} life and would result in his major economic work—the three-volume series called Capital. Marxism is based in large part on three influences: Hegel's dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of [...] "Marxism" [...] (or political economy as Marx called it) were in place by the autumn of 1844. [...] Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy. Not only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally editing a radical newspaper and later the organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies. Marx sought [...] "to understand the inner workings of capitalism".|$|E
