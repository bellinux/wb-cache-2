40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{primary concern}} of this {{dissertation}} is {{the reduction of}} cross-border tax obstacles by improving the VAT rules governing cross border supplies of services and intangibles. These cross-border transactions are on the increase for many countries around the world. Cross-border transactions come with many challenges which impact current VAT rules and systems negatively and expose serious shortcomings in the application thereof. The dissertation examines {{the nature of the}} current cross-border VAT rules in <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> (SA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and analyses the effectiveness and adequacy thereof. As a result of globalization rapid growth in international trade, specifically by electronic means, is inevitable. Today businesses are certainly becoming more focused internationally and are able to conduct their business activities across borders without constraints. Many VAT rules were designed only taking into account national economic activities and not international activities. The supply of services and intangibles across borders may be made without being reported, recorded and taxed. Many cross-border trading activities may potentially fall outside of the tax net and result in the non-collection of VAT revenues. Many countries have introduced a place of supply rule to mitigate the challenges and uncertainties arising from cross-border transactions. <b>South</b> <b>Africa's</b> value-added tax system does not include a place of supply rule. <b>South</b> <b>Africa's</b> Revenue authorities are currently faced with many challenges and uncertainties regarding the tax consequences of cross border transactions. The effectiveness of SA's existing VAT rules governing exports and imports are increasingly challenged by the growth in online web-based commerce. The difficulty in establishing the most effective rules to ensure compliance with VAT obligations on web-based transactions is growing. There is no standard set of VAT rules for cross-border transactions that can readily be applied internationally to every circumstance to determine the place of supply. The aim of this research is to determine whether the introduction of a place of supply rule is an effective solution to resolve the challenges and uncertainties resulting from cross border electronic transactions and ultimately increase VAT revenue. The dissertation specifically includes information on the practical application of the place of supply rule and the challenges facing the UK. A comparison between the VAT rules applied in <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> for imports versus the UK place of supply rules is made and the significant differences are highlighted. In conclusion it is proposed that the introduction of a place of supply rule in <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> would be beneficial and would contribute to the development an <b>d</b> improvement of <b>South</b> <b>Africa's</b> VAT system...|$|R

40|$|Ph. <b>D.</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> has {{the highest}} {{biodiversity}} of tortoises {{in the world with}} possibly an equivalent diversity of apicomplexan haematozoans, which to date have not been adequately researched. Prior to this study, five apicomplexans had been recorded infecting southern African tortoises, including two haemogregarines, Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi and Haemogregarina parvula, and three haemoproteids, Haemoproteus testudinalis, Haemoproteus balazuci and Haemoproteus sp. A. The taxonomy of all of these species was questionable, and therefore one goal {{of this study was to}} examine at least some in great detail with the view to resolving taxonomic issues. This involved using a number of techniques such as light microscopy and image analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and molecular analysis. Outcomes were the transfer of one Haemogregarina species (Haemogregarina fitzsimonsi) to the genus Hepatozoon, the suggestion that the genus Hemolivia might be more appropriate for another haemogregarine (Haemogregarina parvula), the synonymisation of two known species of Haemoproteus (Haemoproteus balazuci with Haemoproteus testudinalis), and the naming of a third haemoproteid (Haemoproteus natalensis Cook, Smit and Davies, 2010). In addition, a likely new species of haemogregarine (Haemogregarina sp. A.) was described. To achieve all this, 367 tortoises were collected representing 62 % of the species and all five genera, of South African tortoises. Tortoises were both wild (287) and captive (80), with these being both live (270) and dead (97) when taken. They were located in four different provinces, including Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern and the Western Cape, and in four different biomes (semi-arid grassland, Kalahari desert, subtropical thorn bushveld, and coastal endemic fynbos). Light photomicroscopy examination of Giemsa stained peripheral blood smears prepared from the subcarapacial vessels of live tortoises allowed for descriptions and comparisons of the observed haematozoans. Of the live tortoises, 14. 8 % had haemogregarines, including 13. 3 % with H. fitzsimonsi, 0. 7 % with H. parvula, and 0. 7 % with a previously unknown, intraleucocytic, Haemogregarina sp. A. A further 1. 1 % had haemoproteids, including 0. 7 % with Hp. testudinalis/Hp. balazuci and 0. 4 % with Haemoproteus sp. A. The host and locality records of previously described haematozoan species were increased and records for likely new species provided. Subtropical areas (KwaZulu-Natal) compared to arid regions (Northern Cape) presented with a higher diversity of apicomplexans, along with a higher prevalence of ticks, possible vectors of the tortoise blood parasites. Overall, male tortoises had the highest haematozoan and tick prevalences compared to females and juveniles...|$|E

40|$|The neuroparalytic {{syndrome}} called botulism {{is caused}} by the neurotoxins produced by bacteria in the genus Clostridium. There are seven toxigenic types of C. botulinum (A to G) based on antigenically distinct toxins produced by different strains of the organism. Animal botulism {{is caused by}} C. botulinum type C and D neurotoxins and has a severe economic impact on cattle farming in South Africa and neighbouring countries. Current treatment regimes include the use of acetylcholine for symptomatic treatment, but this is unfortunately very seldom successful. All indications are that there is no cure for this disease and that effective control can only be achieved through development of efficacious vaccines. The botulinum vaccine currently in use in South Africa contains an adjuvanted toxoid form of the type C and o neurotoxins. However, this bivalent vaccine relies on problematic anaerobic cultivation of the Clostridium bacterium followed by isolation, purification and inactivation of the toxin by treatment with formalin. Apart from the fastidious growth requirements of this organism, {{it has been reported that}} the production of toxin by these cells declines rapidly and eventually ceases, following laboratory passaging of the bacterial cultures. In addition, improper inactivation of the toxins may also lead to the demise of animals following vaccination. Thus, there exists a great need for a safe, effective and inexpensive vaccine against botulism. To investigate the potential of types C and D botulinum neurotoxins as efficacious recombinant vaccine candidates against botulism, full-length copies of the genes were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from bacteriophage DNA isolated from Clostridium botulinum type C (Stockholm) and <b>D</b> (<b>South</b> <b>Africa)</b> cultures. The full-length genes were cloned and subsequently sequenced to verify their integrity. By making use of PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis procedures, three amino acid mutations were introduced in the zinc-binding motif of the respective neurotoxins. Mutation of this domain has previously been reported to successfully detoxify type C neurotoxin. The wild-type and mutant genes were subsequently expressed in insect cells using the BAC-to-BAC™ baculovirus system. Although, unique protein bands corresponding to the size of the neurotoxins could not be seen in Coomassie brilliant blue-stained gels, Western blot analysis indicated immunoreactive material for wild-type and mutant type C corresponding to the size of the type C toxin light chain. However, there was no conclusive evidence to support the successful expression of the full-length wild-type and mutant type D genes.

40|$|Ph. <b>D.</b> <b>South</b> <b>Africa</b> is {{the highest}} produce-producing and {{therefore}} the highest pesticide consumer on the African continent. Although greatly beneficial to the industry, indiscriminate and over usage of these agrochemicals pose a risk to the aquatic ecosystems through non-point source pollution. Data on these risks are limited in the developing countries such as Africa since limited environmental monitoring of pesticides is undertaken. This is due to technical, logistical and economical constraints in determining the links between exposure and effect on non-target organisms. Methods {{that are able to}} screen for and monitor pesticides that could pose a risk according to site-specific scenarios are therefore necessary. Economical and easy-to-use predictive models incorporated into Preliminary Risk Assessments (PRA’s) are useful in this regard and have been developed and applied globally to assist in estimating the probability of risks of pesticides associated with aquatic ecosystems. Currently no such risk assessment model is applied in South Africa for this purpose. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to present and assess the suitability of selected PRA models as preliminary screening tools for estimating potential pesticide exposure and associated effects within aquatic ecosystems. To achieve this, the primary objectives were to apply and validate these models for assessing predicted risks and to relate these to actual ecological hazards by monitoring the exposure and effects of selected pesticides that were identified as potentially posing a risk. It was hypothesised that the data determined by these models would elucidate the association between potential risks of pesticides and actual environmental impacts and could therefore be applied and validated for South African conditions. A framework was thus developed using multidisciplinary approaches to predict the risks of agricultural pesticides to non-target aquatic organisms and to validate these risks in an area known to have a high pesticide usage, namely the Crocodile (west) Marico catchment. This area is representative of a typical farming community in the subtropical central area of South Africa. It is a catchment area that exhibits high urban and agricultural usage, which has compromised the overall ecological integrity of the aquatic systems. The focus of the study was on the Crocodile (west) and Magalies Rivers and the associated irrigation canal network systems. The present study was based on integrating multidisciplinary techniques following the implementation of a tiered approach for assessing the ecological risks of selected pesticides known to be used within the Crocodile (west) Marico catchment. Tier 1 starts with the PRA assuming a relatively worst-case scenario by identifying pesticides most commonly used (through surveys) and estimating exposures posing a potential risk to the aquatic environment using the PRIMET (Pesticide Risks In the tropics to Man, Environment and Trade) model. The second tier can establish a more realistic characterisation of risk for the pesticide application scenarios of interest by using models such as PERPEST (Predicting the Ecological Risks of PESTicides), PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment of Regional and Local Scales), TOXSWA (TOXic substances in Surface Waters), or SSDs (Species Sensitivity Distributions). Higher tiers then include comparing the results from the PRA model predictions to the actual hazards of pesticides and can determine if these risk models are valid under South Africa conditions. This can be achieved using a combination of laboratory- and field-based monitoring assessments in the form of a triad approach (using chemical, toxicological and ecological assessments) to construct several lines-of-evidence (LoEs). The risk assessment process ends with a summary and integration of the data based on the multiple LoEs gathered during monitoring using a weight-of-evidence (WoE) approach...|$|E
