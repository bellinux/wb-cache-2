40|$|In recent years, {{the problem}} of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> {{residues}} in animal derived food has drawn wide attention in the world. It is imperative to develop rapid, simple, highly sensitive, and high-throughput analytical methods for <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues. A comprehensive review was presented here on the sample pretreatment and determination methods of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues. The principles, operation procedures, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} various analytical technologies were analyzed and compared．Possible future directions in the analytical methods used for <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues were also outlined...|$|R
30|$|In the ASALs, {{there is}} limited {{dissemination}} of knowledge and information on camel health management. Pastoralists obtain knowledge and information on <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> use through experience (the elders have more information on <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> than the youth). Pastoralists also get knowledge/information on <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> use through informal training conducted by either NGOs or CBAHWs recruited as facilitators by NGOs. This demonstrates the significant {{role played by the}} CBAHWs in animal health management in the ASALs. There is limited involvement of the government in provision of knowledge and information on the right <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> to use.|$|R

Addi-tionally, the detection methods of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues in raw aquatic products, ready-to-eat meat, dairy products and the differences of maximum residue limits between china and other countries were overviewed.

30|$|The {{health risk}} factors were <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> {{residues}} in camel milk and meat, diarrhoea/vomiting, allergic reaction, resistance to human and <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> and cancer. The {{presence of these}} public health and food safety risk factors demonstrates the likelihood of spreading zoonotic diseases between animals and human. The presence of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residuals may lead to development of resistance in the common diseases affecting the livestock and humans in the study area.|$|R
30|$|Eighty percent (80 %) of pastoralists {{reported}} that they purchase <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> from agro-veterinary shops, while else received from NGO/donor projects (11.4 %) or other sources (8.6 %) such as friends/neighbours with previous leftover stock. There was significant (p[*]=[*]< 0.05) difference and negative correlation (r[*]=[*]− 0.300) between age and sources of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> for treating camels, indicating that youth and elderly herders get <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> from several sources.|$|R

30|$|There {{was very}} little {{involvement}} of either the national or the County government in provision {{of information on the}} right <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> to use (7.1 %) to pastoralists (Figure  4).

30|$|During {{focus group}} discussions (FGD) and key {{informant}} interviews (KIIs), gross misuse {{and abuse of}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> by pastoralists was reported. The noted cases were administering <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> through a wrong route and using a wrong injection needle size. The pastoralists, CBAHWs and veterinary officers complained {{that most of the}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> packages in agro-veterinary shops did not have instructions on dosage for camels, and they extrapolate the camel dosage based on cattle or horse dosage on the package, which can lead to over-dosing or under-dosing of camels.|$|R

40|$|The risk {{assessment}} of residues of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> in {{food is a}} field that continues to evolve. The toxicological end-points to be considered are becoming more nuanced and in light of growing concern {{about the development of}} antimicrobial resistance, detailed analysis of the antimicrobial activity of the residues of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> in food is increasingly incorporated in the assessment. In recent years, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has refined its approaches to provide a more comprehensive and fit-for-purpose {{risk assessment}}. This publication describes in detail the consideration of acute and chronic effects, the estimation of acute and chronic dietary exposure, current approaches for including microbiological endpoints in the risk assessment, and JECFA's considerations for the potential effects of food processing on residues from <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs.</b> JECFA now applies these approaches in the development of health-based guidance values (i. e. safe exposure levels) for residues of <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs.</b> JECFA, thus, comprehensively addresses acute and chronic risks by using corresponding estimates for acute and chronic exposure and suitable correction for the limited bioavailability of bound residues by the Gallo-Torres model. On a case-by-case basis, JECFA also considers degradation products that occur from normal food processing of food containing <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues. These approaches will continue to be refined to ensure the most scientifically sound basis for the establishment of health-based guidance values for <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residues...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{survey of}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> {{residues}} in {{bulk milk tank}} from Minas Gerais State, Brazil, was carried out through a broad scope analysis. Here, 132 raw milk samples were collected at 45 dairy farms in Minas Gerais from August 2009 to February 2010, and analyzed for 42 analytes, comprising pyrethroids, macrocyclic lactones and antibacterials, using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in tandem mode and gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Within all milk samples, at least one <b>veterinary</b> <b>drug</b> residue was identified in 40 milk samples (30. 30 %) by confirmatory tests, whereas 16 samples (12. 12 %) showed the presence {{of at least two}} residues. With regard to the Brazilian maximum residue levels, 11 milk samples (8. 33 %) were non-compliant according to Brazilian Legislation. The <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> detected in the non-compliant milk samples include penicillin V (one sample), abamectin (one sample) and cypermethrin (nine samples). Furthermore, the antibacterial screening methods failed to identify most of the positive samples that were detected by confirmatory tests, leading to a large discrepancy between the screening and confirmatory antimicrobial tests. Thus, the present study indicated that the <b>veterinary</b> <b>drugs</b> residues still represents a great concern for the milk production chain...|$|R
