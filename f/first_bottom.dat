In 1944, the VFL offered a similar scheme in which the second division's top two clubs played off for promotion against the <b>first</b> division's <b>bottom</b> two clubs; but by this stage, the VFA favoured a system of complete amalgalation into a single league with a single premiership.|$|R

He {{was associated with}} several oil projects which include piping route identification, bathymetric and shallow seismic surveys and post-lay surveys in Bombay High, Bassein-Gujarat line, and Butcher Island routes for Oil and Natural Gas Commission and the Mahanadi delta survey for Oil India. For Port Trust Board of India, he conducted surveys for the ports of Mormugao, Visakhapatnam, Mangalore and Karwar. He was credited with the initiation of managanese nodule program in India and this coordinated program {{was reported to have}} earned India a place among the seven registered Pioneer Investors of the International Seabed Authority of the United Nations. The <b>first</b> <b>bottom</b> sediment map of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal was prepared under his supervision which served as a guide for future explorations in the region. The map identified the presence of Foraminifera, a class of amoeboid protists, which indicated the marine pollution levels and the resources of calcareous sediments in Lakshadeep sea. His studies on Lakshadeep offshores also assisted in widening the understanding of about the origin of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. He was the deputy leader of the first Indian expedition to Antarctica, under the leadership of Syed Zahoor Qasim and he coordinated the marine science programs for Dakshin Gangotri, the permanent Indian station in the southernmost continent. His studies and researches have been documented by way of a number peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 14 of them. He also mentored seven doctoral scholars in their studies.|$|E

5000|$|The {{term was}} first coined and {{introduced}} into mainstream usage by Ayman Sawaf {{in a bid}} to factor in the return to one's spiritual self as an additional, fourth bottom line. Spirituality, according to Sawaf, is defined as your own unique relationship and partnership with God or The Divine. It is great to make money, to {{have a positive impact on}} society/people and the environment. It is also important to have a positive impact on one’s own spiritual growth. The fourth bottom line lifts business activities to a sacred form. The fourth bottom line is measured by how much more loving, understanding, happy, joyful, in touch with their destiny, deeper relationship or partnership with god or higher powers the person has become, while performing their business responsibilities. And as these qualities are acquired they are infused back into one's own business activities This definition, thus, identified spirituality as the fourth bottom line by businesses that relate it with happiness of stakeholders. That is when the question of why one is doing business becomes relevant. The <b>first</b> <b>bottom</b> line deals with the what. [...] "What do I get?" [...] is usually measured by money. The second and third bottom lines deal with the how. [...] "How will I do this?" [...] factors in that the means of doing business now matters. The question of whether one is doing business with honesty, trust, character, integrity, without hurting people and the environment. The Fourth Bottom Line has to do with why. To ask oneself, [...] "Why am I doing this?" [...] involves a deeper sense of self being nurtured by such a choice. With the fourth bottom line, commerce/business becomes a spiritual path. The context of spirituality as a fourth factor is further elaborated upon by Dr. Sohail Inayatullah, a professor at Tamkang University and Queensland University of Technology.|$|E
