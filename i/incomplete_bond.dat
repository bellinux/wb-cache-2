These wafers were then bonded together at various temperatures of 100 ͦC, 120 ͦC, 140 ͦC, 150 ͦC, 160 ͦC, and 180 ͦC. The target thickness of each SU- 8 layer was 100 µm.

An n-type silicon wafer and a Pyrex wafer, each with an SU- 8 layer, were brought together on the “hard bake” or final step of SU- 8 polymerization.

Holding time variations of 10, 15, 30 and 45 minutes were applied at 950 °C using mixture of Cu and Fe powder as elements promoter. Single lap joint configuration was performed in vacum furnace to join the dissimilar materials which allowed bonding diffusion. Microstructure was examined on the same test piece.

40|$|AbstractThe {{regulation}} of cell integrin receptors involves modulation of membrane expression, shift between different affinity states, and topographical redistribution {{on the cell}} membrane. Here we attempted to assess quantitatively the functional importance of receptor clustering. We studied β- 1 integrin-mediated attachment of THP- 1 cells to fibronectin-coated surfaces under low shear flow. Cells displayed multiple binding events with a half-life {{of the order of}} 1 s. The duration of binding events after the first second after arrest was quantitatively accounted for by a model assuming the existence of a short-time intermediate binding state with 3. 6 s− 1 dissociation rate and 1. 3 s− 1 transition frequency toward a more stable state. Cell binding to surfaces coated with lower fibronectin densities was concluded to be mediated by single molecular interactions, whereas multiple bonds were formed < 1 s after contact with higher fibronectin surface densities. Cell treatment with microfilament inhibitors or a neutral antiintegrin antibody decreased bond number without changing aforementioned kinetic parameters whereas a function enhancing antibody increased the rate of bond formation and/or the lifetime of intermediate state. Receptor aggregation was induced by treating cells with neutral antiintegrin antibody and antiimmunoglobulin antibodies. A semiquantitative confocal microscopy study suggested that this treatment increased between 40 % and 100 % the average number of integrin receptors located in a volume of ∼ 0. 045 μm 3 surrounding each integrin. This aggregation induced up to 2. 7 -fold increase of the average number of bonds. Flow cytometric analysis of fluorescent ligand binding showed that THP- 1 cells displayed low-affinity β- 1 integrins with a dissociation constant in the micromolar range. It is concluded that the initial step of cell adhesion was mediated by multiple <b>incomplete</b> <b>bonds</b> rather than a single equilibrium-state ligand receptor association.

30|$|It is {{important}} to stress that, among the deposited lamellae, there are small voids, such as pores, cracks and regions of <b>incomplete</b> <b>bonding.</b> Due to such inhomogeneous structure, the deposits can have properties {{significantly different from the}} initial bulk materials (Fauchais 2004). In addition, due to both very high processing temperatures (leading to dehydroxylation of HA and partial decomposition of any other material) followed by rapid solidification, various admixtures and metastable phases are usually present in the deposits. For example, in the case of plasma spraying of calcium orthophosphates, complicated mixtures of various phases (high temperature ACP, α-TCP, β-TCP, HA, OA, TTCP) with other compounds, such as calcium pyrophosphates, calcium metaphosphates, CaO, etc. are obtained (Cao et al. 2010 a; Zyman et al. 1993; Weng et al. 1993; Zyman et al. 1994; Tong et al. 1995; McPherson et al. 1995; Yang et al. 1995; Tong et al. 1998; Park et al. 1998; Gross et al. 1998 a; Gross et al. 1998 b; Heimann and Wirth 2006; Roy et al. 2011). Thus, the chemical and phase compositions of the final coatings, films and layers are dependent on the thermal history of the powder particles. This leads to variable solubility of the deposited coatings, films and layers, dictated by the amounts of more soluble phases, such as ACP. Furthermore, the distribution of by-product and metastable phases in the coatings, films and layers appears to be inhomogeneous. For example, the coating crystallinity was reported to be lower at the interface with the Ti substrate than at the surface of the coating. This happened because metals had a higher rate of thermal diffusivity than calcium orthophosphates and, thus, the cooling rate of the first layer was faster (Gross et al. 1998 b). Besides, residual stresses in the plasma sprayed coatings, films and layers were found and measured (Valter et al. 1997; Tsui et al. 1998; Yang et al. 2000; 2003 c; Yang and Chang 2005; Carradó 2010; Yang 2011).|$|R

40|$|After trauma, {{articular}} cartilage often does not heal due to <b>incomplete</b> <b>bonding</b> of the fractured surfaces. In {{this study we}} investigated the ability of chemical cross-linkers to facilitate bonding of {{articular cartilage}}, either alone or in combination with a pre-treatment with surface-degrading agents. Articular cartilage blocks were harvested from the femoropatellar groove of bovine calves. Two cartilage blocks, either after pre-treatment or without, were assembled in a custom-designed chamber in partial apposition and subjected to cross-linking treatment. Subsequently, bonding of cartilage was measured as adhesive strength, that is, the maximum force at rupture of bonded cartilage blocks divided by the overlap area. In a first approach, bonding was investigated after treatment with cross-linking reagents only, employing glutaraldehyde, 1 -ethyl- 3 -diaminopropyl-carbodiimide (EDC) /N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), genipin, or transglutaminase. Experiments were conducted with or without compression of the opposing surfaces. Compression during cross-linking strongly enhanced bonding, especially when applying EDC/NHS and glutaraldehyde. Therefore, all further experiments were performed under compressive conditions. Combinations {{of each of the}} four cross-linking agents with the degrading pre-treatments, pepsin, trypsin, and guanidine, led to distinct improvements in bonding compared to the use of cross-linkers alone. The highest values of adhesive strength were achieved employing combinations of pepsin or guanidine with EDC/NHS, and guanidine with glutaraldehyde. The release of extracellular matrix components, that is, glycosaminoglycans and total collagen, from cartilage blocks after pre-treatment was measured, but could not be directly correlated to the determined adhesive strength. Cytotoxicity was determined for all substances employed, that is, surface degrading agents and cross-linkers, using the resazurin assay. Taking the favourable cell vitality after treatment with pepsin and EDC/NHS and the cytotoxic effects of guanidine and glutaraldehyde into account, the combination of pepsin and EDC/NHS appeared to be the most advantageous treatment in this study. In conclusion, bonding of articular cartilage blocks was achieved by chemical fixation of their surface components using cross-linking reagents. Application of compressive forces and prior modulation of surface structures enhanced cartilage bonding significantly. Enzymatic treatment in combination with cross-linkers may represent a promising addition to current techniques for articular cartilage repair...|$|R

The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds.

This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper.

For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents studies {{directed towards}} the design, characterization and analysis, of bulk nanostructured (BN) and bimodal aluminum alloy 5083 (AA 5083) fabricated by cold spray processing (CSP). The {{results of the}} CSP samples were compared to the microstructures and properties of BN materials obtained using conventional powder consolidation techniques. Additionally, a proprietary non-cryogenic ball milling (NCM) technique was evaluated as a more cost effective alternative to cryogenic ball milling (CM) for processing nanocrystalline powder. Motivating factors for this research include the degradation of mechanical strength {{as a result of}} long term exposure of the nanocrystalline powder to elevated temperatures during conventional hot-processing techniques, removal of residual surface oxide that can prevent full density of the final product, and a more time and cost effective means of producing BN materials. CSP is an advantageous alternative to conventional bulk powder processing techniques as it is a low-temperature, high-velocity spray deposition technique that has been found to retain, if not further refine, the microstructure of the deposited powder, is capable of breaking up surface oxide resulting in clean metal bonding, and is capable of producing near-net-shape parts that require little post processing to achieve a final product. Furthermore, the NCM process does not use liquid nitrogen during milling operations, which results in significant cost savings compared to CM. It was found that the nanocrystalline powders produced using the NCM process were comparable in size, morphology, and grain size to the nanocrystalline powders developed using CM. It was further determined that NCM AA 5083 exhibited a higher average hardness and potentially higher thermal stability compared to CM AA 5083. These results indicate that NCM is as effective as CM in developing nanocrystalline microstructures. Analysis of the bulk CSP samples revealed that the average grain size was smaller compared to BN materials fabricated using conventional techniques, and also exhibited a higher hardness. The tensile strength of the CSP samples was found to be low compared to the conventionally processed counterparts and is attributed to the presence of microstructural defects arising from <b>incomplete</b> particle <b>bonding.</b> Analysis of bimodal bulk CSP AA 5083 revealed that the intended bimodal microstructure was not retained as the conventional grain sized powder undergoes significant grain refinement during deposition. Though areas of ductile failure were observed in the fracture surfaces, an overall lack of ductility and strength was found and attributed again to microstructural defects. These findings suggest that CSP is a viable alternative for processing BN materials...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{boundaries}} in the absorber {{often lead to}} a lower efficiency in most solar cells (e. g. Si, GaAs). Notable exceptions are Cu chalcopyrites. Until now, solar cells with polycrystalline Cu chalcopyrite absorbers have achieved higher efficiencies than their single-crystalline counterparts. Although grain boundaries may {{play an important role}} in this phenomenon, the electronic structure and the mechanism of the electrical behaviour of grain {{boundaries in}} chalcopyrites is still unknown. Currently under discussion are two different models for explaining the electronic structure of grain boundaries. The first model was originally developed for polycrystalline silicon and assumed that a large number of defects to exist at the grain boundaries caused by <b>incomplete</b> atomic <b>bonds</b> and leading to a formation of trap states that are able to trap charge carriers and immobilize them. These charged defects create a space charge region in the grain close to the boundary. Hall measurements and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) have been carried out to show a barrier and a space charge region in polycrystalline films. However, two-dimensional device simulation taking into account the effects of an additional space charge region at the grain boundaries could not confirm any improvement. An alternative model which is based on a similarity between grain boundaries and { 112 }tet surfaces surmises that grain boundaries in chalcopyrites represent a barrier without charged defects. The theory assumes that grain boundaries consisting of { 112 }tet planes (Σ 3 grain boundary) also have a Cu- deficit, to the effect that the Cu- deficit results in a downshift of the valance-band edge. This band-offset at the grain boundary represents a barrier for holes without the presence of a space charge region. For CuGaSe 2 a barrier of 550 meV was predicted. Model calculations on solar cells with neutral barriers show that the downshift of the valance-band in this order of magnitude reduces the recombination at the grain boundary which would allow efficiencies comparable to those of grain boundary free material. The work investigated single grain boundaries with different orientations to explain the electronic structure of grain boundaries in chalcopyrites. The CuGaSe 2 - bicrystals containing the grain boundaries were grown via MOCVD and MBE using GaAs-bicrystals as substrates. The orientation of the grain boundaries were determined by EBSD. It was possible to grow two different kinds of grain boundaries namely a Σ 3 ({ 112 }tet plane) and a Σ 9 ({ 111 }tet plane) grain boundary. The electronic properties of the grain boundaries were measured by KPFM and Hall measurements. KPFM measurements probe the electrostatic field of the grain boundary, whereas Hall measurements probe the barrier for majority charge carriers. The measurements showed that chalcopyrites have both neutral (Σ 3) and charged (Σ 9) grain boundaries and that a typical grain boundary does not exist. The whole barrier is a superposition of two different barriers for both grain boundaries. And a rectangular barrier between 170 meV and 350 meV is necessary to explain their high resistivity. One explanation for this barrier is a band offset caused by the predicted cooper depletion. Scattering potentials at the gain boundary could be an alternative reason for the rectangular barrier. The source of such scattering potential could be phonon scattering, impurity scattering or scattering results from potential fluctuations. The difference between the grain boundaries is the second barrier which, in the case of the Σ 3 grain boundary, also is a band offset of around 30 meV that is most likely caused by a copper depletion. As for the Σ 9 grain boundary, space charge region causes the second barrier of around 110 me...|$|R
40|$|The {{flip chip}} {{packaging}} {{has become one}} of the most popular electronics packaging technologies for all kinds of applications. For high end applications like central processing units (CPU), the flip chip packaging technology demonstrates its distinctive advantage of high efficiency to dissipate heat from the silicon chip. Flip chip packages have also received tremendous interests for low end applications such as watch modules and smart card due to their light weight and thin package profiles for low cost applications. Fiber reinforced organic substrates are commonly employed to lower the material costs. This raises concerns on mechanical and thermal mismatches between the silicon chip and the organic substrate. The consequence is that there are significant stress concentrations in the solder joints due to the difference in dimensional changes between the silicon chip and the organic substrate during thermal cycles. To reduce the relative displacements and to redistribute the stress over the entire package, an underfill resin is encapsulated along the gap between the chip and the substrate as a stress buffer. The introduction of an underfill in the package also raises other reliability issues, for example, weak interfacial adhesion between package components, process-induced residual stress as during assembly, proper selection of component materials etc. The objective of the present thesis is to gain some new insights into the above underfill-related reliability issues in flip chip packages. To measure the interfacial adhesion between the underfill and other package components, the button shear tests were performed and the corresponding failure behaviors were characterized. The correlations between the elements obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the thermodynamic characteristics determined from the contact angle measurement were established. The UV/Ozone treatment on the polymeric soldermask surface offered the possibility of further enhancement of the adhesion with the underfill material. The interfacial adhesion between the underfill and other components were also characterized. The interfacial adhesion of underfill with eutectic solder was far weaker than the other interfaces, indicating the necessity to treat the solder surface to improve the <b>bond.</b> <b>Incomplete</b> filling of the underfill, either due to flux residue, entrapped gas altered the mode of solder joint failure from hydrostatic fatigue cracking to plastic deformation. An optimized UV/Ozone treatment on polymeric soldermask surface enhanced the interfacial bond strength with underfill resin. The bi-material strip bending (BMSB) method has been successfully developed to in-situ monitor the evolution of the residual stresses in epoxy-based underfill resins during curing and thermal cycles. The residual stress in the silica filled conventional underfill was higher than that of the rubber modified no-flow underfill. The importance of the properties of underfill, such as modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), in governing its residual stress after cure were discussed. Isothermal contraction of epoxy is also noticed during thermal cycles at temperature below the glass transition temperature. The numerical model based on the time-temperature dependent underfill material is compared with that based on the linear elastic underfill material. The importance of material properties of package components, such as the moduli and CTEs of the underfill, solder and PCB, in reducing the stress concentrations is highlighted. The effect of process-induced defects in the underfill layers is also studied. Thermo-elastic modeling of underfill behavior underestimate the stress and strain levels in the solder joints, due to the underestimate of the relaxation of polymeric underfill. The rigidity of PCB substrate also influenced significantly the lifetime of solder interconnection.
