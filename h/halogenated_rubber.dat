50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, <b>halogenated</b> butyl <b>rubber</b> (halobutyl) was developed, in its {{chlorinated}} (chlorobutyl) and brominated (bromobutyl) variants, providing {{significantly higher}} curing rates and allowing covulcanization with other rubbers such as natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. Halobutyl is today {{the most important}} material for the inner linings of tubeless tires.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Rubber/clay nanocomposites {{have been}} {{explored}} as alternative materials to replace expensive <b>halogenated</b> butyl <b>rubber.</b> In order to further improve their gas barrier properties, {{a simple and}} efficient method through sulfur modification was applied in this work. Excess sulfur was added into SBR/clay nanocompound to prepare sulfur modified nanocomposite via the formation of cyclic sulfide in addition to crosslinking. The vulcanization behavior, mechanical properties, dynamic mechanical property and gas barrier property of the nanocomposites were investigated. It {{was found that the}} sulfur modified SBR/clay nanocomposites showed much increased glass transition temperature and lower gas permeability...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} high energy {{radiation}} on <b>halogenated</b> butyl <b>rubbers</b> was studied using electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and gas chromatography. During high energy irradiation, most of the radicals {{were found to be}} generated on the halogenated isoprene units. A higher radiation yield for scission was observed in chlorinated butyl rubber than in brominated butyl rubber. This is due to the ready abstraction of hydrogen from the main chain by the chlorine radicals to give main-chain radicals which are known to contribute to scission in butyl rubbers. However, in both polymers, crosslinking predominates over scission up to a limiting dose...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) rates in aquatic environments are {{often based on}} the incubation of water samples, during which the consumption of methane (CH 4) is monitored. Typically, incubation vessels are sealed with butyl rubber because these elastomers are essentially impermeable for gases. We report on the potential toxicity of five different commercially available, lab-grade butyl stoppers on MOx activity in samples from marine and lacustrine environments. MOx rates in incubations sealed with non-halogenated butyl were > 50 % lower compared to parallel incubations with <b>halogenated</b> butyl <b>rubber</b> stoppers, suggesting toxic effects {{associated with the use}} of the non-halogenated butyl type. Aqueous extracts of non-halogenated butyl rubber were contaminated with high amounts of various organic compounds including potential bactericides such as benzyltoluenes and phenylalkanes. Comparably small amounts of organic contaminants were liberated from the <b>halogenated</b> butyl <b>rubber</b> stoppers but only two halogenated stopper types were found that did not seem to leach any organics into the incubation medium. Furthermore, the non-halogenated and two types of the halogenated butyl elastomers additionally leached comparably high amounts of zinc. While the source of the apparent toxicity with the use of the non-halogenated rubber stoppers remains elusive, our results indicate that leaching of contaminants from some butyl rubber stoppers can severely interfere with the activity of MOx communities, highlighting the importance of testing rubber stoppers for their respective contamination potential. The impact of leachates from butyl rubber on the assessment of biogeochemical reaction rates other than MOx seems likely but needs to be verified...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Tyre inner tubes made of butyl rubber {{have been found to}} have poor heat resistance when used in the environment of Iraq. Research investigations were undertaken to establish the causes of the problem: these consisted of examining the individual contributions of oxidative scission processes in both rubber hydrocarbon and the various processing oils. The principal method used to monitor the degradation processes was ageing in hot air using the reduction in strength for the rubber and change in chemical composition of the processing oils. This preliminary study established that the processing oil made in Iraq was found to be of different composition from the common European rubber processing oils and contributed considerably to the poor life of the butyl inner tubes. Analysis of the oil from Iraq identified the presence of trace amounts of copper (3 ppm) known, from the literature, to adversely affect the resistance of many rubbers to elevated temperatures and, as found in this work, to also degrade butyl rubber. Replacement of the butyl rubber by chlorobutyl rubber overcame the problem of inner tube degradation and an antioxidant system based on a combination of an acetone/diphenylamine (ADPA) plus mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) with MgO was found effective in minimising chlorobutyl inner tube degradation. However, unexpectedly, the research also established that trace quantities of copper were useful as stabilisers in enhancing the heat ageing properties of chlorobutyl rubber and the addition of a particular copper salt (copper sulphatel in small proportions (3 ppm) as an anti-degradant was found beneficial. Another method studied to improve the resistance of <b>halogenated</b> butyl <b>rubber</b> to heat induced oxidative degradation tried to use ZnO as the curative, as recommended by the manufacturers of chlorobutyl rubber; however it was found that with this technique higher degradation was obtained in chlorobutyl than with the standard ZnO/ sulphurless curing system (i. e. ZnO/TMTDin proportions 5 : 1 phr). It was concluded from these studies that: 1. Reducing the oil level in butyl inner tubes from 25 phr to 15 phr enhances heat ageing properties of the rubber. Factory trials confirmed this finding. 2. Adding a copper inhibitor (ZDC) in the proportions 1 - 2 phr in butyl inner tubes was found successful in minimising oxidative degradation. 3. The existence of elemental copper in a chlorobutyl inner tube rubber formulation in the proportion 3 ppm improved the rubber properties at elevated temperatures...|$|R
50|$|The use of accelerators and {{activators}} {{lowers the}} activation energy of vulcanization reaction to 80-125kJ/Mole from 210kJ/Mole which is necessary {{if we use}} ‘Sulphur’ alone. Accelerators and activators break sulphur chains. Accelerated sulphur vulcanization systems require only 5-15 sulphur atoms per cross-link as compared to 40-45 S atoms/crosslink for a non-accelerated sulphur vulcanization.There are many accelerators available for the vulcanization of rubber. That is {{because there is a}} wide range of rubber articles on the market {{with a wide variety of}} properties. For instance in a car tire alone there can be already up to eight different rubber compounds, each with specific properties. For instance the tread in a typical passenger car tire consists of a mixture of SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber) and BR (butadiene rubber). This rubber should have high abrasion resistance and high grip on both dry and wet roads. The side wall of the tire should have a high flexibility, meaning that it should resist many flexings during the running of the tire without cracking. It consists normally of a mixture of natural rubber and butadiene rubber. Inside the tire there is a rubber compound with as major function the adhesion between rubber and the steel cord of the belt. It typically consists of natural rubber with a very high sulfur level (up to 8 phr), to get a relatively stiff rubber, with sulfur promoting the adhesion with the steel cord. The basis of the tire is formed by the carcass, normally a mixture of NR (natural rubber), SBR and BR. It should have a very good adhesion to the polyester cord, used as reinforcement.And the inner side of the tire is formed by the inner liner, normally consisting of <b>halogenated</b> butyl <b>rubber</b> (IIR)For all these compounds with their different properties different accelerators and mixtures of accelerators have to be used to obtain the required properties.A vulcanization accelerator is typically used in combination with sulfur as the cross-linker, and with zinc oxide and stearic acid as activators. Other additives can be added too, but for the cross-linking reaction the abovementioned ones are the most important.The various types of rubber used in the various tire compounds all have different vulcanization characteristics, like speed of cure (cure is the crosslinking reaction) and extent of cure (the number of cross-links). A typical passenger car tire is vulcanized for 10 minutes at 170 degrees C. This means that all the different compounds have to be cured to their optimum state of cure in this same 10 minutes. This is the reason why a lot of different accelerators or mixtures thereof are used in the same tire.|$|R
