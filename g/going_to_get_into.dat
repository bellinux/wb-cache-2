500|$|On April 8 or 12, the {{government}} capitulated. Low's Alberta Social Credit Act delivered what the insurgents wanted, including {{the creation of}} [...] "Alberta credit" [...] {{in the amount of}} [...] "the unused capacity of industries and people of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services", the establishment of [...] "credit houses" [...] to distribute this credit, {{and the creation of a}} Social Credit Board. The bill was passed, and the insurgents were placated, though Brown warned during a cross-province speaking tour that they were determined to see social credit implemented, and [...] "if anyone gets in our way, he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> trouble... we must choose between principles and party, between Social Credit and Premier Aberhart." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, {{head of the}} American Family Association (AFA), {{alleged that}} [...] "The Littlest Tramp" [...] {{depicted}} cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy. The AFA, during its incarnation as the National Federation for Decency, had previously targeted CBS as an [...] "accessory to murder" [...] after a mother killed her daughter following an airing of [...] Concerning Bakshi's involvement with Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures, the AFA claimed that CBS [...] "intentionally hired a known pornographer to do a cartoon for children, and then allowed him to insert {{a scene in which}} the cartoon hero is shown sniffing cocaine." [...] Bakshi responded, [...] "You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> who sniffs what. This is lunacy!" [...] On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage. Wildmon claimed that the edits were [...] "a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine". Despite receiving an award from Action for Children's Television, favorable reviews, and a ranking in Time magazine's [...] "Best of '87" [...] feature, Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures was canceled by CBS following the controversy.|$|E
2500|$|Following Rae's statement, Harper's {{spokesman}} Kory Teneycke {{dismissed the}} issue as irrelevant, saying [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a debate about a five-year-old speech that was delivered three Parliaments ago, two elections ago, when the prime minister {{was the leader of}} a party that no longer exists".|$|E

2500|$|The early Game Theory was {{described}} as a [...] "pseudo-psychedelic pop quartet" [...] for which Miller sang and wrote [...] "almost all of the material." [...] On the first three releases, Miller shared co-writing credits on [...] "The Young Drug" [...] with Alternate Learning's Carolyn O'Rourke, and on [...] "Life in July" [...] with Nancy Becker. Miller also included three songs that were written by Fred Juhos, and later defended the decision to record Juhos's songs as a Beatles-like [...] "relief from seriousness," [...] though only one was included in the Distortion of Glory compilation. Juhos's contributions were criticized as failing to mesh with Miller's, and Miller later mused, [...] "It's funny that his stuff wasn't popular. We all had the impression that no one was ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> my stuff and that his one or two would be the ones to catapult us to fame." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to October 2012, Deep Purple {{had never}} been {{nominated}} for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013. Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee. Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees. There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, [...] "they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? ...And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? ...the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions." [...] Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement for the non-induction of Deep Purple; [...] "The {{list of people who}} haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling.. big one for me is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?". Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction. In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language...'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?" [...] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: [...] "that Deep Purple are not in it [...] It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1958, George Love {{decided he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>into</b> business. Already a multimillionaire, he {{became a member of}} the board of {{directors}} of Chrysler, which had suffered in losing a large portion of the automobile market after World War II. In 1961, Love selected Lynn A. Townsend as president of the company, and Chrysler's fortunes were quickly reversed. Even in the 1940s, Love's coal companies were heavily invested in Chrysler, owning almost 8 percent of the automaker's stock. Eventually Love became chairman of the board in 1965, where he remained until his second retirement in 1970.|$|R
50|$|After {{two seasons}} in the {{basement}} division of the Football League, some Town fans were wondering if Town were ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>into</b> at least the Third Division. Town reverted to their blue and white striped kit, after {{two years in the}} all-blue kit. But, {{at the start of the}} season, it seemed to be a curse, with Town winning none of their first eight matches, which unsurprisingly saw John Haselden <b>get</b> demoted <b>to</b> coach, which saw Tom Johnston return to the hotseat at Leeds Road for a record third time. Town went on a six match unbeaten run, but then Town seemed to go for the rest on the season in a complete mix of mediocrity.|$|R
