5000|$|Ddwng's people, though scientifically advanced, have tastes Colene {{describes}} as [...] "lowbrow American." [...] In addition, {{the more powerful}} members of the mode seem quite ruthless and cruel: in the past, they had attempted to conquer their neighboring modes in order to exploit their resources. Due to these actions, a confederation of other modes confined the DoOon to their <b>home</b> <b>mode</b> and prevented their use of Virtual Mode chips. Leaders possess pain dials {{that can be used}} to cause pain directly to the nervous system of anyone within the radius of the possessor. Pain dial levels are graded, rather like Star Trek phasers or The Machine in The Princess Bride.|$|E
50|$|Colene quickly seizes the {{opportunity}} to become an anchor person and sets out along her side of the Virtual Mode. On her way, she befriends Seqiro, a telepathic stallion and, to Colene's joy and surprise, another anchor. As Sequiro joins her in traveling the Virtual Mode, she opens up to him and reveals the source of her depressive and suicidal nature; she had been raped at a party by several older boys but did not report the incident out of fear of humiliation and because she had become drunk during the party. The two make rapid progress towards Darius' mode until they are unexpectedly trapped in DoOon, <b>home</b> <b>mode</b> of the emperor Ddwng, who is the anchor for his world. Forced to suffer captivity thinly veiled as hospitality, Colene and Seqiro must wait for Darius to arrive.|$|E

While usually thought of as geographic, home may be photographic as well, unconfined to a specific place, but transportable within the space of imagination. (Moran 2002, 61) But the most crucial thing to note is that the question of this space is raised within the space itself—that the agents have points of view on this objective space which depend on their position within it and in which their will to transform or conserve it is often expressed.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp <b>home</b> <b>mode</b> and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|E
50|$|The {{injection}} of fuel or the quantity of injected fuel has a decisive influence on engine starting, idling, power and emissions. The engine ECU is programmed ("mapped") with relevant data to where the fuel rack position has an equivalent signal {{for the amount of}} fuel being injected. The driver requests the torque or engine speed requirements via accelerator pedal potentiometer thereby sending a signal to the engine ECU which then, depending on its mapping and data collected from various sensors, calculates in real time the quantity of injected fuel required, thus altering the fuel rack to the required position.The driver can also input additional commands such as idle speed increase to compensate e.g. for PTO operation which can be either variably set or has a preset speed which can be recalled. The road speed function can be used to evaluate vehicle speed and possibly activate a speed limiter (Heavy Vehicles), or maintain or restore a set speed (cruise control). Further functions can include exhaust brake operation which, when activated, will result in the fuel pump rack position being set to zero delivery or idle. The engine ECU can also interface with various other vehicle systems e.g. traction control and carry out self monitoring duties and self diagnostic functions to keep the system working at an optimal level. To ensure the safe operation in case of failure, the limp <b>home</b> <b>mode</b> functions are also integrated into the system, e.g. should the pump speed sensor fail the ECU can use an alternator speed signal function for engine RPMs counter as a backup signal.|$|E

30|$|A typical usage {{scenario}} {{for a home}} eNB enabled RN {{is to use the}} wireless backhaul connections for RT services with very strict QoS requirements while using the Internet for NRT services and for RT services with more relaxed QoS requirements. This {{is due to the fact}} that the operator has full control over the different (wireless) networks available for the backhaul link, but not on the Internet. Notable latency may be expected due to the longer path needed for the packets if the RN is operating as a home eNB for the first two options. For example in the uplink, in the home eNB case the path is UE-RN-GAN-Gateways while for the first and second options (in the <b>home</b> eNB <b>mode),</b> it will be UE-RN-GAN-donor eNB-GAN-Gateways. That is, option 1 and <b>home</b> eNB <b>mode</b> of option 2 are more suitable for NRT services or RT services with relaxed QoS requirements, while the normal relay mode of option 2 (and to some extent, option 3) is more suitable for RT services with strict QoS requirements.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Diminishing {{partnership}} or musharakah mutanaqisah {{contract in}} home financing is recently {{introduced by the}} Islamic banking industry as an alternative of the bay bithaman ajil contract which has received many criticism from shariah scholars as mimicking conventional loan. This study aims to examine customers attitude upon diminishing partnership home financing and their intention to subscribe into the financing scheme. Approach: This study gauges customers perception on the salient features of diminishing partnership home financing from Islamic banks through a survey of 504 respondents comprise officers, managers and academician in Kuala Lumpur. The structural equation modeling was utilized to find out factors that influence customers intention for diminishing partnership home financing under {{the framework of the}} theory of reasoned action. Results: The main finding indicates that customers perceived the equity sharing features in diminishing partnership <b>home</b> financing <b>mode</b> differ from the conventional loan and other existing Islamic <b>home</b> financing <b>modes.</b> The result from structural equation modeling shows that customers intention for diminishing partnership is more influenced by their subjective norms compared to their attitude toward diminishing partnership home financing. Conclusion: The customers have perceived diminishing partnership as more shariah compliant than bay bithaman ajil. Afterwards, opinions from people perceived important by customers are giving more influence towards their decision making process...|$|R
