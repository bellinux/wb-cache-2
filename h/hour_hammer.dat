50|$|On January 2, 1993, Van Hammer lost to Tony Atlas in {{the quarterfinals}} of a tournament for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship on Saturday Night. A day later he lost to World Heavyweight Champion Big Van Vader {{on a house}} show in Bristol, TN, after which he took time off to have surgery to repair the broken nose {{that he had been}} wrestling with, causing him to miss the Thunderdome match at the Clash of the Champions on January 13. He would be out for a month before {{returning}} on the February 9th taping of WCW Power <b>Hour.</b> <b>Hammer</b> continued to be a mainstay on Saturday Night, winning the majority of his matches. At the first-ever Slamboree pay-per-view, Van Hammer lost his match with Sid Vicious in only 35 seconds.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Unreal Tournament {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, earning {{an overall}} score of 92 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. Mainstream press reviews lauded the title for its graphics, gameplay, and level design. Computer and Video Games concluded [...] "Unreal Tournament {{is nothing short}} of a technical and game-playing marvel destined to hold you - as it did us - wailing with happiness and wasting far too many precious <b>hours</b> <b>hammering</b> keyboards. An absolute joy to behold." [...] In March 2000, Unreal Tournament was second on a list of best-selling games in Computer Dealer News trade magazine. However, the development team believed sales would have been higher if the game was released in October 1999.|$|R
5000|$|This hour-marker {{is called}} an hour-measure; each <b>hour</b> a <b>hammer</b> strikes the bell, {{measuring}} and counting {{the hours of}} the night and of the day [...] [...] [...] No man strikes it, but it is somehow wondrous strangely fashioned to look like a man and sound and move of itself, by man's cunning, with great invention and cleverness. A description of Lazar's clock ...|$|R
60|$|For half an <b>hour</b> Amos Green <b>hammered</b> {{and trimmed}} and caulked, while the sharp {{measured}} clanking of the pumps sounded above the dash of the seas. Slowly, very slowly, the bows of the brigantine were settling down, and her stern cocking up.|$|R
50|$|The cathedral is {{dedicated}} to Saint Alan of Lavaur. The present structure dates from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, and has an octagonal bell-tower. A second, smaller square tower contains a 16th-century jaquemart (a statue which strikes the <b>hours</b> with a <b>hammer).</b> In the bishop's garden is the statue of Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases, one of the companions of Napoleon on Saint Helena.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} half an <b>hour</b> Jerry had <b>hammered</b> the key clear, but {{he could}} not draw it out. A dozen times it seemed that he must give up in despair, that all the danger and toil he had gone through were for nothing. Then an idea came to him, and he went through his pockets with feverish haste, and found what he sought--a ten-penny nail.|$|R
50|$|From 1317 {{till the}} French Revolution Lavaur was {{the seat of}} a bishopric; Lavaur Cathedral, {{dedicated}} to Saint Alan, was built for this purpose, dating from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, with an octagonal bell-tower. A second, smaller square tower contains a jaquemart (a statue which strikes the <b>hours</b> with a <b>hammer)</b> of the 16th century. In the bishops garden is the statue of Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases, one of the companions of Napoleon at Saint Helena.|$|R
6000|$|By {{night it}} was clearer, and Maybole more visible than during the day. Clouds coursed over the sky in great masses; the full moon battled the other way, and lit up the snow with gleams of flying silver; the town came down the hill in a cascade of brown gables, bestridden by smooth white roofs, and {{spangled}} here and there with lighted windows. At either end the snow stood {{high up in the}} darkness, on the peak of the Tolbooth and among the chimneys of the Castle. As the moon flashed a bull's-eye glitter across the town between the racing clouds, the white roofs leaped into relief over the gables and the chimney-stacks, and their shadows over the white roofs. In the town itself the lit face of the clock peered down the street; an <b>hour</b> was <b>hammered</b> out on Mr. Geli's bell, and from behind the red curtains of a public-house some one trolled out--a compatriot of Burns, again!--"The saut tear blin's my e'e." ...|$|R
5000|$|Octavius Morgan made {{a number}} of generous {{donations}} to the British Museum including this automaton in 1866. Historically, it is believed to be an artefact mentioned in an inventory of the Grünes Gewölbe treasury of Augustus, Elector of Saxony of Dresden in 1585. It had been thought to have been owned by Rudolf II. The inventory records"A gilded ship, skilfully made, with a quarter and full hour striking clock, which is to be wound every 24 hours. Above with three masts, in the crows' nests of which the sailors revolve and strike the quarters and <b>hours</b> with <b>hammers</b> on the bells. Inside, the Holy Roman Emperor sits on the Imperial throne, and in front of him pass the seven electors with heralds, paying homage as they receive their fiefs. Furthermore ten trumpeters and a kettle-drummer alternately announce the banquet. Also a drummer and three guardsmen, and sixteen small cannons, eleven of which may be loaded and fired automatically." ...|$|R
2500|$|Further {{extensions}} to the South Dock {{were opened}} in 1907 and 1914. The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during {{construction of the}} new south lock connecting the South Dock to the Severn Estuary, supporting timbers in an excavation trench collapsed and buried 46 workers. The rescuers included 12-year-old paper boy Thomas ‘Toya’ Lewis who was small enough to crawl into the collapsed trench. Lewis worked for two <b>hours</b> with <b>hammer</b> and chisel in an attempt to free one of those trapped who was released the next day. Several hundred pounds was later raised through public subscription in gratitude for the boy's efforts, and he was sent on an engineering scholarship to Scotland. Lewis was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King Edward VII in December 1909. A Wetherspoons pub in the city centre is named [...] "The Tom Toya Lewis" [...] after the young hero. The building in which the pub is housed was formerly the Newport YMCA, the Foundation Stone for which was laid by Viscount Tredegar, also in 1909.|$|R
500|$|Jayson Rodriguez of MTV {{praised the}} song, {{reporting}} [...] "this all-star cipher is a backpackers dream as Ye's GOOD Music soldiers fire away with resolve. But the Brooklyn icon, Jay-Z, steals {{the show with}} an edgy verse dismissing his critics with a 16 that's as pushy as a New Yorker during rush <b>hour.</b> Please, <b>Hammer,</b> stop replying." [...] Slant Magazine's Cole Mathews thought that the song returned West to his hard rap origins, commenting [...] "with the posse cuts 'Monster' and 'So Appalled', Kanye kicks out the two hardest rap tracks of his career." [...] Becky Bain of Idolater described the song as a [...] "dramatic, gloomy epic of a tune that has each artist taking turns at the mic." [...] He expressed that trying to find Kanye's verse was [...] "virtually a musical Where's Waldo". It was noted for its impressive roster of features and was described as [...] "another Kanye West-helmed all-star collabo" [...] by MTV's Hawuse Ziegbe. He noted that Cyhi managed to hold his own against several much more regarded rappers. Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes described the song as a super-sized cypher, stating that the track was packed with plenty of [...] "shitalking" [...] from the group of rappers.|$|R
50|$|After rolling, {{the ribbon}} of gold is cut into one-inch squares. The {{first step in}} the beating process is called the cutch. The cutch is made up of {{approximately}} 150 skins. In {{the early days of the}} trade, ox intestine membrane (Goldbeater's skin) was used to interleave the gold as it was beaten. Today other materials, such as Mylar, are used. Using wooden pincers, the preparer picks up each square of gold and places it in the center of each skin. When the cutch is filled with the small gold squares, it is wrapped in several bands of parchment which serve to hold the packet together during the beating. Parchment is still the best material known to withstand the <b>hours</b> of repeated <b>hammer</b> blows needed to beat the gold.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hammer mill}} boomed during the 16th {{century and the}} forge was reputed to have even made guns for use against the Spanish Armada. The waters of the Tillingbourne powered the water wheel which drove the massive, 400 kg, trip hammer of the forge. The forge closed in 1787 despite {{attempts}} to save or convert it. The clock which overhangs the main road portrays the figure of [...] "Jack the Blacksmith", who strikes the <b>hour</b> with his <b>hammer.</b> The clock bears the motto [...] "By me you know how fast to go". The clock was given {{in memory of the}} first Lord Farrer of Abinger Hall who died in 1899. The clock represents the iron industry and the role played by the county of Surrey in the industrial past.|$|R
50|$|The bombs {{dropped by}} the {{aircraft}} exploded while the submarine was sailing at the periscope depth, and had not damaged Durbo, the submarine then dove down to 35 meters to avoid further attacks by the aircraft. However, {{with the arrival of}} British destroyers situation changed for the worse. At 10:00 the submarine went through the first heavy depth charge attack which damaged her torpedo room and fuel tanks thus making Durbo even more visible to her attackers. Durbo dove down to 58 meters and tried to get away at very low speed. At 13:30 the boat was hit by a second deep charge attack. At 16:30 Durbo went through a third depth charge attack, this time with devastating effect: all the instruments went out, the pumps were damaged. In addition, main propeller shafts were deformed, which made it difficult to maintain propulsion. The consequent flooding through the aft room sunk the stern, until the submarine reached an angle of 20 degrees and Durbo dropped down to 110 meters, thirty meters below her test depth. In addition, the coolant lines were damaged and chloromethane gas started leaking and poisoning the air. At 21:00, after eleven <b>hours</b> of <b>hammering,</b> with the badly damaged boat, continuously rising water, low air reserves and leaking chloromethane gas captain Acanfora ordered the boat to surface. At 21:30 Durbo appeared on the surface and captain Acanfora ordered to abandon the ship, destroy all secret documentation and codes, and scuttle the ship.|$|R
50|$|Martin and Martine are two legendary {{characters}} {{who have come}} to represent the city which they are said to have saved. There are different versions of the story. The most commonly accepted version runs as follows: around the year 1370, at the time of Bishop Robert, Count of Geneva, Martin, a blacksmith of Moorish descent established in Cambrai, was among the burghers who left the city to fight the lord of Thun-Lévêque, who was then reputed to ransom the population around the city and generally to afflict the region. Martin, armed only with his heavy iron hammer, soon {{came face to face with}} the enemy. He dealt such a heavy blow on his opponent's head that, although the helmet of the lord did not break, because it was made of good steel, it was driven down to his eyes. Dazed and blinded, the lord of Thun quickly surrendered. Today the automatons of Martin and Martine, standing at the top of the town hall, strike the <b>hours</b> with a <b>hammer</b> as a reminder of that mighty blow.|$|R
50|$|Tottenham Hotspur {{were the}} next {{visitors}} to Old Trafford {{in a game}} both teams wanted to win - United {{to put pressure on}} Chelsea and Spurs to cement their fourth spot in the League. However, the first half was abysmal, and it was almost 30 minutes before either team had a shot on goal - let alone on target. At the start of the second half, Patrice Evra began vomiting on the pitch, but ultimately stayed on and won a penalty just before the hour mark, which Ryan Giggs scored (Wayne Rooney had picked up a groin injury in training and was ruled out of the match). Ledley King scored with twenty minutes to go to restore parity, but United went back in front ten minutes later after Nani lobbed Heurelho Gomes. Nani was then fouled in the box, giving Giggs his second penalty, which he also scored to give United a 3-1 lead. Nani also began to vomit as injury time came around, but United held on {{to go back to the}} top of the table for 24 <b>hours,</b> before Chelsea <b>hammered</b> Stoke City 7-0 to return to the summit.|$|R
