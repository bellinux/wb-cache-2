50|$|Players {{begin by}} {{creating}} characters {{to play in}} a futuristic interstellar society and then enrolling them in one of the military services: Navy, Army, Scouts, Merchant Marines, and other Services. While in the service, players choose their character's training, provided they qualify for it. Depending upon characters' physical and mental abilities, they may learn such skills as brawling, bribery, swordsmanship, computers, <b>interstellar</b> <b>navigation,</b> spaceship piloting, and so on. Through training and study, characters can also increase their base physical and mental abilities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{issue of}} <b>interstellar</b> <b>navigation</b> is solved {{by the use}} of a {{hyperdrive}} to travel between stars. The player can select a system from the star map and [...] "jump" [...] to it, provided they are reasonably far from a settlement. They then arrive at the outskirts of that star system and must make their way to their destination. A ship's maximum range is calculated according to its mass, so small, light ships can have impressively large ranges. The time taken to travel the maximum range is always exactly one week, with shorter jumps taking less time. Unlike the rest of the game's travel, these jumps are not experienced in some multiple of real time and appear almost instantaneous (theories range from suspended animation to extreme time dilation). A hyperspace jump leaves a visible remnant, a [...] "hyperspace cloud", at the entry and exit points. These are visible for some hours afterwards, ostensibly making it possible for pirates and assassins to track a ship through hyperspace, arrive at its destination first and attack without police intervention.|$|E
40|$|Locally-defined {{parameters}} {{chosen to}} be minimally frame-variant can be useful for describing motion in accelerated frames and in curved spacetimes. In particular the metric-equation's synchrony-free "traveler-point parameters", namely proper-time, plus 3 -vectors proper-velocity and proper-force, are useful in curved spacetime because extended arrays of synchronized clocks (e. g. for local measurement of the denominator in Δ x / Δ t) {{may be hard to}} find. Combined with a recognition of improper (geometric) forces, these same parameters can better prepare intro-physics students for their everyday world, {{as well as for the}} technological world e. g. of GPS systems where differential aging must be considered explicitly. The approach also suggests a traveler-perspective path to 3 -vector simulations that are exact at any speed in flat spacetime, and will soon help frame on-line simulations of <b>interstellar</b> <b>navigation</b> including effects of gravitational fields...|$|E
5000|$|The {{science fiction}} {{computer}} game Space Rogue featured {{the use of}} technologically harnessed wormholes called [...] "Malir gates" [...] as mechanisms for <b>interstellar</b> travel. <b>Navigation</b> through the space within wormholes {{was a part of}} gameplay and had its own perils.|$|R
40|$|<b>Interstellar</b> <b>navigation</b> poses {{significant}} {{challenges in}} all aspects of a spacecraft. One of them is reliable, low-cost, real-time navigation, especially when there is a considerable distance between Earth and the spacecraft in question. In this paper, a complete system for navigation using pulsar radio emissions is described and analysed. The system uses a pulsar‟s emissions in the radio spectrum to create a novel system capable of fully autonomous navigation. The system is roughly divided into two parts, the front - end and the back - end, as well as their subdivisions. The front - end performs initial signal reception and pre-processing. It applies time-based coherent de-dispersion to allow for low-power on-board processing, and uses a very wide bandwidth to limit the required antenna size. As a result, the electronics required performing the processing is complex, but the system is well limited in both size and power consumption...|$|E
40|$|The Background Field Theory (BF Theory) {{was able}} to explain the nature of inertia, {{as well as of}} that of {{gravitational}} and electromagnetic fields. Later, it was revealed to even predict the existence of so called "Torsion Fields. " This would be the first time that all these phenomena were unified in a unique model. Furthermore, it has been recently revealed that Russian astronomers may have already detected the BF during the late 70 's as a radiation or source that is able to produce gravitation. More than 20 years later, this author developed the model of the BF while the Russian evidence of such was still under secrecy after the Cold War. The BF theory makes superfluous the need for time or chronological effects to explain phenomena such as "non-locality " or "entangled particles " because of the unlimited velocity that particles may have in the "diluted " regions of the BF. In the synthesis of the Big Bang theory and BF theory, the origin of the BF has been assigned to a so-called "Primordial Star " (PS), produced by the implosion that might have accompanied the explosion of some initial particle during the Big Bang. Such a PS would be still inside our universe and could be used as "cosmic lighthouse" for future <b>interstellar</b> <b>navigation...</b>|$|E

The system uses a pulsar?s emissions in the radio spectrum to create a novel system capable of fully autonomous navigation. The system is roughly divided into two parts, the front - end and the back - end, as well as their subdivisions. The front - end performs initial signal reception and pre-processing.

As a result, the electronics required performing the processing is complex, but the system is well limited in both size and power consumption. The back-end, in turn, performs advanced nonlinear Kalman filtering and supplies the final navigational product - the systems complete (position and velocity) state vector, as well as the involved uncertainties. Rather uniquely, it uses two inherent signal properties, the Doppler shift and the inherent pulse period slowdown, simultaneously, to obtain both a relative and an absolute estimate of the spacecraft's position. Combined, in the nonlinear Kalman filter, they result in the complete state vector of the system. Performance of the system was analysed and validated using actual telescope data from the LOFAR array. The results show that the front-end can indeed receive and process even a very weak signal from an actual pulsar, while the back-end can output a navigational product despite significant random noise in the signal data received from the front-end.
