5|$|On 17 June 1942, Marseille {{claimed his}} 100th aerial victory. He was the 11th Luftwaffe pilot {{to achieve the}} century mark. Marseille then {{returned}} to Germany for two months leave and the following day was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. On 6 August, he began his journey back to North Africa accompanied by his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper. On 13 August, he met Benito Mussolini in Rome and was presented with the highest Italian military award for bravery, the Medaglia d'Oro al Valor Militare. While in Italy Marseille disappeared for some time prompting the German authorities to compile a missing persons report, submitted by the Gestapo head in Rome, Herbert Kappler. He was finally located. According to rumours he had run off with an Italian girl and was eventually persuaded {{to return to his}} unit. Unusually, nothing was <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> about the incident and no repercussions were visited upon Marseille for this indiscretion.|$|E
5|$|Various wuxia {{novels and}} folk legends have endowed Zhou with {{different}} kinds of martial and supernatural skills. These range from mastery of the bow, double broadswords, and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong and even x-ray vision. Practitioners of Eagle Claw, Chuojiao and Xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with Yue Fei, the supposed progenitor of these styles. He is also linked to Northern Praying Mantis boxing via Lin Chong and Yan Qing. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing. However, the oldest historical record that mentions his name only says he taught archery to Yue Fei. Nothing is <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> about him knowing or teaching a specific style of Chinese martial arts.|$|E
25|$|It {{was at a}} meeting, {{just before}} the Six Day War. It was a meeting in New York, and I {{had to make a}} speech. Before that, the Holocaust had never been {{essential}} to my ideology. However, when the chairman said, 'You've got to face it,' I had to face it. I said the most important thing I <b>ever</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E

Black denies the allegation. Critics have suggested this may be going too far in putting political decisions {{in the hands of}} privately owned corporations. The company denies this was <b>ever</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nowhere has Channel Nine {{ever talked}} the one-day game down, nowhere have we <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> {{this is a}} 'B team'. It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights {{to the people who}} know what they're talking about. I reckon he's got his hands full as it is. He needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. And he needs to understand where his money's coming from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} in the early 1980s of 610 undergraduate women {{asked if they had}} <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> no to sex, even though they fully intended to have sexual intercourse. The majority, 68.5% of these women answered 'no' when their intention was 'maybe'. The other 39.3% answered that when they have said 'no' really meant 'yes'. The explanations in support of their answers were that they were fearful of being considered promiscuous. Some claimed they were inhibited about sex. Others answered that they intended to manipulate the male because they were angry, wanted him to become more aroused or more aggressive.|$|E

25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

500|$|In a {{prominently}} placed TV interview , Andreas von Bülow {{said it was}} a [...] "Medienmasche" [...] (media scam) {{to accuse}} him of anti-Semitism. He denied that he <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> or believed anything about [...] "Jews" [...] being warned of the attacks (one of the urban legends). He said such claims were nonsense. He confirmed, however, that in his opinion a number of indications exist which point to some sort of connection between the Israeli Mossad and the act and perpetrators of 9/11.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez {{believed}} {{that most of}} the information available on Bolívar was one-dimensional: [...] "No one <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> in Bolívar's biographies that he sang or that he was constipated... but historians don't say these things because they think they are not important." [...] In the epilogue to the novel, García Márquez writes that he researched the book for two years; the task was difficult, both because of his lack of experience in conducting historical research, and the lack of documentary evidence for the events of the final period of Bolívar's life.|$|E

I {{think he was}} that type of leader who just loved his guys, and getting the nod to play this guy was something special." [...] Prior to production of the film, Kitsch prepared for the role by performing high-intensity workouts with body armor and long runs with a 40-lb weighted vest.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't {{fuck with}} the formula" [...] is a quote and subject of {{controversy}} {{attributed to the}} Beach Boys' lyricist and co-lead vocalist Mike Love circa 1967. Love called it the [...] "most famous thing I've <b>ever</b> <b>said,</b> even though I never said it." [...] It originates from a 1971 Rolling Stone magazine article written by freelancer Tom Nolan, in which business associate David Anderle reported disagreements from within the Beach Boys' circle. According to Anderle, Love wanted the band to remain profitable for himself—"and don't fuck with the formula." [...] In the ensuing decades, the line has been repeated in myriad books, articles, websites, and blogs.|$|E
500|$|Others saw it differently. When the 1954 Venice Film Festival jury awarded La Strada the Silver Lion while {{ignoring}} Luchino Visconti's Senso, a physical brawl broke out when Visconti's assistant Franco Zeffirelli started blowing a whistle during Fellini's acceptance speech, {{only to be}} attacked by Moraldo Rossi. The disturbance left Fellini pale and shaken and Masina in tears. Marxist critics such as Guido Aristarco rejected the film on ideological grounds, particularly objecting to what they considered Christian notions of conversion and redemption: [...] "We don't say, nor have we <b>ever</b> <b>said,</b> that La Strada is a badly directed and acted film. We have declared, and do declare, that it is wrong; its perspective is wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|The Timothy Everest brand {{has three}} levels of tailoring. 'Bespoke' is aimed at young {{professionals}} with the means to purchase bespoke tailoring, but not necessarily the desire to visit Savile Row. Each customer is measured for an individual pattern to be hand-cut, from which their chosen cloth is cut and sewn by hand. Although still hand made, 'Made-to-measure' garments use existing 'house' patterns, adapted to the customer's measurements. The 'Ready-to-wear' collection is sold in-house, at Everest's Mayfair branch, and in Japan. Emphasising his Savile Row background, <b>Everest</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We are tailors who design, not designers who discovered tailoring".|$|R

500|$|Scenes {{set in the}} House of Commons {{chamber and}} {{committee}} rooms use the actual words as recorded in Hansard. In other scenes Morgan utilised dramatic licence, conceding {{that there was no}} evidence to suggest that any of the lines spoken elsewhere in the film were <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> in real life. The relationship between Brown and Blair received many thematic analogies; Morgan likened Brown's story to a [...] "tragedy of an over-qualified Scot, who the Labour Party probably rightly felt at the time that it could not have as its leader."; Despite the quote {{at the head of the}} film referring to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Frears wryly likened Brown and Blair to Beavis and Butt-head. Producer Christine Langan alluded to both Shakespearean and Biblical themes, painting Brown and Blair as Cain and Abel.|$|E
500|$|The MGM moguls {{were careful}} {{to protect their}} {{contract}} big stars from controversy, and Tracy wished to conceal his relationship with Hepburn from his wife, so it was hidden from the public. The couple did not live together until {{the final years of}} Tracy's life, when they shared a cottage on George Cukor's estate in Beverly Hills. In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on State of the Union, later said: [...] "We all knew, but nobody <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> anything. In those days it wasn't discussed." [...] Tracy was not someone to express his emotions, but friend Betsy Drake believed he [...] "was utterly dependent upon Hepburn." [...] Tracy's infidelity apparently continued, however, and he is reported to have had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of Plymouth Adventure in 1952.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews; {{many critics}} praised {{the return of}} Fox Mulder, although others felt that the episode had various plot holes and was overcomplicated. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave [...] "Deadalive" [...] a full five stars and called its humor and simplistic plot the [...] "icing on the cake." [...] They praised its stylistic difference from the preceding episode, [...] "This Is Not Happening", which they described as [...] "atmospheric and doom-laden". The two called [...] "Deadalive" [...] a [...] "slice of sci-fi hokum, with action scenes, bits of grisly horror [...] a reexamination of the show's mythology". Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A−" [...] and wrote, [...] "Never go away again, David! I take back everything bad I <b>ever</b> <b>said</b> about you! I love {{you as much as}} ever!" ...|$|E
