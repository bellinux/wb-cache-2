5|$|On May 19, 2015, the {{pipeline}} operators in Midland, Texas remotely detected pressure anomalies {{and shut down}} Line 901 at 11:30am. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department initially responded around 11:40am to a report of a strong smell coming from the area. Fire crews found the crude oil flowing from a <b>drainage</b> <b>culvert</b> that passed under U.S. 101, and into the Pacific Ocean and reported the leak to authorities. Local pipeline workers {{did not know about}} the leak until they were notified by the state parks staff around noon that there was oil in the water. After struggling to find the leaking pipeline, workers located Line 901 where it had leaked and flowed into the storm culvert around 1:30pm. Clean-up efforts didn't begin for 16 to 18 hours.|$|E

50|$|In Southern California, 15 underpasses and <b>drainage</b> <b>culverts</b> were {{observed}} {{to see how}} many animals used them as corridors. They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, mule deer, small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals. Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity also played a role in how much use they got. From this experiment, much was learned about what would constitute a successful habitat corridor (Dole et al. 2003).|$|R
50|$|Once the {{supercell}} was {{overtaken by}} the squall line, it slowed considerably, and the torrential rains caused flash flooding {{and at least}} 13 fatalities. Most of the drownings occurred while attempting to cross flooded roads. Some children died while playing around <b>drainage</b> <b>culverts,</b> and two people died when a roof overloaded with rainwater collapsed. The combination of the heavy rain and hail created a dense mixture of hail and water, blocking drains and making travel difficult, as well as creating a dense fog, adding to {{the severity of the}} floods and hampering rescue efforts.|$|R

50|$|Wooden pipes {{were used}} in London and {{elsewhere}} during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs, which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. They were often used in Montreal and Boston in the 1800s, and built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes, used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes, were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in <b>drainage</b> <b>culverts,</b> storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.|$|R
