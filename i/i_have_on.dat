25|$|Satisfactory {{as it may}} be to note {{his general}} {{acceptance}} for the time being of the proposed relations of France with Arabia, his reference to the future of those relations adumbrates a source of trouble which it will be wise not to ignore. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> more than one occasion brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though it may be to convince France of her mistake, if we do not endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his pacifist upbringing, {{as a young}} freedom fighter, Wali Khan seemed exasperated {{with the}} pacifism {{advocated}} by his father. He was to later explain his frustration to Gandhi, in a story he told Muklaika Bannerjee, [...] "If the cook comes to slaughter this chicken's baby, is non-violence {{on the part of}} the chicken likely to save the younger life?" [...] The story ended with a twinkle in his eye when he remembered Gandhiji's reply, [...] "Wali, you seem to have done more research on violence than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> non-violence." [...] His first wife died in 1949 while Wali Khan was in prison. In 1954, he married Nasim Wali Khan, the daughter of an old Khudai Khidmatgar activist.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the 1992 {{election}} MacKenzie {{used the}} front-page headline [...] "If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb. While the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place, MacKenzie has claimed his response was: [...] "Prime Minister, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> my desk in front of me a very large bucket of shit which I am just about to pour all over you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Presley {{performed}} the song {{on national television}} three times in 1956. The first was February 11 on Stage Show. He also performed it again on his third appearance on Stage Show on March 17, and again on the Milton Berle Show on April 3. On July 1, Steve Allen introduced Presley on The Steve Allen Show, and Presley, dressed in formal evening wear, said, [...] "I think that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> something tonight that's not quite right for evening wear." [...] Allen asked, [...] "What's that, Elvis?" [...] "Blue suede shoes" [...] was the answer, as he lifted his left foot to show the audience. Presley mentioned blue suede shoes a second time on this show: in a song during the [...] "Range Roundup" [...] comedy skit with Allen, Andy Griffith, and Imogene Coca, he delivered the line, [...] "I'm a-warnin' you galoots, don't step on my blue suede shoes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with New York radio station Hot 97, Schoolboy Q {{talked about the}} album's delay and how Kendrick Lamar's rise has affected him: [...] "It's finally done. He's [...] the reason why I took so long on my album. If {{it was up to}} Interscope, mine would've been out last summer; 2013... But I wanted to perfect my stuff, because I didn't think it was wrapped. I always felt like it was missing three records. Even when I was done with the album, like a lot of these songs that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> this album was made in 2012. I spent the whole 2013 trying to find four to three records that fit the album, that took my album to that level." [...] During the same interview, Schoolboy Q compared the album to Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle; he also admitted he analyzed Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City album as he crafted his own work: [...] "Yes, I studied Kendrick, because {{he is one of the}} heavy hitters in the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{was a poor}} {{state of}} affairs {{considering}} German intelligence sources in Washington, prior to hostilities, had picked up minutely detailed reports on the performance and potential performance of American aircraft. Moreover, {{the capacity of the}} American aircraft industry was heavily documented in open source publications, and General Friedrich von Boetticher, Chief of Source and Information of the German military and air attaché at the Embassy in Washington, had produced a number of these reports on the Boeing B-17 four-engine heavy bomber development, supported by experts in the German aircraft industry, the War Economy and Armaments Office. [...] "Generaloberst" [...] Hans Jeschonnek, the Luftwaffe Chief of Staff, was impressed by these reports and arranged in May 1942 a meeting for Boetticher with Hitler to underline the threat posed by the USAAF. Hitler had then again dismissed the data and agreed with Göring. Jeschonnek despaired. He wrote to General Friedrich von Boetticher:Boetticher, we are lost. For years <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>on</b> the basis of your reports, forwarded demands to Göring and Hitler, but for years my requests for the expansion of the Luftwaffe have not been answered. We no longer have the air defence I requested and which is needed...we no longer have any time...to provide ourselves with the weapons to fight the dreadful threat which you have predicted and reported to us. Then we will be covered from the air with an enemy screen which will paralyze our power to resist.|$|E

2500|$|... "I’m really {{fortunate}} {{to be given the}} crew members that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> this mission. It’s myself and six others. We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
