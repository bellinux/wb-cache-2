He also {{wrote a letter to}} photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world through rose colored glasses but I love people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color." ...|$|E
500|$|Bégin's {{father taught}} his son that his {{best chance of}} making a career in hockey was as a {{defensive}} specialist and impressed on him {{the need for a}} strong work ethic. [...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I really believe that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spirit, the leadership. Pretty amazing what he’s done for us." ...|$|E

500|$|In the book, {{the narrator}} is not only self-aware, but also alert to every detail around her. Pilgrims second chapter defines two types of seeing: as [...] "verbalization" [...] (active) and as [...] "a letting go" [...] (passive). [...] The narrator refers to the {{difference}} between the two methods as [...] "the difference between walking with and without a camera." [...] Whereas the former requires the need to [...] "analyze and pry", the latter only requires rapt attention. [...] The act of seeing is exhaustive and exhausting, as one of the chapters relates: [...] "I look at the water: minnows and shiners. [...] If I am thinking minnows, a carp will fill my brain till I scream. [...] <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water's surface: skaters, bubbles, and leaves sliding down. Suddenly my own face, reflected, startles me witless. [...] Those snails have been tracking my face! Finally, with a shuddering wrench of the will, I see clouds, cirrus clouds. [...] I'm dizzy. I fall in. This looking business is risky." [...] Sandra Johnson refers to the structure of the book itself leading to an epiphany of self-awareness, or a [...] "mystical experience"; as the narrator watches a falling maple key, she feels [...] "lost, sunk ... gazing toward Tinker Mountain and feeling the earth reel down".|$|E
500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{wrote the}} lyric of the 1988 song [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] as a {{meditation}} {{on the idea of}} commitment. He later said, [...] "'s clearly about a younger version of myself and my relationship with Ali," [...] and added that by nature he was a wanderer, not a family man, and that [...] "The only reason I'm here is because I met someone so extraordinary that I just couldn't let that go." [...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono has seemed to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or listen to the radio. There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The {{value of}} Wingate's Chindits has been disputed. Field Marshal William Slim argued that special forces in general had an overall {{negative}} effect on the prosecution of war by separating the best-trained and most committed troops from the main army. [...] However Sir Robert Thompson, a Chindit who went on to become one of [...] "world's leading expert on countering the Mao Tse-tung technique of rural guerrilla insurgency", wrote in his autobiography that [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture of General Slim and his Corps Commanders being knighted by Lord Wavell as Viceroy on the field of battle after Imphal, I see the ghost of Wingate present.

2500|$|In August 2015, Joseph Adinolfi, a {{reporter}} for MarketWatch, reported that China had re-pegged the RMB. In his article, he narrated that [...] "Weak trade data out of China, released over the weekend, weighed on the currencies of Australia and New Zealand on Monday. But the yuan didn’t budge. Indeed, the Chinese currency, {{also known as the}} renminbi, has been remarkably steady over the past month despite the huge selloff in China’s stock market and a spate of disappointing economic data. Market strategists, including Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, and Marc Chandler, head currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said that’s because China’s policy makers have effectively re-pegged the yuan. “When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dollar-renminbi right now, that looks like a fixed exchange rate again. They’ve re-pegged it,” Chandler said." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to penning their own material, Miracles Robinson, White, Rogers, Tarplin, and Moore wrote {{for many of}} their labelmates as well. Motown hits written, but not recorded, {{by members of the}} Miracles include songs for the Temptations ("The Way You Do The Things You Do", [...] "My Girl", [...] "Don't Look Back", [...] "Since I Lost My Baby", [...] "It's Growing", [...] "Get Ready", [...] "My Baby"), Mary Wells ("My Guy", [...] "The One Who Really Loves You", [...] "What Love Has Joined Together", [...] "Two Lovers"), Marvin Gaye ("I'll Be Doggone", [...] "Ain't That Peculiar", [...] "One More Heartache"), the Marvelettes ("Don't Mess With Bill", [...] "My Baby Must Be a Magician", [...] "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game"), The Contours ("First <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Purse), and Brenda Holloway ("When I'm Gone"). Unlike other Motown artists, whose songs were written for them by staff songwriters, the Miracles were one of the few Motown acts that composed their own songs, adding to the group's already impressive reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1962 and 1966, Robinson {{was also}} one of the major songwriters and {{producers}} for Motown, penning several hit singles such as [...] "Two Lovers", [...] "The One Who Really Loves You", [...] "You Beat Me to the Punch" [...] and [...] "My Guy" [...] for Mary Wells; [...] "The Way You Do The Things You Do", [...] "My Girl", [...] "Since I Lost My Baby" [...] and [...] "Get Ready" [...] for the Temptations; [...] "When I'm Gone" [...] and [...] "Operator" [...] for Brenda Holloway; [...] "Don't Mess With Bill", [...] "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game" [...] and [...] "My Baby Must Be a Magician" [...] for the Marvelettes; and [...] "I'll Be Doggone" [...] and [...] "Ain't That Peculiar" [...] for Marvin Gaye. After the arrival of Holland–Dozier–Holland and the team of Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong, he was eclipsed as a top writer and producer for the label, and other Motown artists such as Gaye and Stevie Wonder began to compose more original material. Later in his career, Robinson wrote lyrics and music for the Contours such as [...] "First <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Purse", as well as the Four Tops' [...] "Still Water" [...] and The Supremes' [...] "Floy Joy".|$|E
