40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the determinants of}} inflation in the Egyptian economy. Using annual data, covering the period (1991 - 2012), a Vector Auto Regression Model (VAR) was estimated. The results of the empirical model confirmed that inflation rate responds positively {{in the first period}} following shocks to itself, <b>domestic</b> <b>liquidity</b> growth rate, output gap, exchange rate depreciation, and world food prices. Also, expectations seemed {{to play an important role}} as inflation rate responds positively to a shock in itself in the first year following the shock, which reinforces the idea that inflationary expectations will generate more inflation. In the short run inflation is explained mostly by its own fluctuations followed by output gap, <b>domestic</b> <b>liquidity</b> growth rate, and nominal depreciation of the Egyptian pound against the US dollar, while in a 5 -year horizon about 56 % of inflation dynamics can be attributed to factors other than inflation expectations "itself". ...|$|E
40|$|The {{globalization}} of banking in the United States is influencing the monetary transmission mechanism both domestically and in foreign markets. Using quarterly information from all U.

Results from a cross-sectional analysis indicate that higher levels of illiquidity at home are consistent with higher contributions to price discovery from the foreign market. This relationship holds after controlling for firm size, U. S. share of trading volume, and industry effects.

40|$|How do firms' sales {{interact}} across markets? Are {{foreign and}} domestic sales complements or substitutes? Using a large French firm-level database that combine balance-sheet and product-destination-specific export information over the period 1995 - 2001, we study the interconnections between exports and domestic sales. We identify exogenous shocks that affect firm demand on foreign markets to instrument yearly variations in exports. Our results show that exogenous variations in foreign sales are positively associated with domestic sales, even after controlling for changes in domestic demand. A 10 % exogenous increase in exports generates a 1. 5 to 3 % increase in domestic sales in the short-term. This result is robust to various estimation techniques, instruments, controls, and sub-samples. It is also supported by the natural experiment of the Asian crisis in the late 1990 's.

40|$|The {{present study}} unveils the {{importance}} of regional characteristics of sovereign debt crises in Latin America and South East Asia. It proposes and empirically corroborates a refinement of the logit approach, for assessing sovereign risk, which draws upon a region-specific parameterization—composite estimator. The analysis identifies some common features of debt crises that largely reflect <b>domestic</b> solvency, <b>liquidity</b> factors and, to a lesser extent, trade-balance variables and external shocks. Nonetheless, heterogeneity effects and regional signals point towards the use of region-specific models. Such approach depicts specific risk factors such as openness and debt burden for Latin America and reserves, output and government expenditure for Asia, thereby suggesting distinctive aspects to debt crises. Out-of-sample forecast comparisons further {{support the use of}} the composite estimator. The latter outperforms the simple pooled and random effects approach on the basis of various criteria, albeit slightly biased towards false non-crises predictions.

While a healthy reserve buffer is needed under a fixed exchange rate regime, determining optimal reserve levels is not straightforward. In this paper, we first use several traditional measures of reserves adequacy to compare Jordan''s reserve holdings with other emerging market (EM) countries. Subsequently, we analyze Jordan''s reserve holdings using a reserves-optimizing model, based on Jeanne and Ranciere (2006) (J-R), but extended to allow reserve holdings to influence {{the likelihood of a}} sudden stop.

It emphasises that the quantitative methods used in the monitoring and assessment of systemic liquidity risk are inadequate because they did not signal the liquidity crises ex-post. There are quick gains to be made from augumenting the liquidity risk indicators with more dynamic liquidity stress tests so that compliance will be achieved through lengthening the maturities of both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as opposed to simply holding more liquid assets.

Preliminary econometric analysis shows that the reaction by the PBoC has been strong and swift. The central bank has also become more active in sterilisation operations {{in the last couple of}} years. Nevertheless, it is difficult to judge the effectiveness of these operations in insulating domestic monetary conditions from surges of capital inflows. Although there appears to be little indication that capital inflows have had a causal effect on domestic credit growth, this observation may simply reflect the possibility that there is no effective transmission mechanism between changes in the PBoC's balance sheet and those of the commercial banks. ...|$|E

By careful examination of the results, this study indicates that the value of interest rate changes is significantly associated with shocks that are associated with monetary policy. The monetary sector is heavily influenced by real GDP shock, liquidity, and inflation shock. However, the monetary sector is only slightly affected by the decomposition of the variance of the exchange rate, which is very sensitive to the inflation shock. The study also indicates that the endogenous variables in the value of changes in interest rates and real exchange rate of rupiah will be close to convergence in the long term. The endogenous variables are more susceptible to changes in variables derived from domestic, such as the level of demand for <b>domestic</b> currency <b>liquidity,</b> compared to variables derived from international capital exposure. Thus, the value of the variable interest rate changes can be used to reduce the potential risks derived from domestic money demand shock. </p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{consists}} of the verification {{of the influence of}} currency, more specifically of the money offered in the economic growth of a small open and federated economy as it is the case in Brazils small and middle towns. Therefore, two basic hypotheses were emphasized: endogeny of currency in local economy in interaction with the income stream from and to abroad; and the domestic circulation unsteadiness rate of the currency. Trying to test these hypotheses, real events in a local model of the balance of payments were simulated, trying to verify the impact of the external relations on the internal monetary basis under laboratory conditions. The simulations corroborated a Keynesian hypothesis that currency affects the real part of economy, they confirmed also the endogeny of currency offer in the local economy in this specific case, and pointed to unsteadiness in the domestic circulation rate of the currency.

40|$|During the booms that precede {{crises in}} {{emerging}} economies, policymakers often struggle to limit capital flows and their expansionary consequences. The main policy tool for this task is a sterilization of capital inflows - essentially a swap of international reserves for public bonds. Despite its widespread use, sterilization is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and, in extreme cases, its potential backfiring. We {{argue that these}} concerns are justified when countries experience occasional external crises and domestic financial markets are illiquid. In this context, while standard Mundell-Fleming considerations may determine {{the impact of the}} sterilization on short term peso interest rates, a potentially more powerful and offsetting mechanism is triggered by the anticipated reversal of this policy {{in the event of an}} external crisis. If the instruments used in the sterilization are illiquid or result in fiscal deficits that reduce the liquidity of the private sector, then the effective dollar cost of capital, which considers the whole path of expected future rates, may be lowered rather than raised by this policy. Most importantly, this dollar cost of capital reduction does not reflect a true increase in the country's international liquidity during the external crisis and reversal, as would be the case with a successful sterilization, but just a decline in <b>domestic</b> private <b>liquidity.</b> The impact of the latter on relative asset prices creates a sort of 'international liquidity illusion' which fosters rather than depress aggregate demand, and exacerbates short term capital inflows. ...|$|R
