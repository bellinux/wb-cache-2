5|$|Around {{the time}} of Bannockburn, however, Arundel's loyalty began to shift back towards the king. Edward's {{rapprochement}} towards the earl had in fact started earlier, when on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel's royal debts. The most significant factor in this process though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king's new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking {{over control of the}} government, and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel's situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found <b>himself</b> <b>back</b> in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards in the form of official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1987–88 season, Whiteside {{represented}} the Football League in a game against the 'Rest of the World' to celebrate the league's centenary. He formed a solid partnership with Brian McClair, scoring 10 goals in 35 appearances, though United finished second in the league behind Liverpool, and he often found <b>himself</b> <b>back</b> in midfield or on the bench when Peter Davenport was selected to play alongside McClair. However, he felt that he was due a better contract, and decided to 'call the bluff' of the club by handing in a transfer request. Recovering from injury and abuse from some supporters for his transfer request, he put what many United fans call the best performance of his career at Anfield on 4 April 1988, when he came off a substitute with his team 3–1 down to help United to salvage a point.|$|E

5|$|Kessler then invites Cole to {{join him}} for a final fight in the same {{location}} where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler {{turns out to be}} Cole himself from an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Kessler failed to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from conquering humanity. With his reign secure, the Beast then tracked down and killed Trish and her children. Sending <b>himself</b> <b>back</b> in time, Kessler seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory, but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.|$|E
5|$|Raghuveer {{discovers that}} Harsha is the reincarnation of the warrior. He murders Indu's father and frames Harsha, causing Indu to hate Harsha. As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha tries {{to catch them}} but fails; falling into a lake, he faces a near-death {{experience}} and learns about his past life in 1609. In that year, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udayghar when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha), commander of the Udayghad army. King Vikram Singh's daughter, Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds <b>himself</b> <b>back.</b> Her cousin, Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), lusts after Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udayghad. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in battle, {{and he does not}} wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhirava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.|$|E
