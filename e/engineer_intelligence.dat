He discovered that the US Navy and Marine Corps did not have adequate map making units, so the task had to be undertaken by the Army. The 64th Topographic Battalion {{was assigned to the}} task of mapping the Caroline Islands and Palau. However, until B-29 photographic aircraft could be based in the Mariana Islands, much of the aerial survey had to be carried out by aircraft carrier-based naval aircraft. Later Loper, who was promoted to brigadier general on 11 November 1944, was involved in gathering <b>engineer</b> <b>intelligence</b> for the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Okinawa campaign, and Operation Olympic. When USAFPOA was merged with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area in 1945, Loper became Chief of <b>Engineer</b> <b>Intelligence</b> under Major General Hugh J. Casey.

40|$|Could {{emergent}} ‘Living Technology’ such as {{synthetic biology}} {{lead to a}} more resilient future? This paper presents ‘BioLace’, a speculative design-led research project that investigates the intersection of synthetic biology and textile design to propose future fabrication processes for textile products and architecture. The motivation behind this research lies in the hypothesis that living technology can foster a new approach to address some of the key sustainable challenges of the 21 st century. The BioLace project is designed to probe the potential of a biological manufacturing future by exploring the cellular programming of morphogenesis in plant systems. The project aims to translate synthetic biology into accessible design scenarios to expose and understand the societal implications of new emerging technologies. The BioLace project poses the following questions: Can synthetic biology become a potential sustainable technology for future textile manufacturing? Will crafting molecules become a new way to produce textiles? Could biology combined with nanotechnology enable us to <b>engineer</b> <b>intelligence</b> in materials to program smart and responsive biological textiles...|$|E
