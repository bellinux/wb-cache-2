40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>head</b> <b>pruning</b> and different nutritional systems (chemical, biological and integrated) on yield and seed oil content in medicinal pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.), an experiment was conducted in Kermanshah/Iran during the 2013 growing season. The experimental treatments consisted of two levels - no <b>head</b> <b>pruning,</b> control (Co) and <b>head</b> <b>pruning</b> (C 1) allocated to the main plots. Four levels of different fertilizing systems - control (without fertilizer) (T 0), chemical (T 1), biological (a combination of nitrogen fixing bacteria, Azospirillum brasilense and Glomus mosseae) (T 2), and integrated fertilizing system (biological fertilizer + 50 % chemical fertilizer) (T 3) {{were assigned to the}} sub-plots. The experimental treatments were arranged as a split plot based on a randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that the highest percentage of seed oil was obtained (37 %) in the integrated nutritional system along with the <b>head</b> <b>pruning</b> treatment. The highest grain yields of 53 and 50 g per square meter were obtained in integrated and chemical fertilizing systems, respectively while no pruning was applied. The highest fruit yields of 3, 710 and 3, 668 kg per hectare were produced by chemical and integrated fertilizing systems, respectively. The biological nutrition system required more time to demonstrate its positive effect on the growth and yield of medicinal pumpkin...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{carried out}} to evaluate the effects of planting methods (seed sowing and transplanting) and <b>head</b> <b>pruning</b> (no pruning, pruning after 12 th node and pruning after 16 th node) on yield and yield components such as number of branches (sub-branches) per plant, fruits per plant, growth, fruit size, weight of fresh fruit, weight of seeds per fruit, number of seeds per fruit and seed yield of medicinal pumpkin. The experiment was carried out based of factorial experiment with Randomized Completely Blocks Design (RCBD) by three replications in Ardabil Agricultural and Natural Resources Researches Station at 2007. Seedlings were grown in heated greenhouse. When the climatic condition became suitable and seedlings were at the four leaves stage, both seeds and seedlings were planted {{at the same time}} in the farm. Maintenance operations were done during the growth season. <b>Head</b> <b>pruning</b> treatments were done the forecast time. The results showed that the planting methods had significant effect on the number of ripen fruits per plant, fruits diameter, weight of seeds per fruit, weight of 1000 seeds and seed yield and had no significant effect on the other traits. Also the results indicated that <b>head</b> <b>pruning</b> treatments had significant effects on the number of branches per plant, growth and seed yield and no significant on the other traits. In this experiment the most seed yield (997. 8 kg ha - 1) obtained from transplanting method with <b>head</b> <b>pruning</b> after 12 th node and the least seed yield obtained from control...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} stem pruning (No heading, <b>head</b> <b>pruning</b> of stem after formation of 10 and 14 nodes) and nitrogen levels (0, 50, 100 and 200 kg ha - 1) on physical and chemical characteristic of pumpkin seed a Factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with three replication {{was carried out in}} Gorgan at 2003 and repeated in 2004 years. Results showed that the stem pruning has significant effect on traits such as seed oil, linoleic acid and oleic acid content. Nitrogen levels also have significant effect on seed dimension, seed oil, linoleic acid and oleic acid content. The largest amount of oil and linoleic acid content was obtained by stem pruning after forming 14 node and 100 kg ha - 1 nitrogen in separately, but the interaction of treatments were not significant difference for all of traits...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made in 1997 to {{rejuvenate}} neglected, mature 'Wichita' pecan trees in a commercial Pinal County grove by applying two types of <b>heading</b> back <b>pruning</b> cuts. The treatments were applied during the dormant season prior to the growing season. The trees were pruned using proven horticultural techniques which included dehorning (cutting main scaffolds to within 2 feet of the trunk) and cutting main scaffolds by 50 %. After four years of data, the trees receiving no pruning treatments are producing as well or better than trees to which the pruning treatments were applied. The data suggests that a return to normal irrigation and fertilization practices alone will return neglected, water-stressed trees to normal productivity as early as trees that have been headed-back...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>heading</b> back cut <b>pruning</b> were tested on a native Iranian early {{maturing}} apple cultivar (‘Golab’) and seven commercial apple cultivars (‘Gala’, ‘Fuji’, ‘Granny Smith’, ‘Red Delicious’, ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Red Spare’ and ‘Braeburn’). Tests evaluated vegetative and reproductive responses to <b>heading</b> back cut <b>pruning</b> on M 9 rootstocks. Tests were {{arranged in a}} completely randomized block design with four replicates. The terminal part of vertical shoots was headed back in mid-April in all cultivars; shoots in the control were left intact. Evaluations were made for plant growth (shoot length) and number of flower buds to remain {{until the end of}} the growing season. Tests showed that flowering, in terms of number of formed flower buds, was significantly affected by pruning treatment. Tests on apple cultivar and interaction between pruning and cultivar indicated difference between cultivars in terms of response to pruning. Evaluations for flower bud number and vegetative growth increased by heading back treatment. Results of comparisons showed that ‘Granny smith’ cultivar had the strongest positive reaction to heading back treatment and that the most flower buds formed on one-year old branches after heading back treatment in the subsequent growing season and the ‘Braeburn’ cultivar had the least positive reaction to heading back. The ‘Golab’ cultivar, a local early maturing cultivar, showed a weak positive reaction to heading back but stimulation to flowering was more than that in ‘Fuji’, ‘Red delicious’ or ‘Golden delicious’ cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract | A recent {{flurry of}} {{time-lapse}} imaging studies of live neurons {{have tried to}} address the century-old question: what morphological changes in dendritic spines {{can be related to}} longterm memory? Changes that have been proposed to relate to memory include the formation of new spines, the enlargement of spine <b>heads</b> and the <b>pruning</b> of spines. These observations also relate to a more general question of how stable dendritic spines are. The objective of this review is to critically assess the new data and to propose much needed criteria that relate spines to memory, thereby allowing progress in understanding the morphological basis of memory. ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT Growing a young mammal in an environment that is enriched with stimuli and motor demands has been shown to enhance the cognitive skills of that animal, as well as the complexity of its neurons. TWO-PHOTON MICROSCOPY A form of microscopy in which a fluorochrome that would normally be excited by a single photon is stimulated quasisimultaneously by two photons of lower energy. Under these conditions, fluorescence increases {{as a function of the}} square of the light intensity, and decreases as the fourth power of the distance from the focus. Because of this behaviour, only fluorochrome molecules near the plane of focus are excited, greatly reducing light scattering and photodamage of the sample...|$|R
40|$|Two-year-old apple branches, ≈ 50 cm long, were {{selected}} from a commercial 'Royal Gala' orchard in the Ceres (Koue Bokkeveld) region of the Western Cape, South Africa [33 °S, 945 m, 1500 Utah model chilling units (CU) ]. In 2000, the branches received either cold storage at 5 to 7 °C or natural chilling in the field. In 2001, the trial was repeated, but only with field chilling. The branches received five dormant pruning treatments: control (not pruned); pruning back to the fourth lateral shoot (heading) before or after chilling; and removal of {{the second and third}} lateral shoots (thinning) before or after chilling. After pruning and chilling, the branches were removed from the orchard or cold room every 2 weeks and forced in a growth chamber at 25 °C. The rate of budburst (1 /days to budburst) was determined for the terminal buds of the lateral shoots. Lateral shoots on the 2 -year-old branches were categorized according to position: the most distal extension shoot, and all other laterals grouped. Removing distal tissue by <b>pruning</b> (<b>heading</b> more than thinning) enhanced the effect of chilling on the terminal buds on the lateral shoots and promoted budberst. Pruning was more effective before than after chilling. Pruning enhanced the growth potential of the terminal buds on proximal shoots on 2 -year-old branches. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Pruning {{has been}} used to reduce tree size, allow light {{penetration}} into trees, improve yield, improve fruit size and fruit quality, overcome alternate bearing, assist fruit harvest, and assist pest and disease control. The use of pruning has increased due to improving agricultural management techniques such as high planting densities, use of mechanical machinery in orchards and the need for effective pesticide and pathological chemical spray applications. The main objective {{of this study was to}} obtain a practical means of manipulating lemon trees at the right time. Pruning at the correct time to cultivate productive trees that produce quality fruit would have financial benefits. Lemon fruit quality is dependent on market demand and involves a number of features such as fruit shelf life, rind thickness, fruit size, rind colour, and juice content. The study was conducted on ’Eureka’ lemon trees budded on C. volkameriana rootstock, bearing the fifth and sixth commercial crops in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Twelve monthly pruning treatments per year were conducted on one row of trees starting in December 1997 (site 1) and repeated in the second year on the adjacent row of the same orchard starting in December 1998 (site 2). Selective <b>pruning</b> <b>heading</b> cuts were applied below the intercalation on the intercalary units. Potential branch bearing units were tagged and assessed during the harvest and flowering periods. Summer pruning between 16 to 19 months before the subsequent April/May harvest, resulted in the longest and most complex (intercalation sprouted per axil) vegetative response. The estimated crop value indicated that summer pruning treatments produced the highest income. This was ascribed not to differences in fruit size or quality, but to an increase in yield. The industry’s trend is to prune citrus from post-harvest to the pre-bloom stage. Results from this study have provided a beneficial cultural practice to prune during the summer months and provides a practice to optimise farm production and profit margins...|$|R
40|$|Bunch stem {{necrosis}} (BSN) is {{a physiological}} disorder in grapes. It results in shrivelled berries with poor quality attributes such that wine produced from grapes with high BSN incidence is of compromised quality. Past research has proposed many different hypotheses {{to explain the}} disorder. Literature indicates that conditions during certain stages of development may predispose berries to BSN but results are not consistent as to which stage is the critical one or which factors have the most impact. This {{study was designed to}} resolve these points of uncertainty. Treatments that either enhanced or decreased vine vigour, or manipulated the light environment around the fruit zone were applied to field grown 'Cabernet Sauvignon' vines over three seasons. Treatments included root <b>pruning,</b> <b>heading</b> back of canes by 50 %, laying down a reflective mulch and two 50 % shade treatments applied for three weeks either pre- or post-full bloom (FB). A strong positive correlation was found between vine vigour and the incidence of BSN. Three weeks post-FB, during both the current and previous season, was identified as the critical period within which factors predispose bunches to BSN. Plant growth regulators, including GA 3, IAA and NPA, were applied to bunches on a different group of field grown vines immediately after FB. Application of GA 3 during the critical period, tended to reduce the incidence of BSN, while the effects of IAA and NPA application were less clear and require further research. In a controlled environment (CE) trial, pot-grown vines were placed in CE rooms during one of three development stages. Results showed that treatments applied during the critical threeweek period after FB increased the incidence of BSN three fold compared with no change in BSN incidence for vines that were placed in the CE rooms immediately prior to FB or prior to veraison. Collective results from these studies clearly demonstrate that the period immediately following FB is the most critical time in the predisposition of bunches to BSN. It is suggested that competitive dominance of vegetative growth over the developing inflorescence and bunch for assimilates and/or nutrients may be the predisposing factor/s influencing this disorder...|$|R
