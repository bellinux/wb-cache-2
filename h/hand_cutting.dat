500|$|Until the mid-twentieth century, all peat {{was cut by}} hand. Although {{the effects}} of the {{industry}} on the ecology of the moors were serious, <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> mainly affected the surface of the moors. It left behind trenches and ditches, which soon became waterlogged, and were re-colonised {{to become part of the}} diverse habitat. Once the cutting process was mechanised, peat could be cut from a greater depth, and at a faster rate, resulting in less ability for the moors to recover. Mechanical peat cutting was introduced to the moors in the early 1960s, and the process was similar to <b>hand</b> <b>cutting,</b> in that the peat was extracted over a small area but to a considerable depth. More destructive to the ultimate regeneration of the moors was the introduction of peat milling in 1985, where a thin layer of peat was stripped from a wider area. Thus in 1910, around 56 tonnes per acre were extracted from [...] of the moors, whereas in 1985 the yield was 10 tonnes per acre over double that area. As early as the late 1960s, academics and conservation agencies expressed concerns that the moors had been so badly damaged by peat extraction and farming that they were not worth saving.|$|E
500|$|On the moors, when dried turves {{were ready}} to be collected, {{temporary}} track sections were laid {{at right angles to}} the main line, and a portable turntable was installed. A rake of twelve wagons could then be moved onto the temporary track, one at a time, to be filled by a 'filling gang'. Each wagon held about a ton, and once all twelve had been manoeuvred over the turntable back onto the main line, they would be pulled to the works by horses. With the advent of the small Lister engines, a new system was used, where three curved sections of track were used, the end one being clipped onto the top of the main line track. The engines could then push a line of forty or fifty wagons onto the temporary track. Cutting of the peat was mechanised from 1963, with the introduction of German peat-cutting machines, and by 1970, all <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> had ceased. Loading of the turves into wagons was also initially by hand, but gradually 'sod collectors' were introduced, which at Swinefleet had a [...] conveyor and at Hatfield a [...] one. These enabled a single side track to serve a much wider section of moor, without having to move the track. Loading turves onto the start of the conveyor was still done manually, but it became difficult to find people who wanted to do the work, and so Hymac loaders were used to load peat directly into the wagons. The success of this process at Hatfield in 1981 lead to it being used at Swinefleet as well.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanical {{harvesting}} uses a combine, or sugarcane harvester. The Austoft 7000 series, {{the original}} modern harvester design, {{has now been}} copied by other companies, including Cameco/John Deere. The machine cuts the cane {{at the base of}} the stalk, strips the leaves, chops the cane into consistent lengths and deposits it into a transporter following alongside. The harvester then blows the trash back onto the field. Such machines can harvest [...] each hour; however, harvested cane must be rapidly processed. Once cut, sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content, and damage to the cane during mechanical harvesting accelerates this decline. This decline is offset because a modern chopper harvester can complete the harvest faster and more efficiently than <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> and loading. Austoft also developed a series of hydraulic high-lift infield transporters to work alongside their harvesters to allow even more rapid transfer of cane to, for example, the nearest railway siding. This mechanical harvesting doesn't require the field to be set on fire; the remains left in the field by the machine consist of the top of the sugar cane and the dead leaves, which act as mulch for the next round of planting.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile an {{extensive}} traffic in valuable furs was commenced with the natives, {{who were more}} than satisfied with the scraps of bright cloth, beads, and other trifling ornaments they received in exchange for them. Some of the natives wanted to purchase weapons with their furs, but Karlsefin would not allow this. At first the Norsemen gave their cloth and other wares in exchange with liberal <b>hand,</b> <b>cutting</b> the bright cloth into stripes {{of three or four}} inches in breadth; but they soon found that at this rate their supplies would become exhausted too early in the year. They therefore reduced their prices, and began to give stripes of cloth only two inches in width, and at last reduced the measure to one inch, for furs that had previously fetched four. But the unsophisticated natives were quite content with the change, and appeared to enjoy nothing so much as to twist these stripes of cloth into their long black hair.|$|E

Not only the biological contamination, but also personal perception and individual behavior {{play a role}} for risk assessment along a chain. This study is to identify the prevalence and number of Salmonella in 3 pig slaughterhouses in relation to several risk factors. During January to April 2013, a total of 87 samples (carcasses, workers' <b>hands,</b> <b>cutting</b> board and belly skin material) were collected from 4 visits to each slaughterhouse. A 3 -tube Most Probable Number (MPN) was applied to quantify the number of Salmonella from carcass, workers' <b>hands,</b> <b>cutting</b> board and belly skin samples (35 samples). The result showed that Salmonella prevalence was 36. 9 % (26. 7 - 47. 8 %), mostly found on worker's hands (50 %) and the lowest from cutting board (33. 3 %). The highest number of Salmonella on carcass and cutting boards was less than 0. 075 MPN/cm 2 and 1. 2 MPN/cm 2, respectively. Potential riskfactors were tested however they were not statistical significant. This study underlines the necessity of good hygiene practices and management in slaughterhouses.

5000|$|The Seljuq {{capture of}} Sinope had {{important}} consequences: {{apart from a}} short period of Trapezuntine recovery in 1254-1265, the city henceforth remained in Turkish <b>hands,</b> <b>cutting</b> the small Trapezuntine state off from overland contact with the metropolitan Byzantine lands of the Empire of Nicaea in western Asia Minor. At the same time, the capture of its ruler forced the Trapezuntines to accept tributary status to the Seljuqs, which lasted until the failure of a Sejuq assault on Trebizond itself in 1222/1223. According to the Byzantinist Warren Treadgold, the loss of Sinope on the one hand [...] "shielded Trebizond from further attacks from Nicaea", but also meant that [...] "henceforth Alexios' claim to be Byzantine emperor rang hollow, and the Empire of Trebizond ceased to be of more than local importance." ...|$|R
