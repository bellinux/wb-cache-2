By 2008, the Cobra HMDS was fully integrated on operational aircraft, and is available as an option for export customers; it has been retrofitted into older Swedish and South African Gripens. The HMDS provides control and information on target cueing, sensor data, and <b>flight</b> <b>parameters,</b> and is optionally equipped for night time operations and with chemical/biological filtration.

500|$|The {{system uses}} a {{multi-function}} Doppler radar, {{which can be}} turned on and off by the tank commander. [...] In conjunction with radar input, a digital computer scans an arc around the tank for threats, and evaluates which [...] of the tank's 26 quick-action projectiles it will release to intercept the incoming threat. [...] In selecting the projectile to use for defeating the threat, the ballistic computer employs the information processed by the radar, including information such as <b>flight</b> <b>parameters</b> and velocity. [...] The computer has a reaction time of 0.05 seconds and protects the tank over a 300-degree arc, everywhere but the rear side of the turret. The system engages targets within [...] of the vehicle it is defending, and the ammunition detonates at around [...] from the threat. [...] It will engage any threat approaching the tank between the velocities of [...] and , and can detect false targets, such as outgoing projectiles, birds and small caliber bullets. [...] Arena works {{during the day and}} night, and the lack of electromagnetic interference allows the system to be used by multiple vehicles as a team.

2500|$|The plane {{continued}} {{to approach the}} airport [...] and leveled off with landing gear retracted. At this time, Captain Noor had been in extreme anxiety, as the plane was in an active bad weather cell. However, First Officer Javid seemed to be ignorant and unaware of the extreme precipitation and bad weather, and did not recommend the Captain to discontinue the approach.

40|$|A long landing is {{one type}} of flight {{incident}} that will multiply {{the risk of a}} runway excursion. It occurs frequently but receives little attention in research due to difficulty in obtaining the real flight data. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discover key <b>flight</b> <b>parameter</b> features of long landing incidents by analyzing Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data and put forward prevention measures from the perspective of pilot operation at the same time. First, 73 <b>flight</b> performance <b>parameter</b> variables and 4 operation parameter variables were defined, covering major landing stages from 1500 ft to touchdown. Then 128 cases of selected QAR data were divided into two groups according to the threshold of identifying normal and long landing. Second, each <b>flight</b> <b>parameter</b> variable of these 128 flights was compared between groups and then the logistic and linear regression models were developed respectively to further examine the links between touchdown distance and these <b>flight</b> <b>parameter</b> variables. Third, potential flight operation causing performance difference of long landing incidents was also analyzed. Finally results indicate that the period of 200 ft to touchdown is the key stage of landing and flare is the most critical operation affecting touchdown distance. It is suggested that the pilot should inspect the ratio of descent rate and groundspeed carefully at the height of 50 ft and pilot&# 39;s faster and steady pulling up columns is probably helpful for an excellent flare and landing. The findings are expected to be applied into flight operation practice for further preventing long landing incidents and even the runway excursion accidents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
