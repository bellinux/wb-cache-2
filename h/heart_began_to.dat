[...] He never again left his Washington residence, having fallen ill with typhoid fever. [...] As the days passed, politicians began {{to wait in the}} Arlington lobby, close to Hanna's house, for news; a letter from the President, [...] "May you soon be with us, old fellow, as strong in body and as vigorous in your leadership as ever" [...] was never read by the recipient.

2500|$|One of {{most famous}} Crow leaders to {{encounter}} the Little People was the legendary Crow chief Plenty Coups (Aleek-chea-ahoosh). When he {{was nine years}} old, Plenty Coup's older brother (who was a great warrior and quite handsome, and whom Plenty Coups loved deeply) was killed by raiding Lakotas. Although the tribe was preparing to move out, Plenty Coups fasted for four days, used the sweat lodge, rubbed his body with sage and cedar to remove any smell, and then went into the nearby hills where he had a vision. In his vision, {{the chief of the}} Little People took him into a spirit-world lodge, where Plenty Coups saw representations of nature (the wind, the stars, thunder, the Moon, bad storms, etc.). The dwarf chief demanded that Plenty Coups count coup, but since Plenty Coups was just nine years of age he knew that he had no great deeds to count. Nonetheless, the chief of the Little People recounted two great deeds to the spirits gathered in the lodge, and said that Plenty Coups would not only accomplish these deeds but many others as well. He also prophesied that Plenty Coups would become chief of his people, if he used his wits, and then advised Plenty Coups to develop his willpower so that he could lead his people. [...] "I had a will and I would use it, make it work for me, as the Dwarf-chief had advised. I became very happy, lying there looking up into the sky. My <b>heart</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> sing like a bird, and I went back to the village, needing no man to tell me the meaning of my dream. I took a sweat-bath and rested in my father's lodge. I knew myself now." ...|$|E
