40|$|Background. The {{effects of}} {{different}} practices on fault distributions in evolving complex software systems {{is not fully}} understood. Software reuse and <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> are prac- tices used to improve system reliability by minimising the number of late faults. Reused software benefits from already being verified while <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> aims to find faults early. Aims. We want to study effects of software reuse and <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> on future modifications, fault densities of software units, and fault distributions. Method. We applied statistical analysis {{to a sample of}} 520 units that were reused and modified within four sequential projects from one product line in the telecommunication domain. Results. In reused units, the results of <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> are correlated to a smaller degree of modifications and decreased fault densities. Conclusion. <b>Unit</b> <b>verification</b> in complex systems may improve system evolution in terms of smaller modifications and decrease of fault densities.

Control charts is a key tool within statistical process control (SPC), through which process characteristics can be visualized, usually chronologically with statistically determined limits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our group has developed a monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> software that has been adopted at several Swedish institutions for pre-treatment verification of radiotherapy treatments. Deviations between point dose calculations using the treatment planning systems and using the independent monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> software from 9219 treatment plans and five different institutions were included in this multicenter study. The process of monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> was divided into subprocesses. Each subprocess was analyzed using probability plots and control charts. RESULTS: Differences in control chart parameters for the investigated subprocesses were found between different treatment sites and different institutions, {{as well as between}} different treatment techniques. 19 of 37 subprocesses met the clinical specification (± 5 %), i. e. process capability index was equal to or above one. CONCLUSIONS: Control charts were found to be a useful tool for continuous analysis of data from the monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> software for patient specific quality control, as well as for comparisons between different institutions and treatment sites.

40|$|Automated {{verification}} of distributed programs is a challenging problem. Since {{the behavior of}} a distributed program encompasses the behavior of the network, possible configurations of the network have to be investigated during verification. This leads to very large state spaces, and automated verification becomes infeasible. We present a framework that addresses this problem by decoupling the behavior of distributed programs from the behavior of the network. Our framework is based on a set of stub classes that replace native methods used in network communication and enables {{verification of}} distributed Java applications by isolating their behavior from the network. The framework supports two modes of verification: <b>unit</b> <b>verification</b> and integration verification. Integration verification checks multiple interacting distributed application components by running them in a single JVM and simulating the behavior of the network within the same JVM via stub classes. <b>Unit</b> <b>verification</b> targets a single component of a distributed application and requires that the user write an event generator class that utilizes the API exported by the framework.

40|$|Preparation for {{radiotherapy}} is {{a complex}} procedure that involves many different technologies and groups of professionals. The rapid development and introduction of new technologies throughout the last decade {{have made it possible}} to deliver highly conformal, individually-shaped dose distributions with high accuracy. However, there is widespread concern that current quality assurance practices have not been updated at the pace necessary to provide adequate and cost-effective safeguards against treatment delivery errors. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop and evaluate new, efficient tools for patient-specific quality assurance of the radiotherapy process, including the following areas: transfer of information, independent monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verification,</b> pre-treatment measurements, in vivo dosimetry, and end-to-end tests. Within the framework of the thesis, a concept for ensuring data integrity was proposed and used to compare different combinations of treatment planning systems and record-and-verify systems with respect to data integrity. Because the concept is based on the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) global information standard, it is generally applicable to most radiotherapy computer systems. Additionally, a software for monitor <b>unit</b> <b>verifications</b> was developed, and the tools within Statistical Process Control were used to analyse calculation results from this software in a multicentre study. Time-resolved dosimetry systems were developed and applied to pre-treatment measurements and in vivo dosimetry, allowing rigorous analysis of the accuracy of the treatment planning and delivery systems and forming a basis for real-time in vivo dosimetry. Finally, gel dosimetry and anthropomorphic phantoms were demonstrated to provide important tools for complete end-to-end tests. The tools developed in this thesis have two important applications: routine use in daily clinical practice, and when introducing new technologies in the local clinical setting.

For comparison purposes, another SMBR process without electrocoagulation (EC) was operated in parallel with both processes operated under constant transmembrane pressure for 24. days in continuous operation mode. It was found that integrating EC process with SMBR (EC-SMBR) was not only an effective method for grey water treatment but also for improving the overall performance of the membrane filtration process. EC-SMBR process achieved up to 13 % reduction in membrane fouling compared to SMBR without electrocoagulation. High average percent removals were attained by both processes for most wastewater parameters studied. The results demonstrated that EC-SMBR performance slightly exceeded that of SMBR for COD, turbidity, and colour. Both processes produced effluent free of suspended solids, and faecal coliforms were nearly (100 %) removed in both processes. A substantial improvement was achieved in removal of phosphate in the EC-SMBR process. However, ammonia nitrogen was removed more effectively by the SMBR only.

We show here that the enzyme sphin-gosine kinase- 1 (SK- 1) regulates the rate and direction of EPC differentiation with-out effect on the hematopoietic compart-ment. EPCs {{have high levels of}} SK- 1 activity, which diminishes with differentia-tion and is, at least partially, responsible for maintaining their EPC phenotype. EPCs from SK- 1 knockout mice form more adherent <b>EC</b> <b>units</b> and acquire a mature EC phenotype more rapidly. Conversely, EPCs from mice overexpressing SK- 1 in the EC compartment are retarded in their differentiation. Exogenous regulation of SK- 1 levels in normal EPCs, by genetic and pharmacologic means, including the immunomodulating drug FTY 720, reca-pitulates these effects on EC differentia-tion. SK- 1 knockout mice have higher levels of circulating EPCs, an exagger-ated response to erythropoietin-induced EPC mobilization, and, in a mouse model of kidney ischemia reperfusion injury, ex-hibit a recovery similar to that of ischemic mice administered exogenous EPCs. Thus, SK- 1 is a critical player in EPC differentiation into EC pointing to the potential utility of SK- 1 modifying agents in the specific manipulation of endothe-lial development and repair.

Therefore the VM overhead can be ignored for our further performance analysis. It is interesting {{to see that the}} Amazon calculation (m 1.large) takes up to 2.6 times longer than the Eucalyptus or even the local execution (compute intensive and non-memory bound). To verify this overhead we decided to use another CPU intensive test example as shown in [44]. For this test we used the command time for i in 0.. 10000; do for j in 0.. 1000; do :; done; done in the terminal. At the local machine, the execution takes 19 seconds, in EC 2 with the m 1.large 47 sec and with c 1.xlarge 37 seconds. With this test, the EC 2 (m 1.large) takes about 2.5 times longer than the local execution, which means approximately the same performance overhead as with the CEF. In [45] Amazon describes EC 2 compute units: “In order to make it easy for developers to directly compare CPU capacity between different instance types, we have defined an Amazon <b>EC</b> 2 Compute <b>Unit.</b> The amount of CPU that is allocated to a particular instance is expressed in terms of these <b>EC</b> 2 Compute <b>Units.</b> We use several benchmarks and tests to manage the consistency and predictability of the performance of an <b>EC</b> 2 Compute <b>Unit.</b> One <b>EC</b> 2 Compute <b>Unit</b> provides the equivalent CPU capacity of a 1.0 – 1.2 GHz 2007 Opteron or 2007 Xeon processor.” That is the reason why {{it is not possible to}} compare one EC 2 instance with a local machine with a specific CPU.|$|R
