The L-L phase separation of Hb serves as a model to elucidate intermolecular interactions that may give rise to accelerated nucleation kinetics of liganded HbC (β 6 Lys) compared to HbS (β 6 Val) and HbA (β 6 Glu). Under conditions of low pH (pH 6. 35) in the presence of <b>inositol-hexaphosphate,</b> COHb assumes an altered R-state. The phase lines for the three Hb variants in concentration and temperature coordinates indicate that liganded HbC exhibits a stronger net intermolecular attraction with a longer range than liganded HbS and HbA. Over time, L-L phase separation gives rise to amorphous aggregation and subsequent formation of crystals of different kinetics and habits, unique to the individual Hb. The composite of R- and T-like solution aggregation behavior indicates that this is a conformationally driven event. These results indicate that specific contact sites, thermodynamics, and kinetics all play a role in L-L phase separation and differ for the β 6 mutant hemoglobins compared to HbA. In addition, the dense liquid droplet interface or aggregate interface noticeably participates in crystal nucleation...|$|E
