The scattering lengths for Ps-Kr and Ps-Xe scattering in the <b>fixed</b> <b>core</b> approximation are 3. 18 a(0) and 3. 82 a(0), respectively. Inclusion of core-polarization potentials {{leads to a}} significant reduction in the scattering lengths. The Ps-Kr and Ps-Xe scattering lengths were 1. 98 a(0) and 2. 29 a(0) for polarization potentials that were tuned to an average of the model electron-atom and positron-atom scattering lengths for the respective atoms. Other choices of the polarization potential resulted in scattering lengths that could be larger by 0. 3 a(0) or smaller by 0. 8 a(0). The pick-off annihilation parameter (1) Z(eff) has also been computed as part of the analysis. The present values of (1) Z(eff) are about 3 to 10 times smaller than the accepted experimental values since short-range electron-positron correlations were ignored when the annihilation matrix element was evaluated...|$|E

Today's general purpose processors cannot satisfy the future aggressive timing and power constraints for a specific application. On the other hand, conventional ASIC design methodologies are costly and require a long time-to-market for today's complex designs. We need a platform based system optimized for a set of applications in a same domain. Reconfiguration has to be integrated into system design. We must exploit the regularity (or similarity) among applications in target system design. This regularity depends on the domain of applications.

40|$|Formulaic {{language}} {{has been shown}} to be an important component of language usage. This paper summarizes evidence of this importance and then goes on to focus upon two key characteristics of formulaic language: fixedness and variability. Formulaic language is usually conceptualized as being basically fixed, but examples are given to illustrate that in many cases formulaic language contains a considerable amount of variation. The degree and type of variation depends on which kind of formulaic language is being addressed: idiom, variable expression, or lexical bundle. Idioms, which are supposedly fixed, show the greatest amount of variation, while variable expressions and lexical bundles seem to contain much more stable <b>fixed</b> <b>cores.</b> It is suggested that variable expressions (and perhaps lexical bundles) may be stored in the mind as individual units, because there are relatively few instances to store. Conversely, idioms may involve so many variants that only the canonical form may be stored as a template, from which truncated and novel forms can be recognized. Teaching implications of these different forms of storage are considered...|$|R

The increase in the computational cost is compensated by an hybrid scheme with local search (i. e., CG-FFT) for finding the auxiliary variable (e. g., total field) and with global optimization algorithms (i. e., GA, SGA, BBO and PSO) for the main unknown of the inverse scattering problem (i. e., complex permittivity). 4 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{presents}} three second-order perturbative developments from {{a complete}} active space (CAS) zero-order wave function, which are strictly additive {{with respect to}} molecular dissociation and intruder state free. They differ by the degree of contraction of the outer-space perturbers. Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall's Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a <b>fixed</b> <b>core</b> field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a CAS. A few test applications of the simplest variant developed in this paper illustrate its potentialitie...|$|E

40|$|Current {{anonymous}} systems either use a small, <b>fixed</b> <b>core</b> set of mixes or randomly {{choose a}} sequence of peer nodes to form anonymous paths/tunnels.

In this paper, we propose SurePath, a failure-resilient tunneling approach for anonymity built on dis-tributed hash tables (DHTs). SurePath aims to make anonymous tunnels fault-tolerant to node failures. The basic idea behind SurePath is to decouple anonymous tunnels from “fixed ” nodes and form anonymous tunnels from dynamic mix nodes by relying on DHT routing infrastruc-ture and data replication mechanism. We have implemented SurePath in Java on FreePastry 1. 3. We also provide analysis of anonymity and performance evaluation for SurePath...|$|E

Using the FitzhHugh-Nagumo model for a generic active medium, Winfree constructed a diagram depicting the regions of parameter space in which the principle phenomena may be observed. Such diagrams are a common way of presenting the different dynamical regimes observed in both experimental and theoretical settings. They are sometimes called flower gardens since the paths traced by autowave tips may often resemble the petals of a flower. A flower garden for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is shown to the right. It contains: the line ∂P, which confines {{the range of the}} model parameters under which impulses can propagate through one-dimensional medium, and plane autowaves can spread in the two-dimensional medium; the [...] "rotor boundary" [...] ∂R, which confines the range of the parameters under which there can be the reverberators rotating around <b>fixed</b> <b>cores</b> (i.e. performing uniform circular rotation); the meander boundary ∂M and the hyper-meander boundary ∂C, which confine the areas where two-period and more complex (possibly chaotic) regimes can exist.
