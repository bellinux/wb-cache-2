40|$|INTRODUCTION The high-energy-density (HED) fuels {{developed}} under U. S. Navy sponsorship {{a replacement}} for conventional liquid fuels in its missile propulsion systems have the drawback of high soot propensity: this makes missiles visible and thus strategically unacceptable. Experimental evidence of heavy sooting from such potential fuels has been presented by Law[l]. Soot propensity is defined here as {{the ability of a}} fuel to form soot precursors through nucleation react ions; it does not refer to soot growth, or soot production which includes the additional effect of soot destruction through oxidation react ions. The general goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the potential for reducing soot propensity through the reduction in soot nucleation reactions which are the initiators of soot formation processes. The concept employed is electrostatic liquid <b>drop</b> <b>charging</b> for dispersing drops so as to avoid the creation of the rich- vapor regions where soot ion occurs. `I'he...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} low soot {{propensity}} of high-energy-density (HED) liquid sooting fuels and cost reduc-tion of a multicomponent energetic fuel {{can be achieved}} by doping a less expensive, less sooting liquid fuel with HED is tested through numerical simulations. The model represents an axisym-metric, polydisperse, dense cluster of binary-fuel (solvent/solute) spherical drops embedded into a vortex. The partial density of the evaporated fuels which is symptomatic of sooting propensity is compared for uncharged and electrostatically charged drops; charging is here usecl m an effective way to increase dispersion and reduce sooting propensity. Results from the simulations show that while the solvent soot propensity indeed decreases with <b>drop</b> <b>charging,</b> contrary to simplistic expec-tations, addition of HED a [...] a solute increases sooting propensity of the solute with increased drop dispersion. This is due to the additional dispersion maintaining the slip velocity at the drop sur-face and preferentially evaporating the solute. These counterintuitive but correct physical effects are independent of the initial solvent/solute mass ratio and decrease with decreasing solute volatil-ity. Based upon these results, blending strategies are suggested for minimizing sooting propensity and decreasing fuel costs. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{protocol}} for charging a lithium-ion battery would be modified, {{according to a}} proposal, {{to compensate for the}} internal voltage <b>drop</b> (<b>charging</b> current internal resistance of the battery). The essence of the modification is to provide for measurement of the internal voltage drop and to increase the terminal-voltage setting by the amount of the internal voltage drop. Ordinarily, a lithium-ion battery is charged at constant current until its terminal voltage attains a set value equal to the nominal full-charge potential. The set value is chosen carefully so as not to exceed the lithium-plating potential, because plated lithium in metallic form constitutes a hazard. When the battery is charged at low temperature, the internal voltage drop is considerable because the electrical conductivity of the battery electrolyte is low at low temperature. Charging the battery at high current at any temperature also gives rise to a high internal voltage drop. In some cases, the internal voltage drop can be as high as 1 volt per cell. Because the voltage available for charging is less than the terminal voltage by the amount of the internal voltage drop, the battery is not fully charged (see figure), even when the terminal voltage reaches the set value. In the modified protocol, the charging current would be periodically interrupted so that the zero-current battery-terminal voltage indicative of the state of charge could be measured. The terminal voltage would also be measured at full charging current. The difference between the full-current and zero-current voltages would equal the internal voltage drop. The set value of terminal voltage would then be increased beyond the nominal full-charge potential by the amount of the internal voltage drop. This adjustment would be performed repeatedly, in real time, so that the voltage setting would track variations in the internal voltage drop to afford full charge without risk of lithium plating. If the charging current and voltage settings were controlled by a computer, then this method of charge control could readily be implemented in software...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of scientific and}} industrial electrical spray applications make use of sprays that contain a range of drop diameters. Indirect evidence suggests the mean drop diameter and the mean <b>drop</b> <b>charge</b> level are usually correlated. In addition, within each drop diameter class {{there is every reason}} to suspect a distribution of charge levels exist for a particular drop diameter class. This paper presents an experimental method that uses the joint PDF of drop velocity and diameter, obtained from phase Doppler anemometry measurements, and directly obtained spatially resolved distributions of the mass and charge flux to obtain a <b>drop</b> diameter and <b>charge</b> frequency distribution. The method is demonstrated using several data-sets obtained from experimental measurements of steady polydisperse sprays of an electrically insulating liquid produced with the charge injection technique. The space charge repulsion in the spray plume produces a hollow cone spray structure. In addition an approximate self-similarity is observed, with the maximum radial mass and charge flow occurring at r/d * 200. The charge flux profile is slightly offset from the mass flux profile, and this gives direct evidence that the spray specific charge increases from approximately 20 % of the bulk mean spray specific charge on the spray axis to approximately 200 % of the bulk mean specific charge in the periphery of the spray. The results from the <b>drop</b> <b>charge</b> estimation model suggest a complex picture of the correlation between <b>drop</b> <b>charge</b> and <b>drop</b> diameter, with spray specific charge, injection velocity and orifice diameter all contributing to the shape of the drop diameterâcharge distribution. Mean <b>drop</b> <b>charge</b> as a function of the Rayleigh limit is approximately 0. 2, and is invariant with drop diameter and also across the spray cases tested...|$|R
