5|$|In Scotland a {{troop of}} English players came to Edinburgh in 1715 where they {{performed}} Macbeth {{and a series of}} Restoration comedies, but they soon left, perhaps because of objections from local kirk presbyteries. By 1725 English actor Anthony Aston, a friend of Ramsay, was performing <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh,</b> but seems to have fallen foul of the Scottish Master of the Revels, who licensed plays, companies and playhouses, and soon left. In 1727 the Kirk attacked theatres as immoral in the Admonition and Exhortation. The Edinburgh Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor's Hall <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> under the protection of a Royal Patent. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in Carruber's Close <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh,</b> but the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act made their activities illegal and the theatre soon closed. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s.|$|E

5|$|The Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland {{was founded}} in 1819 <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh,</b> to provide an {{opportunity}} for artists to present their work. It came to be dominated by a small aristocratic elite and excluded artists from its committee. This led to the founding of the Royal Scottish Academy of Art in 1826. The resulting competition between the two bodies eventually resulted in a de facto merger. In 1835 the now Royal Institution's building on Princess Street, Edinburgh became the Academy's home for exhibitions. The Academy was granted a Royal Charter in 1837 and its members were instrumental in the foundation of the National Gallery of Scotland <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh,</b> which opened in 1859. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery {{was founded in}} 1882. The Glasgow Institute was formed in 1861 to provide exhibiting opportunities in the growing city similar to those <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh.</b> It opened its own gallery on Sauchiehall Street in 1879. It received a Royal charter in 1896 and became the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.|$|E

5|$|While {{opportunities}} {{and training for}} painters had made advances {{by the beginning of}} the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of sculpture was slower to emerge. In the early decades of the century commissions continued to be given to English artists, including Samuel Joseph (1791–1850), who was working <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> in 1821–29 and was a founding member of the Scottish Academy. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790–1858) studied in London and settled in Rome, where he received commissions from visiting British subjects before returning to London in 1830. His works in Scotland included the Hopetoun Memorial (1824–34) <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh.</b> Lawrence Macdonald (1799–1878) was able to study at the Trustees Academy <b>in</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> and then Rome. He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life.
