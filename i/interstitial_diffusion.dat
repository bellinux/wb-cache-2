40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{may contribute to}} the drug resistance of a solid tumor by preventing the penetration of therapeutic agents. We measured differences in interstitial resistance to macromolecule (IgG) motion in four tumor types and found an unexpected correspondence between transport resistance and the mechanical stiffness. The <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient of IgG was measured in situ by fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching. Tissue elastic modulus and hydraulic conductivity were measured by confined compression of excised tissue. In apparent contradiction to an existing paradigm, these functional properties are correlated with total tissue content of collagen, not glycosaminoglycan. An extended collagen network was observed in the more penetration-resistant tumors. Collagenase treatment of the more penetration-resistant tumors significantly increased the IgG <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion</b> rate. We conclude that collagen influences the tissue resistance to macromolecule transport, possibly by binding and stabilizing the glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM.

In substitutional lattice diffusion (self-diffusion for example), the atom can only move by substituting place with another atom.

30|$|Assuming total {{coronary}} artery occlusion in the non-reperfused MI model, {{the only possible}} mechanism for CA uptake is slow <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion</b> from the surrounding tissues that are still well-supplied [14]. The rim of the MI is highlighted even {{as early as the}} time of the EGE acquisition, presumably by CA from intact collaterals. This rim area of the MI is usually composed of a mixture of viable and nonviable myocytes [22]. The collateral circulation supplying this peri-infarct territory keeps the myocardial tissue partially alive, and serves as a CA source as well. The peri-infarct area, however, also contains vessels with damaged endothelial lining, allowing the accumulation of the CA in the extracellular space. This extracellular space may serve as a pool to supply the adjacent infarct area, including the NF, with CA. Interestingly, the reperfused and the non-reperfused MIs accumulate CA at a similar rate. The latter observation may confirm the hypothesis that most of the CA uptake is through slow <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion</b> in both MI models. If the blood flow is not completely absent in the reperfused case, as suggested by others [20], a vascular component may contribute to the access to CA. This flow, however, may be extremely limited, as the rate of contrast uptake in both models seems similar.|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} the <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion</b> of ion-implanted boron during rapid thermal {{annealing}} of silicon layers previously amorphized by implantation of germanium has been proposed. It is supposed that the boron interstitials are generated continuously during annealing due to dissolution or rearrangement of the clusters of impurity atoms which are formed in the ion-implanted layers with impurity concentration above the solubility limit. The local elastic stresses arising due to the difference of boron atomic radius and atomic radius of silicon {{also contribute to the}} generation of boron interstitials. On the basis of the model proposed a simulation of redistribution of ion-implanted boron during rapid thermal annealing with duration of 60 s at a temperature of 850 degrees Celsius has been carried out. The calculated profile of boron distribution after thermal treatment agrees well with the experimental data that confirms the adequacy of the model. A number of the parameters of <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion</b> have been derived. In particular, the average migration length of nonequilibrium boron interstitials is equal to 12 nanometers. It was also obtained that approximately 1. 96 % of boron atoms were converted to the interstitial sites, participated in the fast interstitial migration, and then became immobile again transferring into a substitutional position or forming the electrically inactive complexes with defects of crystal lattice.

40|$|The {{temperature}} variable Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM/ 20 K- 700 K) {{was used}} to measure the surface damage patterns of single ion impacts and to study adsorption, structure and melting of the ice bilayer on Pt(111). The first part of the thesis describes the ion impact data. First, the migration of Pt self interstitials is detected by their appearance at the surface. Thus, the onset temperature of the self <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion</b> is determined to be 22 K. The diffusion energy is estimated to be about 50 meV consistent with earlier different measurements. Second, single ion impacts are analyzed. Due to the low imaging temperature, the surface damage of single ion impacts can be observed prior to any annealing except the <b>interstitial</b> <b>diffusion.</b> This allows to compare the impact patterns directly with Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS). For this purpose, the surface damage of Ne"+, Ar"+, Kr"+ and Xe"+ (4. 5 keV) -impacts on Pt(111) is analyzed. In particular, the number distribution of adatoms per impact (and thus the adatom yield), the radial distribution of the adatoms and the mean size of adatom and surface vacancy clusters are determined. These data show that an increase of the energy density leads to a change of the adatom production mechanism from a linear cascade mechanism (adatom creation by independent collisions) to a thermal spike mechanism (collective flow of Pt-atoms onto the surface).
