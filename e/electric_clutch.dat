40|$|Prior {{papers have}} shown the {{potentials}} of gasoline-like internal combustion engines fitted with Rankine cycle systems to deliver Diesel-like steady state fuel conversion efficiencies recovering the exhaust and the coolant waste heat with off-the-shelf components. In addition to the pros of the technology significantly increasing steady state efficiencies - up to 5 % in absolute values and much more in relative values - these papers also mentioned the cons of the technology, increased backpressures, increased weight, more complex packaging, more complex control, troublesome transient operation, and finally the cold start issues that prevent the uptake of the technology. This paper further explores the option to use Rankine cycle systems to improve the fuel economy of vehicles under normal driving conditions. A single Rankine cycle system is integrated here with the engine design. A latest turbocharged 1. 6 L direct injection engine has the coolant circuit modified to serve as pre-heater for the Rankine cycle fluid. This fluid is then vaporised and superheated in the boiler/superheater coaxial to the exhaust pipe located downstream of the turbocharger turbine and the closed coupled catalytic converter.

50|$|The DPC {{differential}} features clutch packs on both output sides {{that are}} actuated by an <b>electric</b> motor. The <b>clutch</b> pack activates a planetary gearset which causes one wheel to be overdriven. A conventional control system, such as BMW's typical xDrive system without Dynamic Performance Control, relies on brakes {{to reduce the}} speed of the faster-moving wheel (which is the one with less traction) and reduce engine power to limit slip at that wheel. This leads to increased brake wear, and slows the vehicle's optimal progress. By contrast, xDrive when integrated with DPC will speed up the slower-moving, not slipping wheel (the one with the most traction) in order to maintain stability when needed. For example, during vehicle turning, the outer wheel is overdriven to provide greater acceleration, using the traction advantage through the dynamic loading of the outboard wheel in cornering. Meanwhile, in an oversteer situation, the inner wheel is overdriven to regain traction balance. This provides additional traction across the axle of the vehicle, {{while at the same time}} maintaining more of the vehicle's optimal progress through turns.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} widely {{anticipated}} that for <b>electric</b> vehicles (EVs), <b>clutches</b> and multi-speed gearboxes would not be required, as electric motors can drive the vehicle both forward and reverse from zero speed and typically operate over a wider speed range than combustion engines. Elimination of the gearbox represents {{a significant reduction in}} powertrain weight and complexity, and also removes a notable source of parasitic losses. The majority of first-generation consumer EVs have therefore been single-speed. However, current trends indicate that multi-speed gearboxes are likely to return for many future EVs. This allows the use of smaller, lower torque motors running at higher speeds to achieve both greater torque at the wheels for low speed tractive effort, and higher top road speed. Modest efficiency gains are also possible by reducing the proportion of the time that the motor(s) operate at very low speeds where efficiency is reduced. The wider speed range of motors means that the number of ratios required is lower than for combustion engine vehicles, with two to four speed designs emerging as the optimum depending on application.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 47). The growing technology associated with petroleum equipment has lead to an increase in electrical components used to measure, adjust and control many aspects of the petroleum extraction process. This increase in electrical use has lead to the conversion of many components from hydraulic operation to electric. Therefore, it is the purpose of this report to detail and propose an engineering solution to the electrical conversion of a surface controlled subsea safety valve (SCSSV). Preliminary analysis has resulted in the following important functional requirements that the SCSSV should operate within: Temperatures up to 350 F. Estimated operational life of 20 years. Peak available power of 4300 W (actual value will be much lower than this due to other power system drains). The three conceptual designs presented in this report are the following: Electric motor actuator with a solenoid latching detent. Linear actuation with a fluid reservoir locking valve. Rotational engagement with an <b>electric</b> locking <b>clutch.</b> After reviewing and comparing these concepts, the last concept was chosen to be further developed. This concept will have the least temperature sensitive components and fewer leak path problem areas. Upon completion of the detailed design phase an electric SCSSV solution has been proposed. The following is a brief list of the performance claims: Power requirement to open: 0. 5 W. Time required to open valve: 10 minutes. Installable inline with 4 - 1 / 2 tubing. Operating temperature range: 20 - 350 F. H?S service certified. Hold open energy requirements 0 ~ 0. 2 W. There are however practical issues that must be addressed to ensure reliable and satisfactory performance of the SCSSV. The actual efficiency of the cylindrical cam mechanism and reliability of the torque overload clutch must be empirically determined due to the number of theoretical assumptions used. Thus these items should be thoroughly tested in order to produce a reliable and satisfactory SCSSV. It is with these claims and working issue that this electrically converted SCSSV be fully developed and installed for electrical petroleum production systems...|$|R
5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with <b>electric</b> motor-driven <b>clutch</b> actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission’s boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee’d GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT’s seven gears allow the GT Line’s diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine’s torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine’s improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT’s development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Cee’d GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{simulation}} model is presented that enables {{a comparison of}} different hybrid topologies, with respect to fuel consumption, emissions and performance. The obtained results stress {{the properties of the}} different topologies and form a foundation for the choice of hybrid topology. The simulation models included in this thesis are the result of collaboration with Petter Strandh at the Division of Combustion Engines, Department of Heat and Power Engineering, Lund University. The studied hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are restricted to those with an internal combustion engine (ICE), an electrical energy storage and at least one electric machine in the driveline. The goal with the work presented in this thesis is to: # 1. Model hybrid topologies as comparable as possible regarding motor models, battery models, control laws, major energy converters and relevant limitations due to speed and torque. # 2. Compare the number of possible topologies, which increase drastically when adding more <b>clutches,</b> <b>electric</b> machines and other components. Therefore only four, however essential, topologies are chosen for the comparison. The four topologies that have been selected are series, parallel, strigear and power split hybrid. The hybrid topologies have been simulated in two different cycles, the demanding highway cycle US 06 and the slower urban cycle ECE 15 with its much smoother accelerations. The reference vehicle in the simulations has been a Toyota Prius, an electric hybrid family car, which is available on the market today. As input for the ICE, measured values from a SAAB naturally aspirated gasoline engine has been used, but scaled to better correspond to the ICE in the real Prius. There are many possible parameters in the simulation models, that are adjustable; vehicle chassis parameters, engine, electric machine(s) and battery size and types, losses models, charging strategies and driver behaviour etc. To investigate all of them is possibly interesting but not realistic in this survey. It is not the aim and the result flow would be overwhelming. Therefore six key parameters are chosen and thereafter adjusted one by one. The chosen ones are ICE dynamic response time constant, battery inner resistance, ICE charging gain, engine and motor sizes and finally maximum vehicle speed. The work presents a limited number of results. The results presented have been chosen to illustrate the impact the individual parameter has to the behaviour of the single topology. The results of the simulated topologies have been compared with measurements made by MTC in Sweden and EPA in USA on a Toyota Prius. The received results can be evaluated with the help of different criteria. Two different criteria are shown {{as an example of how}} the chosen criteria influence the results; the price of fuel consumption and produced emissions respectively a mutual comparison using weight factors. The results from the simulations made, show that the parallel topology is the most efficient alternative. It is also the topology with the lowest complexity. It should be observed that the differences between the strigear and the parallel hybrid do sometimes not exist or turn to be of advantage to the strigear. The parallel topology however turns to be the preferred choice due to its lower complexity...|$|R
