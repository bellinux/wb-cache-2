5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> out the Sejny Uprising. Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more {{opposed to the}} proposed union with Poland (see Międzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising. While locally successful, {{it led to the}} failure of the nationwide coup.|$|E
5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having been swept by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either {{responded to the}} call for boarders or had taken refuge below.

5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was often}} a hazardous task because {{of the necessity of}} flying at slow speeds and at low altitude. The task was made all the more dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the Luftstreitkräfte failed to prevent the British <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.|$|E
5|$|As unrest grew the 64th {{took place}} in an {{incident}} which lays a claim to the first blood of the American War of Independence being shed in Salem, Massachusetts. On 26 February 1775 a supply of weapons and ammunition {{was known to be}} in Salem. The 64th, under their commander Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Leslie, were ordered to seize the weapons. American patriots in Salem were forewarned and tried to prevent the 64th <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> out their orders. In the scuffle that ensued a local Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was slightly injured by a British bayonet. Negotiations prevented any further bloodshed and the 64th withdrew to Boston, their mission a failure.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment that run on carbon-based fuels. It can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} launched {{initiatives to}} exhume the bodies buried at Ovčara in 1993 and 1994, {{but those were}} unsuccessful. A five-member Commission of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary General came to Ovčara to exhume the victims in October 1993. However, they were prevented <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> out their work by the local Croatian Serb administration. After the Croatian Serb authorities blocked several attempts to further investigate the mass grave at Ovčara, still under constant guard by the Russian peacekeepers, the site was visited by then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright in January 1994. She used the occasion to stress U.S. support for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which {{had been set up}} in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In despair, Vitellius {{attempted}} {{to negotiate a}} surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard—the imperial bodyguard—considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> out the treaty.

5|$|Greene {{was born}} in Apponaug, Rhode Island, one of nine {{children}} of Caleb and Sarah Robinson (Greene) Greene. His family had roots in the founding of Rhode Island and in the American Revolutionary War, including General Nathanael Greene, George's second cousin. Caleb was a financially shrewd ship owner and merchant, but the Embargo Act of 1807, which prohibited U.S. vessels <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> goods to other countries, and the War of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties. Young George attended Wrentham Academy and then a Latin grammar school in Providence and hoped to attend Brown University there, but his impoverished father could not afford it, so he moved to New York City and found work in a dry goods store on Pearl Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, {{revenue was}} 816,444 francs, {{and the company}} paid a {{dividend}} of 555,500 francs. The company was able to raise its rates without reducing traffic.

By 1824, the canal was giving annual revenues of 850,000 francs. An 1824 account described a superb water station at Givors on the right bank of the Rhone, an excellent basin at Rive-de-Gier for loading, fine buildings for administration of the canal and spacious shops and warehouses.|$|E

5|$|James Dudley {{began working}} for Jess McMahon in the 1950s, when McMahon was a {{co-owner}} of the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. When McMahon and his partners {{broke away from the}} National Wrestling Alliance to form the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1963, Dudley continued to work for McMahon. Dudley performed many different jobs, <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> buckets of waters to counting ticket sales. Dudley was a close friend of Vincent J. McMahon and continued working for the family when the younger McMahon took over the business from his father; in particular, he drove McMahon's limousine and served as his bodyguard. He has said that he thought of McMahon as a father figure. McMahon later increased Dudley's responsibilities with the company several times, and eventually assigned him to manage Turner's Arena in Washington, D.C., which made Dudley the first African-American to hold such a position in the United States. His role required him to oversee several other events, including the Town and Country Jamboree television show.|$|E
5|$|More than {{a century}} before {{the events of the}} series begin, Fire Lord Sozin, ruler of the Fire Nation, planned a world war to expand his nation's {{territory}} and influence. He was prevented <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> out his plans by Avatar Roku, who was born in the Fire Nation. After Roku's death, the Avatar was reincarnated as an Airbender named Aang. As Aang was then only a child, Sozin saw his chance and proceeded with his militant plans. Because of the threat of Sozin's war, Aang learned about his avatar status when he was only twelve years old. Afraid of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor, Gyatso, he fled his home on his flying bison named Appa. Forced into the ocean by a storm, Aang entered the avatar state and encased them in suspended animation in an iceberg for one hundred years. Sozin, knowing that the avatar's reincarnation cycle mandated that an air nomad was the new avatar, carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads during the passing of a once-a-century comet which increases the Firebenders' power, and continues his world conquest.|$|E
5|$|On 15 December, {{this plan}} was {{worked out with}} the help of the Luftwaffe′s Jagd-Geschwaderkommodore, among them Gotthard Handrick (Jagdabschnittsführer Mittelrhein; Fighter Sector Leader Middle Rhein), Walter Grabmann and Karl Hentschel, commanders of 3. and 5. Jagddivision respectively. It was {{originally}} scheduled to support the Battle of the Bulge, the German Army′s offensive, which began 16 December 1944. However, the same bad weather that prevented the RAF and USAAF from supporting their own ground forces also prevented the Luftwaffe <b>from</b> <b>carrying</b> out the operation. It was therefore not launched until 1 January 1945. By this time, the German Army had lost momentum owing to Allied resistance and clearing weather, which allowed Allied Air Forces to operate. The German Army attempted to restart the attack by launching Operation Northwind (Unternehmen Nordwind). The Luftwaffe was to support this offensive through Bodenplatte.|$|E
