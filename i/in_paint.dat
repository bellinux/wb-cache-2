5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} <b>in</b> <b>paint</b> pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment {{being the most}} common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found <b>in</b> <b>paint,</b> food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of {{that goes into the}} bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.|$|E

5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered <b>in</b> <b>paint</b> such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{tackle the}} problem of image <b>in</b> <b>painting</b> which aims at {{removing}} objects from an image or repairing damaged pictures by replacing the missing regions using {{the information in the}} rest of the scene. The image <b>in</b> <b>painting</b> method proposed here builds on an exemplar-based perspective so as to improve the local consistency of the <b>in</b> <b>painted</b> region. This is done by selecting the optimal patch which maximises the local consistency with respect to abutting candidate patches. The similarity computation generates weights based upon an edge prior and the structural differences between <b>in</b> <b>painting</b> exemplar candidates. This treatment permits the generation of an <b>in</b> <b>painting</b> sequence based on a list of factors. The experiments show that the proposed method delivers a margin of improvement as compared to alternative methods. Full Tex...|$|R
