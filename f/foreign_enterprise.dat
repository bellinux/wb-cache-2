6000|$|His usual indiscretion {{attended}} Goldsmith at {{the very}} outset of his <b>foreign</b> <b>enterprise.</b> He had intended to take shipping at Leith for Holland, but on arriving at that port he found a ship about to sail for Bordeaux, with six agreeable passengers, whose acquaintance he had probably made at the inn. He {{was not a man}} to resist a sudden impulse; so, instead of embarking for Holland, he found himself plowing the seas {{on his way to the}} other side of the Continent. Scarcely had the ship been two days at sea when she was driven by stress of weather to Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Here [...] "of course" [...] Goldsmith and his agreeable fellow-passengers found it expedient to go on shore and [...] "refresh themselves after the fatigues of the voyage." [...] "Of course" [...] they frolicked and made merry until a late hour in the evening, when, in the midst of their hilarity, the door was burst open, and a sergeant and twelve grenadiers entered with fixed bayonets, and took the whole convivial party prisoners.|$|E

50|$|Finally, Deng's {{policy of}} asserting {{the primacy of}} {{economic}} development, while maintaining {{the rule of the}} Communist Party, has raised questions about its legitimacy.

Questions have also been raised about the amount of <b>foreign</b> <b>enterprise</b> within China, and the time it takes before the government will no longer be able to effectively control private enterprise to fit their standards.|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{agglomeration}} {{has been}} pervasive owing to natural advantages, spillover effects and institutional advantages. The co-agglomeration of <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>enterprises</b> {{may be a}} driving force of intra-industrial agglomeration. Theories however provide conflicting predictions on whether <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>enterprises</b> share similar locations. Based on data from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms in 2005 in China, this study finds that <b>foreign</b> <b>enterprises</b> are considerably more agglomerated than domestic enterprises, and there exist significant industrial variations in the intra-industry co-agglomeration of <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>enterprises.</b> Statistical analysis suggests that foreign-specific agglomeration and dependence on intermediate inputs from primary industries discourage the co-agglomeration of <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>enterprises.</b> Differences in equipment, technology and labour productivity result in locational patterns of <b>foreign</b> <b>enterprises</b> distinct from those of domestic enterprises. Meanwhile statistical results confirm the positive role of external economies and knowledge spillover effects in driving the co-agglomeration of <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>enterprises.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Besides Ikeda's {{adherence}} to government intervention and {{regulation of the}} economy, his government pushed trade liberalization. By April 1960, trade imports had been 41 percent liberalized (compared to 22 percent in 1956). Ikeda planned to liberalize trade to 80 percent within three years. His plans however met severe opposition from both industries who had thrived on over-loaning and the nationalist public who feared <b>foreign</b> <b>enterprise</b> takeovers. The Japanese press likened liberalization to [...] "the second coming of the black ships," [...] "the defenselessness of the Japanese islands {{in the face of}} attack from huge foreign capitalist powers," [...] and [...] "the readying of the Japanese economy for a bloodstained battle between national capital and foreign capital." [...] Ikeda's income-doubling plan was largely a response to this growing opposition and widespread panic over liberalization, adopted to quell public protests. Ikeda's motivations were purely pragmatic and foreign policy based however. He moved toward liberalization of trade only after securing a protected market through internal regulations that favored Japanese products and firms.|$|E
5000|$|Castile {{as a whole}} {{enjoyed the}} status as the {{dominant}} group within Spain. Even before specific Castilianization efforts by the Bourbons and Franco, Castilian was {{the language of the}} bureaucracy, which discriminated against non-Castilian-speaking Spaniards. Further, the Spanish Empire was more of a Castilian empire, as the Americas were only officially open to Castilians (though that referred to inhabitants of Castile in contrast to the Crown of Aragon or Navarre, and so Galicians, etc., could still go), and most of the trade was channeled through Seville and later Cadiz (both of which are actually in Andalusia, but were part of the Kingdom of Castile. Castile had its own particular disadvantages as well, though. Regions like Catalonia refused to support Spain’s military efforts or its finances, as it perceived such efforts as a <b>foreign</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Therefore, Castilians bore the brunt of the taxes until the Bourbons. [...] It can sometimes be unclear whether “Castilian” always refers to just Castile or to the whole Kingdom of Castile in Spain when referring to such things as Castilian taxes or how only Castilians could go to the Americas. The map to the right shows the basic divisions of Spanish law and indicates that this did include those other regions, yet the fact that they can be referred to under a broad “Castile” shows that groups dominance over the others. The map at the top which shows the progress of the Reconquista linguistically also shows how Castilian continued expanding into new territory, especially after 1500. Because of this dominance, Castile did not have to fight for an identity in contrast to a competing identity. Instead, Castilian identity (and also Andalusian identity) is largely a collection of competing municipal identities (e.g. Madrid, Toledo, Burgos, Valladolid, etc.). At the same time, Castillian-ness became increasingly associated with Spanish-ness to the exclusion of other areas.|$|E
