5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and <b>ionise,</b> creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a Coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself. All alkali metals melt {{as a part of the}} reaction with water. Water molecules <b>ionise</b> the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{toroidal}} pinch concept as a route to fusion was explored in the UK during the mid-1940s, especially by George Paget Thomson of Imperial College London. With {{the formation of}} the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell in 1945, Thomson repeatedly petitioned the director, John Cockcroft, for funds to develop an experimental machine. These requests were turned down. At the time there was no obvious military use, so the concept was left unclassified. This allowed Thomson and Moses Blackman to patent the idea in 1947, describing a device using just enough pinch current to <b>ionise</b> and briefly confine the plasma while being heated by a microwave source that would also continually drive the current.|$|E

25|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{predicted that the}} system would have a practical detection range {{on the order of}} , but never managed to stretch this much beyond 3 miles. Much of this was due to the inefficient system being used to blank out the receiver during the transmission pulse, which wasted most of the radio energy. This final piece of the puzzle was provided by Arthur Cooke, who suggested using the Sutton tube filled with a dilute gas as a switch, replacing the spark gap system. During transmission, the power of the magnetron would cause the gas to <b>ionise,</b> presenting an almost perfect radio mirror that would prevent the signal from reaching the output. When the pulse ended the gas would rapidly de-ionise, allowing signals to flow across (or around) the cavity and reach the output. Skinner took up development of the concept with Ward and Starr, initially trying helium and hydrogen, but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon. The resulting design, known as a soft Sutton tube, went into production as the CV43 and the first examples arrived in the summer of 1941.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ionising</b> {{radiation}} {{is commonly used}} {{in the treatment of}} colorectal cancer. Tumour cells with mutant p 53 undergo cell cycle arrest at G 2 /M after <b>ionising</b> radiation and evidence suggests that abrogation of this G 2 arrest can lead to a premature, aberrant mitosis, thus enhancing <b>ionising</b> radiation-induced cell killing. The G 2 checkpoint inhibitor UCN- 01 was thus investigated to determine whether it would abrogate the G 2 checkpoint induced by 5 [*]Gy <b>ionising</b> radiation in a range of colorectal tumour cell lines. Data presented show that, at doses that are alone non-toxic to the cells, UCN- 01 inhibits the <b>ionising</b> radiation-induced G 2 checkpoint in five colorectal tumour cell lines with mutant p 53. The ability of UCN- 01 to sensitise cells to <b>ionising</b> radiation-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis was also investigated and UCN- 01 was found to radiosensitise two out of five cell lines. These results were confirmed by long-term colony forming efficiency studies. These results demonstrate that abrogation of the <b>ionising</b> radiation-induced G 2 checkpoint is not necessarily associated with sensitisation to <b>ionising</b> radiation, however, some colorectal tumour cell lines can be radiosensitised by UCN- 01. Although the mechanism of radiosensitisation is not clear, this may still be an important treatment strategy...|$|R
40|$|Dedicated to Prof. Dr. Dr. J. B ttner on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday Summary: <b>Ionised</b> and total magnesium concentrations were determined in the serum of different groups of patients suffering from renal or hepatic diseases. <b>Ionised</b> magnesium was measured by Microlyte 6 (KONE, Espoo, Finland) and total magnesium by atomic absorption spectrometry. In renal insufficiency <b>ionised</b> and total magnesium concentrations were almost equally increased. In proteinuria with a normal glomerular filtration rate, "pseudohypomagnesaemia " was observed, i. e. decreased total magnesium concentration in parallel with a decreased albumin concentration with no significant change in the concentration of <b>ionised</b> magnesium. Hypermagnesaemia occurred in liver diseases combined with renal insufficiency, whereas "pseudohypomagnesae-mia " was most often found in the absence of renal failure. Also treatment with an aldosterone antagonist was associated with a normal <b>ionised</b> magnesium concentration, but the total magnesium concentration was decreased; when additional magnesium was administered, the total magnesium concentration approached a normal value, while <b>ionised</b> magnesium slightly exceeded reference values. Only during cyclosporin treatment did both <b>ionised</b> and total magnesium concentrations become lowered. However, the decrease of total magnesium exceeded that of <b>ionised</b> magnesium due to concomitant hypoalbuminaemia with reduction of the protein-bound fraction. It is conclude...|$|R

40|$|Most of the ion {{production}} in the atmosphere is attributed to <b>ionising</b> radiation. In the lower atmosphere, <b>ionising</b> radiation consists mainly of the decay emissions of radon and its progeny, gamma radiation of the terrestrial origin as well as photons and elementary particles of cosmic radiation. These types of radiation produce ion pairs via the ionisation of nitrogen and oxygen as well as trace species in the atmosphere, the rate of which {{is defined as the}} <b>ionising</b> capacity. Larger air ions are produced out of the initial charge carriers by processes such as clustering or attachment to pre-existing aerosol particles. This study aimed (1)  to identify the key factors responsible for the variability in <b>ionising</b> radiation and in the observed air ion concentrations, (2)  to reveal the linkage between them and (3)  to provide an in-depth analysis into the effects of <b>ionising</b> radiation on air ion formation, based on measurement data collected during 2003 – 2006 from a boreal forest site in southern Finland. In general, gamma radiation dominated the ion {{production in}} the lower atmosphere. Variations in the <b>ionising</b> capacity came from mixing layer dynamics, soil type and moisture content, meteorological conditions, long-distance transportation, snow cover attenuation and precipitation. Slightly similar diurnal patterns to variations in the <b>ionising</b> capacity were observed in air ion concentrations of the cluster size (0. 8 – 1. 7  nm in mobility diameters). However, features observed in the 0. 8 – 1  nm ion concentration were in good connection to variations of the <b>ionising</b> capacity. Further, by carefully constraining perturbing variables, a strong dependency of the cluster ion concentration on the <b>ionising</b> capacity was identified, proving the functionality of <b>ionising</b> radiation in air ion {{production in the}} lower atmosphere. This relationship, however, was only clearly observed on new particle formation (NPF) days, possibly indicating that charges after being born underwent different processes on NPF days and non-event days and also that the transformation of newly formed charges to cluster ions occurred in a shorter timescale on NPF days than on non-event days...|$|R

50|$|While {{passing through}} the detector, a {{particle}} will <b>ionise</b> the gas atoms by pulling up an electron creating an electron/ion pair (1). When no electric field is applied, the ion/electron pair recombines and nothing happens. But here, within an electric field {{in the order of}} 400 V/cm the electron will drift (2) toward the amplification electrode (the mesh) and the ion toward the cathode. When the electron arrives close to the mesh (3), it enters an intense electric field (typically on the order of 4 kV/cm in the amplification gap).Accelerated by this field, the electron reaches enough energy to produce ion/electron pairs that will also <b>ionise</b> the gas, creating pairs; it’s the avalanche effect (4). By this means, several thousand pairs are created from hundreds of primary charges, which originate from the interactions with the impinging particle. The primary charges need to be multiplied to create a significant signal. A last, we read the electronic signal on the readout electrode (5) by a charge amplifier. The readout electrode is usually segmented in strips and/or pixels in order to obtain the position of the impinging particle in the detector. The amplitude and the shape of the signal, read via the electronic on the readout electrode, gives information on the time and energy of the particle.|$|E
