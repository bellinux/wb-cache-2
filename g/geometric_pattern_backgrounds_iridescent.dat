My primary reasons for working with Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> are two-fold. First, they include both mathematical and artistic aspects, and second, they contain a vast amount of symbolism that I can utilize for my projects. During my projects the symbolic aspect of my works has changed; the symbolic language in my projects evolved form an abstract and ancient language of symbols to a language of more dynamic, current and mundane symbols. To utilize Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> in my investigation on how to combine mathematics and visual arts, my methodology was to use these patterns in my projects.

40|$|Developing {{the ability}} to {{recognize}} a landmark from a visual image of a robot's current location is a fundamental problem in robotics. We consider the problem of PAC-learning the concept class of <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> where the target <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> is a configuration of k points in the real line. Each instance is a configuration of n points on the real line, where it is labeled according {{to whether or not}} it visually resembles the target pattern. To capture the notion of visual resemblance we use the Hausdorff metric. Informally, two <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> P and Q resemble each other under the Hausdorff metric, if every point on one pattern is "close" to some point on the other pattern. We relate the concept class of <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> to the landmark recognition problem and then present a polynomial-time algorithm that PAC-learns the class of one-dimensional <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> when the negative examples are corrupted by a large amount of random misclassification noise.
