25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E
2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would get into trouble if we went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|E
2500|$|While at a {{cocktail}} party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over {{to talk to him}} about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
60|$|Yesterday <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> Hegel or Schlegel or Whegel {{gives the}} truest view of life.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could write}} home {{for him or}} do {{anything}} else. That seemed to touch him. Some day I shall {{tell you what he}} said.|$|R
60|$|Chance sent {{me almost}} {{immediately}} after the Jutland fight a Lieutenant {{of one of the}} destroyers engaged. Among other matters, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> there was any particular noise.|$|R
2500|$|Rivers {{had visited}} his college {{frequently}} {{during the war}} although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the Royal Air Force in 1919, the college created a new office for him – [...] "Praelector of Natural Science Studies" [...] – and {{he was given a}} free rein to do as he pleased. As Leonard E. Shore recalled in 1923: [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would undertake that work... his eyes shone with a new light I had not seen before, and he paced his rooms for several minutes full of delight." [...] He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at St. Johns, Cambridge, and at other colleges. He would arrange [...] "At Homes" [...] in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called The Socratics and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in Conflict and Dream), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. [...] They shared Socialist sympathies.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Jeph Loeb {{requested}} {{the introduction of}} Superman’s future ally, Metropolis Police Lieutenant Maggie Sawyer, for the episode [...] "Insurgence". As Loeb recalls, [...] "Ken [...] had written a hard-bitten, crusty kind of cop. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> minded {{if it was a}} woman, and explained who Maggie Sawyer was and the role she would play in the future." [...] The concept for [...] "Insurgence" [...] also developed from an aspect of the Superman mythology that stemmed back to Superman’s original incarnation, which was his ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound. After their Thanksgiving break, the [...] "Smallville" [...] writers were in the writers' room when Miles Millar walked in and exclaimed, [...] "I think it's time for Clark to leap a tall building." [...] Jeph Loeb and the other writers had already been trying to develop a story that involved a hostage situation, and after Millar made his announcement the team suggested that they also pay homage to the Bruce Willis action film Die Hard. The setting for the hostage situation was LuthorCorp Plaza; the team introduced the [...] "Daily Planet", another pivotal piece of Superman lore that would one day employ Clark Kent and his alternate identity of Superman, by using it as the building that Clark uses to execute his [...] "first leap". [...] "Insurgence" [...] was actually written before [...] "Visage" [...] and [...] "Suspect", but not filmed until after both of those episodes because the team was having difficulty figuring out the logistics of producing the episode. Afterward, the episode would be scheduled to air between [...] "Visage" [...] and [...] "Suspect".|$|E
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. She took his arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is enough,' the {{man said}} at last brusquely. 'I cannot {{understand}} him, but I want that picture. He is a better artist than <b>I.</b> <b>Ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he will sell it.' ...|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT. But, my dear, Doolan's a publican: a most {{influential}} man. By the way, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> {{his wife would}} be at home tomorrow. He said she would; so you must take the motor car round and call on her.|$|R
60|$|At {{intervals}} <b>I</b> {{talked to}} <b>him,</b> <b>asking</b> {{after all the}} other members of the community by name. At last, thinking only of Rima, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> any other person or persons besides his people came to the wood now or lived there.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had any {{particular}} or definite office in view.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> yet {{proposed}} to himself any time for going away.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} that this {{was such a great}} scandal after all.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{opportunity}} for which I {{have been waiting}} has come at last. Mr. Mountjoy is, I believe, fully recovered. This morning, seeing him so well and strong, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might venture to place in his hands a paper containing a narrative.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> the Andes were a mere wall of mountains, {{contiguous}} {{and without}} intervals and spaces, like a fortification, or boundary to a country? {{or whether they}} lay promiscuous, and distant from one another? and whether there lay any way over them into the country beyond? ...|$|R
60|$|I thanked him, {{and told}} him dryly that, as I had no secrets to divulge and none that I cared to hear, it made no {{difference}} to me. As this seemed to increase his confusion and he still hesitated before the door, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> Captain Jim was with him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{would return}} {{at once to}} Upper Egypt, where he had his bishopric.|$|E
60|$|Having {{accepted}} his courtesy, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been long}} a domestic at Osbaldistone Hall.|$|E
60|$|Joe recited this couplet {{with such}} {{manifest}} pride and careful perspicuity, that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had made it}} himself.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had heard}} {{about some of these}} things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> there warn't any good-luck signs. He says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MR. MORGAN (excitedly): 'Mr. Chairman--I do most strenuously {{object to}} this amendment. The gentleman from Oregon is old, and {{furthermore}} is bulky only in bone--not in flesh. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{the gentleman from}} Virginia if it is soup we want instead of solid sustenance? if he would delude us with shadows? if he would mock our suffering with an Oregonian specter? <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he can look upon the anxious faces around <b>him,</b> <b>if</b> he can gaze into our sad eyes, if he can listen to the beating of our expectant hearts, and still thrust this famine-stricken fraud upon us? <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he can think of our desolate state, of our past sorrows, of our dark future, and still unpityingly foist upon us this wreck, this ruin, this tottering swindle, this gnarled and blighted and sapless vagabond from Oregon's inhospitable shores? Never!' [Applause.] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> then <b>asked</b> {{the fellow}} {{if he could}} direct us to Ryde or Newport; but again he shook his head, {{and said that he}} never had heard of such countries. And when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> there were any cities in this country {{he did not know what}} I meant, never having heard the word cities.|$|R
60|$|Hollis ceased. But {{before we}} {{rose from the}} table <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew {{what had become of}} Laughing Anne’s boy.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} {{to take part}} in the feast, as the splendour of his apparel brought me to believe.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused for}} a moment, while <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could {{remember}} {{the nature of the}} country through which he had journeyed.|$|E
60|$|Still added days went by. Whether Bartleby's eyes {{improved}} or not, I {{could not}} say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, {{he would do}} no copying. At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed {{me that he had}} permanently given up copying.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said, 'Is it you, my lord?' and {{the answer}} was, 'Who mocks me with that title?' <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could help him, and he {{answered}} with a voice I shall never forget, 'Food--food! I die of famine!' So I came hither to tell you. What is to be done? Shall we alarm the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Glancing at Fyne out of {{the corner}} of one eye I {{discovered}} that he was attentive. He made the remark that I should have said all this to his wife. It was a sensible enough remark. But I had given Mrs Fyne up. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> his impression was that his wife meant to entrust him with a letter for her brother? ...|$|R
60|$|As we {{went along}} in silence I noticed that Peterkin sighed {{once or twice}} very heavily, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was quite well.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{night when}} Jem and I were talking things over in Rainbow Valley, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had ever felt afraid at the front.|$|E
6000|$|He half demurred, {{but took}} the track, [...] And silence held the scene; I saw his figure {{rambling}} back; [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had been.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> ever he {{had been}} on the coast of Congo. He said, yes, he had, but was never on shore there. Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> how we should get from thence to the coast where the European ships came, seeing, if the land trended away west for 1500 miles, we must have all that shore to {{traverse}} before we could double the west point of it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> {{this was}} the same young lady I saw a day or two before I went to town? He really could not remember. Was she a girl with dark hair and blue eyes? <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> further. He really couldn't tell what colour her eyes were. He was very unobservant except as to the peculiarities of footpaths, on which he was an authority.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could cut}} it {{which he was}} glad - we were very close friends. So I carved a head and {{it must have been}} an awful-looking thing. At the time, I called it Lucifer, looked like Lucifer. At the Armory Show, they put it right up at the {{entrance}} as you came in, and here was this head on a stand.|$|R
