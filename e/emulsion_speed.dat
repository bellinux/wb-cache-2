40|$|When a {{concentrated}} contact is lubricated {{at low speed}} by an oil-in-water emulsion, a film of pure oil typically separates the surfaces (Stage 1). At higher speeds, starvation occurs (Stage 2) and the film is thinner than would be expected if lubricated by neat oil. However, at the very highest speeds, film thickness increases again (Stage 3), though little is known for certain about either the film composition or the mechanism of lubrication, despite some theoretical speculation.

40|$|This thesis uses an unsensitized {{emulsion}} and two chemically sensitized emulsions {{to investigate}} the effect of oxygen and water vapor on latent-image formation and stability. At exposure times that cause little or no low-intensity reciprocity failure, vacuum treatment of an emulsion can result in photographic speeds significantly lower than those found in a humidified environment. This is presumably due to competition between internal desensitization sites and surface electron traps for conduction-band electrons. Storage of a latent image in a humidified air environment will induce a speed loss in some emulsions. The unsensitized emulsion was most sensitive to environmental factors while the sulfurplus- gold-sensitized emulsion was not. This is presumably due to the composition {{and size of the}} latent image. Maximum changes in photographic speed over time require the presence of both oxygen and water vapor. Oxygen alone may cause latent-image decay in some emulsions. Water vapor in a nitrogen environment did not affect latent-image stability. Extended development and gold latensification restored some of the speed loss observed with the unsensitized <b>emulsion.</b> The unrecovered <b>speed</b> loss is due to either latent-image centers being completely oxidized, or being too small to respond to chemical latensification...|$|R

40|$|Enamelled wire is a {{conductive}} wire {{coated with}} a very thin layer of insulation, widely used in the field that requires tight coils of wire. The traditional enamelled wire is produced by liquid paint, which consists of resins, solvents, pigments, and additives. Organic solvent takes a relatively high content, normally of 75 % to 90 % by weight. Many efforts {{have been made to}} decrease the percentage of solvent in the insulation paint. On the other hand, increasing the solids content of given enamel results in the viscosity rises significantly, making it harder to flow. Therefore, powder coating technology as an alternative is developed in the production of enamelled wire, not only benefits the environment but also cuts cost of solvent. Mechanical and chemical methods to prepare the fine powder of PVF type enamelled wire coating are reported in this thesis. For gradual solvent evaporation method, kinetics and thermodynamics of the fabrication of microspheres are adopted from reference to predict the operating parameters, such as the solidification time. Factors affecting average particle size and particle size distribution are investigated as well. Phase ratio of emulsion system (DP/CP), <b>emulsion</b> agitation <b>speed,</b> types and dosage of emulsifier, co-solvent and stabilizer are all taken into account. When the DP/CP was 1 / 15, the resins percentage in DP was 12 wt%, the stirring speed was 6000 r/min, 1 wt% SDS was used as emulsifier, 1 wt% N-octanol and 0. 5 wt% PVA were employed as co-solvent and stabilizer, the powder of average particle size at around 12 micron can be obtained. Initial PVF enamelled wire coating formulation, as adopted from references of liquid insulation paint, which consists of PVF-E resin, novolac epoxy resin and melamine resin, produced a non-continuous coating finish with many tiny holes formed during curing. This may be attributed to the thermal properties of PVF-E resin or the inappropriate ratio among the different components in the formulation. After that BPA epoxy and its hardener were introduced to the initial formulation to improve the surface quality of coating finish. Then, the paint formulation, powder spraying and curing conditions are optimized. The recommended formulation is with mole ratio of PVF-K, OCFER and melamine resin at 100 : 375 : 119, and with proper dosage of degassing and flow agent.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe chief {{problem of}} this {{research}} was to study by standard sensitometric procedures the effects of intensity, time and wavelength on the amount of speed increase which might be obtained from four representative slow, regular, high, and extra high <b>speed</b> <b>emulsions</b> (Royal Pan, Aerial Recon type 1 -B Class L, Plus X and Microfile) by latensification. Latensification has been defined simply as a process applied after exposure and before development to increase the speed or sensitivity (reciprocal of the exposure required to produce a given result) of an emulsion. A secondary purpose was to examine latensification of a very slow, fine grain emulsion for possible use in small high quality aerial camera systems, in which the emulsion graininess is the limiting factor when used with conventional high <b>speed</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The latensification method in this case was post-exposure to radiation from 0. 36 to 0. 68 microns. This spectral range was divided into four bands by the Wratten Filters # 25 A, 58 and 47 B, (red, green and blue respectively) and the Corning 7 - 54, ultraviolet. White light was also used. A tungsten lamp of constant intensity, combined with a ground glass and two inch opal glass disk diffuser produced a source of uniform illumination. Normally exposed sensitometric strips were then subject to laten sification by exposure to radiation in which the spectral region, intensity, and time were varied. Each emulsion was subject to four spectral regions plus white light and four intensity levels for each region. The exposure was then extended over a range of time believed sufficient to reach a peak speed increase for that intensity. Reciprocity failure was sufficient to need considerable attention. The characteristic curves were analyzed by measuring ASA, halfgamma and inertia (H & D) speeds. The speed ratios (latensified speed/control speed) obtained for each spectral region, intensity, and time of exposure were compiled. Curves of speed ratio against time of exposure and fog level against required exposure time for each intensity and spectral region were plotted. These experiments have shown that white light may be used most efficiently in latensification with the panchromatic emulsions tested. In addition to this {{it has been shown that}} the short wavelength region is less effective in producing speed gains than is the long wavelength region. It has been explained that these effects may be due primarily to the greater scattering of the blue and ultra-violet light by the emulsion even though the Gurney-Mott theory of latent image formation would indicate otherwise if these other influences were n ot considered. The overall evaluation attests to the fact that the effect of wavelength is a secondary consideration as compared to the intensity of radiation used to latensify the emulsion. Optimum intensity, when applied with the proper length of exposure time to produce a fog lievel approximately double the normal fog, is the major factor leading to optimum conditions of speed gain. The maximum speed ratio gains achieved for each emulsion were Royal Pan 2. 24, Aerial Recon 1. 85, Plus X 2. 08, and Microfile 7. 35. Generally speaking the slower the emulsion the better the gains which may be achieved. Royal Pan, however, was an exception and produced unexpected results in speed gain. The results obtained with Microfile indicate this fine grain emulsion may possibly be employed in miniature camera systems for use in aerial photography. A less active developer than normally used D- 11 must be used to reduce contrast to a comparable degree ordinarily used in aerial photography. The effect of forced development in D- 11 was found not to produce speed gains as high as the less active development in D- 23, Development in Microdol (1 : 4) proved of little interest as speed loss was excessive. This speed loss is characteristic of most true fine-grain developers...|$|R
40|$|Single-phase (neat oil) and {{two-phase}} (oil-in-water emulsions) lubricants {{are widely}} used in metal forming processes, where speeds as high as 20 m s- 1 are reached. Most of the previous work done on both neat oil and on oil-in-water emulsions has focused on low speed behaviour (below 5 m s- 1) and, as a result, the low speed behaviour of oil-in-water emulsions is well understood. Under these conditions, the lubricating oil film is composed predominantly of oil and {{the thickness of the}} film is similar to that for neat oil. However, the behaviour at high speed is entirely different. No experimental film thickness and friction results at speeds above 5 m s- 1 are available for neat oil and only one study (Zhu et al., 1994) has reported the film thickness behaviour of oil-in- water <b>emulsions</b> above this <b>speed</b> whereas no friction measurements at speeds above 3. 5 m s- 1 have been carried out using oil-in-water emulsions. Consequently, to date, the behaviour of neat oil and the relation of emulsion composition to film forming ability at high rolling speeds could not be described. This project is aimed at investigating the mechanism of film formation and the film forming and friction properties of single-phase and two-phase lubricants in high speed rolling/sliding contacts. An EHD test rig was modified to measure film thickness and friction of oil-inwater emulsions in very high speed, rolling/sliding conditions (up to a mean rolling speed of 20 m s- 1). Ultrathin film interferometry was used to investigate film thickness while infrared temperature mapping of the contact was used to obtain maps showing the rate of heat input into the surface, from which shear stresses and friction could be calculated. Light induced fluorescence was also employed using a water-soluble and an oil-soluble dye to allow visualization of the contact (at low speeds) and help in investigating the composition of the entrained lubricant at these high speeds. Results showed that, for neat oils, the major factor affecting the film formed at high speed is shear heating. For dilute emulsions at the highest speeds, the film thickness and friction are close to those obtained with pure water. More concentrated emulsions give slightly higher film thicknesses. A comparison of the results with earlier theoretical predictions was carried out. Together with the fluorescence results, this suggested that high speed leads to the entrainment of a micro-emulsion.

40|$|In diamond {{grinding}} cutting forces {{affect the}} quality of the machined surface. We can estimate a wear rate of the diamond wheel by the magnitude of the forces and promptly resort to the restoration of its cutting properties. To solve this problem it is necessary to define a relationship between grinding wheel wear and cutting forces. There was no this dependence found in the sources of literature. The forces acting on a single worn diamond grain are considered to find the relationship between wheel wear and cutting forces. The main forces acting on the diamond grain are such as a reaction force of machining material, a frictional force over a worn place of the grain, and a total pressure on the contact surface of the grain and machining material. According to calculation results, in grinding the cutting forces are proportional to the hardness of machining material, and depend on the grain wear, {{as well as on the}} process operation conditions. The paper presents a technique for calculating the number of cutting (active) grains per unit surface of diamond wheel to determine a total cutting force in grinding. The number of cutting grains depends on the properties of diamond wheel and on the operation conditions of grinding process. During grinding a total cutting force is calculated through the single grain cutting force, the number of cutting grains per unit surface of the grinding wheel and the contact area between the wheel and the work piece. Theoretical calculation of the forces is based on the condition that protrusions of all cutting grains are identical and all grains have a maximum wear, i. e. maximum worn place of grain. Calculations based on proposed theoretical formulas are compared with the calculations from the empirical formulas given in the literature. Varying the operation conditions of grinding makes the comparison. Convergence of results in the range of 5 - 20 % is regarded as acceptable. On the BMSTU base flat diamond grinding of tungsten carbide (Т 15 К 6) work pieces was experimentally made. Experiments were carried out on the universal flat-grinding machine 3 G 71 M using a diamond grinding wheel 6 А 2 250 х 20 х 4 х 29 х 76 АС 6 160 / 125 А 1 100 % М 1 - 01  according to GOST 16170 - 91. When using this equipment, cutting operation conditions, namely grinding speed and longitudinal table feed were 35 m/s and 3 - 12 m/min, respectively. The work piece was clamped in a vise. Vise was set on the universal attachment. Device was installed on a three-component dynamometer brands Kistler 9257 B to measure cutting forces. Grinding was carried out under the following operation conditions: traverse Strav= 3 m/min, depth of cutting t = 20 μm. Grinding used a water-based cooling <b>emulsion.</b> Wheel <b>speed</b> was 35 m/s. The dynamometer was tuned to the frequency of signal equal to 250 Hz. After processing the experimental and calculated data were compared using the theoretical formulas. The maximum difference between them was 17 %. Owing to the presented model it is possible to obtain data on the diamond tool wear during cutting through a change of the tangential component of the cutting force. With the definite maximum wear of diamond wheel it is possible to calculate a threshold value of the tangential component of the cutting force. When the threshold value of the tangential component of the cutting force is reached, a diamond wheel must be subjected to dressing. On-time wheel dressing allows us to avoid reducing quality of the machined surface. Control of forces in the cutting zone is difficult to organize; the procedure can be performed by power control of the grinding spindle through the current control. </p...|$|R
40|$|Protein-surfactant {{mixtures}} {{appear in}} many industrial and biological applications. Indeed, a fluid as vital as blood contains {{a mixture of}} serum albumin proteins with various other smaller surface-active components. Proteins and other surface active molecules are often adsorbed at an air-liquid or liquid-liquid interface due to favorable thermodynamics, and these interfaces {{play a role in}} such diverse fields as stabilizing foams and <b>emulsions,</b> controlling high <b>speed</b> coatings, the blood clotting process, designing synthetic replacements of biological fluids, etc. It is thus important to understand the interfacial behavior of protein-surfactant mixtures, especially the role it can play in bulk measurements of material properties. A complete description of the dynamics of these multi-component systems is still elusive. In this thesis, a comprehensive study of the rheology of a model globular protein solution is described. In conventional bulk rheological studies of globular protein solutions a yield-like behavior and shear thinning in the viscosity at low shear rates is observed, even for concentrations as low as 0. 03 % by weight. Typical explanations for this yield stress involve the introduction of long range colloidal forces that are stronger than electrostatic forces, and which stabilize a colloidal structure formed by the protein molecules. However, evidence for this structure from small angle X-ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering is lacking. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, it will be shown using interfacial steady and oscillatory shear experiments how the yield-like behavior observed in bulk rheology in fact arises out of a purely interfacial effect. We show that the yield-like behavior and shear-thinning observed in bulk rheology can be modeled by treating the interfacial layer of the adsorbed protein as a pure plastic material that yields at a critical strain. This model also accounts for the geometric dependence seen in bulk rheology experiments. The second part of this thesis investigates the rheological consequences of adding low molecular weight surfactants to globular protein solutions. Because non-ionic surfactants compete for the interface with the protein molecules, the resulting dynamics at the fluid interface can be complex. In addition to steady and oscillatory interfacial shear rheology, a new phenomenon called interfacial creep ringing-a term used to denote the periodic oscillations arising from the coupling between instrument inertia and interface elasticity-arises. It is demonstrated how these damped inertioelastic oscillations can be used to rapidly estimate interfacial viscoelastic moduli and also study the effect of the addition of non-ionic surfactants to globular protein solutions. We show that exploiting the interfacial creep ringing technique is useful as a way to rapidly determine the effects of interfacial viscoelasticity. It is also observed that increasing the concentration of the competing surfactant leads to progressively decreasing ringing frequencies and amplitudes, until visible ringing completely disappears beyond a certain concentration. Finally, we indicate future avenues of work including surface particle tracking to study these complex dynamics of protein surfactant mixtures. by Aditya Jaishankar. Thesis (S. M.)

Key issues for the fabrication of interconnected porous gypsum are the regulation of the setting ability of heat treated gypsum spheres and the regulation of gypsum’s crystal growth location. In Chapter 5, interconnected porous carbonate apatite(IP-CO_ 3 Ap) was fabricated by using gypsum spheres as a precursor. However heat temperature for dehydration of gypsum spheres affected the conversion to CO_ 3 Ap. The IP-CO_ 3 Ap was B-type CO_ 3 Apwith approximately 9 wt%CO_ 3 ^ in apatitic structure and 78 % apparent porosity. This is enough strength for handling property, therefore, it is expected to be an ideal bone substitute. In Chapter 6, tissue response to IP-CO_ 3 Ap microsphere was investigated by implanting the specimen into the bone defect made at rat calvaria. Micro-CT results demonstrated that new bone formation was observed outside of the specimen. Histological result indicated that specimen was in contact with new bone. Therefore, osteoconductivity of IP-CO_ 3 Ap was confirmed. Further studies are awaited based on the results obtained in this initial in vivo study. In conclusion, CO_ 3 Apdeveloped in the present study can be applicable for a constituent of bone substitute with a 3 -dimensional porous structure...|$|R
