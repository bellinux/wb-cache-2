All TCL patients failing first-line systemic therapy {{in the province of}} Modena were identified from Modena Cancer Registry between 1997 and 2010. A total of 53 patients were analysed. Regarding the type of failure, 18 patients relapsed, and 35 progressed during first treatment. Among relapsed patients, the median time from <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> to relapse after first treatment was 6. 2 [*]months (range 1. 87 - 102). A total of 18 patients (34 %) died before receiving salvage treatment, 21 received platinum or gemcitabine-containing regimens (7 addressed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)), 12 other CT regimens; 2 received radiotherapy (RT). The median survival after relapse (SAR) was 2. 5 [*]months. After a median follow-up for living patients after failure of 35 [*]months (range 8 - 111 [*]months), 44 patients died, and {{the cause of death was}} found to be lymphoma progression in all (98 %) but one of them. The median SAR was 2. 5 [*]months. The 3 -year SAR was 19 %. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses for SAR were performed. In multivariate analysis, performance status and type of failure were associated with a higher risk of death after relapse. The outcome of TCL patients failing first-line therapy is poor. Only a few cases that could receive ASCT had promising chances of long remission. There is urgent need for novel agents for patients requiring second-line treatment.

40|$|GCIG) {{believes}} that definitions for re-sponse and progression of ovarian can-cer according to serum CA 125 levels should {{be incorporated into}} ovarian can-cer clinical trial protocols for relapse therapy. Although the GCIG is con-vinced {{of the value of}} the definition of progression that incorporates both Re-sponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu-mors (RECIST) and CA 125 criteria and which should be used to define date of progression (1, 2), the response defini-tion as defined by Rustin (3) could ben-efit from further simplification. On the basis of the available data and extensive discussions among the cooperative groups within the GCIG, we recommend that the following definition of response be used in ovarian cancer trials so that response can be measured by either RECIST or CA 125 criteria. If the re-sponse is evaluable by both criteria, then the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> will be the date of the earlier of the two events. A response according to CA 125 has occurred if there is at least a 50 % reduc-tion in CA 125 levels from a pretreatment sample. The response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days. Pa-tients can be evaluated according to CA 125 only if they have a pretreatment sam-ple that is at least twice the upper limit of normal and within 2 weeks prior to start-ing treatment. The date when the CA 125 level is first reduced by 50 % is the date of the CA 125 response. To calculate CA 125 responses accurately, the following rules apply: 1) Intervening samples and the 28 -day confirmatory sample must be less than or equal to (within an assay variability of 10 %) the previous sample. 2) Variations within the normal range of CA 125 levels will not interfere with the response definition. We recommend that, in an ideal situation, CA 125 mea-surements be taken at specific time in-tervals. The first sample would be col-lected within 2 weeks before treatment is started, and later samples would be collected at intervals of 2 – 4 weeks dur-ing treatment and at intervals of every...|$|E

Each of the three factors was studied at seven levels. A randomized complete block design with a composite treatment arrangement was used. A secondary objective of this experiment was to demonstrate the use of the composite treatment arrangement to study management factors other than fertilizer rates. The most economical optimum treatment combination was calculated for each year. Results obtained included grain yield, grain moisture, ear population, number of days from planting to tasseling, nutrient content of leaves, and residual soil NO- 3 -N accumulation. There was no significant effect <b>of</b> planting <b>date</b> in 1968, but there was a trend toward lower yields with late planting dates at high rates of N application. The linear date effect in 1969 was highly significant and positive. Yields increased with later plantings. Differences in air temperature, soil temperature, and precipitation at different points in the season were the most tangible reasons for the difference in <b>date</b> <b>of</b> planting <b>response</b> between the years. There was relatively little yield difference between the two years averaged over all treatments.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} factors associated with lack <b>of</b> serological <b>response</b> (LSR) to treatment of syphilis among HIV-infected subjects. Materials and Methods: Retrospective, longitudinal study on HIV-infected subjects diagnosed and treated for syphilis and with an assessable serological response between 1 January 2004 and 15 September 2013. LSR was defined as a < 4 -fold decline of rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer or a failed reversion to nonreactive (if RPR ≤ 1 : 4 at diagnosis) after one year since treatment. Diagnoses of syphilis were staged in early syphilis (primary, secondary and early latent) or late syphilis (tertiary and late latent) according to clinical examination and patient's history. Syphilis was classified in new infections [NI: positive RPR and TPHA (Treponema pallidum Haemagglutination assay) titers in subjects without previous history of syphilis] or re-infections [ReI: a ≥ 4 -fold increase of RPR titer in subjects previously successfully treated for syphilis]. Syphilis treatment was prescribed according to CDC guidelines. The crude incidence rates (IRs) of LSR were calculated per 1000 -person months of follow-up (PMFU) as the total number of LSR episodes divided by the cumulative time contributed by all subjects (interval time since each syphilis diagnosis and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> ascertainment <b>of</b> <b>response).</b> Results are described as median (IQR) or frequency (%). Results: 565 diagnoses of syphilis with an assessable serological response in 421 patients; 458 (81 %) were early syphilis, 189 (33 %) were NI, 376 (67 %) were ReI. At first, diagnosis of syphilis median age was 41 (36 – 47) years, 419 (99. 5 %) males, 391 (93 %) MSM, HIV-infected since 7. 7 (3. 5 – 12. 9) years, 75 (18 %) HCV or HBV co-infected, 56 (13 %) with a previous AIDS diagnosis, 82 (19 %) antiretroviral treatment naïve, 102 (24 %) with HIV-RNA ≥ 50 cp/mL, CD 4 += 576 (437 – 749) cells/mm 3, nadir CD 4 += 308 (194 – 406) cells/mm 3. LSRs were observed in 70 / 565 (12. 4 %) treated syphilis. Incidence of LSR decreased over time [2004 – 2008 IR= 25. 1 (17. 2 – 33. 1) / 1000 PMFU; 2009 – 2010 IR= 21. 1 (12. 3 – 29. 9) / 1000 PMFU; 2011 – 2013 IR= 10. 6 (5. 1 – 18. 2) / 1000 PMFU; Poisson regression: p= 0. 001]. Results of univariate and multivariate analysis on the risk of LSR are reported in Table 1.

Glaciers in the Alps {{reacted to the}} last climate deterioration {{at the end of}} the Late Pleistocene leaving landscape features suitable for reconstructing Lateglacial and early Holocene history. In this context, the Upper Peio Valley in the Ortles-Cevedale Group (Rhaetian Alps, Italy) has well-preserved moraines of La Mare Glacier and Careser Glacier, which we used to reconstruct the glaciers' behaviour and to investigate the Lateglacial–Holocene transition. Detailed glacier reconstructions combined with 11 new 10 Be exposure ages allow <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> the <b>response</b> <b>of</b> these glaciers to the Younger Dryas (YD) cold event. La Mare and Careser glaciers reacted to the YD with a double response, building two clear moraine sets. Data from La Mare Glacier indicate the first advance occurred prior to 12. 3 ± 0. 7 ka (before 10. 0 ± 0. 7 ka at Careser Glacier). Both glaciers then re-advanced before 11. 2 ± 0. 8 ka as dated at La Mare Glacier. This phase can be interpreted as the Egesen stadial glaciers' expression of the end of the YD. Morphometric parameters of the reconstructed phases allowed the estimation of areal and volumetric variations of the studied glaciers as well as equilibrium line altitude (ELA). ΔELA with respect to the Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum position are − 225 m for La Mare Glacier and − 180 m for the Careser Glacier. Although the behaviour of the two glaciers showed coherence during the Egesen stadial and the LIA, they have behaved individually since then. La Mare has lost 60 % of its area, while Careser has lost 85 % since the latest Pleistocene. We attribute this to the greater proportion of ice at high elevation of the La Mare Glacier, underlining the importance of bed hypsometry in glacier response...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to estimate a fitness landscape experienced by HIV- 1 under treatment selective pressure {{as a function of}} the genotypic sequence thereby also estimating the genetic barrier to resistance. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of two estimated fitness landscapes (nelfinavir [NFV] and zidovudine [AZT] plus lamivudine [3 TC]) to predict week 12 viral load (VL) change for 176 treatment change episodes (TCEs) and probability of week 48 virological failure for 90 TCEs, in treatment experienced patients starting these drugs in combination. RESULTS: A higher genetic barrier for AZT plus 3 TC, (quantified per additional mutation required to develop resistance against these drugs) was associated with a 0. 54 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 30 - 0. 77) larger log 10 VL reduction at 12 weeks (P < 0. 0001) and a 0. 39 (95 %/ CI 0. 23 - 0. 66) lower odds of virological failure at 48 weeks (P = 0. 0005), in analyses adjusting for the pre-TCE VL and the exact time-lag between the TCE and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> determining <b>response</b> VL. The strength of these associations was comparable with those seen with expert interpretation systems (Rega, ANRS and HIVDB). A higher genetic barrier to NFV resistance was the only genotypic predictor that tended to be associated with a 0. 19 (95 % CI 0 - 0. 39) higher log 10 VL reduction at 12 weeks (P = 0. 05) and a 0. 63 (95 % CI 0. 36 - 1. 09) lower odds of virological failure at 48 weeks (P = 0. 10) per additional mutation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that an estimated genetic barrier derived from fitness landscapes may contribute to an improvement of predicted treatment outcome for NFV and this approach should be explored for other drugs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the dense}} stand {{of a typical}} maize field, {{chlorophyll}} and carotenoids pigments efficiently absorb blue and red (R) light but the longer far-red (FR) wavelengths are transmitted through the canopy or reflected by the vegetation. This selective absorption causes a reduction both in the R to FR ratio and in the photosynthetically active radiation. Together, they indicate the proximity of neighboring vegetation and induce a series <b>of</b> adaptive <b>responses</b> collectively known as shade avoidance syndrome. To characterize R/FR signaling in maize, an end-of-day FR (EOD-FR) assay was developed. A survey of genetically diverse inbreds, plus teosinte and a modern hybrid, revealed distinct elongation responses in seedling tissues. A quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis <b>of</b> EOD-FR elongation <b>responses</b> identified several QTL for the mesocotyl and 1 st leaf sheath tissues.

This analysis revealed that the subfunctionalization of PhyB paralogs was dependent on the genetic background. Results from a pilot experiment with densely planted rows suggest that both PhyB 1 and PhyB 2 are involved in regulating azimuthal leaf orientation. Variation in plant architecture relative to cardinal position was examined using more than 5000 lines grown in a single field plot. Results suggest that sunset twilight operates similarly to EOD-FR in regulating plant height. That is, plants in the western section of the field, exposed to a higher intensity of FR during twilight sunset, are taller than in the eastern section. Finally, a reverse genetic approach to identify several phyA and phyC mutant alleles is described. Together, these studies provide the most detailed characterization to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> phytochrome <b>response</b> in both seedling and mature maize plants...|$|R

40|$|Natural zircon is {{irradiated}} internally by U and Th impurities. After {{exposure to}} ionizing irradiation zircon exhibits thermoluminescence (TL), {{which can be}} used to calculate the irradiation dose and the sample age. A kinetic model for TL of zircon developed earlier is used to model the processes relevant for <b>dating.</b> The <b>response</b> <b>of</b> zircon to irradiation at different dose rates is simulated for different temperatures. Several scenarios for the dating procedure are considered, including laboratory added irradiation, fading and preheat. It is shown that by irradiating the sample at elevated temperatures one can imitate natural irradiation, i. e. it is possible to reproduce the structural state of the trap system (distribution functions of filled electron and hole traps), which is responsible for the TL behavior. This implies that the dose dependence of the TL signal from samples, which had been irradiated under natural conditions, can be produced by irradiation at an elevated temperature. ...|$|R
