5|$|Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> rose to {{international}} fame {{as part of}} the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band {{was one of the most}} successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 20 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone. Their debut album, Facelift, was released in 1990 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA, selling over two million copies. In 1992, the band's second album, Dirt, was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. Their second acoustic EP, Jar of Flies, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in 1994, becoming the first ever EP and first Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> release to top the charts, and it has been certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The band's third album, Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains,</b> was released in 1995 and has been certified double platinum. It achieved No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart.

For these two chains, the colors that were related to each component of the multiple schedule were not changed during participant replacement.|$|R
5|$|Along with Mastodon and Deftones, Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> {{toured the}} United States and Canada in late 2010 on the Blackdiamondskye tour, {{an amalgam of}} the three bands' latest album titles (Black Gives Way to Blue, Diamond Eyes, and Crack the Skye).|$|E
5|$|Although never officially disbanding, Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> {{was plagued}} by {{extended}} inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 for a live benefit show, performing {{with a number of}} guest vocalists. They toured in 2006, with William DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up released the band's fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009, which received gold certification by the RIAA and three Grammy nominations. Their fifth studio album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, was released in 2013. The band toured extensively and released several videos in support of these albums. Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> is currently working on their sixth studio album, tentatively set for release in early 2018.|$|E
5|$|Although widely {{associated}} with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band {{is known for}} its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and William DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead on the 1992 acoustic EP Sap, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> a two-vocal band.|$|E

40|$|Prenylated {{phenolics}} {{from the}} Fabaceae are promising lead compounds for new antibacterials. Pools enriched in prenylated phenolics {{were made from}} lupine, peanut and soybean seedlings. One pool was rich <b>in</b> <b>chain</b> prenylated isoflavones (cIsf), one <b>in</b> <b>chain</b> prenylated stilbenoids (cSti), one <b>in</b> <b>chain</b> prenylated (cPta) and one in ring-closed prenylated pterocarpans (rPta), as characterized by RP-UHPLC-UV-MS. Antibacterial activity of the pools and membrane permeabilization was investigated. Pools showed high antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes: cIsf pool had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10 µg/ml prenylated compounds, followed by cPta pool (25 µg/ml) and cSti pool (35 µg/ml). Activity against E. coli was found only when the pools were co-administered with an efflux pump inhibitor. The pool enriched <b>in</b> <b>chain</b> prenylated isoflavones permeabilized the bacterial membrane within minutes of exposure, whereas ampicillin did not. Bent conformation and chain prenylation, were molecular features of main prenylated phenolics found in pools with high antibacterial activity...|$|R

5|$|Atlas– A four-armed Titan who {{was imprisoned}} in Tartarus after the Great War. <b>In</b> <b>Chains</b> of Olympus, Atlas was freed by the goddess Persephone and {{captured}} the god Helios on her behalf. Persephone directed Atlas to use Helios' power {{to destroy the}} Pillar of the World. Atlas, however, was chained to the weakened pillar by Kratos, and was doomed to carry {{the weight of the}} world on his shoulders forever. After Kratos defeated Persephone, Atlas mocked Kratos and his choice to defend the gods. In God of War II, Atlas and Kratos met again, and although he was initially bitter towards Kratos, Atlas decided to help him reach the Sisters of Fate, providing him with the magic, Atlas Quake, and stated that they would meet again. This would be Atlas' final appearance, however, leaving his fate unknown. The character was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> of Olympus.|$|E

Although he almost killed Kratos {{during their first}} encounter, Kratos returned and destroyed Charon, taking his power, Charon's Wrath. The character was voiced by Dwight Schultz <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as they could find the Sun God. She also provided him with the magical ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown.

5|$|Helios– The former God of the Sun. Helios {{had entered}} into Ares' wager, {{choosing}} the fiery-being Cereyon, who was drowned by Kratos in the God of War comic series. Years later, <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> of Olympus, Helios was kidnapped by the Titan Atlas {{on behalf of}} the goddess Persephone, who intended to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World, causing the destruction of Olympus. The plan was thwarted by Kratos, and Helios was rescued. When Kratos turned against the gods and lead the Titans in an assault against Olympus in God of War III, Helios was injured and left for dead by the Titan Perses. Found by Kratos, Helios remained loyal to Zeus and attempted to trick Kratos, but was decapitated by the Spartan, which caused worldwide darkness and storms. The Head of Helios became a weapon for Kratos, using it to cast a blinding light and reveal hidden doorways. The character was voiced by Dwight Schultz <b>in</b> <b>Chains</b> of Olympus, and Crispin Freeman in God of War III.|$|E
