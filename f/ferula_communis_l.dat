40|$|Biosystemalic {{study of}} the Ferula communis populations in NE of the Iberian Peninsula and in the Balearic Islands. this paper {{presents}} the results of a taxonomic revision of the collective species <b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> (Umbelliferae) in NE of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands. The main goal of the research has been to characterize the Ferula communis populations in the region under study and to place them into infraspecific taxa. The proposed classification is based on morphology, anatomy, phenology, karyology and numerical taxonomy. A new taxon is described: <b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> subsp. cardonae Sanchez-Cuxart and Bernal and two new nomenclatural combinations are proposed: <b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> subsp. catalaunica (Pau) Sanchez- Cuxart and Bernal and <b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> subsp. catalaunica var. microcarpa (Cauwet-Marc) Sanchez-Cuxart and Bernal. Description, phenology and chorology for each taxon are included. Also an identification key for infraspecific taxa and a list of new localities are provided...|$|E
40|$|The giant fennel, <b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> (Apiaceae) is a circum-Mediterranean species {{responsible}} {{of severe}} haemorrhagic intoxication of livestock. Electrophoretic analysis of 14 putative enzyme loci {{was carried out}} to assess genetic differentiation among poisonous and non-poisonous chemotypes of F. communis in Sardinia. Genetic structuring characterises all the five populations examined. However, differentiation was higher between poisonous and nonpoisonous populations (P < 0. 00001), and was independent from geographic distances, suggesting a reduced gene flow between the two chemotypes.

40|$|The {{enantiomer}} of (+) -allohedycaryol, a germacrane alcohol {{isolated from}} giant fennel (<b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.),</b> has been synthesized, thereby elucidating the relative and absolute stereochemistry {{of the natural}} product. The synthesis of (-) -allohedycaryol started from (+) -α-cyperone (5) which was available in relatively large quantities via alkylation of imine 7 derived from (+) -dihydrocarvone and (R) -(+) - 1 -phenylethylamine. In a number of steps 5 was converted into the mesylate 4 with a regio- and stereoselective epoxidation as the key step. A Marshall fragmentation of 4 was used to prepare the trans,trans-cyclodeca- 1, 6 -diene ring present in allohedycaryol. The conformation of synthetic (-) -allohedycaryol was elucidated via photochemical conversion into a bourbonane system. The synthesis of (-) -allohedycaryol also showed that natural (+) -allohedycaryol has the opposite absolute stereochemistry to that normally found in higher plants. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> {{plants were}} {{collected}} {{all over the}} island of Sardinia (Italy) with the object of determining their poisonousness through UV microscopy examinations of the vittae fluorescence of fresh samples. The same fresh samples examined under UV light were subjected to TLC analyses to check {{the validity of the}} microscopical conclusions of the poisonousness of giant fennel plants, morphologically and caryologically identical. The results evidenced a positive correlation between the microscopical evaluation of the vittae fluorescence intensity and the presence of the chemical compounds responsible of the poisonousness of Ferula communis. These data suggest the employment of UV microscopy as a rapid tool to distinguish “poisonous” and “non-poisonous” giant fennel quite easily, complementing the chemical analysis of the latex. On the basis of the results collected with this rapid method, a ferulosis risk map of Sardinia was also suggested...|$|E
40|$|Giant fennel (<b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.)</b> from Sardinia is {{characterized}} by two chemotypes with different biological activities. One chemotype is poisonous, due to prenylcoumarins, and responsible for ferulosis, which mainly affects sheep and goats, cattle, and horses; the other chemotype is nonpoisonous and contains daucane esters. The two chemotypes cannot be distinguished botanically. High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array-ultraviolet detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-UV-MS) analysis of {{the composition of the}} fractions containing the biologically active metabolites and of the volatile fractions, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), of both essential oil and headspace sampled by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) are here shown to be effective in discriminating the poisonous and nonpoisonous chemotypes. HS-SPME with CAR/PDMS/DVB in combination with GC-MS has also been found to be a successful, fully automated one-step method for rapid and unequivocal discrimination of the two chemotypes, using aristolene and allohedycaryol as markers of the poisonous and nonpoisonous chemotypes, respectively...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> (<b>L.),</b> a plant {{belonging}} to Apiaceae, is widely present in Sardinia, Italy. Currently, interest in F. communis {{focuses on the}} presence of two chemotypes in the wild. One chemotype is poisonous to animals, whereas the other chemotype is non-poisonous. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) has been extracted and partially purified from the two chemotypes of F. communis. The biochemical characterization of the enzymes showed significant differences. In particular, while the two PPOs were not able to use 6 - and 7 -hydroxycoumarin as substrates, they showed distinct specificity for 6, 7 - and 7, 8 -dihydroxycoumarin. Significant differences in the enzyme behavior towards common PPO inhibitors were also observed. In addition, activation energy and activation energy for denaturation were determined, showing significant differences between FP-PPO and FNP-PPO, particularly for denaturation kinetics. The possible roles of the two PPOs in determining differences in composition and toxicity of the two F. communis chemotypes are also discusse...|$|E

40|$|The {{giant fennel}} <b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> is a circum-Mediterranean complex {{characterized}} by a great morphological variability, and comprising several species and subspecies. In this work, we used AFLP markers to investigate the pattern of genetic variation of the F. communis complex in the Tyrrhenian area and to compare the levels of genetic diversity between the widespread F. communis and the Corso-Sardinian endemic congener F. arrigonii. Our study indicates fairly high levels of genetic diversity for all populations (Fragpoly = 58. 2 - 88 %; Hj = 0. 186 - 0. 313), with {{no significant differences between}} F. arrigonii and F. communis. The genetic structure is only partially coherent with the geographic provenance of the populations: while individuals of F. arrigonii constituted a separate genetic group, the individuals of F. communis were partitioned into three main genetic clusters. These corresponded respectively to F. communis subsp. glauca, to populations from Tunisia and Gozo Island, and to all populations {{from the rest of the}} investigated areas; this last cluster was {{characterized by a}} marked substructure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.</b> is an umbelliferous plant {{widespread}} in the Mediterranean basin and particularly abundant in Sicily and Sardinia islands (Italy). In this species, two chemotypes have been distinguished: one is poisonous and responsible of hemorrhagic syndrome of livestock, known as ferulosis, while the other one (non- poisonous) has anticancer activity due {{to the presence of}} daucane esters. In Sicily the dry stem of this plant has commercial applications in special manufactured products. The object of the research was to investigate the germination ecophysiology of nine Sicilian populations of F. communis, in order to establish the correct germplasm conservation of the chemotypes economically interesting. In this preliminary study we report data of seeds collected in July 2009 from Monte Pellegrino (altitude 80 m) population. The effects of water (control), three GA 3 concentrations (10 - 3, 10 - 6 and 10 - 9 M) and four temperatures (5 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 °C) were investigated. Besides, seeds were also incubated on MS medium with vitamins, 30 gl- 1 sucrose supplemented with three GA 3 concentrations (2. 8, 5. 6 and 11. 2 µM) at the same temperatures reported above.

40|$|<b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.,</b> subsp. communis, namely giant fennel, has {{extensively}} {{been used}} in traditional medicine {{for a wide range}} of ailments. Fresh plant materials, crude extracts and isolated components of F. communis showed a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties including antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, and cytotoxic activities. The present paper, reviews the traditional uses, botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of F. communis in order to reveal its therapeutic potential and future research opportunities. A bibliographic literature search was conducted in different scientific databases and search engines including Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Pubmed, SciFinder, and Web of science. Phytochemical studies have led to the isolation of different compounds such as sesquiterpenes from F. communis. This plant has two different chemotypes, the poisonous and non-poisonous chemotypes. Each chemotype is endowed with various constituents and different activities. The poisonous chemotype exhibits anticoagulant and cytotoxic activities with sesquiterpene coumarins as major constituents, while the non-poisonous one exhibits estrogenic and cytotoxic effects with daucane sesquiterpene esters as the main compounds. In addition, although various pharmacological properties have been reported for F. communis, anti-microbial activities of the plant have been investigated in most studies. Studies revealed that F. communis exhibits different biological activities, and contains various bioactive compounds. Although, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities are the two main pharmacological effects of this plant, further studies should focus on the mechanisms underlying these actions, as well as on those biological activities that have been reported traditionally...|$|E

40|$|The {{essential}} oils {{obtained by the}} hydrodistillation from the fresh flowers, leaves, stems, and roots of <b>Ferula</b> <b>communis</b> <b>L.,</b> growing in Tunisia were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Thirty-two components were identified in the oil of flowers with camphor (18. 3 %), α-pinene (15. 3 %), and β-eudesmol (9. 3 %) as the main constituents. Twenty-nine compounds were identified in the oil of stems with β-eudesmol (28. 1 %), δ-eudesmol (11. 1 %), and α-eudesmol (9. 6 %) as the main compounds. Twenty compounds were characterized in the oil of roots with dillapiole (7. 9 %), guaiol (7. 3 %), and spathulenol (6. 8 %). In the oil of leaves, α-eudesmol (25. 2 %), β-eudesmol (20. 7 %), δ-eudesmol (10. 1 %), and caryophyllene oxide (7. 2 %) were found as the main constituents. This study was undertaken to evaluate the antioxidant activity using DPPH (2, 2 ′-diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2, 2 ′-azinobis- 3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid), reducing power, and catalase activity. We tested also the antibacterial, cytotoxic, and cholinesterase inhibition properties of the essential oil of different organs of F. communis. The essential oil of the stems showed the highest antioxidant activity (IC 50 = 0. 03 ± 0. 001 mg mL- 1), in DPPH assay and the important result of catalase (303. 03 μmol H 2 O 2 degraded/min/protein) of F. communis. The antibacterial activity of the oil was determined by micro-well dilution assay. The best results (MIC = 0. 156 ± 0. 02 mg mL- 1) were exhibited by the essential oil of the leaves of F. Communis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Besides, the strongest cytotoxic activity against Hela cells was shown with {{essential oils}}' leaves with an inhibition percentage of 79. 05 % at the concentration of 500 μg mL- 1. However, the best inhibition percentage of A 549 cells was detected for essential oils' leaves with an inhibition percentage of 54. 56 % at 250 μg mL- 1.
