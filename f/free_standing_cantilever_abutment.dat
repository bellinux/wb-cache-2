40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for fabricating <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> structures on flexible substrates using the screen printing technique. The research addresses electronic textile applications and is intended to provide a new method for realising sensors and complex structures on fabrics. Conventional smart fabric fabrication methods, such as weaving and knitting, are only able to achieve planar structures with limited functionality. Packaged discrete sensors can also be attached directly to fabrics but this approach is unreliable and unsuitable for mass production. The reported materials and the fabrication processes enable <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> structures to be formed by printing functional layers directly {{on top of the}} fabric. This reduces the fabrication complexity and increases wearer comfort and the flexibility of the fabric. This research details an investigation into sacrificial materials suitable for use on fabrics. A plastic crystalline material (Trimetlylolethane (TME)) was identified as an appropriate sacrificial material because it sublimates which reduces the chance of stiction occurring. A screen printable TME paste has been achieved by dissolving TME powder in a solvent mixture of cyclohexanol (CH) and propylene glycol (PG). The TME sacrificial paste can be cured at 85 oC for 5 minutes providing a solid foundation for subsequent printed layers. This sacrificial layer can be removed in 30 minutes at 150 oC leaving no residue. EFV 4 / 4965 UV curable dielectric material was identified as an appropriate structural material for use with TME. The feasibility of the sacrificial and structural materials has been demonstrated by the fabrication of <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>cantilevers</b> and microfluidic pumps on fabrics and flexible plastic films. Printed cantilevers, with capacitive and piezoelectric sensing mechanisms, have been demonstrated as human motion sensors. A printed microfluidic pump with a maximum pumping rate of 68 ?L/min at 3 kHz has also been demonstrated. Both the cantilever and micropump have been demonstrated, for the first time, on fabrics and polyimide substrates, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of slender cantilever concrete panels and concrete panels in steel frames exposed to elevated temperatures. This report also provides {{recommendations for the}} design of slender tilt-up wall panels for fire resistance. The current trend of tilt-up construction in industrial buildings utilises very tall and thin concrete wall panels that are reinforced with a single layer of reinforcing in the middle. These wall panels are cantilevered from the base and are not connected to a column or a portal frame. The panels are connected directly to the steel frame by a steel rafter or indirectly to the eaves tie. The analysis of this project was conducted using SAFIR, a non-linear finite element programme developed in the University of Liege, Belgium. Reinforced concrete walls subjected to a fire on one side will undergo non-uniform thermal expansion, causing the walls to bow. Free-standing concrete cantilever walls with slenderness ratios (Height to thickness ratio) in excess of 50 experience very large deflections when exposed to a fire on one side. The analyses have shown that these large deflections will lead to outward collapse of the walls onto the neighbouring property. Concrete cantilever walls connected to unbraced steel frames are dangerous as they cause the frame to sway and fall out onto the neighbouring property during a fire. Braced steel frames connected to the walls enhance the behaviour of the walls by preventing the large outward deflections of the panels. If bracing is available from the steel roof to prevent sway, the wall panels can be constructed up to 12 metres and slenderness ratios up to 96, without outward collapse or buckling failure of the wall panels. For the partially braced frames conducted in this study, the height of the wall panels should not exceed 9. 0 metres and the slenderness ratios should not exceed 65. It is concluded that the deflections of the <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>cantilever</b> walls should be controlled. Slender cantilever walls should be connected to a braced steel frame with well designed connections to the rafter and the eaves tie...|$|R

The depth the protons travel in a material is dependent on its energy, this unique property of proton beams allow multi level structures to be created in materials.

This thesis is {{a study of the}} application of PBW in creating Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) in a polymer SU 8 and SU 8 polymer nano composite with silver, and shows experimental steps, theory and computer simulations involved in creating an electrostatic actuated micro-gripping device. Proton beam writing in silver SU 8 composite results in the creation of electrically conducting microstructures. The unique predictability of the range of protons in materials is leveraged in the creating of <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> conducting <b>cantilevers</b> structures which are used as the building blocks for a micro gripping device.

40|$|Electrostatic {{actuation}} is {{a promising}} solution for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems {{because of its}} good scaling properties in small dimensions, high-energy densities and relative ease of fabrication. Its low response time and compatibility with IC technologies make it even more suitable for the optical applications, such as, optical switching and Variable Optical Attenuators (VOAs) in telecommunications. Variable Optical Attenuators are very important components in fiber optic communication systems needed throughout the network to control optical power and prevent the saturation of receivers. This thesis describes {{the design of a}} novel and simple electrostatically actuated variable optical attenuator that uses the electrostatic actuation of a cylindrical waveguide. The proposed device stands out from the existing conventional optical attenuators by directly moving the input waveguide for creating misalignment and thus eliminating the need for extra optical components required in free space. This model has capability for a high dynamic range of attenuation and has other advantages of low wavelength dependent loss and low back reflection. The optical MEMS device consists of a metal coated cylindrical waveguide positioned in a V-groove and overhanging at the end to act as a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>cantilever.</b> This work presents modeling, analysis and testing of the proposed device. The system has been defined accurately using coupled electromechanical models that take into account the capacitance of the cylindrical electrode configuration. The static and dynamic analyses of the system have been performed using the Rayleigh Ritz energy method. The developed electromechanical model is generic and could be applied to any cylindrical electrostatic actuator. The generality of the method has been demonstrated in this work by performing static and dynamic analysis on a carbon nanotube actuator and nano resonator, respectively, using the above model. To verify the feasibility of the method for optical attenuation parametric study is presented and the resulting static deflections, pull-in voltages, natural frequencies and finally achieved attenuation have been presented. Testing is a very vital component in the synthesis of a microsystem. Experimental testing is carried out in this work using non contact optical methods. Both static testing using optical microscope and dynamic testing using Laser Doppler Velocimetry have been performed on a prototype representing the proposed device. The experimental results of deflection were found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results from the model...|$|R

40|$|Observations of the {{performance}} of basement walls and retaining structures in recent earthquakes show that failures of basement or deep excavation walls in earthquakes are rare even if the structures were not designed for the actual intensity of the earthquake loading. Failures of retaining structures are most commonly confined to waterfront structures retaining saturated backfill with liquefaction being the critical factor in the failures. Failures of other types of retaining structures are relatively rare and usually involve a more complex set of conditions, such as sloping ground either above or below the retaining structure, or both. While some failures have been observed, {{there is no evidence of}} a systemic problem with traditional static retaining wall design even under quite severe loading conditions. No significant damage or failures of retaining structures occurred in the recent earthquakes such as Wenchuan earthquake in China (2008) and, or the large subduction zone earthquakes in Chile (2010) and Japan (2011). Therefore, this experimental and analytical study was undertaken to develop a better understanding of the distribution and magnitude of seismic earth pressures on cantilever retaining structures. The experimental component of the study consists of two sets of dynamic centrifuge model experiments. In the first experiment two model structures representing basement type setting were used, while in the second test a U-shaped channel with cantilever sides and a simple cantilever wall were studied. All of these structures were chosen to be representative of typical designs. Dry medium-dense sand with relative density on the order of from 75 % to 80 % was used as backfill. Results obtained from the centrifuge experiments were subsequently used to develop and calibrate a two-dimensional, nonlinear, finite difference model built on the FLAC platform. The centrifuge data consistently shows that for the height of structures considered herein, i. e. in the range of 20 - 30 ft, the maximum dynamic earth pressure increases with depth and can be reasonably approximated by a triangular distribution This suggests that the point of application of the resultant force of the dynamic earth pressure increment is approximately 1 / 3 H above the base of the wall as opposed to 0. 5 - 0. 6 H recommended by most current design procedures. In general, the magnitude of the observed seismic earth pressures depends on the magnitude and intensity of shaking, the density of the backfill soil, and the type of the retaining structures. The computed values of seismic earth pressure coefficient (âˆ†Kae) back calculated from the centrifuge data at the time of maximum dynamic wall moment suggest that for <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>cantilever</b> retaining structures seismic earth pressures can be neglected at accelerations below 0. 4 g. While similar conclusions and recommendations were made by Seed and Whitman (1970), their approach assumed that a wall designed to a reasonable static factor of safety should be able to resist seismic loads up 0. 3 g. In the present study, experimental data suggest that seismic loads up to 0. 4 g could be resisted by cantilever walls designed to an adequate factor of safety. This observation is consistent with the observations and analyses performed by Clough and Fragaszy (1977) and Fragaszy and Clough (1980) and Al-Atik and Sitar (2010) who concluded that conventionally designed cantilever walls with granular backfill could be reasonably expected to resist seismic loads at accelerations up to 0. 4 g. Finally, numerical models using FLAC finite difference code were quite successful and able to produce a reasonably good agreement with the results of the centrifuge experiments. However, while the finite difference models were able to capture the main aspects of the seismic response observed in the centrifuge experiments, the results of the analyses were highly sensitive to the selection of soil and interface parameters. Therefore, numerical models used for future designs should be carefully calibrated against experimental data to provide reliable results...|$|R
