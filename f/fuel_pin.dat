50|$|Both {{the fuel}} and {{cladding}} can swell. Cladding covers the fuel {{to form a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> and can be deformed. It is normal {{to fill the gap}} between the fuel and the cladding with helium gas to permit better thermal contact between the fuel and the cladding. During use the amount of gas inside the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> can increase because of the formation of noble gases (krypton and xenon) by the fission process. If a Loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) (e.g. Three Mile Island) or a Reactivity Initiated Accident (RIA) (e.g. Chernobyl or SL-1) occurs then the temperature of this gas can increase. As the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> is sealed the pressure of the gas will increase (PV = nRT) and it is possible to deform and burst the cladding. It has been noticed that both corrosion and irradiation can alter the properties of the zirconium alloy commonly used as cladding, making it brittle. As a result, the experiments using unirradated zirconium alloy tubes can be misleading.|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} six <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> each were assembled, encapsulated, and {{irradiated}} in the Plum Brook Reactor. The <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> employed uranium mononitride (UN) in a tantalum alloy clad. The {{first group of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> was irradiated for 1500 hours to a maximum burnup of 0. 7 -atom-percent uranium. The second group of <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> was irradiated for about 3000 hours to a maximum burnup of 1. 0 -atom-percent uranium. The average clad surface temperature during irradiation of both groups of <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> was approximately 1200 K. The postirradiation examination revealed the following: no clad failures or fuel swelling occurred; less than 1 percent of the fission gases escaped from the fuel; and the clad of {{the first group of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> experienced clad embrittlement whereas the second group, which had modified assembly and fabrication procedures to minimize contamination, had a ductile clad after irradiation...|$|R
50|$|He co-invented an {{automated}} loading system for {{nuclear fuel elements}} with a gravity feed conveyor, which permitted individual <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> to roll along a constrained path perpendicular to their respective lengths. The individual lengths of fuel cladding were directed onto movable transports, where they were aligned coaxially with the axes of associated handling equipment at appropriate production stations. The <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> were inserted as a batch prior to welding of end caps.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the new subcritical assembly called DELPHI at Delft University of Technology. It {{consists of two}} vessels one upon the other, and contains 168 <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> made of 3. 8 % enriched UO 2 fuel. The upper acrylic vessel is used to store the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> when the assembly is not in use. With a special handling tool the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> can be loaded into the water-filled steel vessel. The source is stored in a shielding box below the steel vessel and can be inserted pneumatically up to a height of 2 cm below the fuel zone of the pins. DELPHI became operational {{at the beginning of}} 2004 and will be used for training of students and reactor operators from the Netherlands and abroad and for basic research on reactivity determination methods...|$|R
50|$|At Westinghouse, he was {{responsible}} for the development of magnetic pulse welding machines. The magnetic pulse welding process was successful in producing welds within advanced stainless steel <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> rods for the Fast Flux Test Facility reactor. He later represented Westinghouse Hanford taking the magnetic pulse welding process to Japan, his last great accomplishment before retiring.|$|E
50|$|Increase of fission gases above {{a certain}} limit {{can lead to}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> {{swelling}} and even puncture, so that fission gas measurement after discharging the fuel from the reactor is most important to make burn-up calculations, to study the nature of fuel inside the reactor, behaviour with pin materials, for effective utilization of fuel and also reactor safety.|$|E
50|$|In the TOPAZ-II or ENISY reactor each <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> (96% enriched UO2) is {{sheathed}} in an emitter {{which is in}} turn surrounded by a collector, and these form the 37 fuel elements which penetrate the cylindrical zirconium hydride (ZrH) moderator. This in turn {{is surrounded by a}} beryllium neutron reflector with 12 rotating control drums. Liquid metal coolant (NaK) surrounds each fuel element. The mass of the reactor is ~ 1061 kg.|$|E

The <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> were irradiated to burnups between 2. 7 and 4. 6 %. Clad temperatures were between 1750 and 2400 F (1228 and 1589 K).

50|$|The plant made Uranium {{fuel and}} MOX driver <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> {{for use in}} the Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Site in Washington State. Along with NUMEC, between 1973 and 1975 Kerr-McGee made the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> for FFTF cores 1 and 2. The pins were quality tested by the Plutonium Finishing Plant at Hanford. The MOX pins were created by the unusual {{co-precipitation}} of Plutonium Nitrate and Uranium Nitrate solution method. The plant shut down in 1976.|$|R
40|$|Five {{full size}} and eight reduced length <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> were {{fabricated}} for irradiation testing to evaluate design concepts for a fast spectrum lithium cooled compact space power reactor. These assemblies consisted of uranium mononitride fuel pellets {{encased in a}} T- 111 (Ta- 8 W- 2 Hf) clad with a tungsten barrier separating fuel and clad. Fabrication procedures were fully qualified by process development and assembly qualification tests. Detailed specifications and procedures were written for the fabrication and assembly of prototype <b>fuel</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R
50|$|The heating of pellets {{can result}} {{in some of the}} fission {{products}} being lost from the core of the pellet. If the xenon can rapidly leave the pellet then the amount of 134Cs and 137Cs which is present in the gap between the cladding and the fuel will increase. As a result, if the zircaloy tubes holding the pellet are broken then a greater release of radioactive caesium from the fuel will occur. It is important to understand that the 134Cs and 137Cs are formed in different ways, and hence as a result the two caesium isotopes can be found at different parts of a <b>fuel</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The core {{consists}} of a graphite cylinder with a radius of 4 m and a height of 10 m which includes 1 m axial reflectors at top and bottom. The cylinder allocates three or four concentric rings, each of 36 hexagonal blocks with an interstitial gap of 0.2 cm. Each hexagonal block contains 108 helium coolant channels and 216 fuel pins. Each <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> contains a random lattice of TRISO particles dispersed into a graphite matrix. The reactor exhibits a thermal spectrum with a peak located at about 0.2 eV. The QUADRISO fuel [...] concept conceived at Argonne National Laboratory {{has been used to}} better manage the excess of reactivity. The reactor and containment structure are located below grade and in contact with the ground, which serves as a passive safety measure to conduct heat away from the reactor {{in the event of a}} coolant failure.|$|E
50|$|FLLHGR (FDLRX, MFLPD) is a {{limit on}} fuel rod power in the reactor core. For new fuel, this limit is {{typically}} around 13 kW/ft (43 kW/m) of fuel rod. This limit ensures that the centerline {{temperature of the fuel}} pellets in the rods will not exceed the melting point of the fuel material (uranium/gadolinium oxides) in the event of the worst possible plant transient/scram anticipated to occur. To illustrate the response of LHGR in transient imagine the rapid closure of the valves that admit steam to the turbines at full power. This causes the immediate cessation of steam flow and an immediate rise in BWR pressure. This rise in pressure effectively subcools the reactor coolant instantaneously; the voids (vapor) collapse into solid water. When the voids collapse in the reactor, the fission reaction is encouraged (more thermal neutrons); power increases drastically (120%) until it is terminated by the automatic insertion of the control rods. So, when the reactor is isolated from the turbine rapidly, pressure in the vessel rises rapidly, which collapses the water vapor, which causes a power excursion which is terminated by the Reactor Protection System. If a <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> was operating at 13.0 kW/ft prior to the transient, the void collapse would cause its power to rise. The FLLHGR limit is in place to ensure that the highest powered fuel rod will not melt if its power was rapidly increased following a pressurization transient. Abiding by the LHGR limit precludes melting of fuel in a pressurization transient.|$|E
40|$|The present paper reviews {{several aspects}} {{of the problem of}} {{vibrational}} spectra interpretations for the VVER-type fuel assembly under normal and abnormal conditions. Theoretical models and appropriate software have been developed for dynamic analysis and eigencharacteristics extraction. An approach has been proposed toward the creation of simplified finite-element models of the fuel assemblies, which is based on the exception of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> from the model by allocation of the guide tubes with surrounding bunches of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> into substructures. Some results of eigencharacteristics computing and dynamic analysis are presented for the VVER- 1000 fuel assembly. It is shown that a spectrum of eigenfrequencies depends on the clamping state of the guide tubes and the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> in the spacing grids. The influence of reactor liquid filling on eigenfrequencies is evaluated analytically. The application of design sensitivity analysis and optimisation techniques to finite-element models tuning and anomaly detection is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} of the centrifugal casting technique {{to the production of}} multiple castings of <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> of small diameter and of thin fuel plates was investigated. <b>Fuel</b> <b>pins</b> measuring 0. 185 in. in diameter by 4 1 / 4 in. long of unalloyed uranium and of a uranium- 2 wt. % zirconium alloy were cast successfully in batches of sixteen pins per melt. Sixteen different metals and alloys were used as mold materials. Smaller and longer <b>fuel</b> <b>pins,</b> 0. 165 in. in diameter by 9 3 / 4 in. long, of similar compositions were cast successfully in brass and copper molds. Thirty-six pins of the same diameter and length were cast simultaneously in each casting run. Attempts to cast centrifugally thin uranium plates measuring 9 in. long by 2 in. wide by 0. 04 in. thick proved to be only partially successful, but encouraging. These plates were cast into graphite molds at the rate of six plates per run. The maximum usable length of the unalloyed uranium plates cast did not exceed six inches. (auth...|$|R
50|$|In a {{water-cooled}} {{power reactor}} (or in a water-filled spent fuel pool, SFP), if a power surge occurs {{as a result}} of a reactivity initiated accident, an understanding of the transfer of heat from the surface of the cladding to the water is very useful. In a French study, metal pipe immersed in water (both under typical PWR and SFP conditions), was electrically heated to simulate the generation of heat within a <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> by nuclear processes. The temperature of the pipe was monitored by thermocouples and for the tests conducted under PWR conditions the water entering the larger pipe (14.2 mm diameter) holding the test metal pipe (9.5 mm outside diameter and 600 mm long) was at 280 °C and 15 MPa. The water was flowing past the inner pipe at circa 4 ms−1 and the cladding was subjected to heating at 2200 to 4900 °C s−1 to simulate an RIA. It was found that as the temperature of the cladding increased the rate of heat transfer from the surface of the cladding increased at first as the water boiled at nucleation sites. When the heat flux is greater than the critical heat flux a boiling crisis occurs. This occurs as the temperature of the fuel cladding surface increases so that the surface of the metal was too hot (surface dries out) for nucleation boiling. When the surface dries out the rate of heat transfer decreases, after a further increase in the temperature of the metal surface the boiling resumes but it is now film boiling.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{considers}} {{heat transfer}} and temperature fields in a free-packed <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> bundle cooled by a heavy liquid metal with {{different types of}} spacing. Data is analyzed for three fuel assemblies with a pitch of s/d =  1. 33 : a smooth <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> bundle, a bundle of fuel pins spaced by a bilifar-helix wire wrapper of the “wire-to-wire” type, and a bundle with transverse spacer grids. In the free-packed smooth <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> bundle, there are no temperature non-uniformities around the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> periphery in contrast to major general temperature non-uniformities in the bundle with wire wrapping which provides for a major decrease in the heat transfer. In the bundle with transverse spacer grids, the heat transfer only increases {{in the region of}} the grids, and, between them, is approximately equal to the heat transfer in the smooth pin bundle. Correlations are presented as recommended for the calculation of Nusselt numbers and the temperature non-uniformities around the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> periphery with the above spacing options...|$|E

40|$|An open <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> {{failure is}} a breach in the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> {{cladding}} that allows direct {{contact between the}} primary coolant and the nuclear fuel. In this paper {{we focus on the}} sodium-fuel interactions in a Sodium cooled Fast neutrons Reactor (SFR), reviewing the main aspects of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> failure evolution with an emphasis on the Reaction between the Oxide fuel and the Sodium (ROS). This reaction leads to the formation of an uranoplutonate phase with approximately half the density of the initial oxide.

40|$|Calculations {{have been}} {{performed}} to assess the neutronic behavior of pins of Fully-Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel in otherwise-conventional Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) <b>fuel</b> <b>pins.</b> The FCM <b>fuel</b> contains transuranic (TRU) -only oxide fuel in tri-isotropic (TRISO) particles with the TRU loading coming from the spent fuel of a conventional LWR after 5 years of cooling. Use of the TRISO particle fuel would provide an additional barrier to fission product release {{in the event of}} cladding failure. Depletion calculations were performed to evaluate reactivity-limited burnup of the TRU-only FCM fuel. These calculations showed that due to relatively little space available for fuel, the achievable burnup with these pins alone is quite small. Various reactivity parameters were also evaluated at each burnup step including moderator temperature coefficient (MTC), Doppler, and soluble boron worth. These were compared to reference UO{sub 2 } and MOX unit cells. The TRU-only FCM fuel exhibits degraded MTC and Doppler coefficients relative to UO{sub 2 } and MOX. Also, the reactivity effects of coolant voiding suggest that the behavior of this fuel would be similar to a MOX fuel of very high plutonium fraction, which are known to have positive void reactivity. In general, loading of TRU-only FCM fuel into an assembly without significant quantities of uranium presents challenges to the reactor design. However, if such FCM <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> are included in a heterogeneous assembly alongside LEU <b>fuel</b> <b>pins,</b> the overall reactivity behavior would be dominated by the uranium pins while attractive TRU destruction performance levels in the TRU-only FCM <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> is.

AGR <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> are stainless steel cylindrical ribbed pipes of inner diameter of the rod being about 15 mm and wall thickness of about 300 μm.

The novelty of the approach consists in the usage of a frequency domain technique to measure the wall thickness combined with cylindrical ultrasonic scanning of the samples performed using an industrial robotic manipulator. The frequency domain approach could detect wall thicknesses in the range 96 μm to 700 μm with a resolution of about 10 μm.
