In total, II./JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged. Nine of its pilots were missing; five {{were killed and}} four captured. III./JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots.

25|$|The {{crash was}} the worst in Alaskan {{commercial}} aviation at the time, {{as well as the}} first crash of a Pan Am <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, the precursor to the NTSB) was unable to determine probable cause and it remains unknown to this day.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 and 1920, Frank Barnwell, chief {{designer}} of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, considered designs for a commercial transport aircraft, ranging from single-engine, three-seat aircraft to <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> carrying ten passengers, none of which were built. Early in 1921, the British government decided to provide subsidies for approved airlines, so Bristol's management authorised Barnwell to proceed with a design for a single-engined transport aircraft. It {{was intended to be}} powered by a Bristol Jupiter engine, but this had not yet been type-approved, so the initial prototype was fitted with a Napier Lion engine instead.|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} about the claims of JG 11. According to one German document, 13 fighters, two {{twin-engine}} and one <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> were claimed destroyed. Five fighters were claimed damaged on [...] "Glabbeek airfield" [...] â€” in reality it was Ophoven. Ten aerial victories and one probable were also claimed. But U.S. Fighter Group losses indicate these claims are excessive.|$|E
500|$|Amongst {{various other}} bids {{submitted}} were Lockheed Corporation, who marketed its P-3 Orion as the Orion 2000, Loral Corporation proposed to rebuild ex-US Navy Orions, and Dassault {{who sought to}} develop the improved Atlantique 3. On 12 January 1996, Dassault announced that they had withdrawn their Atlantique 3 offer following discussions held with the MOD; Whitehall sources stated that Dassault had found [...] "...no value in perusing its tender", and that the RAF had an expressed preference for a <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In early 1996, Loral's defense assets were acquired by Lockheed, leading to the competition thinning down to only two remaining companies, Lockheed and British Aerospace, by mid-1996.|$|E
2500|$|For example, Delta Airlines {{has reduced}} the number of flights it {{operates}} from the United States to Narita International Airport that are intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia. [...] Instead, Delta will utilize twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Total capacity will be cut, but consequentially load factors will increase. [...] In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400 aircraft and replace them either with Airbus A330 aircraft reassigned from cancelled international runs, or with new Airbus A350 aircraft now on order. [...] That will leave just six 747s flying for the airline in 2015. Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> led to a drag on profits.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army Air Corps still did not have a {{specialized}} school for flexible gunnery. Three schools opened in December 1941, and the program grew rapidly. [...] In July 1943 flexible gunnery schools had possessed few tactical aircraft with which to train, mainly 55 twin-engine B-34 Lexingtons (Lockheed Venturas). By December 1944 they had 440 <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> (173 B-17 Flying Fortresses, 255 B-24 Liberators, and 12 YB-40 Flying Fortresses). By the latter date, students on gunnery missions fired from these, while two-engine aircraft towed targets and single engine tactical aircraft simulated attacks on the bombers. Unfortunately, towed targets hardly resembled attacking fighter aircraft, but one device that more closely simulated combat conditions was a camera gun that students [...] "fired" [...] at fighter aircraft flying in normal attack patterns toward the bombers. These cameras, which came into general use during 1944 and 1945.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1912, Igor Sikorsky became Chief Engineer of the {{aircraft}} division for the Russian Baltic Railroad Car Works (Russko-Baltiisky Vagonny Zavod or R-BVZ) in Saint Petersburg. His work at R-BVZ included {{the construction of the}} first <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the S-21 Russky Vityaz, which he initially called Le Grand when fitted with just two engines, then as the Bolshoi Baltisky (The Great Baltic) when fitted with four engines for the first time, each wing panel's pair of powerplants in a [...] "push-pull" [...] tandem configuration previous to the four tractor-engined Russki Vityaz. He also served as the test pilot for its first flight on May 13, 1913. In recognition for his accomplishment, he was awarded an honorary degree in engineering from Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute in 1914. Sikorsky took the experience from building the Russky Vityaz to develop the S-22 Ilya Muromets airliner. Due to outbreak of World War I, he redesigned it as the world's first four-engined bomber, for which he was decorated with the Order of St. Vladimir.|$|E

50|$|On 1 July 1976, the Wing {{received}} {{notice of}} reassignment to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). A year later, the Wing transitioned to the KC-135A Stratotanker, a <b>four-engine</b> jet <b>aircraft.</b> This {{was a significant}} upgrade, increasing the Wings air refueling capacity and expanding its global mission capability.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the {{original}} passenger terminal was damaged by a fire.An upgraded traffic control tower was constructed and began operation and Runway 6-24 {{was extended to}} 5000 ft for larger <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> during 1952. A new passenger terminal was opened in 1955.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1943, {{plans were}} {{initiated}} for {{reconstruction of the}} site to accommodate both two and <b>four-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> A refresher fixed gunnery course for single-engine pilots (P-63, P-39, and P-40) flying pursuit gunnery missions was started at Dateland AAF in December 1944.|$|E

50|$|On 31 July 1943, the Southeast Air Corps Training Center was redesignated as the Eastern Flying Training Command.

50|$|In June 2010, EADS {{partnered with}} Aero Composites Saintonge and the Greencri-cri Association {{to present an}} {{electric-powered}} Cri-Cri at the Green Aviation Show in Le Bourget.

50|$|The airline was {{established}} and started operations in 1953 as a non-scheduled carrier operating cargo and passenger services.

50|$|Throughout the period, {{the lack}} of <b>four-engine</b> {{long-range}} <b>aircraft</b> and trained crew, unpredictable weather over the Mediterranean, general bureaucracy and feeling of a 'side-show' meant that flights were fewer and cargo continued to consist of explosive and medical supplies, rather than small arms and ammunition.

50|$|During this time, Sukhoi, {{traditionally}} {{a designer}} of fighter aircraft, developed the T-4, a <b>four-engine</b> titanium <b>aircraft</b> with canards. A {{response to the}} XB-70, {{it was to have}} a cruise speed of 3,200 km/h, requiring a massive research effort in order to develop the requisite technologies. Not to be outdone, Tupolev, whose expertise is with bombers, offered the Soviet Air Force (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS) a massively-updated version of the Tu-22.|$|R

5000|$|The Gotha WD.27 (for Wasser Doppeldecker - [...] "Water Biplane") was {{a patrol}} {{seaplane}} developed in Germany during World War I.
