5|$|Many in the {{conservation}} movement urged {{the state to}} buy back the land, especially after the Curtiss-Wright lease was canceled. In April 1967 Penn State vacated the site and gave the reactor complex to the state. Martin Marietta departed in June 1967, and early in that same year, Pennsylvania bought the remaining land back from Curtiss-Wright for $992,500, about $811,000 more than they had sold it for in 1955. Various usage plans for the area were proposed, including: a vacation resort with a large artificial lake, motels, golf courses, and honeymoon resort; a Penn State <b>game</b> <b>preserve</b> stocked with exotic animals like bison and boar; a large youth camp for several hundred children; and a radioactive waste disposal site. By November 1967, all of the land {{was back in the}} state forests and state game lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} proposed would {{differ significantly}} {{from that of a}} typical zoo in that animals would be exhibited in a natural environment rather than in cages. In 1964, the park was assessed financially and then moved onto the next phase; this resulted in three alternative developments. There was an idea for a conservation farm, a <b>game</b> <b>preserve,</b> and a natural environment zoo. The natural environment zoo development was chosen over the conservation farm and <b>game</b> <b>preserve</b> even though it was the most expensive option. The estimated initial cost was $1,755,430.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{describe}} individual types of gamekeeper constructions and facilities built in overwintering <b>game</b> <b>preserves</b> {{in the area of}} National park Šumava. Another aim is to create a map with their position and to compare facilities of overwintering <b>game</b> <b>preserves</b> among themselves. In the résumé were described all types of hunting contructions and facilities that can be theoretically built in overwintering <b>game</b> <b>preserves.</b> Practical part describes the gamekeeper contructions and facilities that actually occur in overwintering <b>game</b> <b>preserves.</b> The result of a terrain research is a list of gamekeeper constructions and facilities, as well as a map containing locations of gamekeeper contructions and facilities. The results and recommendations presented in this bachelor thesis can be used in procedures for all overwintering <b>game</b> <b>preserves,</b> if keepers of these objects require high-quality gamekeeper constructions, which have a high technical level and which serve their particular purpose...|$|R

25|$|The {{first of}} these {{introductions}} occurred in New Hampshire in 1890. Thirteen wild boar from Germany were purchased by Austin Corbin from Carl Hagenbeck, and released into a 9,500 hectare <b>game</b> <b>preserve</b> in Sullivan County. Several of these boars escaped, though they were quickly hunted down by locals. Two further introductions were made since the original stocking, with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve's fencing. These escapees have ranged widely, with some specimens having been observed crossing into Vermont.|$|E
25|$|The most {{extensive}} boar introduction in the US {{took place in}} western North Carolina in 1912, when 13 boars of undetermined European origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a <b>game</b> <b>preserve</b> in Hooper Bald, Graham County. Most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade, until a large-scale hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape. Some of the boars migrated to Tennessee, where they intermixed with both free ranging and feral pigs in the area. In 1924, a dozen Hooper Bald wild pigs were shipped to California and released in a property between Carmel Valley and the Los Padres National Forest. These hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state, {{as well as in}} other states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Mississippi.|$|E
