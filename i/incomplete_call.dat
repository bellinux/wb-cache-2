40|$|Abstract—In a {{personal}} communication service (PCS) network, the call completion probability and the effective call holding times for both complete and <b>incomplete</b> <b>calls</b> are central parameters {{in the network}} cost/performance evaluation. These quantities {{will depend on the}} distributions of call holding times and cell residence times. The classical assumptions made in the past that call holding times and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the effective call holding time distributions for complete and <b>incomplete</b> <b>calls</b> with general cell residence times and call holding times distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions. These results provide a set of alternatives for PCS network modeling, which can be chosen to accommodate the measured data from PCS field trials. The application of these results in billing rate planning is also discussed. Index Terms—Billing rate planning, call blocking, call holding time, call termination, cell residence, handoff, PCS.

40|$|Abstract—Actual call {{connection}} time (ACCT) {{is the total}} time that a mobile user engages in communications over a wireless net-work during a call connection. Due to limited network resources of wireless mobile networks, a call connection may be prematurely disconnected and the ACCT for the call in general {{may not be the}} same as the requested call {{connection time}} (RCCT). The ACCT depends not only on the RCCT, but also on the network resource allocation scheme and network traffic. In this paper, we charac-terize the ACCT and related performance metrics for wireless mo-bile networks under a newly proposed general channel allocation scheme. This scheme generalizes the nonprioritized scheme, the re-served channel scheme, the queueing priority scheme and the sub-rating scheme {{in such a way as}} to reduce the blocking probability of the handoff calls while keeping the ACCT as long as possible. Explicit formulae for the distribution and the expectation of the ACCT are obtained. The call completion probability, the call drop probability, and the average actual call connection times for both the complete <b>calls</b> and the <b>incomplete</b> <b>calls</b> are derived. The results can form the basis for designing better billing rate schemes by dif-ferentiating <b>incomplete</b> <b>calls</b> and complete calls.

5000|$|An early {{predecessor}} of {{the green}} box with similar usage was the [...] "payphone diode" [...] or [...] "one-armed bandit". This was a cheap silicon low-power diode that was bridged across two signal wires into the phone (polarity selected so that the diode is normally reverse-biased, otherwise it would permanently short the line). This device exploited another weakness in the ACTS on certain phone models (including 3 slot rotary). These models used an electromechanical diverter flap to drop and direct coins from the holding area to either the coin vault or the coin return, based on a signal from the CO. The default position of this flap was to the coin return so no signal was required for <b>incomplete</b> <b>calls.</b> The diode allowed the coin drop on the Collect ACTS signal but kept the flap in the default position.|$|R

40|$|This paper gathers {{together}} deliberations surrounding Steve Biko’s I Write What I Like as it simultaneously registers {{the critical}} {{importance of the}} text as an incomplete history. Rather than presupposing the text {{as a form of}} biography or following a trend of translating Biko into a prophet of reconciliation, I argue that the text leads us towards the postcolonial problematic of self-writing. That problematic, I argue, names the encounter between self-writing and an apparatus of reading. The paper stages the encounter as a way to make explicit the text’s postcolonial interests and to mark the onset of an incomplete history. This, I argue incidentally, is where the postcolonial critic may set to work to finish the critique of apartheid. <b>Incomplete</b> histories <b>call</b> attention to how that which is unintelligible in a text makes an authoritative reading difficult.
