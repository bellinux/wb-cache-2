Some theories are used to analyze the issues raised in this dissertation such as: the extraterritorial/ exterritoriality jurisdiction theory, the functional necessity theory, the sovereignty theory, the perfect equality of state theory, the territorial jurisdiction theory and the reciprocity theory. This prescriptive legal research focused on law enforcement and it was aimed explaining to determine the truth of law. The study based on the provisions of international law, particularly in the diplomatic law, namely the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other laws (das-Sollen), as well as the application (das-Sein). The status of inviolability of diplomatic premises in the receiving state has not been absolute anymore. The progress of diplomatic law has shown that the situation can changes the status of inviolability. The protection of the citizens of the sending state who are involved in criminal act in the receiving state can be done based on the rights of extraterritorial jurisdiction. In the event of the receiving state has failed to implement international obligations to give mandatory access on consular notification and when the failure has caused harm to the citizens, the sending state is entitled to bring the case to international court.

40|$|What is ‘political asylum’? Klaus Neumann {{explores the}} history and {{meaning of the term}} MUCH of what has {{recently}} been said or written about political asylum has been confusing. What exactly is political asylum? Is there a difference between political asylum and territorial asylum? And what about the people who are nowadays most commonly labelled asylum seekers: those who arrived in Australia on rickety boats from Indonesia and who ended up in the Port Headland, Curtin, Woomera, Baxter, Christmas Island, Nauru and Manus detention centres - were they seeking the same kind of asylum that Mr Chen sought? A great deal of the recent confusion {{is due to the fact}} that the debate about Australia’s response to asylum seekers and refugees has been largely devoid of a well-informed historical perspective, and that as a result commentators have tended to view what is happening now as the norm, rather than as the exception or as something that became the norm. I am going to say a bit more about the history of the institution of political asylum in a few minutes. There is another reason for that confusion. Following Mr Chen’s defection, the government has been busily muddying the waters. And here, ‘the government’ is for once not synonymous with the indomitable Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, but with her colleague, Alexander Downer. Of course, when Mr Chen went public with his story on 4 June, journalists turned their attention to the usual suspect. But on 6 June, Amanda Vanstone told the ABC: ‘If you want to ask about any reason why this person has not been given territorial asylum then those questions should go to the minister responsible for that, which is in fact the Minister for Foreign Affairs. ’ Vanstone was right. While her department is responsible for issuing visas to those given political (or ‘territorial’) asylum, it is her colleague, Alexander Downer, who has the executive power to grant such asylum. But when journalists put asked Downer why Mr Chen’s request had been refused, he merely obfuscated the issue. ‘Well, look there have been only [...] . two cases as far as I know in Australian history where asylum of that kind - political asylum - has been given - in the Petrov case, and I think there was one other case, a very long time ago,’ he said on 7 June in Chennai. The next day, he added: ‘Well, he [Chen] didn’t lodge a formal application at all. ’ Did Mr Chen lodge a formal application? Was he required to lodge one? Who dealt with, and declined his application? And is it true that Australia has granted political asylum only twice? Were there only two requests? And if there were more, then what happened to the unsuccessful asylum seekers? Thanks to the current Senate inquiry into asylum and protection visas, it is now well established that Mr Chen sought political asylum in a letter hand-delivered to the Immigration Department’s Sydney office on 26 May; that that letter was almost immediately faxed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra; that Minister Downer’s office was made aware of the matter that same day; that, by the next morning, Downer had decided to decline Chen’s request; and that on 3 June Mr Chen applied for a protection visa, which was granted in early July. In the course of that inquiry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that its minister may, at his discretion, grant political asylum to anybody requesting it. A request may be made orally or in writing. There are no forms to fill in. The granting of political asylum is an executive act. Successful asylum seekers are issued with a visa by the Department of Immigration. There is a special visa category for people granted political asylum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs: subclass 800. Subclass 800 visas are, according to the migration regulations, for persons who have been granted ‘territorial asylum’. Both this term, and the term ‘political asylum’ have been used to refer to the asylum sought by Mr Chen. Both terms are correct. Territorial asylum is not some arcane privilege that is so rare that hardly anybody has ever been afforded it. It is one form of political asylum. The other is extra-territorial asylum (also sometimes referred to as <b>diplomatic</b> <b>asylum).</b> That is what the Bahktiyari boys sought - unsuccessfully - when they entered the British consulate in Melbourne a couple of years ago. That’s what Cardinal Mindszenty sought - and was granted - when fleeing to the United States embassy after the Soviet Union put down the popular uprising of October 1956 in Hungary. The processes triggered by a request for political asylum on the one hand, and by an application for a protection visa, on the other, are very different. One requires an executive decision informed by the minister’s judgment, the other sets in train a very bureaucratic process in which a person’s claim to be a refugee is assessed in the light of well-defined criteria. The minister’s decision is discretionary and non-reviewable. The immigration department’s assessment of a person’s refugee claim can be contested before the Refugee Review Tribunal. But the privileges sought by Mr Chen on 26 May, when he requested political asylum, and on 3 June, when he applied for a protection visa, are very similar. In both cases he sought Australia’s protection, including a guarantee that he would not be extradited or otherwise returned to China. You may have noticed that I have already surreptitiously introduced a historical perspective when mentioning Cardinal Mindszenty. Let me now refer to the past in a more systematic fashion. The institution of political asylum is at least two-and-a-half thousand years old. The Greek city states knew about and respected it. A citizen of, say, Sparta, who feared for his life for reasons to do with his politics, could seek, and be granted, asylum in, say, Athens. The system worked as long as the state which the asylum seeker had fled, in this case Sparta, was not powerful enough to make the harbouring state extradite the asylum seeker. In European history, the institution of asylum did not survive unchanged from the fifth-century BC to the twenty-first century AD. But, to cut a very long story very short, in nineteenth-century Europe the situation was again similar to that in fifth-century Greece. The twentieth century saw a major new development prompted by mass flights and mass expulsions. From the 1920 s, international organisations charged with representing the interests of stateless people and of refugees promoted solutions whereby refugees would be protected by international law. In 1951, several countries, including Australia, collaborated in drafting the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 1 of that convention defines those to be protected by it, namely persons who are outside their own country and unwilling to return to it ‘owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. ’ To cut another very long story very short, over the next few decades many countries acceded to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and incorporated their terms into domestic legislation. Australia didn’t sign the Protocol until 1973, and then waited another few years before making the terms of the Convention become part of its domestic law. But today, usually anybody in Australian territory who is seeking Australia’s protection fills in an application for a protection visa. The application is approved if, to cite the Immigration Department’s website, the applicant is ‘found to be owed Australia’s protection under the Refugees Convention’, that is if that person is outside their own country owing to well founded fear of being persecuted, etc, etc. So what happened in Australia before 1973 ? Until 1956, Australia did not have an asylum seeker policy. In large part that was a reflection of Australia’s geographical position: Australia had to deal with very few asylum seekers. They included, of course, Australia’s most famous asylum seekers, Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov, who were granted political asylum in 1954. On 16 October 1956, Cabinet approved ‘of the principle that political asylum and refuge should be available in appropriate instances to various categories of aliens namely Olympic Games visitors, members of visiting trade and other delegations, members of diplomatic and consular missions in Australia, certain other defectors and Asian leaders’. The policy was applied when several Eastern European athletes sought to stay in Australia after the conclusion of the 1956 Olympic Games. Before 1973 (in fact, until the Determination of Refugee Status Committee, DORS, was set up in 1978), requests for asylum were decided much like Mr Chen’s application of 26 May: by the foreign minister, in consultation with other relevant ministers and ASIO. Hundreds of people sought asylum in Australia or its territories before 1973. They were not required to fill in a form or to formulate their request in writing. Among those requesting political asylum before 1973 were diplomats and their dependants; seamen from Eastern Bloc countries; three naval ratings deserting a Portuguese frigate in 1961; a stowaway who feared to be deported to the People’s Republic of China; and others. In the 1960 s and early 1970 s, West Papuans crossing from Indonesian-controlled West Irian into the Australian Territory of Papua and New Guinea comprised the majority of asylum seekers. While receiving hundreds of asylum requests, the government has granted political asylum on very few occasions (although more than twice). In these high-profile cases the ‘propaganda value’ was expected to outweigh any ensuing diplomatic repercussions. They included that of Ryszard Stanislaw Zielinski, the Commercial Consul at the Polish Consulate-General in Sydney, who defected in 1961. In many other instances, the government categorically ruled out the option of granting political asylum (as it did in Mr Chen’s case), but at the same time allowed asylum seekers to remain in Australia or its territories. Many (but by no means all) West Papuan asylum seekers were granted five-year permissive residence visas. In 1965, External Affairs officers persuaded a defecting Burmese diplomat to ‘apply for permanent residence in the normal way (having been assured that his case would certainly receive sympathetic and prompt attention) ’. There were other cases, most notably those involving Eastern European athletes in 1956, where the government did not formally grant political asylum but where the Australian public understood that to have happened. So far, I have tried to sketch the historical background to two procedures: one involving a request for political asylum, the other an application for a protection visa. I have also tried to clear up some of the misunderstandings that resulted from Alexander Downer’s public statements about Mr Chen’s asylum claim. Downer was muddying the waters because he did not want to say why he had refused Mr Chen’s initial request. Governments let their decisions about refugee and asylum claims be influenced by a combination of four factors: • the so-called national interest (or, perhaps more accurately, Macchiavelli’s ragione di stato, reasons of state) • public opinion • legal obligations, and • humanitarian considerations. The national interest could come into play for several reasons: the granting of asylum potentially affects the relations between the asylum seeker’s country of origin and the country granting asylum, as it could be interpreted as an act undermining the sovereignty of the former (before Papua New Guinea became independent, West Papuan asylum seekers were never granted political asylum because External Affairs was afraid of offending the Indonesian government); some asylum seekers and refugees may be perceived to be security threats; asylum seekers may be considered an economic liability or an economic asset; the granting of asylum may be seen to subvert existing immigration policy; and finally, in some cases, a state may offer political asylum as an incentive (in the case of Vladimir Petrov, the then solicitor-general, Kenneth Bailey, suggested that asylum should not be simply offered to Petrov to ‘save his skin’ but only ‘for something we get out of it’). The second factor, public opinion, played an important role in the decision to offer asylum to Evdokia Petrova, who, unlike her husband, was not considered to be of ‘intelligence value’. In her case, the Menzies government was afraid to be accused of condoning her forced repatriation to the Soviet Union. International public opinion may also influence the decisions of governments, although arguably a country’s international reputation is a matter of national interest. During the Cold War, Western governments often considered asylum seekers from Eastern Bloc countries assets in an ideological war. When the Australian government formulated its asylum seeker policy in 1956, it was mindful of what the relevant Cabinet submission termed the ‘propaganda value’ of asylum cases. The third factor, legal obligations, is only relevant in the case of a person claiming to be a refugee in the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. But in that case, it can easily be the most important factor. The fourth factor, humanitarian considerations, is often linked to the second, public opinion, for a government may grant political asylum in cases where the domestic public strongly empathises with the asylum seekers - even if government members do not share the public’s humanitarian concerns. There is nothing wrong in principle with a government refusing a request for political asylum in the national interest - provided the asylum seeker’s interests are safeguarded. Thus it was not Alexander Downer’s decision to refuse Mr Chen asylum that was wrong, but the failure to offer him alternative protection. Instead, Mr Chen was advised of other visas (including a protection visa) he could apply for, but was told at the same time by a Foreign Affairs official that her minister had the power to veto a protection visa on foreign policy grounds. Given that that same minister had just declined a request for political asylum, presumably on foreign policy grounds, Mr Chen could have been forgiven for assuming that Downer would object to the granting of any visa for the same reason. If Minister Downer had instead sought to assure Mr Chen that the Australian government would not jeopardise his safety, the minister may have avoided some of the diplomatic fall-out that this case and the ensuing publicity have undoubtedly generated (and of which he seemed to be afraid when refusing Mr Chen’s initial request). Would it perhaps be better to have only one process, controlled by the Minister for Immigration and her department, who, after all, have ample experience in dealing with asylum seekers? Australia would do well to retain a dual system, if the granting of asylum were understood as an unbureaucratic means to offer protection to people in particularly precarious circumstances. It would because there may be situations when Australia’s national interest is better served by the swift and unbureaucratic granting of asylum (or the swift and unbureaucratic granting of permanent residence, as happened with some previous applications for political asylum), than by the issuing of a protection visa. Today it would also because the human rights of asylum seekers are often ill served by the Immigration Department’s narrow interpretation of the terms of the 1951 Refugees Convention. • Klaus Neumann is a senior research fellow at the Swinburne Institute for Social Research.
