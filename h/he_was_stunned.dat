5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E

25|$|Tsonga {{began his}} grass court season by {{reaching}} the 3rd {{round of the}} 2014 Aegon Championships. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> by Marinko Matosevic in straight sets.

He fell to two-time champion and longstanding rival Novak Djokovic in straight sets.|$|E

The bride's mother, however, {{who was at}} the time divorced from Mr. Mackay, wanted her daughter to follow the dictates of her own heart. Irving had in fact gone to her mother's home before the wedding and had obtained her blessing.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 1987, after {{a lecture}} from hard-liner Yegor Ligachev at the Politburo for {{allowing}} two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Yeltsin {{wrote a letter}} of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea. When Gorbachev received the letter <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned {{from the ranks of}} the Politburo. Gorbachev phoned Yeltsin and asked him to reconsider.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of March 15, Prime Minister Kan called Seiki Soramoto, who used to design nuclear plants for Toshiba, to ask for his help in {{managing}} the escalating crisis. Soramoto formed an impromptu advisory group, which included his former professor at the University of Tokyo, Toshiso Kosako, a top Japanese expert on radiation measurement. Mr. Kosako, who studied the Soviet response to the Chernobyl crisis, said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> at how little {{the leaders in the}} prime minister’s office knew about the resources available to them. He quickly advised the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, to use SPEEDI, which used measurements of radioactive releases, as well as weather and topographical data, to predict where radioactive materials could travel after being released into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Akebono had his MMA {{debut in}} K-1 before Ultimate Fighting Championship pioneer Royce Gracie. Although he was {{initially}} {{able to pass}} Gracie's guard briefly and fend him off, he was eventually submitted with an omoplata/wrist-lock combination. Akebono returned to the event the next year, fighting Bobby Ologun. The sumo champion neutralized Ologun's striking by taking him down and smothering during the earlier rounds, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> by a barrage of punches and controlled {{for the rest of}} the match, losing the decision. His third match would be against UFC champion Don Frye, who ended the match with a guillotine choke after controlling the fight on the feet. Akebono's last MMA match met professional wrestler Giant Silva, who made Akebono tap out to a kimura from under in one minute.|$|E

Father returns home from the North Pole to find Coalhouse playing ragtime in the Family's parlor. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>stunned</b> by the unexpected and unorthodox changes to his household, and he finds Mother unsympathetic to his complaints. He reflects on how much he has missed and how unsure <b>he</b> <b>is</b> of the world, but Mother and Younger Brother have embraced the changes. Hearing Coalhouse's music, Sarah finally descends to forgive him, and the lovers are joyfully reunited (“New Music”).|$|R
25|$|Nadal {{began his}} clay court {{season with a}} quarterfinal loss to David Ferrer in the Monte-Carlo Masters. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> by Nicolas Almagro in {{the quarterfinals of the}} Barcelona Open. Nadal won his 27th masters (a record at the time) at the Madrid Open after Kei Nishikori retired in the third set. On 8 June 2014, Nadal {{defeated}} Novak Djokovic in the Men's Singles French Open final to win his 9th French Open title and a 5th straight win at Roland Garros. Nadal dropped the first set but came back to win the next three sets and lift the trophy. Nadal equaled Pete Sampras' total of 14 Grand Slam wins, the second highest number of single Grand Slam titles for a male player, after Roger Federer. Nadal lost {{in the second round of}} the Halle Open to Dustin Brown the following week.|$|E
25|$|Kray's troops reached Alessandria on 12 June and Suvorov {{planned to}} launch {{them into an}} attack on Pérignon's wing early on the 14th. This proved to be impossible, but Kray managed to join Bellegarde's force and he promised to attack on 15 August. Meanwhile, the {{division}} of François Watrin moved down from the hills {{in the direction of}} Tortona, giving every indication that the French offensive was still in full swing. Joubert had hoped that he was facing only 8,000 enemies. But <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> to see that he was facing at least 36,000 enemies including Kray's corps in the plains below. Both Pérignon and Saint-Cyr counseled retreat, but Joubert put off a final decision until the next day. Meanwhile, Suvorov assumed that the French army would soon descend into the plains. When the French came forward, Kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while Bagration's 5,700-man Russian advance guard would turn their right flank. With luck the two forces would link hands behind the French. Once the turning movements were well developed, Wilhelm Derfelden's 9,850 Russians and Melas' 8,800 Austrians would join the battle. Farther north, Johann Baptist Alcaini's 5,260-strong force besieged Tortona, covered by Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg's 8,270 Russians.|$|E
500|$|Frank Kameny soon {{realized}} the pivotal change {{brought by the}} Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, {{he was used to}} persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, [...] "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred." ...|$|E
50|$|One {{day when}} Sal is {{driving through the}} neighborhood, he nearly runs into Tommy and Rosie, who he recognizes because of their car.

He tells his underlings where they live, and orders them to kill them.|$|R
50|$|When Henry {{returns to}} France to find Pierre, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>stunned</b> by the brutal {{aftermath}} of combat: widespread starvation, cities shattered by Allied bombing, {{and the return}} of survivors from the Nazi concentration camps.

5000|$|Horn crosses over a high, sandy hill rim and {{suddenly}} {{finds himself in}} New Mexico, in 1961. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>stunned</b> to see power lines, a seemingly endless hard black road, and a loud, fast-moving [...] "monster with a face" [...] coming at him. As the truck zooms past the unnerved Horn, he stumbles, accidentally firing his rifle and grazing his arm.|$|R
500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E
500|$|The game's ending was so {{unexpected}} that UEFA President Lennart Johansson {{had left}} his seat in the stands before Sheringham's equaliser {{to make his way}} down to the pitch to present the European Cup trophy, already decorated with Bayern ribbons. When emerging from the tunnel at the final whistle, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned.</b> [...] "I can't believe it", he later said, [...] "The winners are crying and the losers are dancing." [...] When the two teams went to collect their medals, Matthäus received his runners-up medal but removed it from his neck almost immediately. He never won the competition, having moved to play in the United States for the MetroStars Major League Soccer team before Bayern next won the European Cup in 2001. Matthäus later commented that [...] "it was not the best team that won but the luckiest". As captain of Manchester United, Peter Schmeichel should have received his medal last, but instead he went up first before having to return {{to the back of the}} queue with Alex Ferguson; the pair then lifted the trophy together, surrounded by the rest of Manchester United's players, including David May, who memorably climbed the presentation podium to a position of prominence in the celebration photographs.|$|E
500|$|The iOS version's {{improvements}} {{over the}} original PSP version were positively received. The website Famitsu App {{noted that the}} iOS version has shorter loading times and greater display resolution compared to the PSP version. Gay wrote that the iPhone 4's Retina Display made the game look [...] "a whole lot better than it did on the PSP or Vita", while Kumada said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> to see the iPhone 5's more vibrant colors and lack of interlacing, despite its smaller screen compared to the PSP. At the same time, reviewers had mixed opinions regarding the iOS' version's control scheme. Ryūichi Matsumoto of 4Gamer.net appreciated the iOS version's use of touch screen input, feeling that it simplified the controls and Gay felt the touch controls felt natural. In contrast, Famitsu App's writer {{felt that it was}} easier to hold down notes with the PSP's buttons, and Chuang said that playing on an iPad Mini felt less precise than on the PSP, but noted that the player can theoretically [...] "hit the notes even faster" [...] with a touch screen. Chuang also noted he occasionally opened the iOS version's pause menu by accident due to the touch controls, and Matsumoto complained that the use of touch screen input meant that his fingers would be blocking his view.|$|E

She eventually calms down when <b>he</b> says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> killing the grizzly just to protect his family.

5000|$|Soon afterwards, Stachel is {{shot down}} after rescuing a red Fokker Dr.I triplane fighter plane from two British fighters. When {{he returns to}} the airfield, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>stunned</b> when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{introduced}} to the man he saved: Manfred von Richthofen (Carl Schell) - the Red Baron. Richthofen offers Stachel a place in his squadron, which Stachel declines, explaining his desire to [...] "prove himself" [...] with his current squadron.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} day, Father Franklin arrives for a Papal Allocution. Fully expecting Pope John {{to issue}} another Anathema against both Marxism and Freemasonry - the ideological pillars of Felsenburgh's new order - [...] Father Franklin silently laments {{that the world}} will simply ignore it. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>stunned</b> as the Pope instead announces that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> creating an Order of Christ Crucified to spread the Faith {{in the face of}} persecution.|$|R
500|$|Inspired by his {{enjoyment}} {{of his own}} botanical garden but primarily by Anna Seward's poem “Verses Written in Dr. Darwin's Botanic Garden” (1778), Darwin decided to compose a poem that would embody Linnaeus's ideas. (Darwin would later include an edited version of Seward's poem in The Loves of the Plants without her permission and without acknowledgement. Seward was rankled by this treatment and complained of Darwin's inattention to her authorial rights in her Memoirs of Erasmus Darwin.) According to Seward, Darwin said that “the Linnean System is unexplored poetic ground, and an [...] happy subject for the muse. It affords fine scope for poetic landscape; it suggests metamorphoses of the Ovidian kind, though reversed.” Darwin may have also thought of The Love of the Plants “as a kind of love song” to Elizabeth Pole, a woman with whom {{he was in love}} and would eventually marry. Concerned about his scientific reputation and curious to see if there would be an audience for his more demanding poem The Economy of Vegetation, he published The Loves of the Plants anonymously in 1789 (see 1789 in poetry). <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> at its success and therefore published both Loves of the Plants and Economy of Vegetation together as The Botanic Garden in 1791. Joseph Johnson, his publisher, eventually bought the copyright for The Botanic Garden from him for the staggering sum of ₤800.|$|E
500|$|SS Wilfred Sykes loaded {{opposite}} Fitzgerald at the Burlington Northern Dock#1 {{and departed}} at 4:15p.m., {{about two hours}} after Fitzgerald. In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of Sykes predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that {{took advantage of the}} protection offered by the lake's north shore {{in order to avoid the}} worst effects of the storm. The crew of Sykes followed the radio conversations between Fitzgerald and Anderson during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers' Association downbound route. The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00p.m., issuing gale warnings for the whole of Lake Superior. Anderson and Fitzgerald altered course northward seeking shelter along the Ontario coast where they encountered a winter storm at 1:00a.m. on November 10. Fitzgerald reported winds of [...] and waves [...] high. Captain Paquette of Sykes reported that after 1a.m., he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship's speed because of the rough conditions. Paquette said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> to later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state that [...] "we're going to try for some lee from Isle Royale. You're walking away from us anyway... I can't stay with you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rees {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>stunned</b> {{when he learned}} that the number of federal agents who participated in [...] "Operation Reunion," [...] the raid to seize Elián from his great uncle's home in Miami, {{included}} a total of 151 persons, 131 from the INS and 20 from the United States Marshal's office.|$|E
50|$|In Ireland at {{the turn}} of the century, Count Marnak invites a troupe of actors to perform at his island castle. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>stunned</b> by how much Evelyn, the lead actress, resembles his dead wife. They begin an affair, but {{suddenly}} one by one, the inhabitants of the castle are turning up decapitated. The count fears that an old family curse is responsible for the grisly slayings.|$|R
50|$|An army of rats {{patrol the}} stages frequently. There are {{three kinds of}} rats: red, yellow, and white. The red one needs one hit of kick/slingshot attempt, while the yellow one needs two and the white one {{is the same as}} the red one but drops a cross {{granting}} temporary invincibility. Jake Fratelli makes an appearance and attempts to attack Mikey by shooting at him and spreading music notes at him. Jake Fratelli cannot be killed, even by bombs; <b>he</b> can only <b>be</b> <b>stunned.</b> After a while, he will get up and continue chasing the player (if still on screen). However, if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>stunned</b> while jumping over a pit, he will fall into it.|$|R
50|$|Graduating from {{military}} training, {{the families of}} the six come to pick them up and they all share the efforts and camaraderie they have, now bonded not just as soldiers but like brothers.
