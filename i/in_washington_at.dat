5|$|On July 20, the CIA agents {{presented}} {{the results of}} their first two weeks of work <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>At</b> Wisner's request, Tracy Barnes created a booklet from these documents to show to US President Dwight Eisenhower. The 23 documents in the booklet included Communist literature owned by Árbenz, such as a Chinese study on agrarian reform and some Marxist volumes, as well as diplomatic records implying Communist sympathies, and Árbenz's wife Maria Cristina Villanova's copy of a biography of Joseph Stalin. After the presentation, Frank Wisner decided that the examination of the seized documents needed to proceed faster, and so expanded the group of agents working in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>at</b> the behest of the State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The cabinet {{immediately}} convened and unanimously {{ratified the}} Emperor's wishes. They {{also decided to}} destroy vast amounts of material pertaining to war crimes and the war responsibility of the nation's highest leaders. Immediately after the conference, the Foreign Ministry transmitted orders to its embassies in Switzerland and Sweden to accept the Allied terms of surrender. These orders were picked up and received <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>at</b> 02:49, August 14.|$|E

5|$|Boeing built a final {{assembly}} line <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>at</b> its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and {{final assembly}} of the first aircraft began in January 1981.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>At</b> the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, and going on a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E

25|$|When I was a kid, {{my father}} told me about an {{accident}} that happened while he was working on Grand Coulee Dam <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> (<b>At</b> the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
25|$|Wallace's {{most notable}} service came on Saturday, July 9, 1864 at the Battle of Monocacy {{part of the}} Valley Campaigns of 1864. Although Confederate General Jubal A. Early and an {{estimated}} 15,000 troops defeated Wallace's troops at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, forcing them to retreat to Baltimore, the effort cost Early a chance to capture Washington, D.C. Wallace's men were able to delay the Confederate advance toward Washington for an entire day, giving the city time to organize its defenses. Early arrived <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>at</b> around noon on July 11, two days after defeating Wallace at Monocacy, the northernmost Confederate victory of the war, but Union reinforcements had already arrived at Fort Stevens to repel the Confederates and force their retreat to Virginia.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} script gives more {{insight into}} Scully's visit to Scott Blevins' office. The scene that introduces Scully {{in the script}} is set just before her visit and {{takes place at the}} FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, where she teaches a small group of trainees about the physiology of homicide, specifically electrocution and death by cattle prod. Her attention is distracted by an agent who enters the room and hands her a note that reads, [...] "Your attendance is required <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>at</b> 1600 hrs. sharp". Scully checks her digital watch, which reads 1:03. The majority, at the least, of this scene was actually filmed but the scene was omitted from {{the final version of the}} episode. The next scene is that in which Scully reports to the receptionist at FBI headquarters; the script includes Scully showing her badge to the receptionist and dialogue for the role of the receptionist as she tells Scully, [...] "See Section Chief Blevins. Third floor, violent crime division." [...] In the final version of the episode, Scully's badge does not appear in any of the scenes and the receptionist does not speak.|$|E

[...] The congressman had reportedly invited presidential candidates Chuck Baldwin, Bob Barr, Cynthia McKinney, and Ralph Nader to the press conference, leading some to speculate that they would endorse Paul running for president on the ticket of either the Constitution, Libertarian or other third party.|$|E

2500|$|From 1920 through 1923, {{seventeen}} uprisings or attempted coups in Honduras {{contributed to}} growing United States concern over political instability in Central America.

2500|$|The {{battle was}} over and so were almost 8,000 men’s lives with it. However this {{was a turning point}} in the war, and a turning point in Buford’s health. Five further months of almost {{constant}} skirmishing with J.E.B. Stuart's Rebel cavalry at such battles as Funkstown and Willamsport worsened Buford's condition. As Keogh later wrote in Buford's service record (etat de service), Buford [...] "was taken ill from fatique and extreme hardship". By the winter Buford would succumb to typhoid. Keogh would stay by his side and care for him, while they rested <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>at</b> the home of an old friend General George Stoneman. Buford was buried at West Point Cemetery, as Keogh attended his funeral at Washington and rode with his body on the train.|$|E
