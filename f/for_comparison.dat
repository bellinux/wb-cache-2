30|$|Data are {{presented}} as mean ± standard deviation. SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. A Chi square test was used <b>for</b> <b>comparisons</b> of preoperative and postoperative qualitative parameters, followed by Fisher’s exact test.

Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been broken off.
