5|$|Several {{features}} of the tooth are only known <b>from</b> <b>members</b> of the family Dromaeosauridae of theropod dinosaurs. Dromaeosauroides was classified {{as a member of}} the Dromaeosaurinae subfamily within the Dromaeosauridae, due to its similarity to Dromaeosaurus.

It is unlikely that a genus would survive for 60million years; Dromaeosauroides lived during the Early Cretaceous, and Dromaeosaurus during the Late Cretaceous. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.|$|E
