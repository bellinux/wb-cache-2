40|$|The {{influence}} of the modes of wet grinding of the original <b>ferrite-forming</b> components on their activity and {{the temperature of the}} synthesis powders of hexaferrites. It is shown that grinding of the initial components in the acidic environment can reduce the synthesis temperature of hexaferrites. The increased activity of the powders during milling in acidic medium due to the formation on the surface of particles of gellike layers of hydroxides of barium or strontium. The activity formed gelled layers to a significant extent can be controlled by introducing surfactants in the wet grinding...|$|E
