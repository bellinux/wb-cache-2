At this season several {{thousands}} of birds are killed; and the old ones, as if to defend their brood, hover {{over the heads of the}} Indians, uttering terrible cries. The young, which fall to the ground, are opened on the spot. Their peritoneum is extremely loaded with fat, and a layer of fat reaches from the abdomen to the anus, forming a kind of cushion between the legs of the bird. This quantity of fat in frugivorous animals, not exposed to the light, and exerting very little muscular motion, reminds us of what has been long since observed in the <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> <b>geese</b> and oxen. It is well known how favourable darkness and repose are to this process. The nocturnal birds of Europe are lean, because, instead of feeding on fruits, like the Guacharo, they live on the scanty produce of their prey. At the period which is commonly called at Caripe the [...] "oil harvest," [...] the Indians build huts with palm-leaves near the entrance, and even in the porch of the cavern. Of these we still saw some remains. There, with a fire of brushwood, they melt in pots of clay the fat of the young birds just killed. This fat is known by the name of butter or oil (manteca or aceite) of the Guacharo. It is half liquid, transparent without smell, and so pure that it may be kept above a year without becoming rancid. At the convent of Caripe no other oil is used in the kitchen of the monks but that of the cavern; and we never observed that it gave the aliments a disagreeable taste or smell.|$|E

5000|$|In French or Belgian cuisine, pâté may be {{baked in}} a crust as pie or loaf, {{in which case}} it is called pâté en croûte, or baked in a terrine (or other mold), in which case it is known as pâté en terrine. Traditionally, a forcemeat mixture cooked and served in a terrine is also called a terrine. The most famous pâté is {{probably}} pâté de foie gras, made from the livers <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> <b>geese.</b> Pâté en croûte is baked with the insertion of [...] "chimneys" [...] on top: small tubes or funnels that allow steam to escape, thus keeping the pastry crust from turning damp or soggy. Baked pâté en croûte usually develops an air bubble under the crust top as the meat mixture shrinks during baking; this is traditionally dealt with by infusing semi-liquid aspic in the hollow space before chilling.|$|R

40|$|SummaryMedical {{etymology}} sometimes provides unexpected {{information about}} health concepts and medical practice in {{different times and}} cultures. We conducted an etymological analysis of the terms used to indicate “liver” in Germanic and Romance languages. The Greek word “hèpar” was originally connected {{to the concept of}} “pleasure”, showing that in antiquity the liver was considered to be the seat of soul and human feelings. In Romance languages, the Latin term “ficatum” was linked to the ancient practice <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> <b>geese</b> with figs (ficus in Latin) to make their livers more delicious. This relationship between the liver, fat, and carbohydrates seems to indicate that ancient gourmets had clear knowledge of the nutritional mechanisms underlying “fatty liver” in animals. On the other hand, the Germanic term “lifere” was initially connected to “life”, underscoring the relation of the liver to health and existence. In the Early Modern Age, the liver became a recurring image in political reflection, especially within the Elizabethan tradition of the body politic, where the king was frequently described as the “liver” of his country. Finally, the liver was used to indicate courage, or the lack of it: some modern French and English idiomatic expressions derive from the ancient belief that people who had no blood in their liver (“lily-livered”) would thus be cowards or betrayers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fattening</b> <b>of</b> cattle {{based on}} high-grain diets {{is the most}} {{intensive}} form of beef production. Although cattle are ruminants specialised in fodder utilisation, such effective systems of young cattle nutrition exist that resemble – by a high grain pro-portion – the <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> non-ruminant animals. They are used most frequently for the <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> lower slaughter weight categories of cattle (250 to 450 kg), i. e. {{for the production of}} so called baby beef. Many authors dealt with cattle fattening by the baby beef method, with 80 % grain proportion of dry matter in the diet (Krása et al., 1995; Chládek et al., 1998; Pinďák and Vrchlabský, 2000). High-grain diets may also be used for the fat-tening of animals up to higher slaughter weights about 600 kg, particularly for intensive <b>fattening</b> Effect <b>of</b> intensive <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> bulls based on a high-grain diet on growth intensity and biochemical and acid-base parameters of bloo...|$|R

40|$|Interferon γ {{receptor}} 1 (IFNGR 1) and IFNGR 2 are two {{cell membrane}} molecules belonging to class II cytokines, which play {{important roles in}} the IFN-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. Here, goose IFNGR 1 and IFNGR 2 were cloned and identified for the first time. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that relatively high levels <b>of</b> <b>goose</b> IFNγ mRNA transcripts were detected in immune tissues, including the harderian gland, cecal tonsil, cecum, and thymus. Relatively high expression levels of both IFNGR 1 and IFNGR 2 were detected in the cecal tonsil, which implicated an important role of IFNγ in the secondary immune system <b>of</b> <b>geese.</b> No specific correlation between IFNγ, IFNGR 1, and IFNGR 2 expression levels was observed in the same tissues <b>of</b> healthy <b>geese.</b> IFNγ and its cognate receptors showed different expression profiles, although they appeared to maintain a relatively balanced state.
