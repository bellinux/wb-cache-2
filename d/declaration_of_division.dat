The full complement <b>of</b> the <b>division</b> arrived to Vitebsk only by June 27, 1941. Upon arriving to Vitebsk, the division was manned to peace time standards (6,000 soldiers and officers). Due to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war, the <b>division</b> was urgently staffed with personnel and supplied with additional weapons and materiel over the period of June 22-27. The mobilized personnel arriving to the division's camps was often under-supplied, but over the course of the week the division became fairly battle-ready.|$|R
