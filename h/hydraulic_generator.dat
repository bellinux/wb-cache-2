Morgan Smith company and were now rated at [...] and 125 rpm. The water passage for the turbines was modified and the operating frequency of the generators raised to 40 Hz. At the same time, a reciprocating Corliss steam engine was installed in the plant to provide supplemental capacity during low water flow; this drove the No.7 <b>hydraulic</b> <b>generator</b> through a rope drive. This was only kept for 5 years. One turbine failed in 1932 and has not been replaced.

This new design eliminates power conditioning all, or nearly all, of the time.

A series of wind blades is attached to a series of radial piston pumps, which pump fluid to a series of axial piston motors attached to generators. As the wind is reduced, the amount of energy is reduced, and the number of active <b>hydraulic</b> <b>generators</b> can be reduced to maintain a nearly constant RPM.

30|$|Offshore {{drilling}} {{has attracted}} {{more attention than}} ever before due to the increasing worldwide energy demand especially in China. High cost, long drilling cycles, and low rate of penetration (ROP) represent critical challenges for offshore drilling operations. The <b>hydraulic</b> pulse <b>generator</b> was specifically designed, based on China offshore drilling technologies and parameters, to overcome problems encountered during offshore drilling. Both laboratory and field tests were conducted to collect {{the characteristics of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> pulse <b>generator.</b> The relationships between flow rate and pressure amplitude, pressure loss and pulse frequency were obtained, which can be used to optimize operation parameters for hydraulic pulse jet drilling. Meanwhile a bottom hole assembly (BHA) for pulse jet drilling has been designed, combining the <b>hydraulic</b> pulse <b>generator</b> with the conventional BHA, positive displacement motor, and rotary steerable system (RSS) etc. Furthermore, the hydraulic pulse jet technique has been successfully applied in more than 10 offshore wells in China. The depth of the applied wells ranged from 2, 000 m to 4, 100 m with drilling bit diameters of 311 mm and 216 mm. The field application results showed that hydraulic pulse jet technique was feasible for various bit types and formations, and that ROP could be significantly increased, by more than 25 %.|$|R
50|$|The process {{essentially}} {{consists of}} pumping {{water from a}} lower elevation into a containment at a higher elevation. In this step, the mechanical device used to move the water acts like a conventional pump to lift the water. External power, in this case an electric motor, supplies the needed energy. Later, the external power is switched off and water flows backward through the device, enabling it {{to function as a}} hydraulic turbine generating energy to drive an electric power generator. Ideally, the power generated would offset the power consumed in elevating the water. In practice, there are inefficiencies in the system that cause the power consumed raising the water to significantly exceed the energy generated during the reversal of water flow. GRDA has stated that pumping water from Lake Hudson (the source) into Lake W. R. Holway (the receiver) consumes nearly twice the power that can be recovered from the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>generator.</b> The real benefit from the process is that the owner can use power for pumping when overall power demand from customers is lower, and supply electric power when customer demand is higher. It is an effective way to provide peaking power because the system can be brought on line (or taken off line) very quickly.|$|E

Without the proper type and amount of common ground equipment, Navy and Marine Corps maintenance personnel cannot adequately maintain and repair their aircraft. Deficits in the inventory of this equipment, could have a direct negative impact to the readiness of Naval Aviation's aircraft. During the recent "build-up" of the Fiscal Year 2000 budget (POM- 00), the requirements officer for common support equipment was tasked by his resource sponsor to perform a * 10 % plus-up "drill" of the common ground equipment's six year budget profile (FYDP).

40|$|Tidal energy, {{offshore}} wind energy, and onshore wind energy {{can be converted}} to electricity at a central ground location by means of converting their respective energies into high-pressure hydraulic flows that are transmitted to a system of generators by high-pressure pipelines. The high-pressure flows are then efficiently converted to electricity by a central power plant, and the low-pressure outlet flow is returned. The Department of Energy (DOE) is presently supporting a project led by Sunlight Photonics to demonstrate a 15 kilowatt tidal hydraulic power generation system in the laboratory and possibly later submerged in the ocean. All gears and submerged electronics are completely eliminated. A second portion of this DOE project involves sizing and costing a 15 megawatt tidal energy system for a commercial tidal energy plant. For this task, Atlantis Resources Corporation's 18 -m diameter demonstrated tidal blades are rated to operate in a nominal 2. 6 m/sec tidal flow to produce approximately one megawatt per set of tidal blades. Fifteen units would be submerged in a deep tidal area, such as in Maine's Western Passage.

A new renewable energy is the wave power, that transports energy by ocean surface waves, and capture that energy to do useful work.

The material produced in this report is definitely the beginning of new knowledge which can be deeply developed. From these studies some conclusions can be done as electrical systems offer excellent prospects for superior performance and other benefits compared with hydraulic systems, and the development of electrical system prototypes is justified. Phase control avoids the drawback of high power peaks keeping the advantage of increased power extraction. The rotating generation is preferred against a linear electric power generation in terms of efficiency and cost. In a plant, the wave energy converters (base units) can be connected in larger arrays ranging from tenths up to thousands of individual converters. The connections of these converters to the grid can be implemented in various ways (converters and transformer offshore or onshore and connections cables schemes) depending on the size of the farm and the proximity to the grid among other criteria as availability or cost. Taking into account cable losses and complexity the better option is place these devices onshore for small farms close to the grid and offshore for medium to large farms. Comparing connection schemes in terms of cable cost, both material and installation, and availability, systems with clusters and subclusters (small amount of base units) and one cable to the shore are the better options.

For all these reasons LiDAR is particularly suitable for deriving precise Digital Terrain Models (DTM) as geometric basis for hydrodynamic-numerical (HN) simulations. The application of LiDAR for river flow modelling requires a series of preprocessing steps. Terrain points have to be filtered and merged with river bed data, e. g. from echo sounding. Then, a smooth Digital Terrain Model of the Watercourse (DTM-W) needs to be derived, preferably considering the random measurement error during surface interpolation. In a subsequent step, a hydraulic computation mesh has to be constructed. Hydraulic simulation software is often restricted to {{a limited number of}} nodes and elements, thus, data reduction and data conditioning of the high resolution LiDAR DTM-W becomes necessary.

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of blood pressure using a fluid-filled catheter and an electromechanical transducer is widely accepted in clinical practice. However, errors {{associated with the}} measurement are often not appreciated and these catheter-manometer systems are frequently unable to accurately reproduce applied pressures. To assess the accuracy of catheter-manometer systems used for invasive arterial blood pressure measurements, in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed. The frequency response (described in terms of damped natural frequency and damping factor) {{for a variety of}} cannulae, pressure tubing and stopcocks (and combinations thereof) and their dependence on various parameters (catheter length, lumen diameter, fluid temperature and catheter material) were measured using an <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>generator.</b> The design and construction details of the pressure generator are presented. It was found that the damped natural frequency of the catheter-manometer system is directly proportional to lumen diameter of the pressure tubing/catheter. Furthermore, damping factor is inversely related to the damped natural frequency and stiffer catheter material (for identical radius ratios) results in higher damped natural frequency. Catheter length is inversely related to damped natural frequency and the resonant frequency decreases for an increase in fluid operating temperature. It was established that all catheter-manometer systems tested were under-damped (0. 15 < Î² < 0. 37) and that the damped natural frequency ranged from 10. 5 Hz for 1500 mm to 27. 0 Hz for pressure tubing of 300 mm in length. Furthermore, catheter-manometer systems which had pressure tubing in excess of 300 mm in length did not comply with the bandwidth requirements for accurate dynamic blood pressure measurement. For the in vivo assessment of the catheter-manometer system, the blood pressure waveform was analysed in the time and frequency domains. It was established that in 60 percent of the cases, the systolic pressure peak was higher when measured by a narrow bandwidth catheter-manometer system compared to that measured by a wide bandwidth system. Furthermore, values of dp/dt maximum were lower for wide bandwidth catheter-manometer systems than those measured by narrow bandwidth systems for heart rates above 90 beats per minute. In the frequency domain analysis, artifact was sometimes found to occur at frequencies higher than the bandwidth of the catheter-manometer system.
