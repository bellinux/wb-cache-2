25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} behaviors of species of Parischnogaster is the egg deposition process. The ovipositing female uses an abdominal substance produced by herself to handle the egg. In the first stage, the wasp collects a patch of viscid abdominal substance in her mouth. The patch is then placed into the cell. In the second stage, the wasp bends her abdomen towards <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>As</b> the egg emerges from the abdomen the female will grasp it with its mouthparts. The final stage consists of collecting another patch of abdominal substance to place on top of the egg in the cell. This process may have evolved for defense purposes. Since P. alternata typically take on flight as an active defense, this method helps the female save the egg they are laying if disturbed by an attack.|$|E
25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food into <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her rubbed her face in her food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E
500|$|The {{temperature}} at which American alligator eggs develop determines their sex (see temperature-dependent sex determination). Those eggs which are hatched at {{a temperature of}} 34°C (93°F) or more become males, while those at a temperature of 30°C (86°F) or lower become female. The nests built on levees are warmer and thus produce males, while the cooler nests of wet marsh produce females. The female remains near the nest throughout the 65-day incubation period, protecting it from intruders. When the young begin to hatch — their [...] "yelping" [...] calls can sometimes even be heard just before hatching commences — the mother quickly digs them out and carries them to the water in <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>as</b> some other crocodilian species are known to do.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. Although {{it does not follow}} a substantial plot, it features outfits and scenes inspired by The Sound of Music. Stefani and her Harajuku Girls are often dancing in front of fields of flowers and a background of key-like symbols composed of two G's placed back to back. In a scene mimicking The Sound of Music, Stefani portrays Maria von Trapp while the dancers, dressed in pajamas, portray her children and jump on a bed. In another scene, Stefani uses curtains to create sailor suits for the Harajuku Girls. Stefani also appears as a nun and an orchestra conductor. One scene uses smoke to create the illusion that Stefani is a submerged escape artist searching for a key. She pulls the key, a symbol of [...] "the sweet escape", from <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> an allusion to performances by escapologist Harry Houdini. The song's title is often visualized by a colorful sign that reads [...] "wind it up". Another video was produced in 3-D, but this version was never released. After seeing the video, Jimmy Iovine, co-founder of Interscope Records, decided to work with James Cameron to produce other 3-D music presentations.|$|E
2500|$|Though he {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to marry her, the king had grown quite fond of his wife, and {{it is said that}} he was [...] "so grieved by [...] mortal illness… that he could neither eat nor sleep". In her final hours, Philippa was said to be lucid and without pain. According to legend she was roused by a wind which blew strongly against the house and asked what wind it was, upon hearing it was the north wind, she claimed it quite beneficial for her son's and husband's voyage to Africa, which she had coordinated. At her death she prayed with several priests and, [...] "without any toil or suffering, gave her soul into the hands of Him who created her, a smile appearing on <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> though she disdained the life of this world".|$|E
2500|$|On October 2, 2016, while {{attending}} Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint {{in the apartment}} where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry. The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> a gag. Kardashian, who {{was placed in the}} bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life. She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped. On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed [...] "on hold indefinitely" [...] after the robbery. Production resumed on October 26. Kardashian postponed a makeup demonstration in Dubai due to the incident.|$|E

2500|$|In early February 2017, [...] "It Ain't Me" [...] was {{registered}} on the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) database. Gomez first teased {{the single}} with two Instagram stories on 3 February 2017. The first teaser showed a half-profile of the singer {{with a black}} [...] "X" [...] over <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> a 10-second snippet plays with the lyrics, [...] "I had a dream / we were back to 17 / summer nights and liberties / never growing up," [...] while the second teaser was a snippet of the song's beat. Gomez later revealed the single's cover art and release date on Instagram on 13 February 2017, and shared three teasers of the song on Snapchat the following day. [...] "It Ain't Me" [...] was released for digital download by Sony and Ultra Music on 17 February 2017 as the first single from Kygo's upcoming second studio album.

2500|$|In {{his article}} [...] "Too Gay for the U.S.A.", Andrew Webster of The Escapist used {{the history of}} Birdo in the lead-in to his article, commenting on how Nintendo tried to hide Birdo's gender confusion, and how [...] "He's {{just one of a}} long line of Japanese {{videogame}} characters forced to hide their true sexual identity". GamesRadar UK listed Birdo as one of [...] "gaming's most repelling anti-babes", describing her as a [...] "pink, egg blowing, transvestite dinosaur with a mouth like a burst fire hose," [...] thereby describing her as [...] "terrifying". Morgan Webb of X-Play created a video titled [...] "Birdo WTF", commenting that everyone initially thought of Birdo as a [...] "cute little dinosaur". She also describes her as a very feminine male character if she really is transgender. Nintendo Power listed Birdo as one of three weirdos, citing her change from being male to being a love interest for Yoshi. They described her gender as one of life's biggest questions, commenting on how she shoots eggs out of <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>as</b> another oddity. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commented that Birdo is [...] "the most gender-confused character in the history of Nintendo". He also commented on the relationship Yoshi and Birdo formed in Mario Tennis, stating, [...] "They were both sexually chaotic as individuals" [...] as [...] "Yoshi is supposedly a male, but lays eggs like a female. Birdo is supposedly a female, but was originally called a male." ...|$|E
2500|$|As in all crocodilian species, {{the female}} {{saltwater}} crocodile exhibits a remarkable level of maternal {{care for a}} reptile. She excavates the nest in response to [...] "yelping" [...] calls from the hatchlings, and even gently rolls eggs in her mouth to assist hatching. The female will then carry the hatchlings to water in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> (<b>as</b> Nile crocodile and American alligator females have been observed doing when their eggs hatch) and remains with the young for several months. Despite her diligence, losses of baby crocodiles are heavy due to various predators and unrelated crocodiles of their own species. Only approximately 1% of the hatchlings will survive to adulthood. By crocodilian standards, saltwater crocodile hatchlings are exceptionally aggressive {{to one another and}} will often fight almost immediately after being transported to water by their mother. The young naturally start to disperse after around 8 months, and start to exhibit territorial behaviour at around 2.5-years-old. They are the most territorial of extant crocodilians and, due to their aggressiveness to conspecifics, from the dispersed immature stage on, they are never seen in concentrations or loose groups as are most other crocodilians. However, even females will not reach proper sexual maturity for another 10 years. Saltwater crocodiles that survive to adulthood can attain a very long lifespan, with an estimated life expectancy upwards of 70 years, and some individuals possibly exceed 100 years, although no such extreme ages have been verified for any crocodilian.|$|E
