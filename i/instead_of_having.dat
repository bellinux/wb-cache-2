5|$|Dynasty Warriors 4 expands on its {{predecessors}} by adding new characters, new modes {{of play and}} a completely new 'Edit Mode.' <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> strict routines to follow during battle, officers, to some extent, will have a greater reaction to the events taking place on the battlefield {{in the game and}} may react to things more often.|$|E

Gravel was the chief architect {{of the law that}} created a regional high school system for rural Alaska; this allowed Alaska Natives to attend schools near where they lived, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to go to schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the lower 48 states.|$|E

5|$|The {{casting process}} for Monica Reyes was unconventional. Gish {{received}} a call from her agent, who informed her that The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to a do a reading, she only had to meet with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. After receiving the part, Gish's first shot was scheduled four in the morning; her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee.|$|E
5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E
5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E

5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} on the 11th, wily Saltykov realized that Frederick was not advancing on him from Frankfurt, and changed his plans. He inverted his flanks: <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the left wing at the shtetl and the right at Mühlberge, he reversed his flank with the right at the shtetl. Then the Russians set fire to Kunersdorf. Within hours, {{the only thing left}} was the stone church and some walls. While Frederick developed his plan to outflank Saltykov by maneuvering behind him, Saltykov outfoxed him.|$|E
5|$|Raptor is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a short layout {{designed to fit}} into a compact area like , Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra roll, a first for inverted roller coasters. At its opening, it was the largest investment in Cedar Point history. The ride is themed as a bird of prey.|$|E
5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E

5|$|The BBC regime brought {{immediate}} benefits. The use of {{the second}} half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell's. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to rescore the work for the forces available.|$|E
5|$|The German fighter escort {{consisted}} of five Gruppen from JG 3, JG 53 and Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77). LG 2 Bf 109s flew top cover while Adolf Galland's JG 26 and Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51) conducted fighter sweeps {{in advance of}} the main bomber stream. For the sake of appearances (the morale of the bomber crews), Zerstörergeschwader 26 (Destroyer Wing 26 or ZG 26) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 flew close escort to KG 26. It was twice as small as the formation that hit London on 7 September, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> two fighters for every bomber, there were four. Nor could the German pilots complain about being tied to the bombers. Sufficient numbers of fighters were allowed to roam on free-ranging patrols.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E

5000|$|The 17th century English Biblical {{commentator}} Matthew Poole {{referred to}} a hendiaduo in , a form of speech where two nouns are used <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> one noun described with an adjective or adjectival clause: 'God said [...] "I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception"' <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> 'your sorrow in conception', and similarly in [...] the text states that 'God shall send them a saviour, and a great one' <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>'a</b> great saviour'.|$|R
5|$|The {{use of a}} wing-forward was a {{distinctive}} feature of New Zealand play. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> eight men in the scrum as was normal elsewhere, seven men were usedthe missing man, the wing-forward, instead fed {{the ball into the}} scrum then held onto one of their hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to their half-back. With the wing-forward bound {{to the side of the}} scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre past him to tackle the player with the ball. This increased the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before his opposite could tackle him.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} {{the launch of the}} telescope, the {{returned}} images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango mixed static pre-rendered {{background}} {{images with}} 3D characters and objects. Part {{of this decision}} was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3s {{story or}} {{campaign}} mode {{can be played}} through alone or cooperatively with up to three other players via Xbox Live or System Link. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> each player be an identical character as in previous Halo games, the first player plays as Master Chief, and the second player plays as the Arbiter. The other two players control two Covenant Elites, N'tho 'Sraom and Usze 'Taham, each with their own backstories. No matter which character is played, each player has identical abilities, though their starting weapons vary. Hidden skulls found on each level cause changes to the gameplay when enabled, such as giving the enemies extra health, changing in-game dialogue, or modifying AI behavior. These skulls, {{as well as the}} difficulty level and the speed at which the level is completed, provide multipliers to the total score. Players are awarded gamerscore points for unlocking Achievements by reaching a certain score in each level.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E
