40|$|Interdigitated back contact {{solar cells}} were {{fabricated}} {{by a process}} in which patterned photoresist is jet printed directly on the wafer instead of <b>by</b> <b>lithography.</b> The patterned photoresist is used as a barrier for phosphorous and boron implantation as well as for contacts and metal etching. Control solar cells were fabricated <b>by</b> <b>lithography</b> in order to compare the performance of each patterning method. It was found that some of the jet printed photoresist films had non-uniformity issues with respect to the minimal thickness required for implant masking. When these thin zones are not present, structures obtained by jet printed are very similar to those obtained <b>by</b> <b>lithography.</b> With appropriate manufacturing development this technology {{has been shown to be}} feasible for lower-cost high volume production of solar cells...|$|R
