5|$|Later in {{the morning}} North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company. The company sent a squad with a light machine <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} tip of the ridge overlooking Agok to take these troops under fire. When the squad reached {{the tip of the}} ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base. The company hit these houses with artillery. The North Koreans broke from the houses, running for the river. At this the light machine gun {{at the tip of the}} ridge took them under fire, as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector. Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group. Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force. In the afternoon, US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company; only part of it was recovered. The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves {{to be an expert}} on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victim's head the night before the murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{brings the}} <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> FBI for {{comparison}} against the bullet that killed Bill. When Mulder awakens, he becomes angry and suspicious towards Scully.

However, Scully shoots him {{to prevent him from}} doing so, allowing Krycek to escape. Scully brings an unconscious Mulder to New Mexico and, when he awakens, reveals that his behavior was caused by a drug placed into his water supply and that she shot him because if he had killed Krycek, it then would have been harder to prove his innocence in his father's death. She then introduces him to Hosteen, who has been translating the files on the digital tape.|$|E

5|$|The PanzerI was {{upgraded}} {{in order}} to increase its lethality. On 8August 1937, Major General García Pallasar received a note from Generalísimo Francisco Franco that expressed the need for a PanzerI (or negrillo, as their Spanish crews called them) with a 20-millimeter gun. Ultimately, the piece chosen was the Breda Model 1935, due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German Flak 30. Furthermore, the 20mm Breda was capable of perforating 40millimeters of armour at 250meters (1.57in at 275yd), which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armour of the T-26. Although originally 40 Italian CV.35 light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament, this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PanzerI would yield better results. Prototypes were ready by September1937 and an order was placed after successful results. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement. Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of Seville, but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership's request for more lethal tanks. The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank's commander to aim, was found to be a dangerous weak point.|$|E

25|$|In November Harper {{proceeded}} to move an 18-poudner <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit of Mount Theodore, overlooking Cattaro, finally succeeding on 23 December. Bacchante returned and the British {{were able to}} establish four batteries with which to bombard Fort St John at Cattaro. They commenced firing on Christmans Day. On 1 January 1814 two more batteries werre brought into action. The British were preparing for an assault on 3 January when General Baron Gauthier, the French commander, offered to capitulate. The capitulation was signed on 5 January. In all, Bacchante and Saracen captured 130 guns and 900 men at Cattaro.|$|E
25|$|Starting in November, {{production}} {{switched to}} the heavier land-based A-2 model. It added shackles for two 50kg (110lb) bombs, two 20mm MG FF cannon in the wings, and a 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine gun in the cowling. The A-4 replaced it in December 1940, strengthening the airframe, adding another radio, and switching props to a VDM model. The apparently misnumbered A-3, which had additional strengthening of the airframe, replaced the A-4. The final production version was the A-5 from 1943, which changed radios and cockpit instruments, and switched the rear <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> much-improved MG 81Z. Overall, 541 Ar 196s (15 prototypes and 526 production models) were built before production ended in August 1944, about 100 of these from SNCA and Fokker plants.|$|E

On 20 July, Gusev advanced two machine <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Bug River under heavy artillery fire and made possible the crossing of the river with his platoon's fire. After crossing the river, Gusev brought his machine <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other bank and reportedly helped repulse five counterattacks. While repulsing one counterattack, Gusev reportedly destroyed a machine gun and killed ten German soldiers. During {{the expansion of the}} bridgehead, Gusev organized his platoon's machine <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> advance, allowing for the speedy capture of the forward German trenches. During the day, Gusev's machine gun platoon reportedly killed 35 German soldiers. For his actions in this battle, Gusev was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class on 5 August.|$|R

25|$|After trials, {{this gun}} was {{declared}} {{to be superior}} to all its rivals. Armstrong surrendered the patent for the <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British government, rather than profit from its design. As a result he was created a Knight Bachelor and in 1859 was presented to Queen Victoria. Armstrong became employed as Engineer of Rifled Ordnance to the War Department. In order to avoid a conflict of interests if his own company were to manufacture armaments, Armstrong created a separate company, called Elswick Ordnance Company, {{in which he had}} no financial involvement. The new company agreed to manufacture armaments for the British government and no other. Under his new position, Armstrong worked to bring the old Woolwich Arsenal up to date so that it could build guns designed at Elswick.|$|E
25|$|Ottoman {{artillery}} {{was famous}} for {{the size of its}} cannon, and their number; from the highly mobile anti-personnel Abus <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massive Great Turkish Bombard. These bombards were a product of specialised study in the production of 'giant guns' known literally as castle smashers 'kale-kob'. Although such weapons being primarily used in sieges; where they were cast on site due to the logistical difficulties attributed to transport them there, they were used as late as 1809 massive stone-firing guns were used with some effect against British ships during the Dardanelles Operation, throwing 1000-pound marble with a range of 1 mile. Accuracy was achieved by using wadded shots wrapped in sheepskin with ready-measured stacks of powder. Unlike the European powder, the Ottoman powder is thought to be better for upon firing; it produced white smoke rather than black smoke.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October 1934, the French Ministry of Air {{issued a}} {{specification}} for a heavy fighter. The specification demanded the aircraft {{be capable of}} performing three principal roles: fighter direction, {{in which it was}} required to lead formations of single-engine fighters with sufficient maneuverability; day attack, in which the type was also to escort friendly close air support and bomber aircraft; and nightfighter operations. Specified performance details included a maximum speed of 450km/h at 4,000 meters, a 300km/h cruising speed, and an endurance of at least four hours. Armament requirements included two fixed forward-firing 20mm cannons and a single machine <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear for self-defence. The sought aircraft was also required to accommodate two/three seats along with a twin-engine configuration; however, some of the performance limitations imposed upon the aircraft, such as the maximum weight, served to restrict the range of suitable engines to power the type.|$|E

25|$|Six ancient 24cm K L/35 C/88 guns {{originally}} {{used by the}} Odin class coast defense ship (Küstenpanzerschiff) {{that had}} equipped Batteries S1 at Sylt and Bremen at Norderney after those ships were disarmed in 1916 were placed on new mounts beginning in 1937. The gun could traverse only enough on the mount itself for fine corrections (the exact amount is disputed among the sources), coarser adjustments {{had to be made}} by turning the entire mount on the Vögele turntable. The turntable (Drehscheibe) consisted of a circular track with a pivot mount in the center for a platform on which the railroad gun itself was secured. A ramp was used to raise the railway <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of the platform. The platform had rollers at each end which rested on the circular rail for 360° traverse. It had a capacity of , enough for most of the railroad guns in the German inventory. The gun could only be loaded at 0° elevation and so had to be re-aimed for each shot. All six guns were delivered by 1939.|$|E
25|$|With the T-43 cancelled, the Soviet command {{made the}} {{decision}} to retool the factories to produce an improved version of the T-34. Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425mm (56in) to 1,600mm (63in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted and thus the larger 85mm gun. The prototype T-43's turret design was hurriedly adapted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory to fit the T-34. This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gunner and the loader. The turret armour was much thicker, 90mm, even if bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret. This made the turret, overall, a bigger target (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but more resistant to enemy fire. The ammunition load shrank from around 90-100 to 55-60 shells, but the projectiles were 50% heavier (9kg) and were much better in anti-armour role, and reasonable in a general purpose role. The resulting new tank, the T-34-85, was seen as a compromise between advocates for the T-43 and others who wanted to continue to build as many 76mm-armed T-34s as possible without interruption.|$|E
500|$|A third quadruple set of torpedo tubes was added, {{with one}} mount on the {{centerline}} {{and two in}} the side positions.
