40|$|Camera {{surveillance}} {{can provide}} good protection against {{certain types of}} crime, {{but it can also}} invade our privacy. The County Administrative Board monitors compliance with the rules by visiting those places to which the general public has access. They have to issue permits before general camera surveillance to those places which the general public has access. In certain cases, in stores for example, general camera surveillance is permitted only if the Country Administrative Board is notified in advance. The <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> is a public authority and responsible for the camera surveillance for those places to which the public not has access. You do not require a permit to monitor enclosed areas within a company, industrial processes, rooms in a home, schools etc. The deciding factor {{is whether or not the}} general public has access. In new cases from the <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> exclusive demanded that seven schools change their use of surveillance cameras in a decision. The authority hopes to set a precedent for schools across the country. The task for the Country Administrative Boards and the <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> is to protect the individual's privacy in the information society without unnecessarily preventing or complicating the use of new technology.     Keywords: camera surveillance, integrity, court case...|$|E

This thesis points out deficiencies {{in the area of}} information security in home healthcare regarding personal integrity and secrecy. Home healthcare is, in Sweden, performed by the municipalities. The work is based on the recommendations and common advice for processing of personal data compiled by the <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board.</b> Two municipalities in the Västra Götaland Region have been investigated. One of the municipalities has a manual system and the other has a computerized system for personal data management. The work includes a field study where persons from both municipalities have been observed. It also includes interviews based on the comprehensive questions from the <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> and questions arisen from the observations. The work shows that a very clear need of training among personnel involved in home healthcare. It also shows the need for elaborate security measures including levels on access profiles.

40|$|The {{authors of}} this study {{analysed}} {{the increasing use of}} personalized marketing and consumer concerns regarding the access to personal information. The purpose was to find out how companies could react to these concerns. Several theoretical concepts were explored, such as Personal Data, Personalized Marketing, Privacy Concerns, Privacy Policies, Consumer Trust and Consumer Behaviour. Facebook Inc. was analysed as an example to address the problem. An online survey was conducted on university students and two interviews were performed with representatives from the <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> in Sweden. The main findings were that individuals seem to approve of personalized marketing but are concerned about their privacy. Companies should therefore inform their consumers on how personal data is used for personalized marketing and respect their rights and take governmental regulations into consideration...|$|E
40|$|The witness seminar ”Integritetsdebatten åren kring 1984 ” [The Privacy Debate Around 1984] {{was held}} at the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm on 30 November 2007. The seminar was moderated by Lars Ilshammar and Kajsa Klein. A main focus of the {{discussion}} was if and how George Orwell’s book influenced the Swedish privacy debate in the mid 80 s. Most panellists agreed that 1984 had had limited importance in the Swedish context and that Orwell’s major achievement was to formulate a one-liner. Several other fictional accounts were brought up as comparison. Also clear from the discussion was that in Sweden, the privacy debate had ever since the late 1960 s had both left- and rightwing dimensions. There were thus Marxist, as well as conservative arguments, about how computers were used by financial elite and the authorities to control the people. Generally speaking, however, the mid 80 s were characterized by a move towards greater individualism and more widespread computer use. Emphasis in the discussion was put on the different actors and it was agreed that an important driving force behind the privacy debate was the Swedish <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board,</b> headed by the PR savvy director Jan Freese. Different examples were given of actions taken (and not taken) by this institution and also of internal conflicts within the board. The labor movement was on the other hand relatively silent and compared to its counterparts in other countries positive to computer use. Finally, a central theme during the seminar discussion was also the great controversy surrounding the sociological research project Metropolitan “revealed” in 1986. The role of the news media as investigator and scandalizer in this case was examined and debated. Two of the seminar participants were part of the Metropolitan cohort and presented their differing views about this project. While there was still disagreement about to what extent the project had been invasive and concealed, it was nevertheless concluded that especially the tabloids Aftonbladet and Expressen were responsible for exaggerations and fear-mongering in their reporting. In addition, the role of the Swedish <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> was again discussed...|$|E
40|$|Belgium {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of freedom of press and speech and of barring censorship. This liberal policy was also adopted to newsreels. In 1920 Parliament did found a central control <b>board,</b> the Film <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board,</b> to monitor films to protect children's sensibilities. However, in contrast to many other western countries there was no obligatory censorship involved. The Belgian government did only intervene exceptionally in public to control certain newsreels. Although Belgium did not have a tradition of film censorship and newsreels even enjoyed additional protection, this contribution claims that reality was more complex. Several mechanisms were created that enabled the government and the Film <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> to control and even censor newsreels and topical documentaries during the interwar period...|$|R

40|$|The {{digitization}} {{of patient}} data and medical records {{used by the}} healthcare-industry in Sweden is rapidly developing. However; developing and changing things in this field {{is not an easy}} task because of the circumstances surrounding it. Digital systems intended to process, and hold, sensitive personal data, such as medical journals, must be developed with laws, confidentiality, integrity and availability in mind to secure that none of this data gets compromised. A complicating factor in regards to this is the fast rate of development within IT in contrast to the much slower bureaucratic process of the justice system. This means that laws and regulations oftentimes aren’t up to date with the newest available technology. With the purpose of establishing set regulations on how patient data should be properly handled the Swedish government enacted the Patient Data Act (sv. Patientdatalagen, SFS 2008 : 355) on the 1 :st of July 2008. This act doesn’t only touch on safeguarding patient data but also deals with: A possibility for healthcare-providers to take part of other provider’s journals (a system for distribution and sharing of patient data).   The patients given right to at any time deny access of their data to any given healthcare-provider and/or specific personnel.   The possibility for patients to take part of follow-up information regarding access to their data and see, among other things, who’s accessed their files, at what time and which changes were made. In addition to the Patient Data Act the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the <b>Data</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Board</b> inaugurated regulations regarding the handling of information and journal keeping of the healthcare-industry (SOSFS 2008 : 14). This legislative act concerns business organizational issues regarding healthcare-providers responsibilities involving handling of sensitive data. The legislation also sets requirements for routines when following up on logs, methods for authentication etc. In addition to enacted laws and applied technical solutions there is the aspect, and importance, of education of healthcare-personnel. A key component to secure information handling is a security conscious, well-educated staff. This thesis describes the complexity and existing issues between the development of IT and currently enacted laws and regulations regarding healthcare and electronic journal keeping. It also discusses approaches to these issues and the target objective of future technical and administrative implementations. In addition to the presentation of contemporary circumstances in the area the report also deals with proposed solutions to the aforementioned issues. It highlights the areas that are considered critical, and currently non-prioritized, with regards to patient integrity. ...|$|E
