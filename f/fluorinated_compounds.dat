40|$|Tapura fischeri is {{a member}} of the family Dichapetalaceae and the only other member of this family {{naturally}} occurring in South Africa is Dichapetalum cymosum. Poisoning by D. cymosum results in the deaths of many domestic livestock each year due to the presence of fluoroacetate. The aim of the study was to determine if monofluoroacetate or another <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compound</b> is present in T. fischeri, and the possible role endophytes might play in the production of these compounds. Through NMR and GCMS studies it was established that trifluoroacetate is present in T. fischeri. Bacterial endophytes were isolated from plant material and shown to produce a <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compound</b> other than mono and trifluoroacetate. Since trifluoroacetic acid is extremely volatile, and evaporate from the plant extract over time, column chromatography, together with NMR was employed to isolate and identify other compounds responsible for antibacterial activity against the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis previously observed on TLC plates. Two compounds were isolated, and identified with NMR as a fatty acid and a fatty acid attached to glycerol. The names of the compounds could not be established with GCMS due to insufficient derivatization of the compounds. The antibacterial activity of the compounds were also analyzed using 96 well microtitre plates in liquid media, where it was determined that the compounds do not have antibacterial activity against E. faecalis. This indicated that previous results on TLC plates were false positives due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid compounds. Transmission electron microscopy was done on leaf material to determine the presence of bacterial endophytes in the intracellular spaces of plant material, but none was detected.

50|$|This {{route is}} very {{successful}} for higher order alkanes {{due to the}} fact that there is no formation of strong metal-carbon or metal-hydrogen bonds that could prevent any intermediates from reacting further. The reactions also take place in room temperature under mild conditions. However, when applying this method to methane specifically, the gaseous nature of methane requires an appropriate solvent. Reactions with other alkanes usually have the alkane in question be the solvent itself; however, any C-H bond with a lower BDE or higher polarity than methane will react first and prevent methane functionalization. Therefore, Pérez, Asensio, Etienne, et al. developed a solution to use supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent, which is formed under the critical pressure of 73 bar and a temperature of 31 °C. In these conditions, scCO2 behaves as a liquid, and since <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> can dissolve easily in scCO2, highly fluorinated silver-based catalysts were developed and tested with methane and ethyl diazoacetate. However, under the reaction conditions, only 19% yield of ethyl propionate was able to be achieved.

5000|$|Hydrodefluorination (HDF) {{is a type}} {{of organic}} {{reaction}} in which in a substrate a carbon-fluorine bond is replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond. The topic is of some interest to scientific research. In one general strategy for the synthesis of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> with a specific substitution pattern, the substrate is a cheaply available perfluorinated hydrocarbon. An example is the conversion of hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) to pentafluorobenzene (C6F5H) by certain zirconocene hydrido complexes. In this type of reaction the thermodynamic driving force is the formation of a metal-fluorine bond that can offset the cleavage of the very stable C-F bond. Other substrates that have been investigated are fluorinated alkenes. Another reaction type is oxidative addition of a metal into a C-F bond [...] followed by a reductive elimination step in presence of a hydrogen source. For example, perfluoronated pyridine reacts with bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) and triethylphosphine to the oxidative addition product and then with HCl to the ortho-hydrodefluorinated product. In reductive hydrodefluorination the fluorocarbon is reduced in a series of single electron transfer steps through the radical anion, the radical and the anion with ultimate loss of a fluorine anion. An example is the conversion of pentafluorobenzoic acid to 3,4,5-tetrafluorobenzoic acid in a reaction of zinc dust in aqueous ammonia.|$|E
