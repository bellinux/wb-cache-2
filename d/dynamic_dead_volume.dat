40|$|Abstract: Using heat to {{compress}} a gas can have many technological uses including power gen-eration and heat-activated cooling. A model is presented {{here for a}} reciprocating, displacer-based thermocompressor. The model is based upon expressions derived from mass and energy con-servation for each component of the system through {{each part of the}} cycle. It also incorporates features not found in previous works, such as specified regenerator effectiveness and component <b>dead</b> <b>volumes.</b> In order to form a thermodynamic cycle, work is generated from an ideal isother-mal expansion of the compressed gas. The model shows that Carnot efficiency is achieved from the ideal work-generating cycle for a regenerator with unity effectiveness. However, for non-ideal conditions, thermal efficiency is highly sensitive to the regenerator performance. For example, assuming zero <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> in the system, for a temperature ratio of 2 and a pressure ratio of 1. 4, a regenerator effectiveness of 0. 9 corresponds to a thermal efficiency of only 44 per cent of the Carnot efficiency. <b>Dead</b> <b>volume</b> also adversely impacts performance, with cold space <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> being the most critical...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Research in the {{miniaturization}} of thermomechanical {{systems in}} recent years has proven to be both rewarding and challenging. Micro-scale devices have tremendous technological potential but come with a new set of design problems. One such problem is energy storage. Heat actuated systems, driven primarily by thermal energy, take advantage of the high stored energy density of hydrocarbon fuels, and are therefore desirable for small-scale applications. One concept for a heat-actuated compressor is called a thermocompressor, which is a variation of a traditional Stirling engine. Thermocompressors use constant volume heat addition to pressurize their working fluid without applying any mechanical work to the gas. Such devices would be well suited for numerous applications such as power cycles, heat pumps, refrigeration, and liquid pumps. This thesis develops a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the thermocompressor cycle providing insight into the operation of the cycle and the sensitivity of the cycle's performance to various design parameters including regenerator effectiveness, regenerator <b>dead</b> <b>volume,</b> hot side <b>dead</b> <b>volume,</b> and cold side <b>dead</b> <b>volume.</b> The developed model shows that the thermal efficiency is highly sensitive to regenerator effectiveness, which motivates a regenerator optimization study. As the regenerator surface area increases, its effectiveness increases, however, so does its <b>dead</b> <b>volume.</b> The regenerator model shows that there is an optimum balance between regenerator effectiveness and regenerator <b>dead</b> <b>volume,</b> which gives a predicted maximum thermal efficiency.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} modelling of the fluid flow and heat transfer behaviour {{of the steel}} melt in the tundish is carried out for a single strand tundish. The flow dynamics and heat transfer in the tundish is analysed by presenting the velocity field, Residence time distribution (RTD) curves and the temperature profiles by changing the geometrical parameters such as the width, the bath height, their simultaneous change and the nozzle distance of the tundish. The RTD curve is used to find the different volumes such as plug <b>volume,</b> <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> and mixed volume inside the tundish. The ratio of mixed to <b>dead</b> <b>volume,</b> which indicate the mixing capability of a tundish, is estimated. Heat transfer analysis is carried out under steady state conditions for the constant heat fluxes from walls and from free surface of the tundish, for the above mentioned parametric changes so as to find out tundish steel melt cooling rates to determine the lowest temperature zones (maximum cooling), which are the indications of the <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> regions during the steel flow. It is observed {{that the increase in}} the <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> fraction proves detrimental for mixing. The value of the <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> is found to be more sensitive than the other two volumes to find mixing capability and hence important to reduce this stagnant portion as far as possible.
