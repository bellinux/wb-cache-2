In order to route such traffic with Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees without requiring detection of traffic changes in real-time or reconfiguring the network in response to it, we consider a routing and bandwidth allocation scheme that allows preconfiguration of the network such that all traffic patterns permissible within the network’s natural ingress-egress capacity constraints can be handled in a capacity efficient manner.

Two-phase randomized routing is a method for preventing network contention and it works by routing packets to a randomly chosen <b>intermediate</b> <b>node,</b> before routing it to the destination. The effect is to reduce all traffic to an average worst case with predictable latency and bandwidth. Two-phase randomized routing is implemented by the STC104 by setting up links where traffic enters the network to prepend a header with a random destination. The destination is another STC104 device, which recognises the header and discards it before routing it to its actual destination.|$|E
