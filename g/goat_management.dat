50|$|Management of feral goats has varied {{depending}} on the balance between their pest and resource status, and their legal definition in different states. Feral goats are mostly viewed as pests by most land managers. This has led to campaigns to manage or eradicate them. Some laws prescribe how feral goats are to be managed, while others merely define them as pests and leave management to the discretion of land owners or public agencies. State and territory governments provide legislative, technical and possibly financial support for feral goat control, and are also responsible for feral <b>goat</b> <b>management</b> on land held by their agencies.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no current}} {{management}} {{policy for the}} control of feral goats in New South Wales. A group of pastoral and state agencies presented a proposal at the National workshop on Feral <b>Goat</b> <b>Management.</b> The proposal seeks to manage feral goats {{as part of a}} total grazing management program which aims to reduce the impact of goats on pastoral production and conservation values to insignificant levels. Goats are presently opportunistically mustered for slaughter. In New South Wales in 1996, feral goats occupied an estimated total area of 11,400 square kilometres in 101 conservation reserves. Sixty-seven of these were in the eastern, higher-rainfall areas of the State, where the impacts of feral goats have been little studies.|$|E
50|$|Goats {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in Western Australia, {{where they are}} regarded as a pest on rangelands. The Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976 sets out landowners’ responsibilities {{to deal with them}} and to limit their spread. The principal driving force behind attempts to manage goats in the state is peer pressure among land managers. This results in community cooperation and coordination to manage goats, and legislation is only used as a means of last resort when all attempts to gain cooperation have failed. Western Australia has a feral <b>goat</b> <b>management</b> program covering most feral herds, and involves mustering goats for commercial sale to achieve the initial knockdown, followed by aerial and ground shooting to attempt to kill the remaining animals. The success of aerial shooting to control feral goats in arid and semi-arid environments has led to its widespread use in rugged and more densely vegetated terrain elsewhere in Australia.|$|E

Foram modeladas curvas de lactação das fêmeas com e sem secagem. Estudando-se a influência da omissão do período de secagem entre lactações, nomeadamente, a incidência de patologia puerperal (metrite, aborto e toxemia de gestação). Concluiu-se que os animais em lactação continua têm maiores produções de leite que as cabras que secam, ao comparar curvas de lactação médias até aos 390 dias. Estaticamente a incidência de patologia puerperal não foi influenciada pela secagem ou não dos animais. Contudo cabras em secagem têm menos necessidades alimentares, sendo esta uma das principais causas de toxemia de gestação em cabras exploradas em sistema intensivo.

One hundred and eighteen Alpine goats and Saanen were used for: 1) main characteristics of parturitions/abortions; 2) body condition every two weeks (by palpation and observation) before and after parturition; 3) the weight at all kids after birth and weekly till weaning. Lactation curves were modeled for goats in and of the dry-off period. We was studied the influence of dry-off period omission between lactations, in particular the incidence of puerperal pathology (metritis, abortion and pregnancy toxemia). In conclusion, goats in continuous lactation have bigger milk yield than the goats with dry-off period between lactation, in comparison to the medium lactation curves till three hundred and ninety days after parturition. The omission of the dry-off period did not influenced puerperal pathology incidence. Despite that, goats in late pregnancy with dry-off period have less the nutrition needs, being these needs the main cause of pregnancy toxemia in intensive system goats production.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{analysing}} gender issues in livestock and root crop production. Qualitative {{data for the}} study was collected through gender disaggregated group discussions (GDs) in two districts, Mvomero and Kongwa in Tanzania. Data were collected from 4 communities representing the four villages—Wami Luhindo and Kunke in Mvomero, and Masinyeti and Ihanda in Kongwa respectively. A total of 12 GDs were conducted involving 224 {{men and women who}} participated in the GDs. The qualitative data were analysed descriptively and by using measures such as percentages, tables, pie, bar charts and Venn diagrams. The study found that men owned all the goats and made all goat related decisions unilaterally. Women were by far less likely than men to own not only goats, but also livestock in general. On management of goats, an important set of differences in activities is associated with gender as well as with age. Changing livelihood opportunities such as rural–urban migration were identified as a factor that influenced gender and <b>goat</b> <b>management</b> and this increases workload for women. On decision-making over goats, women have limited control over decisions on sale and use of incomes generated from sale of goats. Ownership of crops between men and women is quite distinct, and depends on the market prices of crops and yield of the crop they grow for cash. Men own cash crops or crops for cash whereas women own subsistence or food crops for home consumption. Wealth status had a direct relation with individual decision-making on crops, rich men and women decided on what crops to cultivate, whereas non-rich farmers worked on wealthy farmers’ farms as casual labourers. Perceptions of women and men on the potential benefits of integrating root crops and goat varied. Men perceived value addition resulting from owning dairy goats and the attendant increase in income for them whereas women perceived change in status quo and increase workload resulting from stall <b>goat</b> <b>management</b> activities. Some participants explained that the anticipated increase in men’s real income could come about either through men accessing women’s income, or more commonly, women using their earnings to substitute men’s expenditure on household needs and children’s education. The study concluded that there are gender differences on perceived potential of integrating root crops and dairy goat production, as prevailing tradition may limit women’s participation. The beneficiaries expressed the timeliness of CGP project and exhibited willingness to partake in the project and ensure equitable benefits for participants if participatory gender training and awareness is ensured at both the household and community level.

Small-scale goat {{farmers from}} {{south-western}} KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, identified gastrointestinal helminths, dry-season feed scarcity and poor reproductive performance as major production constraints and highlighted {{the paucity of}} information on <b>goat</b> health and <b>management.</b> The research and extension processes adopted to address these problems comprised on-station experimentation, followed by on-farm validation combined with the participatory dissemination of both study findings and relevant information on goat health care. The approach included {{the use of the}} FAMACHA© system to assess anaemia, a characteristic symptom of infection with the gastrointestinal nematode, Haemonchus contortus (Rudolphi, 1803). On-station experimentation indicated that urea-molasses block supplementation during the dry, winter season was a cost-effective option. Unfortunately, when tested on-farm, the value of such supplementation proved inconclusive, possibly due to low block consumption and further research into alternative and palatable protein supplements for goats is suggested. However, tactical anthelmintic treatment with ivermectin effectively reduced faecal egg counts and is recommended, as is concurrent symptomatic anthelmintic treatment, as determined by the FAMACHA© system, since this practice appeared to improve reproductive capacity. Investigations to better adapt the FAMACHA© system to goats is, however, recommended. A flexible training framework was developed with the collaboration of the farmers, providing them with advice on <b>goat</b> health and <b>management.</b> This ‘hands-on’ approach encompassed regular meetings geared to the farmers’ current expertise and exploited the on-farm experimentation as a training vehicle. The process nurtured local farmer ‘champions’, strengthened the extension skills of researchers and technicians and incorporated the development of a Goatkeepers’ animal health care manual. Indications are that the use of such an approach has considerable potential for the development of goat farming. Moreover this process, which is relatively novel for South Africa, is equally applicable to other similar agro-ecological zones. Access to veterinary and agricultural inputs in areas where communal grazing is practised could be vastly improved and a case is made for universities, researchers, extensionists and farmers to collaborate to encourage the long-term sustainable development of these communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Kafta humera district of Ethiopia, (i) to investigate the milk yield of Begait <b>goat</b> under different <b>management</b> and (ii) to evaluate the effects of different non-genetic factors on lactation performance. Data were collected from 428 lactating does under two managements (semi intensive and extensive) during October 2014 and March 2016. Statistical analyses were carried out using the GLM procedure of SAS version of 9. 2 software. The least squares means (with standard error) for daily milk yield, lactation milk yield and lactation length were observed to be 0. 75 ± 0. 01 kg, 85. 6 ± 1. 04 kg and 111 ± 1. 21 days under semi intensive management, respectively whereas under extensive management these were found as 0. 55 ± 0. 01 kg, 56 ± 1. 43 kg and 101 ± 1. 57 days, respectively. The results of this study indicated that management system, parity number and season of birth affected all variables highly significantly. Global Affairs CanadaPeer Revie...|$|R
