5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of hallucinogens is seen as the closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why they are able to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Unlike ASL, BASL {{allows for}} the <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of {{syntactic}} repetition. In {{a study conducted by}} McCaskill, of 26 signers (13 Black and 13 White), Black signers had 57 instances of repetition compared to 19 from White signers, and of those 19 instances, 18 were made by a single signer. The use of repetition by BASL signers is considered to be pragmatic rather than as a way to clarify meaning.|$|E
5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the papyrus. Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of plant motifs and patterns, including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the decorative arts in the Western world in such forms as the Rococo and later the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E

5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that {{is common in}} Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are {{peculiar}} to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Both Sinclair and Nexstar became infamous {{for their}} <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of sidecars {{as part of}} their {{expansion}} and consolidation tactics, partnering with companies like Cunningham Broadcasting, Deerfield Media, Mission Broadcasting, and even each other {{in the case of a}} virtual duopoly in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania between Sinclair-owned CBS affiliate WHP-TV and Nexstar-owned CW affiliate WLYH-TV, and a former virtual duopoly in Rochester, New York between Nexstar-owned CBS affiliate WROC-TV and Sinclair-owned Fox affiliate WUHF (in the wake of Sinclair and Deerfield's purchase of ABC affiliate WHAM-TV, this particular arrangement ended in January 2014).|$|E
5|$|Carpentier {{reduces the}} {{individuality}} of the characters, enhancing {{the notion of}} humanity, keeping {{in line with the}} theme of history as a repetition of patterns regardless of who is in power. The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and the cycle of reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E

5|$|Chabon's work is {{characterized}} by complex language, the <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of metaphor along with recurring themes, including nostalgia, divorce, abandonment, fatherhood, and most notably issues of Jewish identity. He often includes gay, bisexual, and Jewish characters in his work. Since the late 1990s, Chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets; he is a notable defender of the merits of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction, and, along with novels, he has published screenplays, children's books, comics, and newspaper serials.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's {{music is}} characterised by <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of polyrhythms, complex {{juxtaposition}} of tonal and atonal elements, and copious ornamentation. Many {{of his works}} contain sections employing strongly contrasting approaches to musical architecture; some of them use baroque forms, while others are athematic. His musical output consists of over 100 compositions, ranging from aphoristic pieces to works spanning several hours. Most are for piano solo or feature an important piano part, but he also composed for orchestra, chamber ensembles, organ and other instruments. Partly because of this, Sorabji {{has been described as}} a descendant of a tradition of composer-pianists such as Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt and Charles-Valentin Alkan.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. We {{examined}} whether <b>frequent</b> drug <b>use</b> {{increases the}} likelihood of subsequent sexual or physical intimate partner violence (IPV) and whether IPV {{increases the likelihood}} of subsequent <b>frequent</b> drug <b>use.</b> Methods. A random sample of 416 women on methadone was assessed at baseline (wave 1) and at 6 months (wave 2), and 12 months (wave 3) following the initial assessment. Propensity score matching and multiple logistic regression were employed. Results. Women who reported <b>frequent</b> crack <b>use</b> at wave 2 were more likely than non–drug using women to report IPV at wave 3 (odds ratio [OR]= 4. 4; 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 2. 1, 9. 1; P<. 01), and frequent marijuana users at wave 2 were more likely than non–drug users to report IPV at wave 3 (OR= 4. 5; 95 % CI= 2. 4, 8. 4; P<. 01). In addition, women who reported IPV at wave 2 were more likely than women who did not report IPV to indicate <b>frequent</b> heroin <b>use</b> at wave 3 (OR= 2. 7; 95 % CI= 1. 1, 6. 5; P=. 04).

5|$|The {{emotional}} {{effect of}} these passages is often further enhanced by textural and/or cyclical devices, such as a sudden shift of musical texture, concomitant with the shift in tonality; the use of mechanically repetitive accompanimental patterns, such as ostinati and repeated chords, in the tonally remote or oscillating passages; and the allusion to previously stated material, which appeared earlier in the piece, in tonally detached passages. Schubert's <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of similar harmonic, textural and cyclical devices in his settings of poems depicting such emotional states, only strengthens the suggestion of these psychological connotations.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{animation}} {{was created}} by then-unknown animator John Muto. Because of the film's low budget, Muto created all of the film's animation sequences himself. Muto made <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of airbrush techniques to establish for himself a distinctive style. For sequences in which live-action and animation were combined, the actors were photographed in tight head-on and profile shots, and the photos were cut out and pasted into the animation in a style recalling Terry Gilliam's work on Monty Python's Flying Circus. Muto also credits The Fleischer Brothers as another inspiration.|$|E
5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of controversies with other political or social {{forces and the}} polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E

5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's <b>frequent</b> <b>use</b> of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
