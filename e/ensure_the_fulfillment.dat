Sick {{children}} are carried on the backs of buffaloes, sometimes sixty or seventy miles, to be deposited in front of such a shrine, after which they are carried back--if they survive the journey--in the same way. It is painful even to think of what the wretched child suffers in being thus jolted over the cattle tracks. But the tribesmen consider the treatment much more efficacious than any infidel prescription. To go to a ziarat and put a stick in the ground is sufficient to <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> of a wish. To sit swinging a stone or coloured glass ball, suspended by a string from a tree, and tied there by some fakir, is a sure method of securing a fine male heir. To make a cow give good milk, a little should be plastered on some favorite stone near the tomb of a holy man. These are but a few instances; but they may suffice to reveal a state of mental development at which civilisation hardly knows whether to laugh or weep.|$|E

40|$|Fast {{adaptive}} transmission has been recently {{recognized as an}} essential method to exploit the system diversity and enhance power/spectral efficiency in time-varying channels. In this paper, we propose {{adaptive transmission}} algorithms for multiuser MIMO/OFDM systems. The algorithms adaptively control multiple-access, modulation, and transmit power to exploit the channel variation in space, frequency, and user domains. The ultimate objective is to optimize the overall power efficiency while <b>ensuring</b> <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> of every user's QoS requirements. A major challenge in the problem lies in the optimization complexity due {{to the presence of}} non-linear, non-convex constraints. The proposed algorithms successfully reduce the optimization complexity and solve the noise enhancement problem that exists in multiuser systems with non-orthogonal signatures. Numerical results show that significant improvement in power/spectral efficiency is achievable with reasonable computational complexity when the above schemes are applied...|$|R

40|$|Criteria {{containing}} a barrier function i. e., an unbounded function at {{the boundary of}} the feasible solution domain are frequently encountered in the optimization framework. When an iterative descent method is used, a search along the line supported by the descent direction through the minimization of the underlying scalar function has to be performed at each iteration. Usual line search strategies use an iterative procedure to propose a stepsize value <b>ensuring</b> <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> of sufficient convergence conditions. The iterative scheme is classically based on backtracking, dichotomy, polynomial interpolations or quadratic majorization of the scalar function.
