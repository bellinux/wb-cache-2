5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{also stated}} that the flag was once held in an iron chest, within Dunvegan Castle. The key to the chest was then always {{in the possession of}} the hereditary flag bearers. The c.1800 manuscript related how, on the death of the MacLeod chief Tormod, son of lain Breac, the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of Talisker. The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir, knowing herself to be pregnant (although she had only been married six weeks previous to her widowhood). In time, she gave birth to Tormod, the next chief. The c.1800 manuscript stated that at around this time, a man who wished to curry favour with the <b>expectant</b> <b>heir</b> (MacLeod of Talisker) attempted to steal the flag. Even though the Fairy Flag was later found, both the staff and iron chest were never seen again. Historically, the old chief, Tormod (son of Iain Breac), died in the autumn of 1706, and his son, Tormod, was born in July 1705.|$|E
60|$|Major Melville had {{detained}} Mr. Morton {{during his}} examination of Waverley, both {{because he thought}} he might derive assistance from his practical good sense and approved loyalty, and also because it was agreeable to have a witness of unimpeached candour and veracity to proceedings which touched the honour and safety of a young Englishman of high rank and family, and the <b>expectant</b> <b>heir</b> of a large fortune. Every step he knew would be rigorously canvassed, and it was his business to place the justice and integrity of his own conduct beyond the limits of question.|$|E
5000|$|Kay J cited Evans v Llewellin and Haygarth v Wearing saying equity most {{commonly}} interferes {{in favour of}} an <b>expectant</b> <b>heir,</b> in his youth, or ‘a poor man with imperfect education’. Where such circumstances are shown the onus is on the purchaser to show it was ‘fair, just and reasonable’ (Lord Selborne LC, Aylesford). The undervalue was ‘so gross as to amount of itself to evidence of fraud.’ ...|$|E
50|$|Glanvill {{gives no}} {{indication}} that a tenant needed the lord's consent to alienate his rights to land. He does speak at length {{of the rights of}} <b>expectant</b> <b>heirs,</b> and this should cause some restraints on alienation. He also says the rights of the lord must be considered. It can be inferred from Glanvill that no substitution could occur without the consent of the lord.|$|R
60|$|Twelve {{years have}} passed since Bottles sent in his papers, and in twelve years many things happen. Amongst them {{recently}} it had happened that our hero's only and elder brother had, owing to an unexpected development of consumption among the <b>expectant</b> <b>heirs,</b> tumbled into a baronetcy and eight thousand a year, and Bottles himself into a modest but to him most ample fortune of as many hundred. When the news reached him he was the captain of a volunteer corps engaged in one of the numerous Basuto wars in the Cape Colony. He served the campaign out, and then, in obedience to his brother's entreaties and a natural craving to see his native land, after an absence of nearly fourteen years, resigned his commission and returned to England.|$|R
40|$|Ante-mortem probate {{stands as}} a {{significant}} recent development in the American law of wealth succession. It confronts a problem that seriously impairs our probate system, the depredatious will contest, and promises to help revitalize the probate process. Already enacted in several states and currently under active study by the Joint Editorial Board of the Uniform Probate Code and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, ante-mortem probate {{is likely to be}} widely implemented in some form. But while legislators and academics alike support ante-mortem probate as a general idea, disagreement has emerged over the specific form it should take. A recent exchange in the Michigan Law Review offered two alternative schemes for ante-mortem probate, both of which contemplate a procedural design materially {{different from that of the}} few existing ante-mortem probate statutes. That new design was termed the conservatorship model, contrasting with the more traditional contest model. The exchange reflected a disagreement over what the authors assumed to be an unavoidable trade-off between two objectives: protection against post-mortem strike suits, and confidentiality of a will 2 ̆ 7 s contents during the testator 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. The exchange did not, however, explore the possibility of an ante-mortem probate scheme that would achieve both objectives. What made these objectives appear incompatible was the assumption that any version of ante-mortem probate that would preclude post-mortem attacks on the will must necessarily provide due process protective features, requiring notice to all <b>expectant</b> <b>heirs</b> and legatees under earlier wills and the opportunity for them to appear in the proceeding. In this Article, we shall challenge that assumption and propose a workable scheme of ante-mortem probate that both protects the testamentary plan against strike suits and preserves the confidentiality of the plan during the testator 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. Section I reviews the conservatorship model as developed by Professor Langbein and identifies its objectionable features. In Section II, we address the general constitutional question of what property interests command due process protection. This context poses the constitutional problem narrowly, but our analysis has broad implications regarding constitutional notice requirements for any probate reform. Concluding in that Section that due process does not compel notice and a right to appear for <b>expectant</b> <b>heirs</b> and legatees, we prepare in Section III an administrative design for a no-notice version of ante-mortem probate. Our discussion anticipates prudential objections to the model, offering a possible exception to the no-notice provisions to favor the nuclear family, an exception we ultimately reject...|$|R
50|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Liu Hongxi was in 932, when Liu Yan created his sons imperial princes—with Liu Hongxi receiving {{the title of}} Prince of Jin.

6000|$|The <b>heir</b> <b>expectant</b> {{was then}} {{convinced}} {{that it would have}} been better for him to have followed the advice which Isabel had given him, but yet he could not bring himself to believe that the advice had been disinterested.

6000|$|The {{instrument}} was, in all respects, duly executed, {{and there}} {{could not be a}} doubt of its entire validity. Mary felt a little bewildered, as well as greatly embarrassed. So perfectly disinterested had been all her care of her uncle, and so humble her wishes, that she did not for some time regard herself as the owner of a property that she had all her life been accustomed to consider as a part of her late uncle. The <b>heirs</b> <b>expectant,</b> [...] "a'ter reading the insterment," [...] as Baiting Joe told his cronies, when he related the circumstances over a mug of cider that evening, [...] "fore and aft, and overhauling it from truck to keelson, give the matter up, as a bad job. They couldn't make nawthin' out of oppersition," [...] continued Joe, [...] "and so they tuck the horse, and the looking-glass, and the pin-cushion, and cleared out with their cargo. You couldn't get one of that breed to leave as much as a pin behind, to which he thought the law would give him a right. Squire Job went off very unwillingly; for so strong was his belief in his claim, that he had made up his mind, as he told me himself, to break up the north meadow, and put it in corn this coming season." ...|$|R
60|$|That eldest brother, Lord Saint George, was {{in truth}} {{regarded}} at Turnover as being, of all {{persons in the}} world, the most august. The Marquis himself was afraid of his son, and held him in extreme veneration. To {{the mind of the}} Marquis the <b>heir</b> <b>expectant</b> of all the dignities of the House of Stowte was almost a greater man than the owner of them; and this feeling came not only from a consciousness {{on the part of the}} father that his son was a bigger man than himself, cleverer, better versed in the affairs of the world, and more thought of by those around them, but also to a certain extent from an idea that he who would have all these grand things thirty or perhaps even fifty years hence, must be more powerful than one with whom their possession would come to an end probably after the lapse of eight or ten years. His heir was to him almost divine. When things at the castle were in any way uncomfortable, he could put up with the discomfort for himself and his daughters; but it was not to be endured that Saint George should be incommoded. Old carriage-horses must be changed if he were coming; the glazing of the new greenhouse must be got out of the way, lest he should smell the paint; the game must not be touched till he should come to shoot it. And yet Lord Saint George himself was a man who never gave himself any airs; and who in his personal intercourse with the world around him demanded much less acknowledgment of his magnificence than did his father.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Liu Hongdu was in 932, when Liu Yan created his sons imperial princes—with Liu Hongdu receiving {{the title of}} Prince of Bin, which was shortly later changed to Prince of Qin.

[...] By 934, Liu Hongdu was {{the commander of the}} imperial guard corps, when Liu Yan had him recruiting 1,000 guard soldiers to be loyal to him. Liu Hongdu ended up recruiting many young hoodlums and became close to them. The chancellor Yang Dongqian found this inappropriate and tried to persuade Liu Yan to stop this, but Liu Yan paid no heed to Yang's words, leading to Yang's requesting retirement. (As Yang, in his words to Liu Yan, referred to Liu Hongdu as the heir to the state, it was likely that by this point Liu Yaoshu and Liu Guitu were deceased.) ...|$|E
