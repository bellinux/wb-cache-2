50|$|One {{drawback}} of a fixed {{radiographic grid}} {{is that it}} creates <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> on the image. Hollis Potter (1880-1964) showed in 1920 that the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> could be eliminated by moving the grid {{at right angles to}} the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> during the exposure. If the range and speed of motion is sufficient, the <b>grid</b> <b>lines</b> will be blurred out. The motion may be oscillating, vibrating, or reciprocating and must be continuous and smooth. The motion must also begin before exposure and continue until after exposure.|$|R
