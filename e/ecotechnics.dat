Since 1975 its multicultural crew of explorers, researchers and artists have sailed the vessel over 270,000 miles, in every sea except the Arctic.

50|$|In 1943 {{the station}} manager, Gordon Harold Smith, was killed at Meda while {{mustering}} cattle. His horse fell and Smith received fatal injuries as a result. Heavy rainfall was again recorded in 1945 with another 9 in downpour, which arrived shortly after a dry spell. In the 1970s approximately 2000 ha {{from the station}} were excised by the Lands Department of Western Australia. The land was to be regenerated following land degradation from overstocking. In 1978 the Institute of <b>Ecotechnics</b> acquired the lease known as Birdwood Downs, commencing land care work and offering tourist accommodation shortly afterward.|$|E

After a stint in New York City working as a taxi driver, he arrived at the Synergia Ranch in New Mexico. The ranch, named for Buckminster Fuller's concept of synergy, was founded by John Allen and owned by Allen's wife Marie Harding. Its residents made furniture and pottery, studied ecology, gave theatrical performances under a geodesic dome they had constructed, and occasionally toured under the name [...] "The Theater of All Possibilities". It was at the ranch that the Institute of <b>Ecotechnics</b> was founded in 1973 with Nelson as its director.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} {{phenomenon}} of irregular migrant labour in the United Kingdom (UK). My particular methodology examines political and juridical attention to so-called irregular labour migration including proposed remedies. I employ a three-fold methodology that is political, juridical and, {{with the help of}} Susan Marks’ notion of false contingency, incorporates philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy’s fundamental ‘ontological’ questioning via attention to <b>ecotechnics.</b> Through this methodology I contend that {{the phenomenon of}} 'irregular' migrant labour is symptomatic of the limits of legal categories. My work does not end there, however. Not only are the existing legal categories in immigration and labour law limited in their ability to address what is identified as irregular migrant labour, but the limit of the legal framework obscures the processes of neoliberalisation that maintain an economic market system dependent on persons in ‘irregular’ situations. A critique that stops at identifying the limit of law and legal categories is insufficient to address {{what is happening in the}} circulation of capital, production and reproduction. For this reason, I explore Jean-Luc Nancy’s work, in particular his term <b>ecotechnics,</b> in an attempt to bring attention, within discussion of legal categorical limits, to what is circulating and happening in labour migration considered to be 'irregular'...|$|E
40|$|The {{writers in}} the volume ask, implicitly, how the 21 st century horizons that exceed any political, economic, or {{conceptual}} models alters or redefines a series of key topoi. These range through figures of sexual difference, bioethics, care, species invasion, war, post-carbon thought, <b>ecotechnics,</b> time, and so on. As such, the volume is also a dossier on what metamorphoses await the legacies of -humanistic- thought in adapting to, or rethinking, the other materialities that impinge of contemporary -life as we know it. - With essays by Robert Markley, J.
