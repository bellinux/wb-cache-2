25|$|The Nigerien rebels {{pursued a}} {{strategy}} of expanding the ethnic makeup of their forces, and attempted—with little success in the south—to broaden the insurgency into a social movement to replace the current government and provide the population with a share in Niger's growing mining sector. By the beginning of 2009, rebel attempts to <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> Nigerien uranium production had, according to mining officials, little effect. The effects on {{the population of the}} north has been pronounced, with the regional capitol of Agadez hosting thousands of refugees, economic activity outside the towns grinding to a halt, and the destruction of a burgeoning foreign tourist industry in the north of the country.|$|E
25|$|The Bermudians on the Turks {{continued}} to be governed under their own regulations, with the assent of the royal agent, until 1780, when a more formal version of those regulations was submitted for the assent of the Crown, which was given. Those regulations, issued as a royal order, stated that all British subjects had the right ("free liberty") to rake and gather salt on the Turks, providing that they conformed to the regulations, which expressly rejected Bahamian jurisdiction over the Turks. Despite this refutation by a higher authority {{of their right to}} <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> Bermudian activities on the Turks, the Bahamian government {{continued to}} harass the Bermudians (unsurprisingly, given the lucrativeness of the Turks salt trade).|$|E
25|$|Plans for the {{restoration}} were threatened in 2103 when the route of High Speed 2, a high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham, Manchester and York, were published. This envisaged an East Midlands Hub station at Toton, which would have destroyed part of the canal route, but revised plans were published on 15 November 2016, with the station moved to avoid the canal. The chairman of the Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust, Chris Madge, was still concerned that a tramway to link the station to Derby would <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> the canal, but was hopeful that the canal in this area could be reopened before tramway construction began, and that {{the plans for the}} tramway would therefore have to accommodate the canal.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} ethidium bromide's intense {{fluorescence}} after binding with DNA {{is probably not}} due to rigid stabilization of the phenyl , because the phenyl ring {{has been shown to}} project outside the intercalated bases. In fact, the phenyl group is found to be almost perpendicular to the plane of the ring system, as it rotates about its single bond to find a position where it will <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> the ring system minimally. Instead, the hydrophobic environment found between the base pairs is believed to be responsible. By moving into this hydrophobic environment and away from the solvent, the ethidium cation is forced to shed any water molecules that were associated with it. As water is a highly efficient fluorescent quencher, the removal of these water molecules allows the ethidium to fluoresce.|$|E
25|$|Many ADPKD {{patients}} suffer symptomatic sequelae {{in consequence}} of the disease, such as cyst hemorrhage, flank pain, recurrent infections, nephrolithiasis, and symptoms of mass effect (i.e., early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal discomfort), from their enlarged kidneys. In such cases, nephrectomy can be required due to intractable symptoms or when, {{in the course of}} preparing for renal transplantation, the native kidneys are found to <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> the true pelvis and preclude the placement of a donor allograft. Additionally, native nephrectomy may be undertaken in the presence of suspected malignancy, as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is 2 to 3 times more likely in the ADPKD population in end stage renal disease (ESRD) than in the ESRD patients without ADPKD. Although the indications for nephrectomy in ADPKD may be related to kidney size, the decision to proceed with native nephrectomy is often undertaken on an individual basis, without specific reference to kidney size measurements.|$|E

Implantation of the device is relatively easy. The prevalence of residual defect is low.

2500|$|Diagnostic modalities, {{dependent}} on circumstances, include X-ray, MRI, MR arthrography, double-contrast arthrography, and ultrasound.

[...] Usually, a tear will be undetected by X-ray, although bone spurs, which can <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> the rotator cuff tendons, may be visible. [...] Such spurs suggest chronic severe rotator cuff disease. [...] Double-contrast arthrography involves injecting contrast dye into the shoulder joint to detect leakage out of the injured rotator cuff [...] and its value {{is influenced by the}} experience of the operator. The most common diagnostic tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can sometimes indicate the size of the tear, as well as its location within the tendon. [...] Furthermore, MRI enables the detection or exclusion of complete rotator cuff tears with reasonable accuracy and is also suitable to diagnose other pathologies of the shoulder joint.|$|E

FuturaGene, a biotechnology company owned by Suzano, a [...] Brazilian pulp and paper company, has been leading this research. [...] Stanley Hirsch, chief executive of FuturaGene has stated: [...] "Our trees grow faster and thicker. We are ahead of everyone. We have shown we can increase the yields and growth rates of trees more than anything grown by traditional breeding." [...] The company is looking to reduce harvest cycles from 7 to 5.5 years with 20-30% more mass than conventional eucalyptus. There is concern that such objectives may further exacerbate the negative impacts of plantation forestry. Increased water and soil nutrient demand from faster growing species may lead to irrecoverable losses in site productivity and further <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> neighbouring communities and ecosystems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} over Sierra's suspension {{and the subsequent}} trial drew local, national and international media attention. Initial reaction to Sierra's actions from the local media was unsympathetic. This was later attributed by Sierra's lawyers and Dan Radmacher – editor of the Charleston Gazette – to Principal Mann's repetition in his comments to the Gazette of Jacob Reed's statements concerning Sierra's message. [...] Sierra claims that callers to local radio stations [...] "wanted to shoot me in the head. They wanted to send me to another country." [...] The Charleston Daily Mail praised Mann's decision, calling Sierra's [...] "thoroughly egocentric exercise" [...] of her constitutional rights [...] "tiresome". The Daily Mail expanded on its position in a July 15, 2002 editorial; while noting Justice Lewis Powell's declaration that full constitutional rights did not apply equally in school as in criminal justice, the paper commented that [...] "students do have rights {{as long as they}} are not disrupting the education of others", and that while [...] Sierra's request to form an anarchist club [...] "may have seemed bizarre and even oxymoronic", Principal Mann ought to have permitted it [...] "since it would not harm or <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> the rights of others". It went on to praise the jury's decision that Sierra had no constitutional right to wear her T-shirts to class or to disobey the authority of Mann but that she did have the right to express her opinions after class, calling it [...] "the essence of Americanism … a great system that makes anarchy look silly".|$|E
