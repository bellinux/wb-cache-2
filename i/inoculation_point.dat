40|$|Many Phytophthora spp. have {{recently}} been isolated from native vegetation in Western Australia. As their pathogenicity is often unknown, {{it is not possible}} to provide advice to land managers on the impact of site infestation on native plants and how these infestations should be managed. We describe a rapid screening method based on sapwood invasion that has been used to compare the pathogenicity of Phytophthora arenaria, P. cinnamomi and P. multivora. Radial invasion into the xylem of six banksias and three eucalypts was assessed in an excised branch assay in summer and winter. Branches were wound inoculated and invasion was assessed by plating from a strip of tissue cut across the stem at the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point</b> and at 40 mm above and below. A symptomless infection had established in both the bark and sapwood within 6 days. P. arenaria was only isolated from the strip of tissue at the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point.</b> P. cinnamomi was isolated from the sapwood of Banksia attenuata, B. burdettii, B. menziesii and B. speciosa 40 mm above or below the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point</b> in some experiments. P. multivora was isolated from B. speciosa 40 mm below the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point</b> in one experiment. Hyphae of both species were seen in both ray parenchyma cells and xylem vessels. The invasiveness of the Phytophthora spp. was compared on the two groups of hosts using scores for sapwood invasion at the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point.</b> For banksias, P. cinnamomi and P. multivora had significantly higher invasion scores on banksias than P. arenaria but were not significantly different to one another. There was no significant difference between the three Phytophthora spp. on the eucalypt hosts. Assessing sapwood invasion provides a rapid, inexpensive and biologically meaningful way of screening the many Phytophthora spp. that have been isolated from native vegetation...|$|E

In this second round of testing, two points on each plate were inoculated from the C. aeruginascens isolate that produced xylindein, while the other remaining two points were taken from copies which had stopped producing the pigment. The plates were maintained in the dark at room temperature (21 C). After five days of initial growth, the widest diameter of each colony was measured using a caliper. This size was measured as the base size of the colony. Each colony was then re-measured every three to four days, and the new width of the colony was recorded. Recording was completed when <b>inoculation</b> <b>points</b> on the same media plate touched (22 days). Six replicate plates were made per wood species, per mesh size, per wood amount for all preliminary tests.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In Korea, mass {{mortality}} of Quercus mongolica trees has become obvious since 2004. Raffaelea quercus-mongolicae {{is believed to}} be a causal fungus contributing the mortality. To evaluate the pathogenicity of the fungus to the trees, the fungus was multiple- and single-inoculated to the seedlings and twigs of the mature trees, respectively. In both the inoculations, the fungus was reisolated from more than 50 % of inoculated twigs and seedlings. In the single inoculations, proportions of the transverse area of non-conductive sapwood at <b>inoculation</b> <b>points</b> and vertical lengths of discoloration expanded from the points were significantly different between the inoculation treatment and the control. In the multiple inoculations, no mortality was confirmed among the seedlings examined.

40|$|Trifolium repens (white clover) stolons were inoculated with Ditylenchus dipsaci (stem nematode), and the {{development}} of resulting infestations was monitored. Nematodes initially remained confined to superficial locations, concentrating in petiole axils near <b>inoculation</b> <b>points.</b> They were able to migrate slowly from the inidal <b>inoculation</b> <b>points</b> and infest adjacent axils, especially in regions near the stolon tip. As time progressed, in some axils, nematodes migrated through the stolon epidermis and colonized slowly expanding subepidermal pockets of host tissue (ca. 0. 2 -mm length of stolon/day). In these loci nematodes established exponentially increasing populations, but the rates of locus expansion remained constant, indicating that locus expansion was limited by unidentified host-dependent factors. As a result of increasing population pressure within subepidermal loci, J 4 entered a "diapause" state and the rate of egg production by adults declined, thereby reducing rate of population growth to more sustainable levels. Typically, these populations peaked at ca. 10, 000 individuals in ca. 160 days occupying 3 -cm lengths of stolon. Thereafter, heavily infested regions of stolons started to die, leading to the formation of longitudinal splits in their epidermis. In other axils, nematodes did not migrate into the stolons but remained confined to axils. Some of these populations increased a hundred-fold in 95 days, with population growth ending when petioles started to die. Host plant stolon morphology was affected only when subepidermal stolon populations developed high population levels (> 100 nematodes) within close proximity (< 2 cm) to active terminal meristems. This occurred either when axillary buds became active on previously infested nodes or when nematodes established endoparasitic populations at locations near the stolon tip during winter and spring, when the rate of stolon extension was limited by low light intensity. Affected stolon tips could "escape" from the influence of such infestations when light intensity and temperature increased. Nematode activity was limited by low temperature rather than light intensity. Global warming is likely to lead to greater damage to infested plants during the winter and early spring because the predicted milder winter temperatures will enhance nematode activity but not necessarily promote stolon growth...|$|R

An initial inoculation trial was conducted using seven species (Botryosphaeria mamane, B. dothidea, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Neofusicoccum andinum, N. parvum, N. ribis and Pseudofusicoccum stromaticum) on one commercially propagated clone representing a Eucalyptus urophylla E. grandis hybrid in Venezuela. Stems were inoculated and lesion development recorded after 7 weeks. Inoculations with B. mamane, B. dothidea, L. theobromae, N. andinum and P. stromaticum showed little effect, but N. parvum and N. ribis caused bark swelling around the <b>inoculation</b> <b>points</b> with kino exudation. A second inoculation trial was performed on four commercial clones to evaluate variation in their tolerance to infection by N. ribis and N. parvum, which were the most pathogenic in the first trial.

40|$|Fusarium graminearum causes {{head blight}} (FHB) and crown rot (CR) {{diseases}} in wheat. Compared with FHB, CR symptom development occurs slowly, usually taking 4 to 8 weeks to become visible. To characterize CR development, we used histological and real-time quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} analyses to assess fungal colonization during a timecourse of infection. Three distinct phases of infection were identified: i) initial spore germination with formation of a superficial hyphal mat at the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point,</b> ii) colonization of the adaxial epidermis of the outer leaf sheath and mycelial growth from the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point</b> to the crown, concomitant with a drop in fungal biomass, and iii) extensive colonization of the internal crown tissue. Fungal gene expression was examined during each phase using Affymetrix GeneChips. In total, 1, 839 F. graminearum genes were significantly upregulated, including some known FHB virulence genes (e. g., TRI 5 and TRI 14), and 2, 649 genes were significantly downregulated in planta compared with axenically cultured mycelia.

For both nematode species, a specific and strong activation of DR 5 ::gusA was observed inside the initial feeding cells at 18 h post <b>inoculation,</b> <b>pointing</b> to an increase in the perceived auxin concentration. This high expression was maintained until 3 - 5 days post inoculation and subsequently the GUS staining was reduced. Cyst and root-knot nematodes are distantly related and the feeding sites they induce are highly dissimilar. In this respect, the similarities between the two nematode-induced DR 5 activation patterns in A. thaliana roots are remarkable. A transient and local increase in auxin perception could be due to an accumulation or to an increased sensitivity. Based on previously published data, a local auxin accumulation seems to be the more probable explanation. The observed early and localized increase of the perceived IAA concentration in the initial feeding structure underlines that this phytohormone could be an important clue in feeding cell induction by plant parasitic nematodes...|$|R

Two rapid {{diagnostic}} techniques, real-time {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were compared {{on the basis of}} cost, reliability, and their ability to quantify X. fastidiosa in diseased tissues. A high correlation was found between the two techniques for measuring bacterial titer in vitro. A similar relationship was not detected when applying the methods to diseased tissue. There was a 75 % similarity between the techniques when used to diagnose PD in artificially infected grapevines. Where the two methods differed, real-time PCR was more successful in identifying plants known to be infected with the bacterium. In uninoculated grapevines, the two techniques were similar, where the positive rates were 7 % and 4 % for ELISA and real-time PCR respectively. In a second study, 3 grape cultivars, ?Cynthiana?, ?Cabernet Sauvignon?, and ?Chardonnay?, were inoculated with 2 isolates of X. fastidiosa to measure disease development and colonization by the pathogen. The bacteria colonized similar distances from the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point</b> over a 25 week period in all three cultivars.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The goal of {{this paper}} is to assess the interim results of a {{full-scale}} bioaugmentation biobarrier. The biobarrier is designed to treat a trichloroethene (TCE) plume along the downgradient property boundary of an industrial facility. The biobarrier is 381 meters long perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction. The aquifer was conditioned with 27, 215 kilograms (kg) of an emulsified vegetable oil (EVO) electron donor using direct-push techniques. Three groundwater extraction wells were used to supply make-up water to three different portions of the biobarrier. The make-up water was used to prepare a 20 % EVO solution, which was delivered to the subsurface. The central extraction well was located in an area where a viable bacterial population persisted from an earlier bioaugmentation pilot test. The EVO donor solution prepared from this water successfully “pre-seeded ” the central portion of the biobarrier. Two months following donor addition, 330 liters (L) of dechlorinating bacterial culture (KB- 1) was applied to the entire length of the biobarrier including the pre-seeded area.

One main QTL was identified with highly significant and large effects on all three traits after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides and on true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. capsici. Three other QTL with smaller effects were found for overall lesion diameter and true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides, two of which also {{had an effect on}} infection frequency. Interestingly, the resistant parent carried a susceptible allele for a QTL for all three traits that was closely linked to the main QTL. The results with C. capsici were based on less observations and therefore less informative. Although the main QTL was shown to have an effect on true lesion diameter after inoculation with C. capsici, no significant QTL were identified for overall lesion diameter or infection frequenc...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{examined}} drought-induced {{changes in}} sus-ceptibility of potted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees to a bark-beetle associated fungus (Leptographium wingfieldii Morelet, from the bark beetle Tomicus piniperda L.). Five-year-old field-grown trees were transplanted to 50 -l pots and grown for 1 {{year before the}} treatments were applied. Trees in the drought treatment were subjected to several successive, 3 -week-long drought cycles, with predawn water potential dropping below – 2 MPa at peak drought intensity. The experi-mental drought cycles were more severe than the natural drought episodes usually recorded in Scots pine stands. Trees were then mass-inoculated with L. wingfieldii at a density close to the critical threshold density of inoculations (400 m– 2) above which tree resistance is overcome. Inoculation of well-watered trees resulted in induced reaction zones around the <b>inoculation</b> <b>points</b> and very limited damage (resinosis) in the sapwood. Drought alone had no long-lasting consequences on tree water relations, except for a decrease in hydraulic con-ductance in the youngest segments of the main stem. However, the combination of mass-inoculation and drought stress after inoculation resulted in a dramatic loss of stem hydraulic con-ductivity that was paralleled by conspicuous damage to the sapwood (resinosis, drying and blue staining). There was a close correlation between amount of visible sapwood damage and loss of hydraulic conductivity. The intensity of induced re-actions in the phloem was unaffected by drought stress. We conclude that tree defence against L. wingfieldii is decreased during severe drought stress, resulting in changes in the spread and action of the fungus in the sapwood {{but not in the}} phloem...|$|R
40|$|Rotylenchulus reniformis is {{the most}} {{damaging}} nematode pathogen of cotton in Alabama. It is easily introduced into cotton fields via contaminated equipment and, when present, is difficult and costly to control. A trial to monitor the natural migration of R. reniformis from an initial point of origin was established in 2007 and studied over two growing seasons in both irrigated and non-irrigated no-till cotton production systems. Vermiform females, juveniles and males reached a horizontal distance of 200 cm from the initial <b>inoculation</b> <b>point,</b> and a depth of 91 cm in the first season in both systems. Irrigation {{had no effect on}} the migration of vermiform females and juveniles, but males migrated faster in the irrigated trial than in the non-irrigated trial. Population density increased steadily in the irrigated trial during both years, exceeding the economic threshold of 1, 000 per 150 cm 3, but was highly correlated with rainfall in the non-irrigated trial. The average speed of migration ranged from 0 - to 3. 3 -cm per day over 150 days. R. reniformis was able to establish in both the irrigated and non-irrigated trials in one season and to increase population density significantly...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Seiridium cardinale, {{the main}} fungal {{pathogen}} re-sponsible for cypress bark canker, {{is the largest}} threat to cy-presses worldwide. The terpene response of canker-resistant clones of Italian cypress, Cupressus sempervirens, to two dif-ferently aggressive isolates of S. cardinale was studied. Phlo-em terpene concentrations, foliar terpene concentrations, as well as foliar terpene emission rates were analyzed 1, 10, 30, and 90 days after artificial inoculation with fungal isolates. The phloem surrounding the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point</b> exhibited de novo production of four oxygenated monoterpenes and two unidentified terpenes. The concentrations of several constitu-tive mono- and diterpenes increased strongly (especially α-thujene, sabinene, terpinolene, terpinen- 4 -ol, oxygenated monoterpenes, manool, and two unidentified diterpenes) as the infection progressed. The proportion of minor terpenes in the infected cypresses increased markedly {{from the first day}} after inoculation (from 10 % in the control to 30 – 50 % in the infected treatments). Foliar concentrations showed no clear trend, but emission rates peaked at day 10 in infected trees, with higher δ- 3 -carene (15 -fold) and total monoterpene (10 -fold) emissions than the control. No substantial differ-ences were found among cypresses infected by the two fungal isolates. These results suggest that cypresses activate several direct and indirect chemical defense mechanisms after infec-tion by S. cardinale...|$|E
40|$|Artificially inoculated {{asparagus}} {{tissue culture}} plantlets with a virulent fungus, Fusarium proliferatum {{showed signs of}} infection as early as 4 days after inoculat ion. Macroscopic observations revealed presence of early symptoms such as necrotic lesions at the affected area and light microscopic examinations clearly revealed the post-penetration events that took place including the destruction of surrounding cells. However, little is known of the hyphal activity or advancement on the host's surface at the initial stage after inoculation. Scanning electron microscopic examination clearly revealed the hyphal advancement {{on the surface and}} the mode of entrance into the host tissues beneath. Four days after inoculation, the fungi proceeded to spread out from the <b>inoculation</b> <b>point</b> onto the host surface which eventually developed into a sparse network of both aerial and non-aerial hyphae. Non-aerial hyphae form a network of mycelium that adheres to the surface and it's movement appeared to be oriented towards the stomata. Hyphal penetration occurs more often through the stomata, natural openings or wounds. In some cases, the hyphae crossed over the stomatal opening w ithout entering the host tissues. At places where the cuticle layer is absent or not well developed the hyphae successfully grew in between the epidermal cells into the tissues beneath...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} a scientific report submitted by the Italian Authorities to the European Commission to support a request to delist Vitis sp. from Annex I (‘specified plants’) of the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015 / 789 of 18 May 2015 to prevent the introduction into and the spread within the Union of Xylella fastidiosa (Wells et al.). The report comprised (i) surveys to detect X. fastidiosa in vineyards located in the epidemic zone of CoDiRO with high numbers of diseased olive trees; (ii) inoculation experiments to infect grapevine with a X. fastidiosa isolate ‘De Donno’ from CoDiRO diseased olives; and (iii) vector transmission experiments with X. fastidiosa infective Philaenus spumarius. The Panel acknowledges the difficulties in providing evidence about this hitherto unknown pathogen/vector/host interaction to {{support the hypothesis that}} a plant species cannot be infected with a pathogen. Although field surveys to detect X. fastidiosa in grapevine were negative, there was no supporting information on infective vector populations present in the vineyards. Hence absence of infection pressure cannot be excluded. Furthermore the failure to infect grapevine plants either by artificial inoculation or by vector transmission might be due to inoculation conditions not appropriate to induce infections in grapevine. The detection of X. fastidiosa DNA in inoculated grapevine plants even 12 months after inoculation, although localised at the <b>inoculation</b> <b>points,</b> cannot exclude that the DNA amplified by qPCR was from viable cells. The results presented are coherent and provide converging lines of evidence that grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is not a major susceptible host of X. fastidiosa strain CoDiRO. However, from the experimental evidence it is premature to exclude that systemic infections of V. vinifera and Vitis sp. occur and that infections at limited foci could serve as a source of inoculum...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the histologic {{features}} of a latent Monilinia fructicola infection and brown rot in infected fruit. This report informs on the results of an investigation whose aim was to analyze the microanatomy of nectarines with a latent and visible M. fructicola infection. Mature nectarines were inoculated with an M. fructicola isolate and incubated at 25 °C for 0, 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours in the dark. For investigating the latent infection process, the inoculated nectarines were first incubated at 25 °C for 24 hours in the dark and then incubated at 4 °C for 72, 144, 216, and 288 hours in the dark. At the end of the incubation, samples of nectarine tissue were excised from the <b>inoculation</b> <b>points</b> and prepared for light and transmission electron microscopic examinations. No signs of disease were seen on the surface of nectarines with a latent infection over the 288 -hour incubation period. When the tissue samples were microscopically examined, M. fructicola colonized the stomata and this stomatal colonization progressively increased over time and was associated with gradual collapse of the epidermal cells and colonization of the subepidermis. In nectarines with visible brown rot, the disease usually appeared after 24 hours on the surface and in the uppermost layers of epidermal cells, which began to collapse after 48 hours. Subsequently, the diseased tissues of the nectarines displayed (a) colonization of the epidermis and mesocarp by M. fructicola with thin and thick hyphae, (b) collapse and disruption of epidermal and mesocarpic cells, (c) lysogenic cavities in the subepidermis and mesocarp, (d) degradation of the cuticle and epidermis, and (e) M. fructicola sporulation. M. fructicola is active during latent infections because slow and progressive colonization of nectarine subcuticular cells by the fungus occurs...|$|R
