The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the role of the <b>gut</b> and <b>liver</b> <b>in</b> IL- 6 homeostasis during liver surgery. MethodsBefore and after partial hepatectomy, IL- 6 was measured in blood sampled from the radial artery, and the hepatic and portal vein. Blood flow was measured to assess IL- 6 fluxes (flow times AV-differences) across the <b>gut,</b> <b>liver</b> and hepatosplanchnic area. ResultsIn 22 patients undergoing liver resection, IL- 6 release from the gut after transection was 90. 9 (30. 1) ng/min (P < 0. 001), whereas net IL- 6 uptake by the liver equalled 83. 4 (41. 7) ng/min (P < 0. 01). Overall hepatosplanchnic flux was 7. 3 (43. 5) ng/min after transection and did not differ significantly from zero. Overall hepatosplanchnic flux was 87. 8 (41. 5) ng/min in the major resection group and − 59. 8 (67. 5) ng/min in the minor resection group (P < 0. 05). DiscussionThe gut releases IL- 6 and the liver takes up IL- 6 before and after liver resection.

Gene inactivation of IL- 7, IL- 7 R, and IL- 2 Rgamma resulted in severe impairment of B and T lymphopoiesis in mice. In addition, IL- 2 Rgamma-deficient mice lack gammadelta T cells in the skin and have the impaired development of natural killer (NK) cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the contribution of}} blood cellular elements to inter-organ transport of amino acids, net exchange across the leg and splanchnic bed of 17 amino acids was determined in seven healthy postabsorptive subjects by use of both whole blood and plasma for analysis. Arterial-portal venous differences were measured in five additional subjects undergoing elective cholecystectomy. By use of whole blood, significant net release of amino acids was noted from the leg and gut, while a consistent uptake was observed by the splanchnic bed. The output of alanine from the leg and gut and the uptake of this amino acid by the splanchnic bed exceeded that of all other amino acids and accounted for 35 - 40 % of total amino-acid exchange. Transport by way of plasma could not account for total tissue release or uptake of alanine, threonine, serine, glutamine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and citrulline. For each of these amino acids, significant tissue exchange was calculated to occur {{by way of the}} blood cellular elements, the direction of which generally paralleled the net shifts occurring in plasma. For alanine, 30 % of its output from the leg and gut and 22 % of its uptake by the splanchnic area occurred by way of blood cells.

Lethal total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimens followed by reconstitution with allogeneic lymphohematopoietic cells results in the generation of donor anti-host cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) -mediated solid organ (<b>gut,</b> <b>liver,</b> skin) destruction. <b>In</b> contrast, donor anti-host CTL-mediated hematopoietic failure is {{the primary cause of}} morbidity following sublethal TBI. To determine the role of interferon (IFN) -gamma in graft-versus-host reactions against hematopoietic and solid organ targets, we used IFN-gamma knockout mice as donors in both lethal TBI and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) rescue and sublethal TBI models. In this report, we show that CD 4 + T cells from IFN-gamma knockout (KO) mice resulted in accelerated GVHD after lethal TBI/BMT using a single major histocompatibility class II mismatch model. In marked contrast, the use of these same IFN-gamma KO CD 4 + donor cells in combination with sublethal TBI significantly ameliorated GVHD-associated mortality. In these recipients, severe anemia, bone marrow aplasia, and intestinal lesions were observed in the presence but not the absence of donor-derived IFN-gamma. Administration of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies to sublethally irradiated recipients of wild-type donor cells confirmed the role of IFN-gamma depletion in CD 4 + T cell-mediated GVHD. In conclusion, the extent of conditioning markedly affects the role of IFN-gamma in GVHD lesions mediated by CD 4 + T cells. In models using sublethal TBI, the absence of IFN-gamma is protective from GVHD, whereas in lethal TBI situations, the loss is deleterious. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 2000; 6 (6) : 604 - 12...|$|R

Apart from providing nitrogen for protein synthesis, Gln is a precursor for nucleic acids, nucleotides, hexose amines, the nitric oxide precursor arginine (Arg), and the major antioxidant-glutathione. It plays a central role in nitrogen transport between tissues, specifically from muscle to <b>gut,</b> kidney, and <b>liver.</b> <b>In</b> addition to its role as a gluconeogenic substrate <b>in</b> the <b>liver,</b> kidney, and intestine, Gln is involved in the renal handling of ammonia, serving as a regulator of acid base homeostasis.

Ultrasonic flow probes were placed around the portal vein and hepatic, renal, and femoral arteries. After splenectomy, catheters were inserted into the pulmonary artery, aorta, and hepatic, left renal, and femoral veins. Whole blood lactate and blood gases from all catheters, organ flows, and cardiac output were measured before and 30 to 45 min after a bolus infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin (1 mg/kg). After endotoxin infusion, mean arterial blood lactate level increased from 0. 92 ± 0. 11 to 1. 60 ± 0. 15 mmol/L (p < 0. 0001). Lung lactate flux changed from uptake to release of lactate adding a mean of 9. 97 ± 16. 23 mmol/h (p < 0. 05) to the systemic circulation. Liver and muscle lactate fluxes remained neutral at all times, while kidney and gut took up lactate from the circulation {{both before and after}} endotoxin infusion (mean renal uptake, 2. 73 ± 3. 85 mmol/L; p < 0. 001; mean gut uptake, 2. 46 ± 2. 31 mmol/h; p < 0. 002). Except for the kidney, where a decrease in blood flow correlated with diminished uptake, there was no correlation between changes in transvisceral lactate fluxes and organ or systemic oxygen delivery during endotoxemia. A positive correlation between lactate uptake and oxygen consumption during endotoxemia was seen for both gut (p < 0. 0001) and kidney (p < 0. 002).

Results: The expression profiles suggested increased cholesterol trafficking <b>in</b> the <b>liver</b> and decreased trafficking in the small intestine. Plasma cholesterol concentrations significantly increased, and triglycerides decreased in fasting. Surprisingly, in prolonged fasting, the biliary bile salt and lipid output rates increased, with increased hepatic and intestinal lipid turnover, and enhanced trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion. In contrast, faecal sterol loss declined sharply. To investigate whether the increased biliary phospholipid secretion could nourish the intestinal epithelium, we studied the histology of the small intestines upon fasting in multidrug resistant protein 2 deficient mice with scarce biliary phospholipids. Their adaptive biliary response to fasting was lost, while the shortage of biliary phospholipids strongly induced apoptosis and proliferation in the small intestine and increased the number of mucin-producing cells. Conclusion: Even with no dietary fat, lipid levels remain remarkably constant <b>in</b> the murine <b>liver</b> and intestines during prolonged fasting. The biliary system, always assumed to be coupled to the postprandial response, shows a paradoxical increase in activity. We hypothesise that biliary lipids are mobilised to supply the enterocytes with luminal fuel and to stabilise transport systems in the intestine for ensuring a rapid recovery when the food supply resumes.

40|$|A 34 -year-old female with {{a history}} of {{advanced}} pulmonary sarcoidosis and right-sided heart failure presented with chronic, postprandial right upper quadrant pain, and weight loss. Endoscopic biliary drainage was deemed to be the most appropriate therapeutic option for her chronic cholecystitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography utilizing the SpyGlass cholangioscopy system allowed us to access the cystic duct through which the gallbladder was ultimately decompressed, via biliary stent placement and gallstone irrigation. This is the first report of SpyScope assisted placement of fully covered self-expandable metal biliary stents into the cystic duct enabling definitive treatment of symptomatic chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis without cholecystectomy.

40|$|Biliary {{obstructions}} {{are rarely}} {{caused by a}} foreign body and have received sparse attention. We present an unusual case with pruritis and abdominal pain caused by impacted full length surgical gauze within the common bile duct. The patient had previously undergone an open cholecystectomy. Radiological investigations were inconclusive and suggestive of either a calculus or a cholangiocarcinoma. Surgical exploration revealed full length surgical gauze within the common bile duct. Because imaging modalities are often non-determinant, the possibility of biliary tract obstruction from a foreign body should be borne in mind for patients with unusual presentations, especially those who have previously undergone surgery.
