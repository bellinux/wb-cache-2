40|$|Wind {{tunnel test}} data are {{analysed}} to determine ground effects {{and the effectiveness}} of the aerodynamic control surfaces to provide a technology base for a Navy type A V/STOL airplane. Three 14 CM (5. 5 inch) turbopowered simulators were used to power the model which was tested primarily in the following configurations: (1) VTOL with flaps deployed, <b>gear</b> <b>down,</b> and engines tilted to 80 deg, 90 deg, and 95 deg, (2) STOL with flap and <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> and engines tilted to 50 deg; and (3) Loiter with flaps and gear up and L/C nacelles off. Data acquired during the tests are included as an appendix...|$|R
50|$|A {{free-fall}} or gravity drop {{system uses}} gravity to deploy the landing <b>gear</b> into the <b>down</b> and locked position. To accomplish this the pilot activates a switch or mechanical handle in the cockpit, which releases the up-lock. Gravity then pulls the landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> and deploys it. Once in position {{the landing gear}} is mechanically locked and safe to use for landing.|$|R
50|$|Boeing {{simulations}} {{showed that}} aircraft was controllable with one engine at idle reverse {{and the other}} at full forward thrust in gear up, flaps 15 configuration. With flaps 25 and <b>gear</b> <b>down,</b> {{it was not possible}} to maintain level flight.|$|R
50|$|The CNA C.VI I.R.C.43 was a six-cylinder, supercharged, inverted, inline engine {{designed}} and built in Italy in the 1930s. Following standard Italian practice, the designation IRC43 indicated that the engine was inverted, <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> and had a supercharger rated to 4,300 m (14,110 ft).|$|R
50|$|An AC servo amplifier, {{a linear}} power amplifier, feeds the control winding.The {{electrical}} {{resistance of the}} rotor is made high intentionally so that the speed/torque curve is fairly linear. Two-phase servo motors are inherently high-speed, low-torque devices, heavily <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> to drive the load.|$|R
50|$|Iran Air Flight 742 was a {{passenger}} flight which made {{an emergency landing}} at Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran, Iran, on 18 October 2011.

2500|$|Below {{the summit}} {{there is an}} area known as [...] "rainbow valley", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly {{coloured}} winter <b>gear.</b> <b>Down</b> to about 8000 metres is an area commonly called the [...] "death zone", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.|$|R
25|$|Based on the {{principle}} of the Fokker Zentralsteuerung gear, with flexible drives linked to the camshaft, and firing impulses being generated by the trigger motor of each gun. <b>Geared</b> <b>down</b> to operate more reliably with the difficult Schwarzlose gun, its rate of fire was limited to 360–380 rounds per minute.|$|R
40|$|Discussed {{here are}} {{computations}} of drag or negative traction of <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> supporting propellers in the downward vertical glide of a helicopter. By means of Frounde's Theory, the maximum {{value of the}} drag of a windmill is calculated. For wooden propellers, the author finds {{that the difference between}} the drag and the weight is proportional to the number of blades and is larger for propellers of small diameter; thus it is 25 kg. for a six blade propeller with a diameter of 2 m. 50. The author notes that if we are to adopt large propellers, we must have recourse to a different method of construction, resulting in large dimension propellers much lighter than those made of wood. In discussing insufficient drag, the author notes that the question of the drag of <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> supporting propellers can only be decided by experiment...|$|R
500|$|The tents were {{dismantled}} and Hawaiians {{carried the}} <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> {{over the next}} three days, while Wilkes enjoyed a lomilomi Hawaiian massage. He continued his measurements at lower elevations and left the island on March 5. For all the effort he did not obtain any significant results, attributing gravity discrepancies to [...] "the tides".|$|R
50|$|Captain Linquist told San Juan {{that his}} landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> {{indicator}} lamps did not work. This {{led to the}} discovery that his batteries were low on water and electrical charge. While he ordered the refilling of the batteries with water, he ordered the reinstallation of the batteries on board the aircraft without recharging them.|$|R
50|$|Above him, many enemy {{fighters were}} maneuvering. He {{found one of}} them coming <b>down</b> with landing <b>gear</b> <b>down.</b> He chased it to an {{altitude}} of 200 m and fired a burst. The I-16 was surprised and made a split S maneuver, but crashed at {{a corner of the}} airfield. This was his 4th victory.|$|R

Nose <b>gear</b> touched <b>down</b> at 8days 4hours 30minutes 54seconds (12:01:37pmEST – 17:01:37UTC) and Atlantiss wheels stopped at an MET of 8days 4hours 31minutes 42seconds (12:02:24pmEST – 17:02:24UTC), {{bringing}} the 73rd space shuttle mission to a close.|$|R
2500|$|L8 a {{significant}} 1929 development {{with the same}} swept volume but cruising at 2,100rpm and delivering 354hp; take off power was 413hp. The output was <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> at ratios between 2.47:1 and 1.44:1 to enhance propeller efficiency. [...] Only a few were produced, powering early configurations of the Junkers G 38 as outer engines, with two L55s inboard.|$|R
6000|$|I saw Pyecroft's arm fly up; {{heard at}} the same moment the {{severing}} of the tense rope, the working of the wheel, Moorshed's voice down the tube saying, [...] "Astern a little, please, Mr. Hinchcliffe!" [...] and Pyecroft's cry, [...] "Trawler with her <b>gear</b> <b>down!</b> Look out for our propeller, Sir, or we'll be wrapped up in the rope." ...|$|R
50|$|Catch-22s budget could {{accommodate}} 17 flyable B-25s, and {{an additional}} non-flyable hulk was acquired in Mexico, made barely ferry-able and flown with landing <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> to the Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico filming location, only to be burned and destroyed in the landing crash scene. The wreck was then buried in the ground next to the runway, where it remains.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} motor, <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> {{to get a}} {{lower speed}} and a higher torque, drives a pulley {{at one end of}} a belt. The door is clamped to the belt.To open the door, the motor turns the pulley, which in turn turns the belt, which in turn drags the door. To close the door, the reverse occurs.|$|R
50|$|Two {{nights before}} the festival gig, Talisman played in Stockholm. Because of a {{miscommunication}} between Jamie, Pontus, Marcel {{and the guys}} doing the mobile recording stuff, Marcel's entire gear (bass included!) was left at the venue in Stockholm instead of travelling with everybody else’s <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> to Sölvesborg, south of Sweden, where the Sweden Rock Festival takes place.|$|R
50|$|Since the gas {{turbines}} optimum performance {{was at a}} speed of 19250 rpm, the output was <b>geared</b> <b>down</b> to 6000 rpm for the hydraulic drive. The main diesel and gas turbine (as in the Class 219 001) had two independent drive shafts with the output connected by gears. Each hydraulic chamber could be filled and emptied independently.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 July 1973, Varig Flight 820, a Boeing 707, made {{a forced}} landing due to {{fire in a}} rear lavatory, {{incoming}} from Rio de Janeiro-Galeão. The aircraft landed 5 kilometers short of the runway, in a full-flap and <b>gear</b> <b>down</b> configuration. Due mainly to smoke inhalation, there were 123 deaths whilst 11 people survived (10 crew, 1 passenger).|$|R
