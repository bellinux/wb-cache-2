5000|$|The second {{generation}} {{also saw the}} introduction of Super Select 4WD (SS4) as ActivTrak 4WD in some markets, multimode ABS, which were firsts on Japanese four-wheel drives, and <b>electronic</b> <b>shock</b> absorber. SS4 was ground-breaking {{in the sense that}} it combined the advantages of part-time and full-time four-wheel drive with four available options: 2H (high-range rear-wheel drive), 4H (high-range full-time four-wheel drive), 4HLc (high-range four-wheel drive with locked center differential) and 4LLc (low-range four-wheel drive with locked center differential). Another advantage of this {{second generation}} system is that it gave the driver the ability to switch between two-wheel drive and full-time four-wheel drive at speeds up to 100 km/h (62 mph), whereas the first generation Pajero had to be stationary to switch from rear-wheel drive to four-wheel drive (but not from four-wheel drive back to rear-wheel drive). In addition to the SS4, an air locking differential was included as factory option. Either 4HLc or 4LLc mode must be engaged to perform this operation. Multimode ABS, on the other hand, was equally innovative. This meant ABS would be fully functional in all modes of SS4, as braking with a locked center differential requires completely different braking parameters. The new <b>electronic</b> <b>shock</b> absorber was also factory option with three settings: S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard). This meant driver can change ride quality and handling depending on road conditions via a switch on center console.|$|E

Numerous functional applications, such as nano-brushes, field emitters, catalyst and catalyst supports, <b>electronic</b> electrodes, <b>shock</b> absorbing, energy conversion and storage, {{have been proposed}} [1 – 5]. The performance of aligned CNTs depends highly on the intrinsic structure of CNTs {{as well as the}} organization of CNTs. For example, large specific surface area (small CNT diameter and wall number) and suitable pore size distribution (hierarchical array structures) were required for the application of aligned CNT arrays in supercapacitor [6]. Therefore, the modulations of the CNT structure and their organization were of common interest in the research of CNT arrays.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Optoelectronics {{and fiber}} optics {{can be used}} to miniaturize and improve the {{flexibility}} of the transducer cable and transducer handle of medical diagnostic ultrasound scanners. The reduction in size has gained importance as 2 -D array trans-ducers with up to 1000 independent channels become accepted to improve diagnostic ultrasound images. This paper describes the analysis, design, fabrication and testing of a prototype silicon photoconductive semiconductor switch (PCSS). The monolithic silicon PCSS was used in combination with an infrared semicon-ductor diode laser with a fiber optic “pigtail ” to shock excite and burst excite a 2 -D array transducer element resonant at 2. 5 MHz. Optically controlled voltage, current, and ultrasound pulses are compared to those from conventional <b>electronic</b> <b>shock</b> excitation and narrow band Doppler pulses. The optically triggered ultrasound pulse for single shock exci-tation produced 30 V spikes at the 2 -D array element with a fall time of 200 nsec and a rise time of 2 psec with a peak current through the transducer element of 34 mA. An optically produced burst of eight pulses at a frequency of 2. 5 MHz produced 11 V spikes at the transducer with a fall time under 100 nsec and a rise time of approximately 300 nsec. The peak current per pulse was 25 mA through the transducer element. These results show the feasibility of applying optoelectronic technology to replace conventional electronic transmitter technology. I...|$|E

MethodsTotal of 40 SD rats, 20 females and 20 males, {{were randomly assigned to}} 4 groups, controlled group (A), model group (B), conventional treatment group (C) and Bushenyisui Formula treatment (BYFT) group (D), 10 rats in each group. Aβ 1 – 42 was injected into the bilateral hippocampus of the rats in group B, C and D to create the models of AD. Sham operation was performed on the rats of group A in the same way by injecting equal volume of 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution into their bilateral hippocampus. 5 days after operation, Bushenyisui Formula was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 450 mg/kg to the rats of group D (QD) for 20 days. Equal volume of 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution was intraperitoneally injected into the rats of group B with the same procedure. C suspension (20 mg/mL) was intraperitoneally injected into the rats of group B with the same procedure. The number of apoptotic cells in Brain and the positive Bcl- 2 were counted. The changes of learning and memory abilities were evaluated using Y-maze. ResultsRight after the establishment of the models, group B, C and D compared to group A respectively, the outcomes of Y-maze were significantly different from that of group A, which suggested obvious learning and memory disorder in those groups (P< 0. 01). After treatment, the times of <b>electronic</b> <b>shocks</b> of group C and D were significantly less than that of group B (P< 0. 05), and the numbers of apoptotic cells and positive Bcl- 2 were significantly different from those of group B, apoptotic sells' number of group C and D smaller than that of group B and the number of positive Bcl- 2 greater than that of group B. ConclusionBushenyisui Formula could increase the number of Bcl- 2 in brain, which improved the function of nervous system pertaining to learning and memory abilities...|$|R
40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} industry, {{it may be}} important to study the relationship between machine component failures under stress. Examples include failures such as integrated circuits and memory chips in electronic merchandise given various levels of <b>electronic</b> <b>shock.</b> Such studies are important {{for the development of}} new products and for the improvement of existing products. We assume two component systems for simplicity and we assume the joint probability of failures increases with stress as a cumulative bivariate Weibull function. Optimal designs have been developed for two correlated binary responses using the Gumbel model, the bivariate binary Cox model and the bivariate probit model. In all these models, the amount of damage ranges from negative to positive infinity. In the Weibull model, the amount of damage is positive which is natural for experimental factors such as voltage, tension or pressure. First, we describe locally optimal designs under bivariate Weibull assumptions. From among many optimal objective functions, we use the D-optimality criterion which minimizes the inverse of the determinant of information matrix. Since locally optimal designs with non-linear models depend on pre-determined parameter values, misspecified parameter values may lead to designs of the low efficiency. To improve the efficiency of locally optimal designs, we recommend a multi-stage procedure. We show how using a two-stage procedure substantially improves a locally optimal design with misspecified parameters. In addition to D-optimal designs, we describe c-optimal designs under the trivariate Weibull regression model. We assume that the amount of damage decreases sequentially as the stress progresses through the three components. The target stress can be expressed in terms of a linear predictor function, and we evaluate c-optimal designs for optimizing the prediction of the target stress. To compensate for the loss of efficiency of optimal designs with non-linear models, we show a two-stage procedure, and then compare the e...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} effect of feeding mackerel dried by low temperature vacuum method to mice on their learning behavior and fatty acid composition of the nervous system. Thirty-two male mice were fed either a control (palm oil, control group) diet or a diet of 20 % dried mackerel (mackerel group) for three months. Learning behav-ior was assessed using a passive avoidance test, and the tissue fatty acid composition was measured after the behavioral test. The lack of experience with <b>electronic</b> foot <b>shocks</b> resulted in both the control and mackerel groups showing shorter latency during the acquisition trial (Day 1). The avoidance latencies of each group subsequently increased after multiple acquisition trials. The mackerel group showed a significantly longer avoidance latency on day 2 than {{was the case with the}} control group (p < 0. 05). In terms of the fatty acid composition of the serum and nervous tissues such as the brain and retina, the mackerel group showed increased percentages of total n- 3 fatty acids, and especially docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids. Meanwhile, the control group showed decreased DHA levels, but increased docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn- 6) levels. From the above results, it may be concluded that the intake of mackerel dried by low temperature vacuum improved learning behavior, as assessed by passive avoidance test, with increased DHA in the brain.

40|$|In this study, the {{transient}} response of electronic assemblies to mechanical loading encountered in drop and shock conditions are investigated. Many manufactures face design challenges when evolving new designs for high strain-rate life-cycle loading. Examples of high strain-rate loading include drop events, blast events, vibration, ultrasonic process steps, etc. New design iterations invariably bring new unexpected failure modes under such loading and costly trial-and-error design fixes are often necessary after {{the product is}} built. Electronics designers have long sought to address these effects during the design phase, {{with the aid of}} computational models. However, such efforts have been difficult because of the nonlinearities inherent in complex assemblies and complex dynamic material properties.

40|$|Background: Identifying stress {{vulnerability}} after antidepressant discontinuation may {{be useful}} in treating relapses in depression. Previous studies have suggested significant effects of the immune system as well as the central nervous system (CNS) on progression and induction of major depression. In the present study, we hypothesized that the factors that are not rescued by a tricyclic antidepressant imipramine may be associated with stress vulnerability and relapses in depression. Methods: To address this issue, mice were exposed to 2 h of restraint stress for 21 consecutive days (chronic restraint stress (CRS)) with or without co-treatment of imipramine. These groups were exposed to an <b>electronic</b> foot <b>shock</b> (FS) as additional stress after imipramine washout. Main targets of stress and antidepressants were analyzed in the hippocampus, lymph node, and serum after a series of depression-like behavior analysis. Results: In this study, we found {{for the first time that}} mice exposed to CRS with a tricyclic antidepressant imipramine co-treatment, which did not show depressive-like behaviors, were vulnerable to subsequent stressful stimuli compared to the non-stressed mice after imipramine washout. CRS mice with imipramine co-treatment did not show any difference in BDNF, serotonin receptors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, or kynurenine pathway in the hippocampus compared to the controls. However, peripheral IL- 4, IL- 10, and alternatively activated microglial phenotypes in the hippocampus were not restored with sustained reduction in CRS mice despite chronic imipramine administration. Supplementing recombinant IL- 4 and IL- 10 in co-Imi+CRS mice prevented the stress vulnerability on additional stress and restored factors related to alternatively activated microglia (M 2) in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Thus, our results suggest that the reduced IL- 4 and IL- 10 levels in serum with hippocampal M 2 markers may be involved in the stress vulnerability after imipramine discontinuation, and the restoration and modulation of these factors {{may be useful}} to some forms of depression-associated conditions.
