50|$|In 2010, Native Instruments {{released}} the Traktor Kontrol S4, which used high resolution <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and a proprietary protocol rather than MIDI to achieve better {{performance of the}} <b>jog</b> <b>wheels.</b> The Mk2 of the Kontrol S4, released in 2013, uses standard HID signals rather than a proprietary protocol {{to communicate with the}} computer.|$|R
50|$|Specialized DJ-CD {{players with}} <b>jog</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{allowing}} the DJ to manipulate a CD {{as if it}} were a vinyl record, have become widely available in the 2000s.|$|R
50|$|The CMX-5000 {{consists}} of a 2U section {{with a pair of}} slot-loading CD drives and a 3U 'controller' section with a pair of <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and control buttons for the CD drive below.|$|R
5000|$|The CMX-3000 was Pioneer's second {{attempt to}} enter the market of {{rack-mountable}} dual deck CD-players. Released {{in the wake of}} the CDJ-1000, the player was - and still is - often mistakenly advertised as a 19" [...] inch rack mountable equivalent of dual CDJ-1000's even though the intended target audiences for the products, as well as their comparative pricing, were entirely in different leagues. The misconception is possibly caused by the fact that while Pioneer's earlier dual deck CD-player, the CMX-5000, only had a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> comparable to earlier single deck CD-players for doing pitch bending, the CMX-3000 also allowed distinct jog mode that enabled the user to use the <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> for scratching, a feature that thus far was only available on the top-of-the line CDJ-1000. The <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> however relies upon the movement of the wheel itself and is not touch sensitive as it is on the CDJ-1000, CDJ-800 and CDJ-400. Therefore, the scratch is intended as an effect or for cueing a track, and is not appropriate for stopping the track by touch as it is on the other CDJ models.|$|E
50|$|An {{updated version}} of the CDJ-1000, the CDJ-1000 MK2 was {{released}} on July 2003 with additional features like improved <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> and faster response time than in the original model. The product was discontinued in 2006 when the mk3 was introduced into the market.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} {{physical}} {{buttons on the}} front of the Mondo, located under the display to toggle standby, and to provide shortcuts to the phone, messages, calendar and contacts features. A <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> on the left spine of the phone controls volume and another button starts and stops audio recordings.|$|E
50|$|Some DJ {{controllers}} {{break from}} the conventional two <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and a mixer layout and {{are designed to be}} easily mapped however the user wants. Some controllers are designed to be used either for live PA performances with software such as Ableton Live or with DJ software. A few DJ controllers, most notably the Novation Dicers, are designed to be used with timecode vinyl.|$|R
25|$|CDJs {{are high}} quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and pitch {{controls}} to allow DJs {{to manipulate the}} playback of digital files for beatmatching similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from compact discs, they now can play digital music files stored on USB flash drives and SD cards. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software {{to act as a}} DJ controller.|$|R
50|$|Early {{examples}} of DJ controllers include the Hercules DJ Console released by Guillemot Corporation in 2004, {{which features a}} 6 channel soundcard with SPDIF and MIDI ports, traditional mixer-style faders, crossfader and EQs, <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and CD DJ style button controls. In 2007, Vestax produced a controller specifically designed for DJing, the VCI-100, that emulated two turntables and a DJ mixer setup and was built with quality components acceptable to DJs. Many manufacturers saw {{the success of the}} VCI-100 and started selling their own similar devices. Unlike the original VCI-100, some of those devices had integrated sound cards.|$|R
5000|$|Maschine Mk2: The current {{configuration}} of Maschine is {{nearly identical to}} its predecessor, but features RGB backlighting {{for all of its}} button and upgraded pads. As well, 3 knobs related to volume, tempo, and swing were replaced with a single <b>jog</b> <b>wheel,</b> and 6 buttons. The unit also comes in either black or white, and features a removable magnetic top-plate and knobs for further color customization.|$|E
5000|$|Maschine Studio: The {{most recent}} {{configuration}} of Maschine, Studio is marketed as the premium {{edition of the}} hardware. Studio features 16 pressure sensitive pads, RGB backlighting, 9 rotary knobs, 2 color LCD screens, 2 sliders, a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel,</b> and 66 buttons. The controller also features dual MIDI inputs and outputs, 2 foot switch inputs, and an input for a 15v power supply, as USB power is insufficient.|$|E
50|$|The Sport Relief Mile {{was created}} to give the {{campaign}} a focus with an event that was open to anyone to run, walk, <b>jog,</b> <b>wheel,</b> bounce or crawl, regardless of ability or age. It was also designed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Sir Roger Bannister's first sub-four-minute mile. Participants can also choose to cover 3 miles or 6 miles (close to, but slightly shorter than, the 5K and 10K distances more commonly used in mass runs).|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Vestax {{moved into}} the burgeoning digital DJ market and {{released}} the VCI 100, an all-in-one DJ controller used to control digital DJ software. Its design of <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and a mixer in a single compact frame sparked a revolution in digital DJ hardware, quickly becoming the blueprint for most DJ controllers and helping to re-establish Vestax as {{a major player in}} the DJ market. The company has subsequently solidified this position by launching a highly respected range of DJ controllers from low-end consumer models to more highly specced pro versions such as the VCI-380 and VCI-400.|$|R
50|$|A CDJ is a {{specialized}} digital music player for DJing. Originally designed {{to play music}} from compact discs, many CDJs can play digital music files stored on USB flash drives or SD cards. In typical use, at least two CDJs are plugged into a DJ mixer. CDJs have <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and pitch faders that allow manipulation of the digital music file similar to a vinyl record on a DJ turntable. Many have additional features such as loops and beat analysis that are not present on turntables. Additionally, some can function as DJ controllers to control the playback of digital files in DJ software running on a laptop instead of playing the files on the CDJ.|$|R
50|$|DJ {{controllers}} are devices {{used to help}} DJs mix {{music with}} DJ software using knobs, encoders, <b>jog</b> <b>wheels,</b> faders, backlit buttons, touch strips, and other components. They are used to provide easier control of the software than the computer keyboard and touchpad on a laptop, or the touchscreen on tablet computers and smartphones. DJ controllers do not mix audio signals like DJ mixers; rather, they send signals to a computer to tell the DJ software running on the computer how to mix audio. Many DJ controllers also have a built in sound card with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs), which allows the DJ to preview music in headphones before playing it on the main output. Most DJ controllers use the standard MIDI or HID protocols {{to communicate with the}} computer via USB.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} {{versions}} the mk3 supports playback of MP3s from CD-R and CD-RW media. Other improvements to earlier versions include bigger, lighter displays; a 100 dots waveform display {{instead of the}} earlier 50 dots waveform; the ability to record loops into Hot Cue slots instead of just cue points. The mechanical resistance of the <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> is adjustable to suit different styles of handling by the DJ. Furthermore, the mk3 uses a newer SD media while the earlier incarnations used MultiMediaCard/MMC as a memory card format.|$|E
5000|$|A jog dial, <b>jog</b> <b>wheel,</b> shuttle dial, or shuttle {{wheel is}} a type of knob, ring, wheel, or dial which allows the user to shuttle or jog through audio or video media. It is {{commonly}} found on models of CD players which are made for disc jockeys, and on professional video equipment such as video tape recorders. More recently, they are found on handheld PDAs, and as the scroll wheel on computer mice. [...] "Jog" [...] refers to going at a very slow speed, whereas [...] "shuttle" [...] refers to a very fast speed.|$|E
5000|$|There was no {{audio signal}} in an I/O module—rather, each I/O module {{had a single}} 4 MHz Z80 {{microprocessor}} that was responsible for converting user input (switches, knobs, faders) on four channels to control signals for the audio tower, and for returning sample level information for display on the meters and overload information for clipping indicators. The Master module (also powered by a single 4 MHz Z80) handled the master faders, the talkback system, additional meters, etc. and also included a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> and dot-matrix alphanumeric display for configuring the system. Since most controls (e.g. {{the changing of the}} gain of a selected EQ) could be performed with the <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> and alphanumeric display and were shown in real time on the Support Computer's display, a mix engineer could do most of his/her work from a central location at the Mix Controller while remaining in the audio [...] "sweet spot" [...] for monitoring purposes, etc. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} conventional mixing consoles of the time, where a particular EQ had to be adjusted via the associated knobs in that particular channel strip, which might be located a considerable distance from the sweet spot. A third Z80-based processor board—the MPU—resided inside the Master module and was responsible for system booting and initialization, system management, inter-module communication and communication with an external PC.|$|E
40|$|We have {{continually}} evolved computing to {{not only}} be more efficient, but also more accessible, more of the time (and place), and to more people. We have progressed from batch computing with punch cards, to interactive command line systems, to mouse-based graphical user interfaces, and more recently to mobile computing. Each of these paradigm shifts has drastically {{changed the way we}} use technology for work and life, often in unpredictable and profound ways. With the latest move to mobile computing, we now carry devices with significant computational power and capabilities on our bodies. However, their small size typically leads to limited interaction space (diminutive screens, buttons, and <b>jog</b> <b>wheels)</b> and consequently diminishes their usability and functionality. This presents a challenge and an opportunity for developing interaction modalities that will open the door for novel uses of computing. Researchers have been exploring small device interaction techniques that leverage every available part of the device. For example, NanoTouch, develope...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This project aims at {{improving}} the user experience re-garding multimedia content annotation. We evaluated and compared current timeline-based annotation tools, {{so as to}} elicit user requirements. We address two issues: 1) adapting the user interface, by supporting more input modalities through a rapid prototyping tool and by offering alternative visualization techniques of temporal signals; and 2) covering more steps of the annotation workflow besides the task of annotation itself: notably recording multimodal signals. We developed input devices components for the OpenInterface (OI) platform for rapid prototyping of multimodal interfaces: multitouch screen, <b>jog</b> <b>wheels</b> and pen-based solutions. We modified an annotation tool created with the Smart Sensor Integration (SSI) toolkit and com-ponentized it in OI so as to bind its controls to different input devices. We produced mockups sketches towards a new design of an improved user interface for multimedia content annotation, and started developing a rough prototype using the Processing Development Environment. Our solution allows to produce several prototypes by varying the interaction pipeline: changing input modalities and using either the initial GUI of the annotation tool, or the newly-designed one. We target usability testing to validate our solution and determine which input modalities combination best suits given use cases...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to realise an {{interface}} between a digital music source such as a CD player or a computer and a turntable. The overall work during this research was signal processing. One of the main parts {{of the project was}} a discovery of the CD players' signals and characteristics and a discovery of the characteristics of the vinyl disc and the turntable {{in order to determine the}} project specifications. To realise the project, many compromises had to be made in order to solve every problem as well as possible. The first part of the project was the realisation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the vinyl saw tooth signal in order to determine the bandwidth of four saw tooth signals with different frequencies given that a saw tooth is composed of a fundamental and several harmonics. The {{aim of the}}se measurements is to determine which signal is the most suitable for the realisation of the project. Then the work is focused on the vinyl disc signal in order to determine precisely the speed of rotation and the direction of rotation of the vinyl disc. And the final part is the generation of the signal which simulates the CD player <b>jog</b> dial (or <b>wheel)</b> signal. The detection of the direction of rotation is now working correctly and the generation of the CD player jog dial signals is possible. The last part which has not been completely achieved during the project is the accurate detection of the speed of rotation of the vinyl disc. This project is an on-going personal investigation into DJs system that is why this work will continue after the Master's projectSchool of Computing, Communications and Electronic...|$|R
50|$|Another {{technology}} included {{is called}} JogAssist, {{which gives the}} user {{more control over the}} Palm OS by using the <b>Jog</b> <b>wheel.</b> It can be set so that when the Jog wheel's back button is held down for a few seconds, it will show a cursor over the on-screen elements and allow the user to modify them without using the stylus. Holding the back button for slightly longer instead selects the Palm OS menu from the current application, which can also be augmented with up to 3 shortcuts to regularly used tasks from: Power Off, Applications, Keyboard, Calc, Find, Backlight or Brightness.|$|E
50|$|Equipment {{levels were}} high and set new {{standards}} for French cars, the 25 including among other features, an express-up and down feature on the driver's power window, voice alerts (covering {{items such as}} improperly shut doors/bonnet/boot - oil pressure, engine temperature/charging circuit and blown bulbs), {{and one of the}} world's first remote stereo controls, mounted {{to the right of the}} steering column (controlling volume +/-, station search, station select (<b>jog</b> <b>wheel)</b> in radio mode & Volume +/-, mute and track advance (if supported)). For the first time since World War II, Renault had a realistic chance of breaking into the full-size market segment outside France.|$|E
5000|$|From the {{advertising}} brochure:The MPC Renaissance uses a PC or a Mac's memory. The MPC Renaissance {{is the first}} MPC to take the power from an external computer (with the dedicated [...] "MPC Software") and combine it with the regular tradition of the MPC. The memory limitation depends on the connecting computer. The Renaissance takes on {{the look of the}} 3000, sharing its transport buttons, <b>jog</b> <b>wheel,</b> and arm rest. Its LCD has the same look as the MPCs 1000, 2500 and 5000r. The Renaissance is the first MPC to include back lit pads which change colors for velocity levels, sound groups, step edit, etc.|$|E
5000|$|HandEra's second {{handheld}} was the Handera 330. The 330 introduced {{many new}} features {{which were not}} standard for other Palm OS devices at their time. The Handera was the first Palm to provide virtual graffiti input. In addition the 330 also featured a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel,</b> a microphone, an internal audio amplifier, an MMC / SD slot, and a Compact Flash slot. A backup utility in ROM could restore RAM contents from a memory card. Multiple backup files could be maintained on a single card. The 330 supports the use of four AAA batteries or a Li-Ion battery pack. The 330 also supported various add-ons such as a Wi-fi Card. http://www.handera.com/Products/HandEra330.aspx ...|$|E
50|$|Analog Keys was {{released}} in November 2013. It is {{an expansion of the}} Analog Four architecture. It has a 37-key keyboard and an analog joystick for modulation and tweaking. The Analog Keys has more dedicated control keys than its tabletop sibling, including a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> for quick access to pre-programmed sounds. The Analog Keys was designed to be a hands-on, tactile instrument fit for live performances while maintaining all the sequencing, sound crafting and programming capabilities of the Analog Four. At the 2016 Game Awards show in California, the artist Sonic Mayhem did a memorable performance using the Analog Keys. He performed a cover of the theme song from the classic Doom (1993 video game).|$|E
50|$|SidStation was {{the first}} Elektron instrument, {{released}} to the public in 1999. A tabletop synthesizer built on the SID chip originally found in the Commodore 64 home computer. The synthesizer had three voices, three oscillators (with various possible forms of synthesis like AM, FM and ring modulation, four rubber-coated potentiometers to control parameters including filter cut-off frequency, amplitude envelope and LFO, a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> for patch selection and a telephone keypad for programming input. Even at the outset, the SidStation was a strictly limited product: it had to be discontinued when the last stock of virgin SID chips was depleted. Butchering even a single Commodore 64 for parts was out of the question. The original SidStation had a polished aluminum casing. There were a couple of special editions, like a red-tinted one, a blue tinted one and a carbon black version called SidStation Ninja.|$|E
5000|$|A line of {{accessories}} for the G5 branded as [...] "Friends" [...] were unveiled {{alongside the}} phone itself, including a wired head-mounted display {{known as the}} LG 360 VR (which attaches via the device's USB-C port), the LG 360 Cam virtual reality camera, and the LG Rolling Bot. These accessories are all managed via the LG Friends Manager application on the device, which automatically pairs and synchronizes with these devices. The 360 VR is not compatible with the G5 SE model. Two accessories utilizing the expansion slot system were unveiled; the [...] "LG Cam Plus" [...] accessory adds a grip {{to the rear of}} the device that incorporates physical camera controls, a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> for zoom, as well as a supplemental battery. The [...] "LG Hi-Fi Plus" [...] accessory is a collaboration with Bang & Olufsen which adds a DAC, an amplifier, Direct Stream Digital audio support and upsampling, and is bundled with B&O Play H3 earbuds.|$|E
5000|$|The CDJ-800 uses a {{different}} {{mechanism for the}} <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> than the 1000 - it can perform [...] "quick return" [...] if the top surface of the wheel is pressed, then released. The general design purpose of the CDJ-800 was to offer DJ's the facilities {{they have in the}} club on CDJ-1000's at home for a lower price. While the CDJ-1000 has a button to override the pitch slider, the CDJ-800 slider has a center detent, which is [...] "easy to center." [...] The CDJ-800 does not have the CDJ-1000's [...] "hot cue" [...] feature, and has only [...] "one cue, and one loop" [...] at a time, though these can be saved for up to 500 CDs. [...] The CDJ-800 can alter loop [...] "out-points" [...] while playing, but can't alter in-points; loops must be re-captured. Though the CDJ-1000 will relay (alternate CDs) in both vinyl and CDJ jog modes, the CDJ-800 will only relay in CDJ jog mode. The CDJ-800 also has an [...] "auto-beat" [...] function that the 1000 does not.|$|E
40|$|Three {{interaction}} techniques were evaluated for scrolling stack mode displays of volumetric data. Two used a scrollwheel mouse: one used only the wheel, while another used a “click and drag ” technique for fast scrolling, leaving the wheel for fine adjustments. The third technique used a Shuttle Xpress <b>jog</b> <b>wheel.</b> In a within-subjects design, nine radiologists searched stacked images for simulated hyperintense regions on brain, knee, and thigh MR studies. Dependent measures were speed, accuracy, navigation path, and user preference. The radiologists considered the task realistic. They had high inter-subject variability in completion times, far {{larger than the}} differences between techniques. Most radiologists (eight out of nine) preferred familiar mouse-based techniques. Most participants scanned the data in two passes, first locating anomalies, then scanning for omissions. Participants spent a mean 10. 4 s/trial exploring anomalies, with only mild variation between participants. Their rates of forward navigation searching for anomalies varied much more. Interaction technique significantly affected forward navigation rate (scroll wheel 5. 4 slices/s, click and drag 9. 4, and <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> 6. 9). It {{is not clear what}} constrained the slowest navigators. The fastest navigator used a unique strategy of moving quickly just beyond an anomaly, then backing up. Eight naïve students performed a similar protocol. Their times and variability were similar to the radiologists, but more (three out of eight) students preferred the <b>jog</b> <b>wheel.</b> It may be worthwhile to introduce techniques such as the <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> to radiologists during training, and several techniques might be provided on workstations, allowing individuals to choose their preferred method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} rapid and reusable gestural interface prototypes for navigation by similarity in an audio database and for sound manipulation, using the AudioCycle application. For this purpose, we propose and follow guidelines for rapid prototyping that we apply using the PureData visual programming environment. We have mainly developed three prototypes of manual control: one combining a 3 D mouse and a <b>jog</b> <b>wheel,</b> a second featuring a force-feedback 3 D mouse, and a third {{taking advantage of the}} multitouch trackpad. We discuss benets and shortcomings we experienced while prototyping using this approach...|$|E
40|$|We attach an {{inexpensive}} pressure sensor {{to the side}} ofa personal digital assistant {{and use it as}} three input devices at once. Users can squeeze the device to provide near-continuous input to applications. At the same time the drivers interpret a sudden full squeeze as the push of a virtual button. A user’s sudden pressure release while squeezing is detected as the push ofa second virtual button. We briefly describe our hardware and signal processing techniques. The remainder ofthe writing describes an experiment that explores whether users can cope cognitively with the 3 -in- 1 control. We compare against a three-control setup consisting ofa <b>jog</b> <b>wheel</b> and two physical buttons. We show that the three-in-one control enables a 13 % faster reaction time over the three-control one, but that the three-in-one control suffers a 4 % penalty in the accuracy ofusers choosing between the two buttons in response to cues from an application. We show that a good choice ofapplication cue is more important for assuring accuracy in the 3 -in- 1 than in the more traditional set ofseparate controls. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
