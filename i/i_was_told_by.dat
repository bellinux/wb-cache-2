But the original writers were happy {{for me to}} do that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval about what happened to the song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E

It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E
500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was {{a knock at the door}} and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E

500|$|Upon his return, {{he found}} that the story {{was not going to be}} used in the current form. Gerrold later said that [...] "I was told that Gene's lawyer did not like the script and felt that this was not a good episode, and so on his advice, it seems, the script was cancelled. That's what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> someone who was in a {{position}} to know. I don't have any proof in writing, so I have to qualify it by saying someone told me." [...] Official sources stated that Paramount became involved, and that the company felt the story was inappropriate for younger viewers in the syndicated marketplace and that complaints would be received from parents. The script was given to Herbert Wright to re-write. Roddenberry gave Wright a number notes on the script, who accidentally handed over notes on the script to Gerrold which were written by Roddenberry's lawyer, Leonard Maizlish. Due to the workload on Wright at the time, Gerrold offered to make a first attempt at the re-write with the intention of removing the homosexual characters. However, after initially clearing that with Roddenberry, Wright later received a phone call from him telling Wright not to let Gerrold work on it. Shortly after, Wright received a second call from Maizlish to reinforce the message that Gerrold must not be allowed to work on the script.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, a {{teenager}} {{who went to}} the protests in front of the Queen Victoria Street Church of Scientology in London was issued a court summons after being asked to take down a sign that read [...] "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult". Posting anonymously on a forum, the teenager stated [...] "Within five minutes of arriving ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> a member of the police that I was not allowed to use 'that word'". He said that the police told him he had 15 minutes to take down the sign. The teenager did not, citing a 1984 high Court ruling by Mr Justice Latey in which he described the Church of Scientology as a [...] "cult" [...] that was [...] "corrupt, sinister and dangerous". The sign was then confiscated. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, a human rights group, said that, [...] "They will be banning words like 'war' and 'tax' from placards and demonstrations next. This is just barmy". On May 23, 2008, the legal action against the boy was dropped. A Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokesman said: [...] "In consultation with the City of London Police, we were asked whether the sign was abusive or insulting. Our advice {{is that it is not}} abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness (as opposed to criticism), neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression." [...] Anonymous also held a protest in Budapest, Hungary, in the same time and location as a program of the local Scientology church.|$|E
500|$|A {{continued}} allegation in {{the case}} has been the presence of Captain Robert Nairac at the scene. Former serving Secret Intelligence Service agent Captain Fred Holroyd, and others, suggested that Nairac had organised the attack in co-operation with Robin Jackson and the Mid-Ulster UVF. In his maiden parliamentary speech on 7 July 1987, Ken Livingstone MP told the House of Commons, [...] "it was likely" [...] that Nairac had organised the attack. Surviving band members Stephen Travers and Des McAlea told police and later testified in court that a British Army officer with a [...] "crisp, clipped English accent" [...] oversaw the Buskhill attack, the implication being that this was Nairac. In his book The Dirty War, Martin Dillon adamantly dismissed the allegation that Nairac had been present. He believed {{it was based on}} the erroneous linkage of Nairac to the earlier murder of IRA man John Francis Green in County Monaghan– the same pistol was used in both attacks. Regarding the soldier with the English accent, Dillon wrote:it is to say the least highly dubious, if not absurd to conclude from such superficial factors that Nairac was present at the Miami murders. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> a source close to [...] "Mr. A" [...] and another loyalist hitman that Nairac was not present at either murder [...] Travers had described the English-accented man as having been of normal height and thought he had fair hair, but was not certain. Travers was not able to positively identify Nairac, from his photograph, as having been the man at Buskhill. The RTÉ programme Today Tonight aired a documentary in 1987 in which it claimed that former UVF associates of Harris Boyle revealed to the programme's researchers that Nairac had deliberately detonated the bomb to eliminate Boyle, with whom he had carried out the Green killing. Journalist Emily O'Reilly noted in the Sunday Tribune that none of the three men convicted of the massacre ever implicated Nairac in the attack or accused him of causing Boyle's death.|$|E

2500|$|They {{told me that}} it {{was going}} to be a trilogy. [...] What {{happened}} was that all of the people that made Streets of Fire left Universal Studios and went to 20th Century Fox.

What I am absolutely certain of is that Robert McConnell, Robert McConnell knew that area really, really well. Robin Jackson was with him. I was later told that Nairac was with them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> ... a UVF man, he was very close to Jackson and operated with him.

But suffice it to say that Frank was in very poor health. Maybe the last ten years of his life, I saw a real decline there [...] Of course, we rekindled our friendship years later in a way that was very ultimate and very real, and it didn’t involve the band because he wasn’t in the band. He would come out here every year and stay for about a month with me, every year. He did it for years, until he died." ...|$|E

2500|$|As I chose on all {{occasions}} {{to appear as}} a Christian, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> some of them , that I {{was the only person}} they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe Christianity. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, I thought I should be able to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [...] of Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|I have {{a theory}} about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has {{lost a lot of}} weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told,</b> <b>by</b> somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>by</b> agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance." ...|$|E

60|$|The great {{difficulty}} that is complained {{of in the}} well-managed places is the floating poor, who cannot <b>be</b> excluded, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> <b>by</b> any existing law from quartering themselves where they like.
