50|$|The Society of Gilders is a {{non-profit}} educational organization {{devoted to the}} art and craft of <b>gilding.</b> The society's mission is to preserve traditional <b>gilding</b> skills and techniques, and to promote the highest standards {{in the practice of}} <b>gilding.</b>|$|R
25|$|Two <b>gilding</b> {{techniques}} were applied on the carved ornaments of the icon screen: burnished and matte <b>gilding.</b> Both methods contain about 18–60% dissolved gold. In the burnished technique {{the surface is}} polished, after the <b>gilding</b> is dry. This method results a glossier, more emphasized surface. Among others the stems of the plants, the veins of the leaves, the flower heads and the plane surfaces of the icon frames were gilt with burnished <b>gilding.</b> Matte <b>gilding</b> was applied for {{the surface of the}} leaves and generally the deeper parts of the carved ornaments.|$|R

5|$|Grasshoppers are {{sometimes}} used as symbols, as in Sir Thomas Gresham's <b>gilded</b> grasshopper in Lombard Street, London, dating from 1563; {{the building was}} for a while {{the headquarters of the}} Guardian Royal Exchange, but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust.|$|E
5000|$|Once major {{structural}} treatments {{have been}} performed and the gesso layer stabilized, {{it is necessary to}} assess the bole layer of the frame. Bole is a mixture of colored clay, glue size, and fat, which is applied on the frame as a base coat for the <b>gilding</b> [...] Typically, the bole layer, which is either red or gray, is revealed in the points of contact of the frame where the <b>gilding</b> has worn off. The color of the bole layer must be closely matched to that of the original bole, as the bole affects the overall tone of the frame.It is essential to determine which <b>gilding</b> process was used before proceeding with the in-gilding process. The two common <b>gilding</b> processes are water <b>gilding</b> and oil <b>gilding.</b> The difference in the two processes is in adhesive coating base. Water <b>gilding</b> is the traditional, more difficult method, which must be cleaned using a mineral spirit or denatured alcohol. Oil <b>gilding</b> can be cleaned with a mild water based soap solution.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical <b>gilding</b> {{includes}} all the operations in which gold leaf is prepared, and the processes to mechanically attach the gold onto surfaces. The techniques include burnishing, water <b>gilding</b> and oil-gilding used by wood carvers and gilders; and the <b>gilding</b> {{operations of the}} house decorator, sign painter, bookbinder, the paperstainer and several others.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of examinations {{in western countries}} are derived from the university examinations of the middle ages. The first universities of Europe consisted of corporations of teachers and of students analogous to the trade <b>gilds</b> and merchant <b>gilds</b> of the time. In the trade <b>gilds</b> there were apprentices, companions and masters. No one was admitted to mastership until he had served his apprenticeship, nor, as a rule, until he had shown that he could accomplish {{a piece of work}} to the satisfaction of the <b>gild.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{landmark}} {{event in}} the world of <b>gilding</b> took place at the Newark Museum in New Jersey during the winter of 1986. While attending a week-long <b>gilding</b> course hosted by the museum’s Arts Workshop, gilders met and exchanged <b>gilding</b> recipes, anecdotes, techniques and ethical concerns. The participants expressed a unanimous desire to extend this collaboration into an organization patterned after the ancient craftsmen’s guilds. Originally called the Guild of Gilders, the group changed their name to the Society of Gilders, welcoming fellow gilders and anyone interested in the art of <b>gilding</b> to join their ranks.|$|R
5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three <b>gilded</b> bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are <b>gilded</b> in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, {{said to have}} been covered with a <b>gilded</b> roof. Among those completed were the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, the Arch of Titus and the Colosseum, to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.|$|E
5|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{room in the}} suite is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room is lined with Italian <b>gilded</b> and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.|$|E
5000|$|Oundle had a grammar school, {{called the}} <b>Gild</b> School, {{since at least}} 1485. In 1499, Dame Joan Wyatt had {{purchased}} a licence to refound the <b>Gild,</b> properly authorizing its existence. It was {{to be known as}} the <b>Gild</b> or Fraternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the [...] "Gildhouse" [...] stood within the churchyard of St Peter's parish church. [...] The <b>Gild</b> was affected by the Abolition of Chantries Act and, in 1548 its assets were seized and it was taken over as a grammar school by the Commissioners for the Continuance of Schools.|$|R

5|$|The wolf head crest {{also appears}} in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is {{decorated}} with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and <b>gilded,</b> and traces of this still remain.|$|E
5|$|When {{the great}} bell rings out every full hour, {{struck by a}} large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a <b>gilded</b> figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek {{personification}} of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg, while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been <b>gilded,</b> just like the bells, since 1770.|$|E

30|$|The <b>gilding</b> {{created by}} {{traditional}} methods was fragile [33, 34]. Therefore, the <b>gilding</b> {{should not be}} frequently cleaned. Additionally, excessive heat and light should be avoided, and extreme care should be taken when installing light and heat sources near the <b>gilding</b> surfaces to avoid creating localised areas of damage. All of these effects {{have contributed to the}} different alterations that were observed in the studied medallions.|$|R
50|$|However, {{depletion}} <b>gilding</b> {{was widely}} used in antiquity. While it requires skill to execute it well, the process itself is technologically simple, and uses materials that are readily available to most ancient civilizations. Some form of depletion <b>gilding</b> {{has been used by}} nearly every culture that developed metalworking. The South American Sican culture in particular developed depletion <b>gilding</b> to a high art. Some ancient alloys, such as tumbaga, may have been developed specifically for use in depletion <b>gilding.</b> The technique was not known to be used by Anglo-Saxons until detailed examination with electron microscopes of treasures such as the Staffordshire Hoard revealed its use in the twenty-first century.|$|R
5|$|With these exceptions, {{most of the}} {{decoration}} and the fittings of the choir date from the 19thcentury and are {{in keeping with the}} Gothic Revival promoted by the Oxford Movement and Augustus Welby Pugin. The restored vault of the choir is typical of the period, having been designed by Scott and decorated and <b>gilded</b> by Clayton and Bell.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into <b>gilded</b> frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from <b>gilded</b> sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1096 and 1536, Norwich Cathedral has a Norman form, {{retaining}} {{the greater part}} of its original stone structure, which was then vaulted between 1416 and 1472 in a spectacular manner with hundreds of ornately carved, painted, and <b>gilded</b> bosses. It also has the finest Norman tower in England, surmounted by a 15th-century spire, and a large cloister with many more bosses.|$|E
25|$|Historically, gold amalgam {{was widely}} used in <b>gilding,</b> leading to {{numerous}} casualties among the workers. It is estimated that during the construction of Saint Isaac's Cathedral alone, 60 men died from the <b>gilding</b> of the main dome.|$|R
50|$|Layering {{gold leaf}} over a surface is called gold leafing or <b>gilding.</b> Traditional water <b>gilding</b> {{is the most}} {{difficult}} and highly regarded form of gold leafing. It has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years and is still done by hand.|$|R
40|$|The 1399 account {{roll of the}} Paternoster <b>Gild</b> of York, missing {{since the}} 1880 s, has {{recently}} been discovered amongst papers donated to the Borthwick Institute, University of York. These accounts, edited {{at the end of}} this paper, reveal the names of over 150 <b>gild</b> members from all over the city of York and beyond and allow them to be placed within their social context, showing members and their families receiving bequests in each other's wills, and revealing several of them as members of the later Corpus Christi <b>gild</b> at York. The accounts also demonstrate the extent of the <b>gild's</b> property ownership and give details of preparations and purchases for the elaborate <b>gild</b> feast. The <b>gild</b> was responsible for performances of the Paternoster play, and examination of the accounts allows revision of confused, earlier reports of their contents relating to the plays. It is now clear that two pageants from the play are mentioned in the accounts, supporting Johnstone's suggestion that the play was based on seven pageants, each one reflecting one of the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer, matched against one of the seven deadly sins. ...|$|R
