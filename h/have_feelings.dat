5|$|Rand {{was portrayed}} by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had {{previously}} worked with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in both The Lieutenant and a pilot for a show he created called Police Story.

It is unclear as to who suggested that her contract should be terminated, or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said he regretted it.

It transpires that Duncan is a forger, who many years ago stole a Titian painting from Goodyear and had an affair with his wife. Goodyear believes that his painting is on board the ship, and leads Gabriel to believe that Duncan was responsible for his wife's death.

25|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to convince Cassie that his claims are sincere, Azazeal kills Thelma before Cassie's eyes as a sacrifice to increase his power and prove that he is truly who he says he is.

Thelma works {{behind the scenes to}} spy on Azazeal and gather evidence from places where Cassie cannot enter. Cassie, while horrified by some of Azazeal's behaviour, ultimately finds herself drawn into his power.
