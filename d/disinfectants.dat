5|$|By 1918, the US Department of Treasury {{called for}} all {{drinking}} water to be disinfected with chlorine. Chlorine is presently an important chemical for water purification (such as in water treatment plants), in <b>disinfectants,</b> and in bleach.

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or <b>disinfectants</b> such as triclosan. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard <b>disinfectants</b> and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- In this study, the veridical {{efficacy}} of an aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet composed to calcium hypochlo-rite against {{red sea bream}} iridovirus (RBIV). A veridical efficacy was determined with the viability of RBIV contacted with the <b>disinfectant</b> in viral stock cultured in fat head minnow cell line. An aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet and RBIV were reacted on the distilled water (DW), hard water (HW) or organic matter suspension (OM) condition. On DW and HW condition, RBIV was inactivated with 25, 000 fold dilutions of an aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet. With {{the investigation of the}} antiviral effect of the <b>disinfectant</b> on OM condition, RBIV was inactivated on 22, 000 fold dilutions of an aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet. As an aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet possesses veridical efficacy against RBIV, the <b>disinfectant</b> solution can be used to limit the spread of cultured marine fish viral disease.

50|$|<b>Disinfectant</b> was {{a popular}} {{antivirus}} software program for the classic Mac OS. It was originally released as freeware by John Norstad {{in the spring of}} 1989. <b>Disinfectant</b> featured a system extension that would detect virus infections and an application with which users could scan for and remove viruses. New versions of <b>Disinfectant</b> would be subsequently released to detect additional viruses. Bob LeVitus praised and recommended <b>Disinfectant</b> in 1992. In May 1998, Norstad retired <b>Disinfectant,</b> citing the new danger posed by macro viruses, which <b>Disinfectant</b> did not detect, and the inability of a single individual to maintain a program that caught all of them.|$|R

5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, <b>disinfectants,</b> cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural <b>disinfectants</b> that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is used in}} {{numerous}} applications other than as currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware), and as an investment medium (coins and bullion) Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in catalysis of chemical reactions. Silver compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays. Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as <b>disinfectants</b> and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Vibrio spp. and Streptococcus spp. {{have caused}} a {{considerable}} disease of farmed fish and economic loss in fish farming and seafood industry. In this study, the efficacy of an aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet composed to cal-cium hypochlorite was evaluated against V. anguillarum and S. iniae. A bactericidal efficacy test by broth dilution method {{was used to determine}} the lowest effective dilution of the <b>disinfectant</b> following exposure to test bacteria for 30 min at 4 oC. An aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet and test bacteria were diluted with distilled water (DW), hard water (HW) or organic matter suspension (OM) according to treatment condition. V. anguillarum on the DW, HW and OM condi-tion was completely inactivated with 16, 000 15, 000 and 13, 000 fold dilutions of the <b>disinfectant,</b> respectively. On the DW, HW and OM condition, S. iniae was absolutely inactivated with 17, 000 16, 000 and 14, 000 fold dilutions of the <b>disinfectant,</b> respectively. As an aquatic <b>disinfectant</b> tablet possesses bactericidal efficacy against fish pathogenic bac-teria such as V. anguillarum and S. iniae this <b>disinfectant</b> solution can be used to control the spread of fish infective bacterial diseases.

40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Specialized Center of Research and Training for Advanced Life Support (NSCORT-ALS) at Purdue University, a {{complementary}} disinfection process, which uses ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the primary <b>disinfectant</b> and iodine as the secondary, residual <b>disinfectant,</b> is being developed.

Iodine, which is effective at inactivating many microorganisms and is less likely to react and form disinfection byproducts than other halogens, was selected as the residual <b>disinfectant</b> because it has the potential for dual use as an on-line UV monitor, as well as a <b>disinfectant.</b> Description: 10 page...|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{disinfection}} is the inactivation of microorganisms. This depends on: the microorganism, the <b>disinfectant</b> being used, {{the concentration}} of the <b>disinfectant,</b> the contact time, and the temperature and pH of the water.|$|R
5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and <b>disinfectants,</b> and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine <b>disinfectants</b> due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed <b>disinfectants.</b> In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E

25|$|Ultraviolet light (UV) is very {{effective}} at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, {{a result of}} the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual <b>disinfectant</b> in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual <b>disinfectant</b> after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary <b>disinfectant.</b> When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual <b>disinfectant</b> with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.|$|R
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. <b>Disinfectants</b> such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|Common {{hospital}} <b>disinfectants</b> are ineffective against C. difficile spores and, in fact, may promote spore formation, however, <b>disinfectants</b> {{containing a}} 10:1 ratio {{of water to}} bleach effectively kill the spores. Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) systems used to sterilize a patient room post-discharge {{have been shown to}} reduce infection rates and to reduce risk of infection to subsequent patients. The incidence of CDI was reduced by 53% or 42% through use of HPV. Ultraviolet cleaning devices and housekeeping staff especially dedicated to disinfecting the rooms of patients infected with C. difficile after discharge may be effective.|$|E
25|$|Facility {{management}} includes using <b>disinfectants</b> and {{ambient temperature}} to control viruses in the environment. They {{are unlikely to}} survive outside living cells {{for more than two}} weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by <b>disinfectants.</b> Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be quarantined. After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur.|$|E

40|$|Poor {{sanitation}} of food contact surfaces {{has been}} a contributing factor in food borne disease outbreaks, especially those involving Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus etc. The objectives {{of this study were}} therefore to: 1. Determine the efficiency of a <b>disinfectant</b> based on chlorine dioxide in suspension in a closed system in a dairy plant. 2. Evaluate the possibility of disinfection of working surfaces with a <b>disinfectant</b> based on chlorine dioxide. In order to determine the germicidal effect of the <b>disinfectant</b> based on chlorine dioxide by suspension test (BSEN 1276 : 1997); the following test organisms were used: Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate. The corrosive properties of the <b>disinfectant</b> based on chlorine dioxide were tested by IDF 077 : 1977 standard. The efficacy of this <b>disinfectant</b> was investigated in a closed system in a dairy plant.
