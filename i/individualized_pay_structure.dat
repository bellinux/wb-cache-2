40|$|The use {{of various}} types of <b>individualized</b> <b>pay</b> setting has {{increased}} dramatically in Sweden. In order for <b>individualized</b> <b>pay</b> to work as an incentive, the pay system has {{to be perceived as}} fair. This thesis focuses on the various subjective perceptions that arise in relation to <b>individualized</b> <b>pay</b> setting, since such perceptions may have consequences for employee attitudes and behavior. Using survey data from Swedish human service workers (Study I and II) as well as other public employees (Study III), the general aim was to shed more light on employees’ pay attitudes and fairness perceptions in connection with <b>individualized</b> <b>pay</b> setting. Study I examined some of the explanatory factors behind employee pay attitudes. The results showed that perceiving a clear connection between work results and pay, and perceiving a sound working climate, were both related to more positive attitudes towards the pay distribution process. Study II examined factors potentially associated with pay-related justice perceptions. The results demonstrated that perceptions of having sufficient feedback, proper information on pay criteria, gender equality, and lower workloads were connected with more favorable views of pay justice. Pay justice perceptions, in turn, appeared only to be marginally connected with employees’ work-related attitudes and behavior. Study III investigated whether women’s and men’s perceptions of the individualized pay-setting process differed. The results showed that both genders had a similar awareness of the organizational policies and goals. The women, however, reported much lower levels of pay-related gender equality than the men and perceived that men, overall, benefited more from <b>individualized</b> <b>pay</b> setting. In conclusion, employees’ perceptions of a well-functioning working climate, apparent links between work effort and pay, as well as perceived equal opportunities contribute to <b>individualized</b> <b>pay</b> systems being viewed as more fair...|$|R
40|$|With {{the cost}} of {{healthcare}} rising in the United States, policy makers and hospital management {{are trying to find}} ways to reduce costs associated with the provision and consumption of healthcare. One way to maintain costs within the hospital is examining physician pay. Financial incentives drive physician behavior and can affect {{the cost of}} care provided. Specifically, research has been done on the effects and differences between fee-for-service and the capitation method. The research found that different <b>pay</b> <b>structure</b> has different effects on physician behavior and implications on the cost of care given. However, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence on physicians with no prior exposure to either compensation method. This thesis intends in investigate how costs are affected by fee-for-service and the capitation method on medical students. It addresses the lack of research on the effects of different <b>pay</b> <b>structures</b> on physicians with no prior experience with <b>pay</b> <b>structure.</b> A survey given to medical students at the University of Minnesota evaluated the effects of different <b>pay</b> <b>structures</b> on the cost of care given. Results showed that the <b>pay</b> <b>structure</b> given to the participant significantly influenced the participant’s decisions in choosing a treatment option. Specifically, participants under capitation significantly preferred the lower cost treatment relative to participants under FFS, who preferred the higher cost treatment.

However, when absolute and relative pay levels are jointly considered, only the latter displays a significant impact.

The evidence suggests that external labour market conditions are less important than internal <b>pay</b> <b>structures</b> in determining hiring pay, with internal <b>pay</b> <b>structures</b> binding even more often when there is labour market slack. When explaining their choice ﬁrms allude to fairness considerations and the need to prevent a potential negative impact on effort.

40|$|A fair <b>pay</b> <b>structure</b> is an {{essential}} element of the personnel policy of a firm. If the <b>pay</b> <b>structure</b> is perceived as arbitrary by the members of the staff, it becomes a cause of disturbance of the labor relations. Particularly, a <b>pay</b> <b>structure</b> is unfair if it discriminates against women. Job evaluation is a traditional tool used by companies to assist in the process of determining <b>pay</b> <b>structures</b> that can be also useful to detect and combat wage discrimination, since allow determining whether two jobs are of comparable worth or not. Although there are many kinds of systems, authors agree when defining point factor methods as the most appropriate and fair job evaluation systems. However, even being well defined from a technical point of view, most existing systems give discriminatory results regarding to gender. ISOS, a new job evaluation system which is described in this paper, has been designed, with the aim to define a neutral system with regard to gender, based on present jobs characteristics, existing job evaluation systems and job description questionnaires, international experts’ knowledge and a wide body of literature on gender discrimination and its relation with job evaluation. Using ISOS can contribute to detect, combat and eliminate part of the existing wage discrimination in general and, in particular, against women. ISOS includes all aspects of the work so no characteristics are omitted. The system can be applied in any company and to evaluate any job, and offers flexibility to be adapted to the specific characteristics of an organization. ISOS {{can also be used to}} detect and combat wage discrimination. Furthermore, characteristics of present jobs, such as cross-training or flexible working time, are also included so the system can be considered innovative in a very traditional field of industrial engineering...|$|R

At the country level we distinguish between cultural and institutional (labor regulation institutions) influences. At the firm level, we distinguish firms that view HR as strategically important and firms that are foreign-owned. On the one hand, our findings indicate that both cultural and institutional effects at country level significantly influence the adoption of I-PFP. On the other hand, senior managers’ agency counts. We find the effect of labor regulation on I-PFP to be mediated by its effects on labor union influence and we find the effects of culture on I-PFP to be entirely mediated by labor regulation and (country level) union influence...|$|R
