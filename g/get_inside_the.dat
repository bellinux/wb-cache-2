5|$|In 1983, Wizard Video, who {{had also}} {{released}} a video game version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, released a Halloween game for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player was a babysitter who had to protect her children from Michael Myers, who had managed to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> house. Although the game was called Halloween, and featured the film's theatrical poster as its cover art {{as well as the}} movie's main music theme, the game itself never refers to any characters, including the killer, by their names in the film.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to <b>get</b> <b>inside.</b> <b>The</b> SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> head of each suspect.|$|E

25|$|The last {{successful}} title {{defense for}} Dempsey was in September 1923 at New York City's Polo Grounds in Dempsey vs. Firpo. Attendance was 85,000, with another 20,000 trying to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> arena. Firpo was knocked down repeatedly by Dempsey, yet continued to battle back, even knocking Dempsey down twice. On the second occasion he was floored, Dempsey flew head-first through the ring ropes, landing on a ringside reporter's typewriter. At this point {{he was out}} of the ring for approximately 14 seconds, less than the 20 second rule for out-of-ring knockouts. Ultimately, Dempsey beat Argentinian contender Luis Ángel Firpo with a second-round KO. The fight was transmitted live by radio to Buenos Aires.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} year or so the squatters multiplied, as did the {{tensions}} between them and the authorities. On March 6, 1982 the first seriously violent confrontation between squatters and police took place. Earlier that day, about 90 people had illegally occupied an old building. When the police moved in for the eviction, several of the squatters were wearing bandannas and ski masks to hide their faces. The police tried to break down the door, but their first assault was forced back by a bombardment of bricks and other building materials. They regrouped and brought in an armored car and industrial saw. When they did manage to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> building, they severely beat several of their opponents.|$|E
25|$|Lagun Ein {{was not yet}} off the hook. The king {{assigned}} him to lead {{another attempt}} on Minkhaung. Lagun Ein led a team of 12 commandos to infiltrate the Ava camp. The team made it inside the camp from the lightly guarded north side. He and five men managed to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Ava king's quarters. But the plan was foiled when a concubine of Minkhaung saw them and screamed. She was killed but the king escaped. Lagun Ein and his men took Minkhaung's ruby-studded royal sword and gold-plated betel nut chest. They barely escaped. When they got back, Saw Pyei Chantha, Minkhaung's daughter who had been captured in early 1408 and put in Razadarit's harem, identified that the sword and the chest were her father's. Although the second attempt did not succeed, Razadarit forgave Lagun Ein, and let him live.|$|E

25|$|Reed's first {{investigation}} is the Magdalena Cartel, {{believed to be}} responsible for 75% of New York's cocaine trade. Higgins had made contact with socialite and philanthropist Teresa Castillo (Socorro Santiago), who he believed may be able to help him <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> cartel. She gives Reed information leading him to the Magdalena safe house, where he chases down their leader, Rey (Paolo Andino). However, Rey turns out to be head of the Latin Lords, the main rival of the Magdalena Cartel; the Cartel was using Reed to take out their competition. Reed discovers Teresa's real name is Magdalena Rojas, and she runs the cartel. He arrests her, but she tells him she doesn't know who the mole is, only that as their information was always accurate, she knows it is someone high up in the OCU.|$|E
25|$|Patrol vessel No.123 {{arrived at}} the scene near 9:30a.m. as the first ship to reach the site after the incident. During the time between the {{dispatch}} and the operations, members failed to raise Sewol, and chose to call for other ships on the radio. Consequently, members on the vessel had not directly communicated with Sewol, and {{were not aware of}} the content of the communication between Sewol and the Jindo VTS on arrival. At the time of arrival, Sewol had listed about 50 to 60 degrees to port. When the vessel arrived, members made announcements for five minutes, calling people to abandon ship and jump into the water. The vessel began rescue operations at 9:38a.m., with the dispatching of a rubber boat. Passengers who had reached the deck or jumped into the water were rescued, including the captain, but rescue members could not <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> ship due to the list.

25|$|The storyline {{dispute between}} Último Guerrero and Rey Escorpión {{that led to}} that week's main event was very evident even before the match {{actually}} started. Guerrero entered the ring first, then attacked Rey Escorpión {{while he was still}} on the floor, before the bell rang. Guerrero dove out of the ring and knocked Escorpión down, not once but three times in a row, inflicting enough damage that Rey Escorpión was not able to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> ring before the referee counted to 20, giving Último Guerrero the first fall by count out. Once Escorpión recovered he was able to fight back in the second round, he fought back against Guerrero, even {{going so far as to}} tearing at Guerrero's mask using his teeth. Escorpión gained a measure of revenge on Guerrero when he applied Último Guerrero's own Pulpo Guerrero ("The Guerrero Octopus") to Guerrero and forced him to submit, tying the match at one fall each. During the third fall Rey Escorpión team mate Dragón Rojo, Jr. came to ringside to distract the referee.|$|E

25|$|After 23:00, {{a smaller}} {{group of the}} demonstrators tried {{to get into the}} Magyar Televízió public {{television}} building at Szabadság Tér (Liberty Square) to announce their demands on air. After they were not allowed to enter, a smaller group attacked the police forces. The riot police units which were intended to secure the building and the perimeter were ordered to disperse the crowd with tear gas and a water cannon. They blocked the main entrances but were unable to stop the attackers who could <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> building. Some demonstrators became indignant at the authorities' resistance and were later joined by a group of enraged football ultras. A hardcore subgroup of them started to make repeated assaults in order to penetrate the defences and break into the building. The police retaliated, using tear gas and a water cannon. The crowd became enraged and attacked the police units by throwing cobblestones and debris (injuring 141 police officers), but they didn't attack the two drivers of the water cannon mobil. They also set several parked cars ablaze (which led to part of the building catching fire too) and eventually managed to enter the building, forcing the police back.|$|E

After all, sense equipment is the same in men and women of all ages, and though each age inflects its sense usages uniquely, there should remain an underlying continuity among sensibilities.

500|$|Michigan's defense {{held the}} Penn State to 169 yards of total offense (68 passing yards and 101 rushing yards), Penn State's lowest total since 1987.

Penn State did not <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Michigan 40-yard line in the first 52 minutes of the game. [...] Woodson helped contain Penn State's leading receiver, Joe Jurevicius to 20 receiving yards.

Through the first nine games, Michigan's defense allowed an average of 198.7 yards per game, the lowest among major college teams since the national champion 1992 Alabama team gave up 194.2 yards per game. However, Penn State scored the first fourth-quarter points and the first second-half touchdown that Michigan had surrendered all season.|$|E

Three years later, in another Billboard article ("Lady Gaga's Top 10 Most Daring Songs"), Dan Weiss called [...] "Aura" [...] the singer's [...] "boldest moment particularly as an album opener ... a dizzying roller coaster ride of a tune and its presumed intent—to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> head of a woman from a completely different walk of life and find a kindred spirit in sexual repression—is not without merit". Helen Brown of the Daily Telegraph called [...] "Aura" [...] the most interesting track on Artpop, commending its Middle-Eastern production, Gaga's characteristically-repeated syllables and the song's [...] "clever sonic shapeshifting".

500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some {{of the film is}} trying to be through Ed a little bit.

[...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|In early February 1904, the Japanese Navy {{launched}} a surprise {{attack on the}} Russian fleet at Port Arthur. Sevastopol was hit by one shell, either [...] or [...] in diameter, that wounded two men on her bridge. She soon turned in pursuit along with other ships of the Russian fleet, all firing their forward guns, but she failed to score any hits. On 26 March 1904, Sevastopol was accidentally rammed by , damaging a propeller. After the attack on Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron tried to break out several times. During one attempt on 23 June, Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, commanding the Pacific Fleet, retreated after encountering the Japanese fleet. Approaching the harbor, Sevastopol moved slightly out of formation and hit a mine that killed 11 and caused severe flooding, but managed to <b>get</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> harbor and drop anchor. She was under repair for six weeks, during which time a fire broke out on deck, killing two and wounding 28. The Russian battleships were too big {{to fit into the}} dry dock at Port Arthur, so large caissons were built to provide access to the ships' hulls. On 9 August, with the Japanese Third Army assaulting the outer defenses of Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron sortied from its base.
