40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the legislation that}} regulates the Romanian unit-linked life insurance market. The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no. 32 / 2000 on insurance undertakings and insurance supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and reinsurance undertakings, of mutual undertakings, {{as well as of}} insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive, 2002 / 83 /EC, unit-linked life insurance products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the <b>insurance</b> <b>undertaking,</b> usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the insurance undertaking's entire business, of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical provisions, including mathematical provisions, and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the home Member State pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every <b>insurance</b> <b>undertaking</b> whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all life insurance products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance products and the one regarding traditional life insurance products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts...|$|E

Since 1990, when the law on insurance activity was passed, the number of insurance companies has increased considerably. The quick adoption of the above-mentioned law {{was related to the}} system transformation and an urgent need to adjust that sector of the economy to the standards applicable in capitalist countries. The unification of the law and adoption of international insurance conventions have stimulated the growth of that sector. The offer of insurance companies has been extended to include new and better services, ranging from basic vehicle or property insurance to complicated financial insurance. A broadly conceived insurance market consists of two basic components, i. e. insurers who represent the supply of insurance coverage and policyholders, or persons with a property interest, who represent demand.

The development of capacity in mortgage lending and securitization in the private sector does suggest, however, that federally subsidizing mortgage market activities can be restrained with little effect on homeownership- the principal goal of this federal activity. In particular, the orderly reduction in the mortgage investment activities of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and the imposition of guarantee fees on mortgage-backed securities insured by the GSEs are first steps in restraining federal activity. More generally, a concentration of FHA and GSE activity on first-time homebuyers would reduce federal risk exposure while preserving the economic rationale for government activity...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying flood hazard is an {{essential}} component of resilience planning, emergency response, and mitigation, including <b>insurance.</b> Traditionally <b>undertaken</b> at catchment and national scales, recently, efforts have intensified to estimate flood risk globally to better allow consistent and equitable decision making. Global flood hazard models are now a practical reality, thanks to improvements in numerical algorithms, global datasets, computing power, and coupled modelling frameworks. Outputs of these models are vital for consistent quantification of global flood risk and in projecting the impacts of climate change. However, the urgency of these tasks means that outputs are being used as soon as they are made available and before such methods have been adequately tested. To address this, we compare multi-probability flood hazard maps for Africa from six global models and show wide variation in their flood hazard, economic loss and exposed population estimates, which has serious implications for model credibility. While there is around 30 - 40 % agreement in flood extent, our results show that even at continental scales, there are significant differences in hazard magnitude and spatial pattern between models, notably in deltas, arid/semi-arid zones and wetlands. This study is an important step towards a better understanding of modelling global flood hazard, which is urgently required for both current risk and climate change projections...|$|R
