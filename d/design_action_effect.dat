40|$|In EN 1990, in {{persistent}} and transient <b>design</b> situations, <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> should be derived according to three {{different sets of}} combinations of actions: expressions 6. 10 or, alternatively, the most adverse between expressions 6. 10 a and 6. 10 b or the most adverse between expressions 6. 10 a modified and 6. 10 b, being the choice among the three different sets left to the National annex. As the three formulations are not equivalent in terms of structural reliability, the reliability indexes associated which each of them in some simple, but very clear, case studies, have been determined, highlighting the differences and their significance. For each case, and for various ratios between the variable and permanent loads, {{the resistance of the}} considered structural member has been set equal to the capacity required by each set of combination of actions considered and the reliability indexes have been determined considering real load combination fitted in turn by one if the alternative sets of expressions, {{in such a way that}} the comparison focuses only on the reliability variations induced by combination rules. Results show that the target reliability level indicated in EN 1990 is commonly reached using expression 6. 10, while expressions 6. 10 a and 6. 10 b can lead to lower values, especially when the bias of resistance’s distribution is small, the C. O. V. of the resistance is high and the real distribution is fitted by [6. 10]. In the authors’ opinion expressions 6. 10 a modified and 6. 10 b are not to be adopted, leading in some cases to significant reduction of the reliability indexes...|$|R

In the present study, we examined {{the question of whether}} <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> play a role in cued task switching. In our study, the participants practiced task-response-effect mappings in an acquisition phase, in which <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> occur after a response in a certain task context. In the ensuing transfer phase, the previously practiced mappings were changed in a random, unpredictable task-response-effect mapping. When changed into unpredictable <b>action</b> <b>effects,</b> RT as well as switch costs increased, but this occurred mainly in trials with short preparation time and not with long preparation time. Moreover, switch costs were generally smaller with predictable <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> than with unpredictable <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> This suggests that anticipated task-specific <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> help to activate the relevant task set before task execution when the task is not yet already prepared based on the cue...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that we can pick up <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations when acting in a free-choice intentional mode. However, it is less clear whether and when <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations are learnt and actually affect behavior if we are acting in a forced-choice mode, applying a specific stimulus-response (S-R) rule. In the present study, we investigated whether response selection difficulty imposed by S-R rules influences the initial rapid learning and the behavioral expression of previously learnt but weakly practiced <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations when those are re-activated by effect exposure. Experiment 1 showed that the rapid acquisition of <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations is not directly influenced by response selection difficulty. By contrast, the behavioral expression of re-activated <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations is prevented when actions are directly activated by highly over-learnt response cues and thus response selection difficulty is low. However, all three experiments showed that if response selection difficulty is sufficiently high during re-activation, the same <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations do influence behavior. Experiment 2 and 3 revealed {{that the effect of}} response selection difficulty cannot be fully reduced to giving <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> more time to prime an action, but seems to reflect competition during response selection. Finally, the present data suggest that when multiple novel rules are rapidly learnt in succession, which requires a lot of flexibility, <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations continue to influence behavior only if response selection difficulty is sufficiently high. Thus, response selection difficulty might modulate the impact of experiencing multiple learning episodes on <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> expression and learning, possibly via inducing different strategies...|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{attenuation}} {{of voluntary}} <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> {{has been widely}} reported in both somatosensory and auditory domains. However, relatively little {{research has focused on}} physiological measures of sensory attenuation of visual <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> One previous study found, perhaps surprisingly, that both auditory and visual sensory attenuation were manifested as decreased ERP amplitude over the vertex. The present study aimed to extend these findings using a novel paradigm in which voluntary actions were either associated with a visual <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> or to no effect. Crucially, this allowed us to explore both sensory attenuation (by comparing ERPs to action-triggered versus externally triggered stimuli) and <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> prediction (by comparing actions that triggered a stimulus with actions that did not). With regard to sensory attenuation, we found that attenuation of cortical responses to visual <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> was manifested in a reduced activation of a frontoparietal network, from 150 ms after stimulus. Differences between actions that produced an effect and those that did not were observed in lateralized motor potentials and may reflect the cortical correlates of the <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> prediction. We also observed a re-activation of lateralized motor activity following onset of the <b>action</b> <b>effect,</b> suggesting a common representation of <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> in visual and motor cortices. Taken together, these findings help to elucidate the cortical mechanisms of voluntary action as well as their sensory consequences and inform how our interaction with the external world is processed and controlled. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{embodied}} {{approaches to}} language comprehension {{suggests that we}} understand linguistic descriptions of actions by mentally simulating these actions. Evidence {{is provided by the}} action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE) which shows that sensibility judgments for sentences are faster when the direction of the described action matches the response direction. In two experiments, we investigated whether the ACE relies on actions or on intended <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> Participants gave sensibility judgments of auditorily presented sentences by producing an <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> on a screen at a location near the body or far from the body. These <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> were achieved by pressing a response button that was located in either the same spatial direction as the <b>action</b> <b>effect,</b> or in the opposite direction. We used a go/no-go task in which the direction of the to-be-produced <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> was either cued at the onset of each sentence (Experiment 1) or at different points in time before and after sentence onset (Experiment 2). Overall, results showed a relationship between the direction of the described action and the direction of the <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> Furthermore, Experiment 2 indicated that depending on the timing between cue presentation and sentence onset, participants responded either faster when the direction of the described action matched the direction of the <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> (positive ACE), or slower (negative ACE). These results provide evidence that the comprehension of action sentences involves the activation of representations of <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> Concurrently activated representations in sentence comprehension and action planning can lead to both priming and interference, which is discussed {{in the context of the}} theory of event coding...|$|R

40|$|Voluntary {{actions are}} thought to be {{selected}} with respect to their intended goal. Converging data suggests that medial frontal cortex plays a crucial role in linking actions to their predicted effects. Recent neuroimaging data also suggests that during action selection, the brain pre-activities the representation of the predicted <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> We review evidence of <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> prediction, both in terms of its neurophysiological basis as well as its functional consequences. By assuming that action preparation includes activation of the predicted sensory consequences of the action, we provide a mechanism to understand sensory attenuation and intentional binding. In this account, sensory attenuation results from more difficult discrimination between the observed <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> and the pre-activation of the predicted effect, as compared to when no (or incorrect) prediction is present. Similarly, a predicted <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> should also reach the threshold of awareness faster (intentional binding), if its perceptual representation is pre-activated. By comparing this potential mechanism to mental imagery and repetition suppression we propose a possible neural basis for the processing of predicted <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In {{everyday}} {{cases of}} tool use, proximal <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e. operating {{the navigation system}} of vehicle via a multi-functional control button) and distal <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e. resulting effects on the medium´s display) often diverge or are even conflicting. In other words, the human information processing system is often confronted with more or less distinct <b>action</b> <b>effects,</b> like bodily related consequences of manual actions vs. medium related <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> Nevertheless - referring to the navigation system example - {{in some cases the}} destination selection process seems to operate flawlessly, whereas in some cases it does not. Due to this phenomenon the question on how the human information processing system solves these kinds of scenarios may arise. According to theories of common coding, the present work considers proprioceptive as well as visual information to be represented within a common cognitive domain. It is assumed that both sources of information interact on this domain. The following sections provide a brief overview of the studies comprised in this dissertation. Experiments reported in study 1 examine the role of proximal and distal <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> in a closed loop task of sensorimotor control. Particularly interesting in this study is the introduction of different gain factors that systematically perturb the relation between covert hand movements on a digitizer tablet and resulting cursor movements on a screen. This scenario comes along with a second perturbation in the form of rotated visual feedback. Results were discussed with respect to theories of common coding and against the background of beneficial or detrimental effects of feature overlap. For instance, when participants are asked to replicate an initial hand movement without visual feedback, hand amplitudes vary in accordance with predecessing display amplitudes. Adding a second perturbation (Experiment 1 (2) : 90 ° (180 °) rotation of visual feedback) reduces these aftereffects only when the discrepancy between hand and display movement is obvious. In summary, distal <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> do assimilate proximal <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> when the proprioceptive/tactile feedback show feature overlap with former presented visual feedback on the display. Since the first study examines the effects of perturbed visual <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> on proximal <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> by employing a motor replication task, experiments reported in study 2 attempt to assess the inverse question by introducing conditions containing a motor replication task {{on the one hand and}} a visual replication task on the other hand. Herein, ask about intra- and inter-modal recall of either proprioceptive or visual information, and whether there are any differences between proximal and distal <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> At first, mechanisms of information processing seem to depend on the output modality. That is, both, proprioceptive and visual <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> interfere with the motor modality whilst visual but not proprioceptive <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> exhibit effects on the visual modality. Second, however, inter-modal information processing shows higher susceptibility to interference, which seems to depend on the output modality. In a nutshell, the results provide useful implications for tool use, since the optimized processing of conflicting <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> is a precondition for successful tool use. This work generally aims at extending the present body of research on multimodal information processing in tool use by referring to a working model which will guide through this thesis and practically illustrate complex coherencies in the field of multimodal information processing...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{acquisition}} of <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations {{may serve as}} a parsimonious account of how people acquire the basis for intentionally controlled action. However, recent research suggests that learning or the expression of <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> links might depend on whether task demands impose either a stimulus based mode of action control or an intention based action control mode. In the current study we develop a paradigm that allows the mode of action control to be varied via instructions while keeping stimuli identical. Participants were to respond to the location of a cloud of dots. Their actions were followed by predictable visual effects, either consistently congruent or incongruent with the location of the action. In Experiment 1, a displaced new cloud of random dots was presented as a spatial <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> In Experiment 2 an arrow was presented as effect with a pointing direction congruent or incongruent to the response position. The location of the stimulus in the reference frame was easy to detect in some of the trials while the location of the cloud of dots was completely ambiguous in others. The instruction manipulation targeted the latter trials, suggesting to one group of participants to freely choose a key in a difficult trial, while asking another group to react to their spontaneous impression {{in the event of a}} difficult stimulus. In this way, we aimed at rendering actions either as stimulus driven or internally generated. By this we could investigate how effect anticipation changed with practice depending on action mode. We employed the impact of <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> compatibility on speed and choice of action as a measure for <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> anticipation. Our results suggest that <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> associations can be acquired when instructions suggest stimulus based action control or intention based action control.

40|$|The {{implications}} of an ideomotor approach to action control were investigated. In Experiment 1, participants made manual responses to letter stimuli {{and they were}} presented with response-contingent color patches, i. e., colored <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> This rendered stimuli of {{the same color as}} an action's effect effective primes of that action, suggesting that bilateral associations were created between <b>actions</b> and the <b>effects</b> they produced. Experiment 2 combined this set-up with a manual Stroop task, i. e., participants responded to congruent, neutral, or incongruent color-word compounds. Standard Stroop effects were observed in a control group without <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> and in a group with target-incompatible <b>action</b> <b>effects,</b> but the reaction time Stroop effect was eliminated if actions produced target-compatible color effects (e. g., blue word fi left key fi blue patch). Experiment 3 did not replicate this interaction between target-effect compatibility and color-word congruency with color words as <b>action</b> <b>effects,</b> which rules out semantically based accounts. Theoretical implications for both action-effect acquisition and the Stroop effect are discussed. It is suggested that learning <b>action</b> <b>effects,</b> the features of which overlap with the target, allows and motivates people to recode their actions in ways that make them more stimulus-compatible. This provides a processing shortcut for translating the relevant stimulus into the correct response and, thus, shields processing from the impact of competing word distractors...|$|R
40|$|The Simon effect {{refers to}} an {{advantage}} when a stimulus 2 ̆ 7 spatial location corresponds to that of its response, even though stimulus location is irrelevant to the task. The Simon effect is typically attributed to spatial coding of the stimuli and responses. It is assumed that a stimulus automatically activates its spatially corresponding response, with this activation facilitating responding when that response is correct and interfering when it is not. Though the instructed <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> is usually produced {{in response to a}} stimulus, multiple irrelevant/unintended <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> associated with other response features may be activated as well, and the spatial codes of these actions can be in opposition. ^ Five experiments were conducted to investigate how irrelevant <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> influence response selection with a wheel in an auditory Simon task. Experiment 1 showed that a cursor triggered by the wheel response did not yield an overall Simon effect even with instructions emphasizing the cursor. Experiment 2 indicated that experience with a controlled cursor yielded an overall Simon effect even when the cursor was triggered by the wheel response, suggesting that subjects coded their responses in terms of cursor movement. A combined <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> hypothesis was proposed to account for the size change of the Simon effect with an opposite <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> ^ Experiments 3, 4, and 5 were designed to test the hypothesis that the combined result of the <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> (relevant hand-movement and irrelevant cursor-movement) determines the direction {{and the size of the}} Simon effect. In Experiment 3, all six sequences of three display conditions were used, and a carryover effect from the controlled cursor to the triggered cursor was found. Thus, a sequence with increasing cursor involvement (no-cursor, triggered-cursor, and controlled-cursor) was selected for Experiments 4 and 5. The Simon effect was reduced in both experiments when there was a conflicting <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> In Experiment 4, the reduction was due in part to individual differences in response-selection strategy. However, in Experiment 5, the reduction was due to the combination of conflicting <b>action</b> <b>effects,</b> supporting the hypothesis that this combination determines the direction and size of the Simon effect. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In adults, the {{selection}} and the planning of actions {{are influenced by the}} anticipation of desired <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> However, the role of <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> for <b>action</b> control in infants is still an unresolved issue. One important prerequisite for infants action control is that infants are able to relate certain movements to certain effects. To test this assumption, it was investigated how infants action control is affected by <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> By applying an imitation paradigm, we studied 12 - and 18 -month-old infants who first observed an adult experi-menter demonstrating a three-step action sequence on a toy bear. In three experimental groups, the second ac-tion step, the third action step, or no action step elicited an arbitrary sound as an additional acoustic action ef-fect. It was coded how often each of the target actions was performed by the infant in a subsequent 90 -s test phase. As predicted, the frequency of the infants target action varied depending on which action step elicited the <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> In both age groups, the target action that was combined with an acoustical effect was not only produced more often but also occurred with lower la-tency and was in most cases the first target action shown by the infants. These results are interpreted as evidence of the important role of <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> in infants <b>action</b> control...|$|R
40|$|Interpersonal action {{coordination}} {{relies on}} an information channel between co-actors. Previous {{studies have shown}} that offline or online visual, auditory, and haptic information can facilitate joint action. However, most previous studies only investigated the information that is naturally meaningful in the task context. Few explanations have been given about the underlying mechanism of this facilitation effect. The current study was designed to investigate what makes the information useful in improving joint action performance. I argued that externally added information (<b>action</b> <b>effects)</b> can also facilitate joint action. According to the Theory of Event Coding (TEC), once the association between an <b>action</b> and its <b>effects</b> are built, <b>action</b> control can be achieved by effects control. Thus, by adding external <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> in joint <b>action,</b> co-actors are able to perceive the action and intention of each other and coordinate their action accordingly. In the current study, the utility of a color <b>action</b> <b>effect</b> in a joint movement control task was tested. An association test was used to examine the hypothesis of TEC. The results, for the first time, revealed that <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> are coded in dynamical, flexible forms in action concept...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates a {{two-stage}} {{model of}} infants' imitative learning from observed <b>actions</b> and their <b>effects.</b> According to this model, {{the observation of}} another person's action activates the corresponding motor code in the infants motor repertoire (i. e. leads to motor resonance). The second process guiding imitative behavior results from the observed <b>action</b> <b>effects.</b> If the modeled action {{is followed by a}} salient <b>action</b> <b>effect,</b> the representation of this effect (i. e. perceptual code) will be associated with the activated motor code. If the infant later aims to obtain the same effect, the corresponding motor program will be activated and the model's action will therefore be imitated. Accordingly, the model assumes that for the imitation of novel actions the modeled action needs to elicit sufficient motor resonance and must be followed by a salient <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> Using the head touch imitation paradigm, we tested these two assumptions derived from the model. To this end, we manipulated whether the actions demonstrated to the infants were or were not in the motor repertoire, i. e. elicited stronger or less strong motor resonance, and whether they were followed by salient <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> or not. The results were in line with the proposed two-stage model of infants' imitative learning and suggest that motor resonance is necessary, but not sufficient for infants' imitative learning from others' <b>actions</b> and their <b>effects...</b>|$|R

We used a probabilistic learning task and ERP analyses to compare the processing of explicit, performance-related feedback with the processing of task-irrelevant response-contingent stimuli.

Interestingly, low-probability but task-irrelevant <b>action</b> <b>effects</b> elicited a signal similar to the NFB, {{even though it had}} a shorter duration.

40|$|Summary. The Simon effect {{indicates}} that choice reac-tions {{can be performed}} more quickly if the response corre-sponds spatially to the stimulus- even when stimulus location is irrelevant to the task. Two experiments tested an intentional approach to the Simon effect that assigns a critical role to the cognitively represented action goal (i. e., the intended <b>action</b> <b>effect).</b> It was assumed that the direc-tion of the Simon effect depends on stimulus-goal corre-spondence, that is, that responses are faster with spatial correspondence of stimulus and intended <b>action</b> <b>effect.</b> Ex-periment 1 confirmed that {{the direction of the}} Simon effect was determined by spatial correspondence of stimulus and intended <b>action</b> <b>effect,</b> the latter having been manipulated by different instructions. Experiment 2 indicated that ef-fects of correspondences unrelated to the action goal (i. e., stimulus to hand location or to anatomical mapping of the hand), contributed additively to the resulting Simon effect.
