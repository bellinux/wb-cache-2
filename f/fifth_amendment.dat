5|$|In {{response}} to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees {{chose to use}} the <b>fifth</b> <b>amendment</b> protection against self-incrimination to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs. Government agencies and private organizations, in response, established polices which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked the <b>fifth</b> <b>amendment.</b> The national ACLU was divided on whether to defend employees who had been fired merely for pleading the <b>fifth</b> <b>amendment,</b> but the New York affiliate successfully assisted teacher Harry Slochower in his Supreme Court case which reversed his termination.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> {{right to}} counsel {{attaches}} upon invocation (i.e., when an attorney is requested). The Sixth Amendment's right to counsel attaches when adversarial proceedings begin (i.e., at the arraignment). The presumption in Jackson attempted to analogize the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> right against self-incrimination through Edwards v. Arizona to the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel, essentially not allowing police interrogation after the right attached. Under Montejo, {{in the case}} where the Defendant has not asserted his <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> right to counsel but rather relies on his Sixth Amendment's right to counsel, police may reinitiate interrogation after his Miranda rights have been read. However, if a Defendant has asserted his <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> right to counsel and adversarial proceedings have begun, police may not reinitiate questioning without counsel present and waiver under Edwards, or unless the Defendant initiates the conversation and police get a waiver.|$|R

5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966. In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, as well as his <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> privilege against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment.</b> Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E
5|$|According to Prof. Whittington, Cantril was {{the first}} {{challenge}} to a federal statute under the Due Process Clause of the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> to be considered by the Court. In later cases, the Court has noted the several possible holdings {{that could have been}} intended in Cantril.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Liliʻuokalani {{brought an}} {{unsuccessful}} {{lawsuit against the}} United States under the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> seeking {{the return of the}} Hawaiian Crown Lands. The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her. In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands were not necessarily the private possession of the monarch in the strictest sense of the term.|$|E
5|$|In its 1969 Leary v. United States {{decision}} the Supreme Court {{held the}} Marijuana Tax Act to be unconstitutional, since it violated the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> privilege against self-incrimination. In response, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which repealed the Marijuana Tax Act.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the Constitution of 1906, {{the lion}} and sun motif in {{the flag of}} Iran was {{described}} as a passant lion that holds a saber in its paw and with the sun in its background.

5|$|The ACLU {{has also}} criticized {{targeted}} killings of American citizens who {{fight against the}} United States. In 2011 the ACLU criticized the killing of radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki {{on the basis that}} it was a violation of his <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> right to not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{protects against}} double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain. The amendment {{was the basis for}} the court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which established that defendants must be informed of their rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double Jeopardy Clause of the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E

2500|$|In the Salinas case, justices Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy {{held that}} [...] "the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> {{privilege}} against self-incrimination {{does not extend}} to defendants who simply decide to remain mute during questioning. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection." ...|$|R
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Constitution's <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The clause {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury Clause of the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> and (possibly) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E
50|$|Justice Reed {{based his}} {{decision}}, in part, on the Court's 1937 decision in Palko v.

5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions {{are contained in}} the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|Schmerber v. California, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> privilege against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body. Until Schmerber, the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects. Likewise, the Court had not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against the wishes of a criminal suspect may be used against that suspect {{in the course of a}} criminal prosecution.|$|E
5000|$|TWR {{brought their}} initial {{challenge}} before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the United States. TWR challenged the prohibition against substantial lobbying as violative of the First Amendment and {{the equal protection}} component of the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> due process clause, and sought declaratory judgment that it qualified for the exemption granted by § 501(c)(3), claiming that § 501(c)(3)'s prohibition against substantial lobbying is unconstitutional under the First Amendment by imposing an [...] "unconstitutional burden" [...] on the receipt of tax-deductible contributions, and is also unconstitutional under the equal protection component of the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Due Process Clause because the Code permits taxpayers to deduct contributions to veterans' organizations that qualify for tax exemption under § 501(c)(19).|$|R
50|$|The Court {{only had}} the issue before it of whether government-induced {{temporary}} flooding was categorically exempt from {{the scope of the}} <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Takings Clause. In a unanimous, eight-justice opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court ruled that there was no basis in its Takings Clause jurisprudence for such an exemption.|$|R
50|$|Although the Court {{held that}} {{evidence}} obtained {{in violation of}} substantive due process must be excluded in criminal prosecutions, the court declined to incorporate a broad exclusionary rule for all constitutional violations. Likewise, the Court left unanswered {{the question of whether}} evidence obtained through involuntary blood samples violates the <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> privilege against self incrimination.|$|R
