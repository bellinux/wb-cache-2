25|$|A few donkeys are milked or {{raised for}} meat; in Italy, {{which has the}} highest {{consumption}} of equine meat in Europe and where <b>donkey</b> <b>meat</b> is the main ingredient of several regional dishes, about 1000 donkeys were slaughtered in 2010, yielding approximately 100 tonnes of meat. Asses' milk may command good prices: the average price in Italy in 2009 was €15 per litre, and a price of €6 per 100 ml was reported from Croatia in 2008; it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes. The niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding. In the past, donkey skin {{was used in the}} production of parchment. In 2017, the UK based charity The Donkey Sanctuary estimates that 1.8 million skins were traded every year, but the demand could be as high as 10 million.|$|E

40|$|The PCR {{method has}} become a crucial tool for the {{identification}} of meats of different animal species {{in recent years and}} came into prominence as an alternative method that can replace the existing methods. In this study, a specific PCR method has been developed for identification of horse, <b>donkey</b> and porcine <b>meats</b> in a traditional, dry-fermented Turkish sausage, sucuk. For this purpose, sucuk samples were prepared from binary meat mixtures which were obtained by adding different amounts (0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 5. 0 %) of horse, <b>donkey</b> and porcine <b>meats</b> into either cattle or sheep meats. Oligonucleotide primers (producing fragments at a base pair (bp) length of 153, 145 and 227 respectively) that are specific to horse, donkey and porcine species were designed on the mitochondrial DNA. The results showed that each meat species could be identified at all the levels studied in the range of 0. 1 % to 5 %, in all sucuk samples. In conclusion, it was suggested that the specific PCR method developed within the scope of this study {{could be used as a}} routine control method in food control laboratories for the identification of horse, <b>donkey</b> and porcine <b>meats</b> in the meat products...|$|R

40|$|Donkey species {{reproductive}} biotechnology {{studies had}} {{a dramatic increase}} after the Convention of Biological Diversity {{that took place in}} Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in 1992. The mechanization of agriculture of the 20 th century took most of the developed countries donkey breeds close to extinction and, after Rio, the development of effective reproductive programs to save them were encouraged. Moreover, the recent interest in <b>donkey</b> milk, <b>meat</b> and skin products transformed the donkey in a potential productive animal leading to the research and dissemination of desired productive tracts into its population. Amongst reproductive biotechnologies the production and cryopreservation of embryos has a key role due to the possibility of producing and stocking valuable genetics potentially forever.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{slaughter}} age (8 vs 12 months) were investigated on meat and carcass quality obtained from Martina Franca donkey foals. Sixteen male foals were used, eight were slaughtered at 8 {{months of age}} with a mean (±s. e.) final body weight of 101 ± 18 kg and the remaining 8 foals slaughtered at 12 months of age with a mean final body weight of 122 ± 13 kg. Carcass weight and dressing percentage were higher (P b 0. 05) in older foals. Shear force value was lower (P b 0. 05) in donkeys slaughtered at 8 months of age (54. 03 N) compared to the same muscle Longissimus Thoracis et Lumborum (LTL) collected in older animals (62. 66 N). Muscle glycogen content was higher (P b 0. 05) in foals slaughtered at 12 months of age. <b>Donkey</b> foal <b>meat</b> showed an interesting content of essential amino acids and a notable percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in both groups of animals, giving a high nutritional value to this alternative red meat...|$|R

In all, it is 80% lean meat, of which 25% will be prosciutto (ham), and 20% pancetta. The meat is finely minced, and mixed with seasonings (salt, pepper, white wine.) Some makers will also use cinnamon and cloves and no nitrates are used.|$|R
40|$|As {{a unique}} species of equine, the donkey has certain {{specific}} variation from the horse; {{it is no}} longer acceptable to simply look on the donkey as a small horse. Domesticated only for approximately 5, 000 years, the donkey has been and still is used for draught and production purposes and working and living alongside humans all around the world. More recently, the donkey has also found a role as a pet and companion. In some Countries, <b>donkey</b> milk and <b>meat</b> is also much prized. Donkey milk was used in the Antiquity for its medicinal and cosmetic properties. Though it had long been forgotten, it has gained new popularity with today's request for natural medicine, and for nutrition of children affected by Cow Milk Proteins Allergy. Donkey milk has been extensively studied, however little is known about donkey nutrition and particularly about the effects of donkey nutrition on milk production. As a matter of fact, though donkeys are part of the equid family, their feeding habits, their digestive anatomical and physiological particularities differ from those of horses. Donkeys have a higher food intake, a longer gastrointestinal transit and a greater dry matter digestibility, and are therefore able to enhance poor forage better than other equids. Basing the diets formulation on the study of the macroscopic anatomy of their gastrointestinal tract, this chapter provides information on the dietary requirements of donkeys whose milk is destined for human consumption. Factors affecting the digestive efficiency of lactating donkeys have been investigated, comparing donkey milk quality and milk yield in animals fed either a low quality roughage (wheat straw: 77. 1 % neutral detergent fibre, 2. 8 % crude protein) or a high quality forage (alfalfa hay: 47. 5 % neutral detergent fibre, 22. 7 % crude protein). Practical management tools for donkey breeding are also indicated in the chapter, such as the methods necessary for donkey body condition scoring and donkey body weight estimation...|$|R

5000|$|The {{oral history}} of the {{inhabitants}} of this woreda begins with a severe famine around 1850, known as Rukisa (Arsi Oromiffa [...] "hunger"), when the cattle developed diarrhea and [...] "the Oromo in the area ate horse and <b>donkey</b> <b>meat</b> {{as a result of}} famine." [...] At that time the inhabitants were primarily pastoralists. Around 1935, the gebbar system was imposed by the naftagna and balabat landowners, which led 95% of the farmers becoming tenants.

Local elders remember [...] "Shenqute's Famine" [...] in 1957, locally known as Rukissa Qallo (the thin famine), when they were still pastoralists; these elders also recalled the shocks of the earthquake at Karakore in 1961. By the time of the far more severe 1984 famine, the inhabitants had shifted to a primarily agricultural lifestyle, but due to lack of rain they suffered from a shortage of food. They lost most of their cattle during the drought due to lack of pasture and water in the fields, but did not receive relief during that famine. They were able to survive the famine only because of the resumption of rains which began 17 May 1984.|$|E

After the hunters had left, Mr. Dongguo lets the wolf out of his bag, got on his donkey, {{and was about to}} take his leave only to be stopped by the wolf. The wolf now asked the scholar to save his life again, this time from starvation. Mr. Dongguo offered the wolf some pastries, but the wolf smile and said [...] "I don't eat those, I dine solely on meat". Puzzled, Mr. Dongguo inquires if the wolf intended to eat his donkey and the wolf replies [...] "No, no, <b>donkey</b> <b>meat</b> is no good". The donkey, upon hearing this, bolts from the scene as fast as its four legs to carry it leaving Mr. Dongguo behind with the wolf. To Mr. Dongguo's surprise, the hungry wolf pounced on him and announced it intention to eat him. When Mr. Dongguo protests at the wolf's ingratitude, the wolf presents the argument: since the scholar saved his life once why not do it again?

40|$|Meat has exerted {{a crucial}} role in human {{evolution}} and is an important component of a healthy and well balanced diet due to its nutritional richness. The aim of the present chapter is to shed light on the nutritional composition of <b>donkey</b> <b>meat</b> and the implications for human health. Donkeys are not perceived as multi-use animals. Cattle, buffaloes and camels are usually kept for their milk and their meat as well as for work. In many areas donkeys are not sold for their meat. One of many exceptions is Lesotho where donkeys are culled for meat when they are considered too old to work, and for this reason donkeys are relatively expensive in this Country. In the rest of the world, the lower cost of donkeys makes them more affordable to small farmers. On the other hand, <b>donkey</b> <b>meat</b> can be considered a good alternative in red meat consumption, being a dietary meat. <b>Donkey</b> <b>meat</b> is in fact characterized by low fat, low cholesterol content, a favourable fatty acid profile and is rich in iron. Today consumers are health conscious and demand high quality food products; they require leaner meat, with less fat (the minimal fat level required to maintain juiciness and flavour) and a consistent quality. Ultimately, the success of any food product is determined by the consumer’s acceptance. Meat quality and acceptability is determined by its physico-chemical characteristics, although consumer preferences for meat are difficult to define.
