"The {{surprise}} of Saturday's football" [...] came when a late goal from Hands {{was enough to}} beat Preston North End, {{though there was a}} suggestion in the press that the team would <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> moderate their tactics, which [...] "were not of the gentlest". For Preston's visit to Coventry Road the following weekend, the club applied for a licence to sell alcohol within the ground, as it was the only First Division club without such a licence. The application was refused, the licensing magistrate [...] "remarking that if the public wanted drink they could go outside to get it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1962 he {{attended}} an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda. He met with important literary figures {{from around the}} continent and the world, including Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soyinka, and US poet-author Langston Hughes. Among the topics of discussion {{was an attempt to}} determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not [...] "a very significant question", and that scholars would <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond.|$|E
500|$|In August 1865 Nelson {{attempted}} to resurrect the institute following the war, and he submitted an advertisement to the Civilian & Telegraph newspaper in Cumberland, Maryland, {{in which he}} billed the institute as [...] "A Male and Female Boarding and Day School". The institute opened on the first Monday in September in 1865 for its fall and winter session. According to Nelson in the advertisement, [...] "parents desiring for their children a sound English, Classical and Mathematical Education would <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> patronize this School." [...] Student education was divided into three levels: the Lowest Grade level for $10 for a five-month session, Intermediate level for $15, and the Highest level for $20. Latin and Greek each cost $5 additional per quarter. Boarding at the school cost $3 per week; however, laundry, fuel, and lighting {{were not included in}} this fee. Music lessons were also taught [...] "at Professor's charges".|$|E

500|$|Yousafzai's memoir I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban, co-written with British {{journalist}} Christina Lamb, {{was published}} in October 2013 by Little, Brown and Company in the US and by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK A reviewer for The Guardian called the book [...] "fearless" [...] and stated that [...] "the haters and conspiracy theorists would <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> read this book", though she criticised [...] "the stiff, know-it-all voice of a foreign correspondent" [...] that is interwoven with Yousafzai's. A reviewer for The Washington Post called the book [...] "riveting" [...] and wrote [...] "It {{is difficult to imagine}} a chronicle of a war more moving, apart from perhaps the diary of Anne Frank." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the book a [...] "B+", writing [...] "Malala's bravely eager voice can seem a little thin here, in I Am Malala, likely thanks to her co-writer, but her powerful message remains undiluted." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E
500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{released}} the song [...] "Hey You" [...] for the Live Earth series of concerts. The song was {{available as a}} free download during its first week of release. She also performed it at the London Live Earth concert. Madonna announced her departure from Warner Bros. Records, and a new $120million, ten-year 360 deal with Live Nation. She produced and wrote I Am Because We Are, a documentary on the problems faced by Malawians. The documentary was directed by Nathan Rissman, who worked as Madonna's gardener. She also directed her first film Filth and Wisdom. The plot of the film revolved around three friends and their aspirations. The Times said she had [...] "done herself proud" [...] while The Daily Telegraph described the film as [...] "not an entirely unpromising first effort [...] Madonna would <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> hang on to her day job." [...] On March 10, 2008, Madonna {{was inducted into the}} Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility. Madonna did not sing at the ceremony but asked fellow Hall of Fame inductees and Michigan natives The Stooges to perform her songs [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". She thanked Christopher Flynn, her dance teacher from 35 years earlier, for his encouragement to follow her dreams.|$|E
500|$|The New York Dramatic Mirror {{review was}} {{positive}} despite the plot having been produced previously. The reviewer wrote, [...] "This film {{story has been}} done before and by an Independent producer, which prompts the wonder if the Independents would not <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> avoid borrowing - at least from each other. The Thanhouser producers have the excuse, however, {{in this particular case}} that the former telling of the story was a sad failure, while this one has pleasing qualities. Two fathers are determined that their children shall wed each other, but the young folks object to such cut and dried procedure, whereat the fathers pretend to quarrel and forbid the children to love, and the perverse youngsters at once elope, assisted secretly by the parents. The trick of having the boy join the girl in her apparent banishment by hiding in her trunk is the one discordant note in an otherwise plausible and human comedy." [...] The Moving Picture World was more brief, acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario and that the acting was convincing. The Moving Picture News review was also brief, stating, [...] "The film calls for shrieks of laughter; it deserved it, for it is built upon human nature. A story anyone can see and enjoy." [...] In 1912, the American Film Manufacturing Company released the similarly titled An Assisted Elopement and the Selig Polyscope Company released its own An Assisted Elopement.|$|E
