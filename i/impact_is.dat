30|$|The fire {{effluents}} {{may or may}} {{not make}} an impact on the environment depending on the duration of exposure, the means of transmission to the environment, and the susceptibility of the receptor. A clear distinction to differentiate <b>impacts</b> <b>is</b> the differentiation between short term and long term, where short term <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> considered to occur over a few hours or a few days, at most. Long term <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> <b>impacts</b> beyond immediate, short term impacts.|$|R
50|$|Giant <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> {{hypothesized}} {{to account for}} both the tilt of Uranus, and the retrograde rotation of Venus. Giant <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> also candidates for the Mars ocean hypothesis, and the high density of Mercury.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997 Oliviero {{joined the}} Montreal <b>Impact,</b> and <b>was</b> {{with the club}} until 2002 for all but one season. His best season with the <b>Impact</b> <b>was</b> 1998 when he {{recorded}} 27 points on 8 goals and 11 assists. He tallied a total of 18 goals in 115 games. Oliveiro played for Staten Island Vipers in 1999 when the <b>Impact</b> <b>were</b> not in operation.|$|R
5000|$|Climate change <b>impacts</b> can <b>be</b> {{measured}} {{as an economic}} cost (Smith et al., 2001:936-941). This is particularly well-suited to market <b>impacts,</b> that <b>is</b> <b>impacts</b> that <b>are</b> linked to market transactions and directly affect GDP. Monetary measures of non-market impacts, e.g., impacts on human health and ecosystems, {{are more difficult to}} calculate.

50|$|Negative <b>Impacts</b> <b>are</b> the effects, {{that are}} caused in most cases, at the tourist {{destination}} site with detrimental impacts to the Social and cultural area, {{as well as}} the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, resources become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted. Typically, when negative <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> occurring, it is too late to place restrictions and regulations. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> found in the development stage of the Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC).|$|R
5|$|Woodruff's <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> also {{apparent}} in his {{large volume of}} publications. In addition to authoring over two hundred scholarly papers, Woodruff wrote seven books during his career, covering numerous aspects of medicine and surgery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} human <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, {{are commonly}} seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
5|$|Brownlee's <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> {{also felt}} through the {{organizations}} {{he participated in}} founding: the Alberta Wheat Pool remained an important player in Canadian agriculture until 1998, when it merged with Manitoba Pool Elevators to form Agricore Cooperative Ltd.. In 2001, this new company merged with the UGG to form Agricore United. In 2007, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool took it over, forming Viterra. Brownlee's vision, unique {{among the members of}} the Macmillan Commission, of a publicly controlled central bank became a reality in 1938, when the Bank of Canada shifted from private to government control.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, SDSU {{was deemed}} {{the number one}} small {{research}} university in the nation. The ranking was determined based on faculty productivity, honorary awards, publications in journals, and number of research grants received. At any point, the campus usually has around 800 studies in progress in various fields. A 2007 study revealed that the campus has an economic impact of $2.4 billion on the San Diego region. Due to projections of current and future growth, the study indicated that the school's economic <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> expected to increase to $4.5 billion by 2025.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomic}} or involuntary nervous system, {{which is}} involved in the control of body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, is affected in two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but the <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> variable. Twenty percent may experience severe blood-pressure fluctuations and irregularities in the heart beat, sometimes {{to the point that the}} heart beat stops and requiring pacemaker-based treatment. Other associated problems are abnormalities in perspiration and changes in the reactivity of the pupils. Autonomic nervous system involvement can affect even those who do not have severe muscle weakness.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{significant}} human <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> a small prefabricated hut {{which is used}} by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug up once discovered. An improperly handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Debris {{from the}} <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> {{scattered}} over {{an area of}} 1600000 km2 thrown more than 800 km; rock fragments ejected by the <b>impact</b> have <b>been</b> found as far as Minnesota.|$|R

5|$|Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets {{are also}} found in the Everglades, their <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native {{wildlife}} is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have devastating effects on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3 {{supports}} split-screen multiplayer {{and online}} multiplayer. Five different game modes {{can be played}} online in the game. Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some modes is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI drivers are replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions differently to the offline mode. The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three modes are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player modes where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously. Team Crush is focused cooperative gameplay while Double <b>Impact</b> <b>is</b> about competing with each other. Party Crash is an eight-player score competition mode where players crash on a junction individually and their scores are compared. In April 2010, online services were shut down.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> {{known to have}} been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.|$|E
50|$|At least 6,400 flight {{cancellations}} occurred across North America {{before the}} storm. <b>Impact</b> <b>was</b> severe at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, as over 1,100 flights were canceled there. A less severe {{but still a}} major <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Toronto where about 300 of its 1,400 daily flights were canceled.|$|R
30|$|Results {{presented}} in this paper are based on “intent-to-treat” <b>impact</b> estimates. That <b>is,</b> the <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> calculated by comparing all individuals in the programme group with all individuals assigned to the control group, regardless of whether or how long they were engaged in UK ERA services. The <b>impacts</b> <b>were</b> regression-adjusted using background characteristics of the sample such as prior earnings, education, household characteristics, and relative month of random assignment.|$|R

5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the ejecta blanket from the Imbrium <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected there could give insight into the geologic history of the Moon. The petrology of the formation, based on data obtained on Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E

30|$|Notably, {{the impact}} of the pumped {{hydropower}} store in the category natural land transformation is reduced, no longer exceeding the result of the utility-scale battery. Natural land transformation <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> now approximately a third lower than those of the battery option. Therefore, in this scenario, all environmental <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> now without exception lower than those of the utility-scale battery.|$|R
40|$|Cordon tolls are {{simulated}} {{for eight}} English towns. The distributional effects and environmental <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> assessed.
