40|$|In vivo {{methods are}} {{described}} to detect clastogenic and aneugenic effects of chemical agents in {{male and female}} germ cells in vivo. The knowledge of stages of germ cell development and their duration for a given test animal is essential for these experiments. Commonly, mice or rats are employed. Structural chromosome aberrations can be analyzed microscopically in mitotic cell divisions of differentiating spermatogonia, zygotes, or early embryos {{as well as in}} first meiotic cell divisions of spermatocytes and oocytes. Numerical chromosome aberrations are scorable during second meiotic divisions of spermatocytes and oocytes. The micronucleus test is applicable to early round spermatids and to first cleavage embryos, and as in somatic cells, it assesses structural as well as numerical chromosome aberrations. In contrast to the somatic micronucleus assay, the timing of cell sampling determines whether the micronuclei scored in round spermatids were formed from structural or numerical aberrations, i. e. with short treatment sampling intervals the micronuclei are formed by exposed meiotic divisions and represent induced non-disjunction. On the contrary, after longer intervals of 12 – 14 days micronuclei are formed from induced unstable structural aberrations in differentiating spermatogonia or during the last round of DNA synthesis in early spermatocytes. Furthermore, labelling with fluorescent DNA-probes can be used to confirm these theoretical expectations. The mouse sperm-FISH assay is totally based on scoring colour spots from individual chromosomes (e. g. X, Y, and 8) hybridized with specific DNA-probes. The most animal demanding assay described here is the dominant lethal test. It is commonly performed with treated male laboratory rodents and allows the determination of the most sensitive developmental stage of spermatogenesis to a particular chemical under test. Theoretically, unstable structural chromosome aberrations in sperm will lead to foetal deaths after fertilization at around the time of implantation in the uterus wall. These can be scored as deciduomata or early dead foetuses in the uterus wall of the females at mid-pregnancy. None of the tests described in this chapter provide data for a quantitative estimate of the genetic risk to progeny from exposed germ cells. The only tests on which such calculations can be based, the <b>heritable</b> <b>translocation</b> assay and the specific locus test, are so animal and time-consuming that they can no more be performed anywhere in the world and thus are not described here...|$|E

Males were mated either 11. 5 – 14. 5 days after treatment (middle spermatids) or less than 2. 5 hours after treatment (fully mature sperm). Results clearly showed that, even though similar levels of dominant-lethal mutations were induced in fully mature sperm and in middle spermatids, the frequency of <b>heritable</b> <b>translocations</b> induced in mature sperm was markedly lower than that induced in middle spermatids.

40|$|Induction of {{chromosome}} aberrations in pachytene spermatocytes of mice by 2 mg/kg TEM {{was compared}} with induction by 400 R X rays. These doses induced comparably high {{dominant lethal effects}} in pachytene spermatocytes of mice. Cytological analysis at diakinesis–metaphase I stage showed that whereas 76. 4 % of the cells treated with X rays at pachytene stage had aberrations, the frequencies observed in two TEM experiments were only 0. 8 and 2. 2 %. On the other hand, 5 % of the progeny from TEM-treated pachytene spermatocytes {{were found to be}} translocation heterozygotes. This is the first report on the recovery of <b>heritable</b> <b>translocations</b> from treated spermatocytes of mice. The aberration frequencies observed for TEM in diakinesis–metaphase I were much too low to account for all the lethal mutations and <b>heritable</b> <b>translocations.</b> Thus, the formation of the bulk of aberrations induced by TEM in pachytene spermatocytes was delayed—a marked contrast to the more immediate formation of X-ray-induced aberrations. It is postulated that the formation of the bulk of TEM-induced aberrations in pachytene spermatocytes and in certain postmeiotic stages occurs sometime during spermiogenesis, and not through the operation of postfertilization pronuclear DNA synthesis...|$|R

40|$|An {{effort to}} assess and {{quantify}} genetic risks from human exposure to mutagenic chemicals is urgently needed; otherwise genetic toxicology may well lose its credibility. Genetic biomonitoring provides us with an indication of mutagenic effectiveness in human somatic cells. The populations and chemicals selected for such studies form a useful database for genetic risk-assessment studies. Extrapolation to what can be expected in germ cells of exposed individuals should be possible by using good dosimetry (adducts) and a parallelogram approach. The principle is that genetic damage in the inaccessible human germ cells can be estimated by determining the effects on lymphocytes (or other somatic cells) from humans and mice and in germ cells of mice. Worldwide, opportunities for the costly mouse germ cell studies are limited. Knowledge of type of DNA adducts, their persistence and/or removal and dominant lethal studies, will be helpful in predicting stage sensitivity. Extrapolation from a lowest effective dose level is proposed. The available data for ethylene oxide and benzene are reviewed. The risk of <b>heritable</b> <b>translocations</b> in progeny of populations exposed to ethylene oxide is so high that more precise estimates seem desirable. In discussing {{the expression of the}} induced mutations, the importance of dominant mutations and of heterozygous effects of deletions and other recessives is pointed out. The molecular changes underlying dominant mutations in man are more limited than is the case for recessive mutations. This raises the question whether mutagenic agents can produce the specific changes leading to recoverable, dominant mutations. Extrapolation from increased mutation rates to predictable increases of human disease, whether by doubling dose or direct methods, have been criticized...|$|R
40|$|Acrylamide is {{an animal}} {{carcinogen}} and probable human car-cinogen present in appreciable amounts in heated carbohydrate-rich foodstuffs. It {{is also a}} germ cell mutagen, inducing domi-nant lethal mutations and <b>heritable</b> chromosomal <b>translocations</b> in postmeiotic sperm of treated mice. Acrylamide’s affinity for male germ cells has sometimes been overlooked in assessing its toxicity and defining human health risks. Previous investigations of acrylamide’s germ cell activity in mice showed stronger ef-fects after repeated administration of low doses compared with a single high dose, suggesting the possible involvement of a sta-ble metabolite. A key oxidative metabolite of acrylamide is the epoxide glycidamide, generated by cytochrome P 4502 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1). To explore the role of CYP 2 E 1 metabolism in the germ cell mutagenicity of acrylamide, CYP 2 E 1 -null and wild-typ...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Acrylamide is a {{commonly}} used industrial compound; {{however it is}} also naturally occurring in cooked foods such as potatoes, breads and coffee. Since the discovery of acrylamide formation in food, significant research {{has been carried out}} to determine the consequences of human dietary exposure to acrylamide. The reproductive toxicity of acrylamide was the focus of this thesis; however the compound is also known to cause neurotoxicity, carcinogenicity and genotoxicity. In rodent studies, acrylamide reproductive toxicity is primarily mediated through paternal exposure, and has been observed to induce DNA damage, male infertility, dominant lethality, <b>heritable</b> <b>translocations</b> and embryo resorptions. Thus, prolonged exposure to acrylamide in males not only has implications within the individual, but may have consequences for future offspring. The aims of this thesis were to examine the nature of DNA damage induced by acrylamide in male germ cells, and to investigate whether this damage could be induced at levels equivalent to human estimates. These aims were addressed using a series of experiments in isolated mouse germ cells, as well as a chronic exposure study in which acrylamide was administered to male mice via the drinking water for one year. Genome-wide microarray analyses were subsequently used to explore the molecular mechanisms that mediate the damage induced in the testis of acrylamide exposed mice. The results of this study indicated that acrylamide-mediated DNA damage was likely due to the presence of both DNA adducts as well as oxidative damage in mouse male germ cells. Furthermore, chronic exposure to acrylamide in male mice led to significant dose and time-dependent increases in DNA damage in male germ cells. Microarray analyses offered insight into the mechanisms that generate deleterious effects in the testes of mice following acrylamide exposure, and identified several potential biomarkers of exposure. The outcomes of this research will provide better understanding of acrylamide toxicity and shed light on the consequences of xenobiotic exposure in the male...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Male {{germ cells}} are {{vulnerable}} {{to a wide variety}} of substances, including hormones, drugs, environmental toxicants, heat and radiation. Acrylamide is a reproductive toxicant that is ubiquitous in human lives, with its formation occurring during the cooking of many foods such as breads, potatoes, cereals and coffee. This toxicant has well established neurotoxic effects in humans, and is recognised as a probable human carcinogen. Acute exposure in male rodents results in DNA damage, infertility, <b>heritable</b> <b>translocations</b> and embryo resorptions. Hence, prolonged acrylamide exposure in males has the potential to not only affect the individual, but may also have consequences for offspring. Studies have demonstrated one unique enzyme responsible for the phase I metabolism of acrylamide; the cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1). Via this enzyme, acrylamide is converted to the highly reactive epoxide glycidamide. Importantly, glycidamide adducts with DNA, and is responsible for the toxicities associated with acrylamide exposure. The aims of this thesis were to assess the DNA damage induced in germ cells following chronic low dose acrylamide exposure, relevant to human exposure estimates. Importantly, we sought to determine if this damage could be ameliorated by utilising an inhibitor of CYP 2 E 1. We aimed to determine if this DNA damage harboured in the male gamete had consequences for the offspring. The fourth aim was to assess CYP 2 E 1 localisation within the male reproductive tract and to relate this to the consequences to offspring of acute high dose paternal acrylamide exposure. Our results demonstrated that there are two major sites of CYP 2 E 1 expression within the male reproductive tract; the testis and the epididymis. Importantly, the expression in the mouse was equivalent to that in the human, further validating the use of the mouse model. We determined that the CYP 2 E 1 of the epididymis plays a vital role in induction of dominant lethality following acute acrylamide exposure. However, of most critical importance to humans may be the expression within the spermatocytes of the testis, which respond to chronic low level acrylamide exposure by induction of this enzyme and resultant DNA damage within the germ cells. This induction was inherited in the untreated progeny and may render these mice more susceptible to direct acrylamide exposure...|$|R
