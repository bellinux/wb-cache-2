Tymoshenko hurried up the lawyer and was disturbed with his resultless efforts despite money given to him. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> that Hennadi Tymoshenko in prison suffered a microinsult. Just based on that video recording, a criminal suit was initiated against Tymoshenko under the articles 15 part 2 and 369 part 1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. But this criminal case was closed in 2004, under Kuchma presidency.|$|E

Different disciplines use schematization for different reasons. In cartography, graphic schematization is {{one aspect of}} map generalization. In contrast, cognitive science addresses schematization as a method <b>to</b> intentionally <b>emphasize</b> certain aspects of knowledge beyond technical necessity; therefore, the notion of schematic map is proposed to denote maps that employ schematization for cognitive representational reasons.

25|$|Organic cofactors {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) {{that can be}} either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when {{it is difficult to}} remove without denaturing the enzyme, it can be called a prosthetic group. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> that there is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Indeed, many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in some enzymes, while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in transketolase or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), biotin, and lipoamide, for instance, are covalently bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> the {{fundamental}} difference in plan between the midrashim forming a running commentary (מאמרים ביאוריים) to the Scripture text, and the homiletic midrashim (מאמרים לימודיים). When the scholars undertook to edit, revise, and collect into individual midrashim the immense array of haggadot, {{they followed the}} method employed in the collections and revisions of the halakhot and the halakhic discussions. The form which suggested itself was to arrange in textual sequence the exegetical interpretations of the Biblical text as taught in the schools, or the occasional interpretations introduced into public discourses, etc., and which were in any way connected with Scripture. Since {{the work of the}} editor was often merely that of compilation, the existing midrashim show in many passages the character of the sources from which they were taken. This was the genesis of the midrashim which are in the nature of running haggadic commentaries to single books of the Bible, as Bereshit Rabbah, Eikah Rabbati, the midrashim to the other Megillot, etc. See Midrash for more details.|$|E

2500|$|Irenaeus' {{presentation}} of Christ as the New Adam {{is based on}} Paul's Christ-Adam parallel in [...] [...] Irenaeus uses this parallel to demonstrate that Christ truly took human flesh. [...] Irenaeus consideres it <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> this point because he understands the failure to recognize Christ's full humanity the bond linking the various strains of Gnosticism together, as seen in his statement that [...] "according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was the Word of God made flesh." [...] Irenaeus believes that unless the Word became flesh, humans were not fully redeemed. He explains that by becoming man, Christ restored humanity to being in the image and likeness of God, which they had lost in the Fall of man [...] Just as Adam was the original head of humanity through whom all sinned, Christ is {{the new head of}} humanity who fulfills Adam's role in the Economy of Salvation. [...] Irenaeus calls this process of restoring humanity recapitulation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept was}} widely popularized in {{anthropology}} through the book, [...] "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" [...] by James C. Scott (1976). The book {{begins with a}} telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live {{so close to the}} subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were [...] "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a [...] "safety first" [...] principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as [...] "traditionalist" [...] when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides [...] "subsistence insurance" [...] for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{bacterial}} species {{belonging to}} the genus Clostridium are characterized by their ability to produce extremely potent neurotoxins. Classified as either tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) or botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), they act by inhibiting neurotransmitter release at CNS synapses (TeNT) and neuromuscular junctions (BoNT), leading to the spastic (tetanus) or flaccid (botulism) paralysis. To date, eight different neurotoxin types have been recognized; these are single form of TeNT, and seven (A-G) serologically distinct BoNTs. One of the most <b>important</b> factors <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> is that while production of TeNT is confined to a single clostridial species, Clostridium tetani, BoNT is produced by a range of species.

When viewing a low {{depth of field}} image, the viewer implicitly segments the image into region of interest and non regions of interest which has major impact on {{the perception of the}} image. Thus, robust algorithms for the detection of the OOI in low DOF images provide valuable information for subsequent image processing and image retrieval. In this paper we propose a robust and parameterless algorithm for the fully automatic segmentation of low depth of field images. We compare our method with three similar methods and show the superior robustness even though our algorithm does not require any parameters to be set by hand. The experiments are conducted on a real world data set with high and low depth of field images...|$|R

These findings are contrary to the findings of previous studies.

40|$|Abstract: We examine {{properties}} of estimators of count data model with endogenous switching. The {{estimation of the}} count data model that accommodates endogenous switching {{can be accomplished by}} Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML). However, FIML estimation requires fully and correctly specified model and is computationally burdensome. Alternative estimation methods do not require fully specified model have been proposed. The typical methods are Two Stage Method of moments (TSM) and Nonlinear Weighted Least Squares (NWLS). The {{properties of}} these estimators have never been studied so far. In this paper, we compared the finite sample properties of these estimators under correct and incorrect model specifications using Monte Carlo experiments. We find that FIML estimator has the smallest standard deviation and TSM estimator has the largest when the model is correctly specified. This property also holds under incorrect model specification. An <b>important</b> point <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> is the large standard deviation of the estimate of endogeneity suggests that TSM and NWLS estimations result in an anomalous estimate of endogeneity very frequent even under the correct specification...|$|R

The aim of our study was to examine some adoptive parents, to internationally adopted children, experience of adopting, the time before the adoption, the adoption process, and the time after the adoption. The study is based on qualitative interviews with seven adoptive parents. Theoretical frameworks that have been used are a phenomenological perspective, the dramaturgical perspective of Goffman and the theory of rites of passage. The result of our study shows that the adoptive parents have tried “everything” to be-come parents in a biological way before they came to the decision to adopt. At first they were worried about the background of the child but after the adoption they think the worrying was unwarranted and becoming a parent through adoption was fantastic. The respondents describe that relatives have been <b>important</b> <b>to</b> them and in particular other adoptive parents. There are those who expressed that they have got a good treatment from the social workers and the social workers have been professional and courteous. At the same time there are those who expressed that the social workers gave unwarranted comments and had an arrogant manner.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} improve {{treatments}} for cannabis use disorder, {{a better understanding of}} factors associated with successful quitting is required. Method This study examined differences between successful (n = 87) and unsuccessful (n = 78) cannabis quitters. Participants completed a questionnaire addressing demographic, mental health, and cannabis-related variables, as well as quitting strategies during their most recent quit attempt. Results Eighteen strategies derived from cognitive behavioral therapy were entered into a principal components analysis. The analysis yielded four components, representing (1) Stimulus Removal, (2) Motivation Enhancement, (3) (lack of) Distraction, and (4) (lack of) Coping. Between groups comparisons showed that unsuccessful quitters scored significantly higher on Motivation Enhancement and (lack of) Coping. This may indicate that unsuccessful quitters focus on the desire to quit, but do not sufficiently plan strategies for coping. Unsuccessful quitters also had significantly more symptoms of depression and stress; less education; lower exposure to formal treatment; higher day-to-day exposure to other cannabis users; and higher cannabis dependence scores. Conclusions The findings suggest that coping, environmental modification, and co-morbid mental health problems may be <b>important</b> factors <b>to</b> <b>emphasize</b> in treatments for cannabis use disorder. </p...|$|R
