5|$|With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an {{additional}} document was granted, the Articuli super Cartas (The Articles upon the Charters). It {{was composed of}} 17 articles and sought in part to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of enforcing the Charters. Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the sheriff of each county, and should be read {{four times a year}} at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.|$|E
5|$|Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later {{admitted that he had}} personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's {{primary concern}} was {{to place the}} {{provision}} of food supplies to the army on a rational and sustainable basis. To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} the arbitrary exaction of food levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E

5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E
5|$|In June 1964, {{following}} {{the withdrawal of}} ONUC, the communist Kwilu and Simba rebellions overwhelmed the ANC in eastern and central Congo. The weak central government was unable to effectively <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> so President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Prime Minister Adoula and requested Tshombe to replace him. Tshombe arrived in the capital on 24 June and assumed the premiership on 9 July. The insurgencies were successfully quelled {{with the use of}} former gendarmes and mercenaries, but in October 1965 Kasa-Vubu dismissed Tshombe. In November, Colonel Joseph-Desiré Mobutu seized power in a coup and Tshombe returned to exile in Spain. Though he had designs on a return to power, Tshombe was imprisoned in Algeria in 1967 and remained there until his death.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a {{conservative}} Ohio judge, is appointed {{to head the}} President's Office of National Drug Control Policy, taking on the title drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} and fourth days (September 1 and 2, 1983), work began with the Canadarm Remote Manipulator System and the payload test article, and {{communications}} testing through TDRS continued. The former was successful, but the latter lost contact on a number of occasions, due to problems at the White Sands ground station. As a result, the crew had to be awakened early on September 1 in order to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> A minor cabin pressure leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled. The orbiter performed an Orbital Maneuvering System firing on September 2 to place itself in a lower orbit, where the air density was higher and the oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively.|$|E
5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, {{you were in the}} right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
5|$|Response unit – Also {{known as}} a fly-car or a , which is a vehicle {{which is used to}} reach an acutely ill patient quickly, and provide on scene care, but lacks the {{capacity}} to transport the patient from the scene. Response units may be backed up by an emergency ambulance which can transport the patient, or may <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> on scene, with no requirement for a transport ambulance. These can be a wide variety of vehicles, from standard cars, to modified vans, motorcycles, pedal cycles, quad bikes or horses. These units can function as a vehicle for officers or supervisors (similar to a fire chief's vehicle, but for ambulance services). Fire & Rescue services in North America often staff EMTs or Paramedics to their apparatuses to provide medical care without the need to wait for an ambulance.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, {{and the effects of}} the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E
5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E
5|$|Under the papacies of {{successive}} Popes {{smaller groups}} of Crusaders continued {{to travel to}} the Eastern Mediterranean to fight the Muslims and aid the Crusader States in the early 12thcentury. The third decade saw campaigns by Fulk V of Anjou, the Venetians, and Conrad III of Germany and the foundation of the Knights Templar. The period also saw the innovation of granting indulgences to those who opposed papal enemies, and this marked the beginning of politically motivated Crusades. The loss of Aleppo in 1128 and Edessa (Urfa) in 1144 to Imad ad-Din Zengi, governor of Mosul, led to preaching for what subsequently became known as the Second Crusade. King Louis VII and ConradIII led armies from France and Germany to Jerusalem and Damascus without winning any major victories. As in the First Crusade, the preaching led to attacks on Jews including massacres in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer amid claims that the Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard of Clairvaux, who had encouraged the Second Crusade in his preaching, was so perturbed by the violence that he journeyed from Flanders to Germany to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E

5|$|Vito Spatafore is outed as {{homosexual}} {{after running}} into {{a friend at}} a New York gay night club. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito with the security guard. Finn then has to {{sit in front of}} Tony's entire crew and tell them what happened with the guard, solidifying their thoughts on Vito's sexuality. Tony is urged to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> by Phil Leotardo, now acting boss of New York with Johnny Sack in prison. Once Vito is outed, he runs away from the city and hides out in a New Hampshire town where he claims to be writing a book and meets with the locals. Vito also starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Eventually, Vito returns to New Jersey and asks Tony to allow him to return to work, albeit in Atlantic City. He continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual. Tony mulls over the decision to let him work, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. When {{one of the members of}} the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won't stop making jokes about Vito and his death, the two members of Tony's crime family who are present kill Fat Dom out of anger at the disrespect he has shown. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.|$|E
