40|$|A {{member of}} the TTP family of proteins, TIS 11 d binds RNA with high {{specificity}} using a pair of CCCH-type tandem zinc fingers separated by a 18 residue long linker. Our previous work showed that the formation of hydrogen bonds between the C-terminal residue <b>E</b> <b>220</b> and the residues of the linker region stabilized a compact structure of TIS 11 d {{in the absence of}} RNA. To investigate the role of the C-terminal residues in the structure of unbound TIS 11 d, the <b>E</b> <b>220</b> A mutant and the truncation mutant lacking the last two residues (D 219 /E 220) were studied using molecular dynamics, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical methods. This study confirmed the importance of the charged residues D 219 and <b>E</b> <b>220</b> in maintaining structural stability in unbound TIS 11 d and elucidated the underlying physical mechanisms. We observed a greater structural heterogeneity for the residues of the linker in the molecular dynamics trajectories of both mutant proteins relative to the wild-type. This heterogeneity was more pronounced in the D 219 /E 220 deletion mutant than in the <b>E</b> <b>220</b> A mutant, indicating that a greater reduction of the charge of the C-terminus results in greater flexibility. In agreement with the increased flexibility and the reduced number of negatively charged residues of the D 219 /E 220 deletion mutant, we measured more unfavorable entropic and a more favorable enthalpic contribution to the free energy of RNA binding in the mutant than in the wild-type protein. The relative orientation of the zinc fingers was stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between <b>E</b> <b>220</b> and positively charged residues of the linker in TIS 11 d. In the <b>E</b> <b>220</b> A mutant, the relative orientation of the zinc fingers was less constrained, whereas in the D 219 /E 220 deletion mutant, little orientational preference was observed.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of total drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDRTB) {{has made the}} discovery of new therapies for tuberculosis urgent. The cytoplasmic enzymes of peptidoglycan biosynthesis have generated renewed interest as attractive targets {{for the development of}} new anti-mycobacterials. One of the cytoplasmic enzymes, uridine diphosphate (UDP) -MurNAc-tripeptide ligase (MurE), catalyses the addition of meso-diaminopimelic acid (m-DAP) into peptidoglycan in Mycobacterium tuberculosis coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP. Mutants of M. tuberculosis MurE were generated by replacing K 157, <b>E</b> <b>220,</b> D 392, R 451 with alanine and N 449 with aspartate, and truncating the first 24 amino acid residues at the N-terminus of the enzyme. Analysis of the specific activity of these proteins suggested that apart from the 24 Nterminal residues, the other mutated residues are essential for catalysis. Variations in K m values for one or more substrates were observed for all mutants, except the N-terminal truncation mutant, indicating that these residues are involved in binding substrates and form part of the active site structure. These mutant proteins were also tested for their specificity {{for a wide range of}} substrates. Interestingly, the mutations K 157 A, <b>E</b> <b>220</b> A and D 392 A showed hydrolysis of ATP uncoupled from catalysis. The ATP hydrolysis rate was enhanced by at least partial occupation of the uridine nucleotide dipeptide binding site. This study provides an insight into the residues essential for the catalytic activity and substrate binding of the ATP-dependent MurE ligase. Since ATP-dependent MurE ligase is a novel drug target, the understanding of its function may lead to development of novel inhibitors against resistant forms of M. tuberculosis...|$|E

40|$|Rmi 1 is {{a member}} of the Sgs 1 /Top 3 /Rmi 1 (STR) complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has been implicated in binding and {{catalytic}} enhancement of Top 3 in the dissolution of double Holliday junctions. Deletion of RMI 1 results in a severe growth defect resembling that of top 3 Δ. Despite the importance of Rmi 1 for cell viability, little is known about its functional domains, particularly in Rmi 1 of S. cerevisiae, which does not have a resolved crystal structure and the primary sequence is poorly conserved. Here, we rationally designed point mutations based on bioinformatics analysis of order/disorder and helical propensity to define three functionally important motifs in yeast Rmi 1 outside of the proposed OB-fold core. Replacing residues F 63, Y 218 and <b>E</b> <b>220</b> with proline, designed to break predicted N-terminal and C-terminal α-helices, or with lysine, designed to eliminate hydrophobic residues at positions 63 and 218, while maintaining α-helical structure, caused hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea. Further, Y 218 P and <b>E</b> <b>220</b> P mutations, but not F 63 P and F 63 K mutations, led to reduced Rmi 1 levels compared to wild type Rmi 1, suggesting a role of the C-terminal α-helix in Rmi 1 stabilization, most likely by protecting the integrity of the OB-fold core. Our bioinformatics analysis also suggests the presence of a disordered linker between the N-terminal α-helix and the OB fold core; a P 88 A mutation, designed to increase helicity in this linker, also impaired Rmi 1 function in vivo. In conclusion, we propose a model that maps all functionally important structural features for yeast Rmi 1 based on biological findings in yeast and structure-prediction-based alignment with the recently established crystal structure of the N-terminus of human Rmi 1...|$|E
