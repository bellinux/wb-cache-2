40|$|Introduction In {{light of}} the {{disturbing}} e#cacy of the recently-discovered <b>deletion</b> <b>attack</b> of Knudsen and Mirza [2], we propose a subtle strengthening procedure to avoid their method. We call our approach "strengthening by re-keying. " The basic technique employed is called the "PUT IT BACK" algorithm. The fundamental idea here is this: when Knudsen and Mirza delete the key, we put it back. Details follow. 2 One-Time Pad Revitalized The well-known one-time pad [3] was devestated by [2], but fortunately the intellectual gold-mine that is U. C. Davis {{has come to the}} rescue. Normally we are given plaintext P and a secret key K such that n = |P | = |K|. Then we produce an encryption of P by computing C = P +K in the finite field GF(2 n). (Note that this can be done without the generation of irreducible polynomials! See [1].) Now [2] uses the following clever attack: they set K = 0. (The alert reader will note that their attack is phrased somewhat di#erently, but the e#ect is th...|$|E
40|$|Unattended Wireless Sensors Networks (UWSNs) are {{emerging}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) characterized by periodic absence of trusted entities, like the Sink Collectors. The time periods with no sink attendance, force the network sensors to locally store collected data {{until the next}} sink visit. This means that data collection is not performed in real time, but it falls at regular intervals. Such conditions define a different paradigm regarding traditional WSNs and introduce several new security issues, data survival above all. At {{the best of our}} knowledge, only two strategies were proposed to mitigate mobile adversary data <b>deletion</b> <b>attack</b> : encryption protocols (implementing backward and/or forward secrecy) and replication. While encryption protocols can impose an extensive computational effort and experience several security issues (like key exposure), replication schemes seem to capture a renewed interest from researchers, since their power requirement seem compatible with the constraints of wireless sensors. In this paper we focus on a new replication scheme and compare its performances with some other proposals, previously presented in literature. The schemes share some model assumptions, in terms of network and adversary attack strategy and objective...|$|E

However, the cloud server providers are not fully trusted. Whether the data over cloud servers are intact becomes a major concern of data owners. To offer cloud users with the capacity of data integrity verification, recently, Chen proposed a remote data possession checking (RDPC) protocol from algebraic signatures which achieves many desirable features such as high efficiency, short length of challenges and responses, non-block verification. Unfortunately, in this paper, {{we find that the}} protocol is vulnerable to replay attack and <b>deletion</b> <b>attack</b> launched by a dishonest server. Specifically, the server can deceive the users to believe that their data are well hold by replaying a previous evidence or re-constructing the deleted data blocks from the corresponding tags in the integrity checking process, while their data have been partially discarded in fact. Then, we present an improved scheme to fix the security flaws of the original protocol. Both the theoretical analysis and the implementation results show that the improvement is secure and practical.

40|$|In {{the study}} of content {{authentication}} and tamper detection of digital text documents, a novel English text zero-watermarking approach based on probabilistic patterns proposed in this paper. Hidden Markov model was presented, and the core algorithm of the watermark generation and detection was designed in this paper. In the proposed approach, Hidden Markov model letter-level based of order one was constructed for text analysis and watermark generation based on interrelationship between contents of host text document by using the two-dimensional matrix coordinate of probabilistic weights of states and transitions. However, we can extracted this watermark later using extraction and detection algorithm to identify the status of text document such as authentic, tampered, etc. Furthermore, the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed algorithm was proved with algorithm experiments and comparative with other recently approach under random insertion and <b>deletion</b> <b>attacks</b> in localized and dispersed form on 6 text datasets of varying length. Results showed that our proposed algorithm is more secure, had better robustness, and always detects tampering attacks occurred randomly on text even when the tampering volume is low or high...|$|R
40|$|Abstract —  The use of {{relational}} databases {{is growing}} rapidly {{over the internet}} and also in many applications worldwide and so it faces various issues like ownership right issues, tampering issues and many more. In this paper we present a technique which can eradicate these issues using the SHA 512 signature generation technique in which we embed a watermark in the tuples of the database without changing the original data. That is by adding an extra column of signature bit to the database. This technique is resilient {{to all sorts of}} attacks on the databases which include <b>deletion</b> <b>attack,</b> alteration attack, and insertion attack too. We use a checksum to verify the tampering in the database. This checksum verifies the signature extracted. The database signature is then encrypted with public key using RSA algorithm to obtain security and authorization. This paper shows the implementation of our technique experimentally and also proves it better than the existing systems as we have compared our system with already existing systems which clearly shows the merits of our system. The advantage of our system is that it doesn’t change the original data unlike all other watermarking techniques that modify the bits in the tuples which may alter the usefulness of the data.

Target sets specify minimal changes on the current state of the debate that are required to achieve such goals, where changes are the addition and/or <b>deletion</b> of <b>attacks</b> among ar-guments.

30|$|In recent years, {{along with}} the rapid {{promotion}} and popularization of network technology and digital communication technology in the world, digital images, and digital video-based digital images have become an important medium for information storage and transmission in the computer network in the civil and military fields. However, network security issues have long been an important factor that plagued and restricted the development of network technology. Especially {{in the context of}} the information resources of the public and government departments, how to realize the data security protection in the computer network is the important content and direction of the research in the field of network security and information security. Among them, digital image and digital video have become the important content of data transmission in the network by virtue of its intuitiveness and convenience. Therefore, the security protection of digital images has received great attention from all parties. Especially in the background of the increasingly severe network security situation in recent years, information transmission and sharing based on digital images often face the problems of data theft, tampering, <b>deletion,</b> and <b>attack,</b> which have caused great losses to the owners or publishers of digital images.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} text {{watermarking}} scheme that embeds a bitstream watermark Wi {{in a text}} document P preserving the meaning, context, and flow of the document. The document {{is viewed as a}} set of paragraphs, each paragraph being a set of sentences. The sequence of paragraphs and sentences used to embed watermark bits is permuted using a secret key. Then, English language sentence transformations are used to modify sentence lengths, thus embedding watermarking bits in the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of the sentences' cardinalities. The embedding and extracting algorithms are public, while the secrecy and security of the watermark depends on a secret key K. The probability of False Positives is extremely small, hence avoiding incidental occurrences of our watermark in random text documents. Majority voting provides security against text addition, <b>deletion,</b> and swapping <b>attacks,</b> further reducing the probability of False Positives. The scheme is secure against the general attacks on text watermarks such as reproduction (photocopying, FAX), reformatting, synonym substitution, text addition, text deletion, text swapping, paragraph shuffling and collusion attacks. 9 page(s...|$|R

T cells were engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with predefined binding and CD 3 ζ signaling to initiate T-cell activation. CD 28 costimulation {{provided by a}} CD 28 -CD 3 ζ signaling CAR moreover improved T cell activation and persistence; however, it {{failed to meet the}} expectations with respect to mounting attacks against solid tumors infiltrated with regulatory T (Treg) cells. We revealed that a CD 28 CAR–redirected T-cell attack is accompanied by higher numbers of Treg cells infiltrating the tumor and is less efficient against cancer cells in presence of Treg cells than a CD 3 ζ CAR T-cell <b>attack.</b> <b>Deletion</b> of the lck binding moiety in the CD 28 CAR endodomain, however, improved redirected anti-tumor activity in presence of Treg cells without impairing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion, proliferation, and cytolysis. CD 28 modification abrogated interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) induction upon CAR engagement which in turn is no longer available to sustain Treg cell persistence. CARs with the modified CD 28 endodomain thereby expedite the implementation of adoptive T-cell therapy in patients with a variety of cancer types that are heavily infiltrated by Treg cells...|$|R
40|$|Numeric set {{watermarking}} {{is a way}} {{to provide}} ownership proof for numerical data. Numerical data can be considered to be primitives for multimedia types such as images and videos since they are organized forms of numeric information. Thereby, the capability to watermark numerical data directly implies the capability to watermark multimedia objects and discourage information theft on social networking sites and the Internet in general. Unfortunately, there has been very limited research done in the field of numeric set watermarking due to underlying limitations in terms of number of items in the set and LSBs in each item available for watermarking. In 2009, Gupta et al. proposed a numeric set watermarking model that embeds watermark bits in the items of the set based on a hash value of the items' most significant bits (MSBs). If an item is chosen for watermarking, a watermark bit is embedded in the least significant bits, and the replaced bit is inserted in the fractional value to provide reversibility. The authors show their scheme to be resilient against the traditional subset addition, <b>deletion,</b> and modification <b>attacks</b> as well as secondary watermarking attacks. In this paper, we present a bucket attack on this watermarking model. The attack consists of creating buckets of items with the same MSBs and determine if the items of the bucket carry watermark bits. Experimental results show that the bucket attack is very strong and destroys the entire watermark with close to 100 % success rate. We examine the inherent weak nesses in the watermarking model of Gupta et al. that leave it vulnerable to the bucket attack and propose potential safeguards that can provide resilience against this attack. 8 page(s...|$|R
