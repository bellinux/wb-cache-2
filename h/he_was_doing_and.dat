5|$|Tchaikovsky {{remained}} friendly {{but never}} intimate {{with most of}} The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from {{them as well as}} from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the Moscow Conservatory offered to him by Nikolai Rubinstein, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the Belyayev circle took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
25|$|Eliyahu was a {{favorite}} of the Baba Sali, who lived nearby in Netivot. One day, the latter insisted Eliyahu stop whatever <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> come visit him for a glass of arak. Not wishing to upset the holy man, Eliyahu accepted the invitation, only to find out later that a disgruntled ex-litigant had gone to the beth din seeking to do him harm.|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{points out}} that, {{although}} it was said half-jokingly, so far as Shankly was concerned there was a degree of truth in what he had said. Shankly had fully realised the importance of football to its die-hard fans, himself included. It had become [...] "too important". Ian St John agreed that [...] "much of Shankly's behaviour was bizarre", but everything was done with a purpose because [...] "Shankly always knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> what he was saying".|$|E
500|$|The book {{states that}} President Bush [...] "rarely leveled {{with the public}} to explain what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> what should be expected... The {{president}} was rarely the voice of realism on the Iraq war." [...] It also calls him [...] "the nation’s most divisive figure" [...] and described his foreign policy as a failure, saying [...] "He had not rooted out terror wherever it existed... He had not achieved world peace. He had not attained victory in his two wars." [...] At the same time, the book largely supports the 'surge' strategy and lauds the President for adopting it.|$|E
500|$|A year later, Frusciante and {{his mother}} moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new {{stepfather}} who, he says, [...] "really supported me and {{made me feel good}} about being an artist." [...] Like many young people in the area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.|$|E

500|$|According to a Scientology publication, Moxon {{utilized}} Scientology doctrine {{to bring}} about the demise of the Cult Awareness Network. The publication, authored by Scientology official Kurt Weiland, stated: [...] "A civil case was filed by the victim against [...] Ross and the Cult Awareness Network. This time he had an attorney who knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> understood PTS/SP tech! The attorney was a Scientologist and OT [...] Rick Moxon." [...] "PTS/SP tech" [...] is Scientology terminology referring to the organization's founder L. Ron Hubbard's prescribed tactics of handling enemies called [...] "suppressive persons" [...] (SPs) and their associates, called [...] "potential trouble sources" [...] (PTSs). The Cult Awareness Network was seen by Scientology as a [...] "SP" [...] organization.|$|E
500|$|In June 1953, Hayward took {{command of}} the escort carrier [...] He confessed to the crew {{that he did not}} know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> urged any crewman who felt he was doing {{something}} wrong to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was deployed at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruzs chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: [...] "You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, by {{the time}} of his appointment, Rimsky-Korsakov had become painfully aware of his {{technical}} shortcomings as a composer; he later wrote, [...] "I was a dilettante and knew nothing". Moreover, he had come to a creative dead-end upon completing his opera The Maid of Pskov and realized that developing a solid musical technique was {{the only way he could}} continue composing. He turned to Tchaikovsky for advice and guidance. When Rimsky-Korsakov underwent a change in attitude on music education and began his own intensive studies privately, his fellow nationalists accused him of throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally. He told Rimsky-Korsakov that he fully applauded what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} between Ace Bailey and Eddie Shore {{occurred in}} the Boston Garden during the second period of a regular league game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins on December 12, 1933. [...] Having taken two penalties in quick succession, the Maple Leafs were playing short handed, and sent Bailey, Red Horner and King Clancy out to defend against Boston's power play. During that sequence, Clancy upended Shore with a hard check as the later player rushed up the ice. [...] Angry, dazed, and thinking he was going after Clancy, Shore rushed at Bailey intent on revenge. He hit Bailey hard from the side, sending the stricken player flying through the air. [...] Bailey struck the ice head first and lapsed into convulsions. [...] Furious, Horner asked Shore what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> when met with only a smile in response, knocked Shore out cold with one punch.|$|E
500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you treat me wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> if so, that what he was doing was wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} Hitler pathographies comes from the neurologist and psychiatrist Frederick Redlich. Redlich, who emigrated from Austria in 1938 to the United States, {{is considered one of}} the founders of American social psychiatry. In his 1998 published work Hitler: Diagnosis of a Destructive Prophet, on which he worked for 13 years, Redlich came to believe that Hitler had indeed shown enough paranoia and defense mechanisms in order to ”fill a psychiatric textbook with it”, but that he was probably not mentally disturbed. Hitler’s paranoid delusions ”could be seen as symptoms of a mental disorder, but the largest part of the personality worked normal.” Hitler ”knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> he did it with pride and enthusiasm.” ...|$|E

[...] After Gao informed Yao this, Yao's apprehensions were dissolved. [...] In 726, when Zhang Shuo was accused of corruption and arrested, it was Gao that Emperor Xuanzong sent to visit Zhang to see how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>and</b> it was at Gao's subsequent intercession that Zhang's punishment was reduced.|$|E
