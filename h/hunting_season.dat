5|$|The {{scenes of}} walrus, bowhead whale, and caribou hunting are all real. Because the <b>hunting</b> <b>season</b> for caribou, polar bear, walrus, and whale {{occur at the}} same time, the {{production}} was forced {{to spend more than}} a year in the Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) {{in order to get the}} necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out {{the center of the}} log and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of the}} lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and <b>hunting</b> <b>season.</b> Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the <b>hunting</b> <b>season,</b> typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon {{and then leave}} it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is to}} demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E
5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The <b>hunting</b> <b>season</b> begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat {{has long}} been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has {{maintained}} a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when <b>hunting</b> <b>season</b> is generally open.|$|E

40|$|Special <b>hunting</b> <b>seasons</b> {{were first}} {{implemented}} in 1992 {{to help reduce}} {{the growth rate of}} Pennsylvania 2 ̆ 7 s rapidly expanding resident Canada goose (Branta canadensis) population. Special seasons timed to occur before and after fall migration were successful in harvesting resident and not migrant Canada geese. Since 1992, September and late <b>season</b> <b>hunting</b> opportunities have been gradually expanded to include the entire state. The special season harvest of resident Canada geese has increased from about 13, 000 birds in 1992 to over 68, 000 in 1999. Special <b>hunting</b> <b>seasons</b> now account for over 80...|$|R
5|$|The huia {{was found}} {{throughout}} the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. The Māori are estimated to have arrived around 800 years ago, and {{by the arrival of}} European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The <b>hunting</b> <b>season</b> was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a rāhui (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer. It was not until European settlement that the huia's numbers began to decline severely, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.|$|E
5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} <b>hunting</b> <b>season</b> and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
5|$|Within the BWCAW are {{hundreds}} of prehistoric pictographs and petroglyphs on rock ledges and cliffs. The BWCAW {{is part of the}} historic homeland of the Ojibwe people, who traveled the waterways in canoes made of birch bark. Prior to Ojibwe settlement, the area was sparsely populated by the Sioux, who migrated westward following the arrival of the Ojibwe. It is thought that the Hegman Lake Pictograph located on a large overlooking rock wall on North Hegman Lake were most likely created by the Ojibwe. The pictograph appears to represent Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during the early evening, knowledge of which may have been useful for navigating in the deep woods during the winter <b>hunting</b> <b>season.</b> The Grand Portage Indian Reservation, just east of the BWCAW at the community of Grand Portage, is home to a number of Ojibwe to this day.|$|E

40|$|The mid-continent {{population}} of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) {{is the largest}} {{population of}} cranes in North America. <b>Hunting</b> <b>seasons</b> for sandhill cranes were closed in 1916 and gradually resumed in Mexico (1940), the United States (1961), and Canada (1964). As knowledge of the biology of cranes and experience with <b>hunting</b> <b>seasons</b> increased, areas in which hunting was permitted expanded, and by 1992 all but 2 states (Nebraska and Kansas) in the U. S. portion of the Central Flyway conducted sport <b>hunting</b> <b>seasons</b> for this population. In 1993 Kansas resumed <b>hunting</b> and initial <b>seasons</b> were limited to specified geographic areas of the state with relatively restrictive bag limits. Hunting restrictions were influenced {{by the presence of}} whooping cranes (G. americana) and limited public acceptance to the hunting of cranes. As experience with hunting sandhill cranes in Kansas increased, the number of sandhill crane hunters and the crane harvest nearly doubled. However, the illegal take of 2 whooping cranes in 2004 prompted a reassessment of the season structure. This resulted in further delay of the opening date for sandhill crane hunting and the development of additional tools to assist hunters in better discriminating whooping cranes from other hunted species...|$|R
