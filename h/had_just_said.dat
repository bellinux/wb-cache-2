500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by David Silverman. When the episode was originally planned, it called for Albert Brooks to voice [...] "Björn", a Swedish tennis instructor, but Brooks {{thought it would be}} funnier to make the character French and so the change was made. The title was originally to be [...] "Bjorn to Be Wild", thus accounting for the episode's alternate title [...] "Jacques to Be Wild". Brooks improvised almost all of his dialogue, producing over three hours of material. Marge's laugh during her bowling lesson was an ad-libbed, natural laugh by Julie Kavner, who was laughing at something Albert Brooks <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> The line [...] "four onion rings!" [...] was one of the many lines that Brooks ad-libbed and when saying it, Jacques loses his French accent. An extended audio clip of Albert Brooks' unused dialogue was made available on Disc Three of The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD.|$|E
2500|$|Hellena, who {{has seen}} and heard {{everything}} Willmore said, comes out of hiding and pretends as if nothing has transpired. As Willmore begins to flirt with her again, Angellica enters, masked, and sees Willmore betraying the vows he made to her. Hellena finally reveals her face to Willmore, who praises her beauty. This is the last straw for Angellica. She orders one of her servants {{to find out who}} Hellena is and storms out. Hellena asks what Willmore was doing in Angellica's house; he denies that anything transpired. Hellena then attacks him, quoting to him what he <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> about Angellica [...] She makes Willmore promise never to see Angellica again.|$|E

"I <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to Dick McMullen, 'Be {{sure not}} to fire until they reach that mullein stalk,' when a commotion {{in the rear of}} our line caused me to look behind us, and to my dismay, my eyes rested upon the largest line of cavalry I had ever seen. There seemed to be no end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in our {{immediate}} rear I know not, and from what direction they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance. Major [...] Boyd, commanding our regiment, quickly said: 'We are prisoners,' {{and that was the end}} of the Nineteenth Virginia Infantry as a body of armed soldiers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{said that}} Abram's father Terah {{manufactured}} idols (as [...] implies), and once Terah went away and left Abram {{to mind the}} store. A man came and asked to buy an idol. Abram asked the man how old he was. The man replied that he was 50 years old. Abram exclaimed {{that it was a}} shame that a man of 50 would worship a day-old object. The man became embarrassed and left. On another occasion, a woman came with a plate of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols. Abram took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol's hand. When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he had done. Abram told Terah that the idols fought among themselves to be fed first, and the largest broke the others with the stick. Terah asked Abram why he made sport of him, for the idols had no consciousness. Abram replied by asking Terah to listen to what he <b>had</b> <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> Thereupon Terah seized Abram and delivered him to Nimrod, king of Shinar. Nimrod proposed that they worship the fire. Abram replied that they should rather worship water, which extinguishes fire. Nimrod agreed to worship water. Abram replied that they should rather worship clouds, which bear the water. Nimrod agreed to worship the clouds. Abram replied that they should rather worship the winds, which disperse the clouds. Nimrod agreed to worship the wind. Abram replied that they should rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind. Nimrod then accused Abram of just bandying words, and decreed that they would worship nothing but the fire. Nimrod cast Abram into the fire, challenging Abram's God to save him from it. Haran was standing there undecided. Haran thought to himself that if Abram survived, then Haran would say that he was of Abram's faith, but if Nimrod was victorious, then Haran would say that he was on Nimrod's side. When Abram descended into the fiery furnace, God saved him. Nimrod then asked Haran whose belief he shared. Haran replied that he shared Abram's faith. Thereupon Nimrod cast Haran into the fire, and he died in his father's presence, as [...] reports, [...] "And Haran died in the presence of ( [...] , al pene) his father Terah." ...|$|E
