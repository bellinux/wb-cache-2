25|$|The {{circle is}} {{commonly}} used to represent the relationship between diatonic scales. Here, the letters on the circle are taken to represent the major scale with that note as tonic. The numbers {{on the inside of}} the circle show how many sharps or flats the <b>key</b> <b>signature</b> for this scale has. Thus a major scale built on A has 3 sharps in its <b>key</b> <b>signature.</b> The major scale built on F has 1 flat.|$|E

50|$|Put another way: for <b>key</b> <b>signatures</b> with sharps, {{the first}} sharp {{is placed on}} F with {{subsequent}} sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for <b>key</b> <b>signatures</b> with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional <b>key</b> <b>signatures,</b> with up to seven sharps or flats and including the empty signature of C major (A minor).|$|R

25|$|The key {{signatures}} {{found on}} the bottom of the circle of fifths diagram, such as D Major, are often written one way in flats and in another way using sharps. These keys are easily interchanged using enharmonic equivalents. Enharmonic means that the notes sound the same, but are written differently. For example, the <b>key</b> <b>signature</b> of D Major, with five flats, contains the same sounding notes, enharmonically, as C Major (seven sharps).|$|E
25|$|Sung by {{his younger}} brother Carl Wilson, the Beach Boys' {{recording}} was produced and arranged by Brian using an unorthodox selection of instruments, including French horn, accordions, sleigh bell, harpsichord, and a quartet of violas and cellos heard throughout the piece in counterpoint. The musical structure has been variously cited for its harmonic complexity, inspiring tension through its disuse of authentic cadences and a definite <b>key</b> <b>signature.</b> Its closing section features perpetual rounds, a device that was not normally heard in popular music of the era.|$|E

50|$|It {{is based}} on seven Romanian tunes from Transylvania, {{originally}} played on fiddle or shepherd's flute. The original name for the piece was titled Romanian Folk Dances from Hungary (Magyarországi román népi táncok) but was later changed by Bartók when Romania annexed Transylvania in 1918-1920. It is nowadays available in the 1971 edition which is written with <b>key</b> <b>signatures</b> although Bartók rarely ever wrote <b>key</b> <b>signatures.</b>|$|R
25|$|Schoenberg did {{not arrive}} {{immediately}} at the serial method. His first chamber work, the string sextet Verklärte Nacht, was mostly a late German romantic work, {{though it was}} bold in its use of modulations. The first work that was frankly atonal was the second string quartet; the last movement of this quartet, which includes a soprano, has no <b>key</b> <b>signature.</b> Schoenberg further explored atonality with Pierrot Lunaire, for singer, flute or piccolo, clarinet, violin, cello and piano. The singer uses a technique called Sprechstimme, halfway between speech and song.|$|E
25|$|Because all saxophones use {{the same}} key {{arrangement}} and fingering to produce a given notated pitch, {{it is not difficult}} for a competent player to switch among the various sizes when the music has been suitably transposed, and many do so. Since the baritone and alto are pitched in E, players can read concert pitch music notated in the bass clef by reading {{it as if it were}} treble clef and adding three sharps to the <b>key</b> <b>signature.</b> This process, referred to as clef substitution, makes it possible for the Eb instruments to play from parts written for baritone horn, bassoon, euphonium, string bass, trombone, or tuba. This can be useful if a band or orchestra lacks one of those instruments.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} Western notation, {{the scale}} {{used for a}} composition is usually indicated by a <b>key</b> <b>signature</b> at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes {{the relationship of the}} overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.|$|E

25|$|Schoenberg's {{music from}} 1908 onward {{experiments}} {{in a variety}} of ways with the absence of traditional keys or tonal centers. His first explicitly atonal piece was the second string quartet, Op. 10, with soprano. The last movement of this piece has no <b>key</b> <b>signature,</b> marking Schoenberg's formal divorce from diatonic harmonies. Other important works of the era include his song cycle Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten, Op. 15 (1908–1909), his Five Orchestral Pieces, Op. 16 (1909), the influential Pierrot Lunaire, Op. 21 (1912), as well as his dramatic Erwartung, Op. 17 (1909). The urgency of musical constructions lacking in tonal centers, or traditional dissonance-consonance relationships, however, can be traced as far back as his Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9 (1906), a work remarkable for its tonal development of whole-tone and quartal harmony, and its initiation of dynamic and unusual ensemble relationships, involving dramatic interruption and unpredictable instrumental allegiances; many of these features would typify the timbre-oriented chamber music aesthetic of the coming century.|$|E
25|$|A savant {{syndrome}} {{is described as}} a person with a low IQ but who has superior performance in one particular field. Sloboda, Hermelin and O'Connor (1985) discussed a patient, NP, who was able to memorize very complex musical pieces after hearing them three or four times. NP's performance exceeded that of experts with very high IQs. However, his performance on other memory tasks was average for a person with an IQ in his range. They used NP to suggest that high IQ is not needed for the skill of musical memorization and in fact, other factors must be influencing this performance. Miller (1987) also studied a 7 year old child who was said to be a musical savant. This child had superior short term memory for music that was found to be influenced by the attention given to the complexity of the music, the <b>key</b> <b>signature,</b> and repeated configurations within a string. Miller (1987) suggests that a savant's ability is due to encoding the information into already existing meaningful structures in long term memory.|$|E
25|$|Mozart {{always had}} a gift for {{absorbing}} and adapting valuable features of others' music. His travels helped in the forging of a unique compositional language. In London as a child, he met J.C. Bach and heard his music. In Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna he met with other compositional influences, {{as well as the}} avant-garde capabilities of the Mannheim orchestra. In Italy he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which deeply affected the evolution of his own practice. In London and Italy, the galant style was in the ascendent: simple, light music with a mania for cadencing; an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other harmonies; symmetrical phrases; and clearly articulated partitions in the overall form of movements. Some of Mozart's early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are homotonal (all three movements having the same <b>key</b> <b>signature,</b> with the slow middle movement being in the relative minor). Others mimic the works of J.C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms turned out by Viennese composers.|$|E

25|$|The third (or {{technically}} {{fourth or}} fifth) primary melody {{in a march}} is called the trio. The trio is described as the main melody of the march. It is often played legato style in a softer dynamic, and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. The trio is the most contrasting section, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains. The trio melody is often repeated once at a softer dynamic, or not repeated at all and goes right to the next section. Generally, it is played quietly for the first (or second) playthrough, then the next has a piccolo playing over the trio melody, and in the final playthrough, it is loud. In almost all cases, the trio modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning one flat {{is added to the}} <b>key</b> <b>signature.</b> Again, this is for the purpose of contrast and makes the trio more memorable to the listener. The fact that the key is now flatter also offers a more relaxing feel for those trios with softer instrumentation. For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major. This key is maintained {{to the end of the}} piece.|$|E
