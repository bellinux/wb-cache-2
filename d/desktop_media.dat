We find that small-value loads-loads with small-value operands of 8 bits or less-are common across 52 applications from the <b>desktop,</b> embedded, and <b>media</b> domains. We show that the relative occurrences of small-value loads remain fairly stable during the program execution. Moreover, we establish that the frequency of small-value loads are almost independent of compiler and input data. We then introduce the concept of small-value caches (SVC) to compactly store small-value memory words. We show that SVCs provide significant speedup and reduce the overall energy dissipation with negligible chip-area overhead...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{multimedia}} systems {{deal with}} only a few basic media: text, graphics, audio and video. However, many other types of media, such as ultrasound, infrared and RF signals, can be represented by streams of data samples and processed within multimedia applications. In this paper, we introduce some of these new media domains and identify interesting opportunities enabled by their software-based processing. We also describe our SpectrumWare testbed for experimenting with these new media types and report on our experience to date. We believe {{that the time has come}} to broaden the scope of `multimedia' to include any form of sampled information. Advances in processor and analog-todigital conversion technology have brought raw sample streams within the grasp of <b>desktop</b> computers and <b>media</b> processing systems. Coupling these new media types with software-based processing allows the construction of virtual devices that can handle different sample sources, modify their behavior based on in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} several decades, {{computer}} architecture research has largely benefited from, {{and continues to be}} driven by ad-hoc benchmarking. Often the benchmarks are selected to represent workloads that architects believe should run on the computational platforms they design. For example, benchmark suites such as SPEC, Winstone, and MediaBench, which represent workstation, <b>desktop</b> and <b>media</b> workloads respectively, have influenced computer architecture innovation for the last decade. Recently, advances in VLSI technology have created an increasing interest within the computer architecture community to build a new kind of processor that is more flexible than extant general purpose processors. Such new processor architectures must efficiently support a broad class of applications including graphics, networking, and signal processing in addition to the traditional desktop workloads. Thus, given the new focus on flexibility demands, a new benchmark suite and new metrics are necessary to accurately reflect the goals of the architecture community. This paper thus proposes (i) VersaBench as a new benchmark suite, and (ii) a new Versatility measure to characterize architectural flexibility, or in other words, the ability of the architecture to effectively execute a wide array of workloads. The benchmark suite is composed of applications drawn from several domains including desktop, server, stream, and bit-level processing. The Versatility measure is a single scalar metric inspired by the SPEC paradigm. It normalizes processor performance on each benchmark by that of the highest-performing machine for that application. This paper reports the measured versatility for several existing processors, as well as for some new and emerging research processors. The benchmark suite is freely distributed, and we are actively cataloging and sharing results for various reference processors. 1...|$|R
30|$|Some {{programs}} {{were held to}} research how the smart classroom should be {{and what will happen}} to teaching and learning in the smart classroom. University of Minnesota’s new, technology-enhanced learning spaces project constructed the Active Learning Classrooms (ALCs) (Whiteside et al. 2010). In the ALCs, the classrooms featured a number of large circular tables, each of which accommodated nine students and had three laptop computer connections to large LCD screens to facilitate collaborative work. The ALCs featured 360 -degree glass marker boards around the edges. Technology Rich Classrooms Program in Kansas is funded through the competitive portion of Title IID. The Minimum Classroom Equipment include 2 : 1 student to computer ratio (laptops or <b>desktops),</b> interactive whiteboard, <b>media</b> projector, digital still camera, printer, scanner, Internet access and software to support instruction and curriculum projects (The Free Library 2007). Although the equipment and appearance of the above classrooms are different, they are all aim to build an open, interactive, flexible and media-rich instruction environment to support the individual or collaborative learning in schools.|$|R
40|$|Decoupled {{architectures}} are fine-grain processors that partition {{the memory}} access and execute functions {{in a computer}} program and exploit the parallelism between the two functions. Although some concepts from the traditional decoupled access execute paradigm made its way into commercial processors, they encountered resistance in general-purpose applications because these applications are not very structured and regular. However, multimedia applications have recently become a dominant workload on <b>desktops</b> and workstations. <b>Media</b> applications are very structured and regular and lend themselves well to the decoupling concept. In this paper, we present an architecture that decouples the useful/true computations from the overhead/supporting instructions in media applications. The proposed scheme is incorporated into an out-of-order general-purpose processor enhanced with SIMD extensions. Explicit hardware support is provided to exploit instruction level parallelism in the overhead component. Performance evaluation shows that such hardware can significantly improve performance over conventional SIMD enhanced general-purpose processors. Results on nine multimedia benchmarks show that the proposed MediaBreeze architecture provides a 1. 05 x to 16. 7 x performance improvement over a 2 -way out-oforder SIMD machine. On introducing slip-based data prefetching, a performance improvement up to 28 x is observed...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{technology}} {{has had a}} significant impact on the ways in which music information can be stored, transmitted, and used. Within the information sciences, music information retrieval has become an increasingly important and complex field. This brief article is addressed primarily to those involved in the design and implementation of systems for storing and retrieving digital files containing musical notation, recorded music, and relevant metadata – hereinafter referred to as a Music Information Retrieval System (“MIRS”). In particular, this group includes information specialists, software engineers, and the attorneys who advise them. Although peer-to-peer computer applications, such as Napster’s MusicShare or the Kazaa <b>Media</b> <b>Desktop,</b> can be conceived of as creating a MIRS, my analysis focuses on MIRS designed or operated by an entity that takes responsibility for choosing and controlling the music information stored in the system. Examples would include digital music collections stored in research libraries or on university intranets, as well as commercial systems with similar design features. This article describes how certain provisions of U. S. intellectual property law apply to MIRSs and mentions relevant law in the European Union for purposes of comparison. The focus is on U. S. copyright law, with very brief mention of U. S. patent and trade secret law. Additionally, the article mentions proposed legislation for database protection, which already exists in the European Union. Enactment of such legislation could be very significant for developers and operators of MIRS...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years CTA has collaborated with other {{organizations}} in a training programme focusing on improving the communication capabilities of ACP countries in the field of agriculture. The main aim of the programme is {{to bridge the gap between}} research and development by providing trainees with the communication skills needed to transfer knowledge and technologies more effectively. In the course of last year, CTA sponsored or jointly organized four workshops on scientific writing, two on desktop publishing and one on the production of extension materials. Scientific writing workshop for agricultural researchers In Africa, workshops were organized in Benin (14 - 25 November) and Kenya (9 - 20 January 1995). These workshops provide information on publishing procedures, choosing appropriate journals and liaising with the editors, planning and writing papers, and oral and poster presentations. The workshop in Benin was attended by 35 participants from 15 African countries (12 anglophone and 23 francophone). It was run in two languages, with two sets of resource persons, an approach which has proved effective in West Africa where many English and French-speaking scientists are working alongside each other on the same topic. The Kenya workshop was held at ICRAF headquarters and attended by 27 participants from eight countries in Eastern and Southern Africa. The participants suggested that these courses should be longer to cover all topics adequately, and that some scientists should be trained to run similar courses at national or regional level. The workshops in the Caribbean were part of a series being organized by CARDI and sponsored by CTA. They cover the principles of communication, writing style for technical publications, and scientific conventions in data presentation, and put the emphasis on practical exercises. The participants included researchers and trainers in agricultural research institutions, government departments the private sector and regional organizations. The workshop in Belize (22 - 25 November) was attended by 13 researchers from the Belize College of Agriculture, CARDI, the ministry and the private sector. The Jamaica workshop (28 November - 1 December) was attended by 16 participants from the University of West Indies, CARDI, the government departments and the private sector. In their evaluation reports, the participants suggested that these workshops should be longer and that courses on specific subjects such as biometry, data handling and oral presentations should be organized. Desktop publishing courses With current developments in electronic <b>media,</b> <b>desktop</b> publishing is now the most cost-effective system for producing printed materials. Participants in the desktop publishing courses in which CTA is involved are editors and publications production staff from research and development institutes, government departments and NGOs. The course in Nigeria (1 - 20 August) was held at NEARLS headquarters and was sponsored entirely by CTA. It was attended by 10 participants from several Nigerian agricultural research institutes. To qualify for the course, the participants had to have prior knowledge of word-processing and access to appropriate equipment in their institutes. The course modules were followed by practical exercises and a test. In the Senegal course (12 - 30 September) sponsored by CTA and ARESAF and attended by 15 participants from francophone countries in Africa, the emphasis was on hands-on experience. Each participant had access to a personal computer and a printer. This enabled participants to practise using the applications covered in the course until they felt confident that they had mastered them.
