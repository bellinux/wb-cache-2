50|$|Here {{the spear}} shaft is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} buoy. It is loosely fitted to the gun as well while hunting, but after the spear is fired its force of movement detaches the line from the gun. The spearfisher is then able to subdue the fish from the buoy or <b>float</b> <b>line</b> while retaining possession of his gun. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the gun {{can be used to}} push off sharks or signal the boat driver, and secondly to prevent loss of the gun should the fish break the line, or should the spearfisher lose grip on the buoy. This setup can be used in conjunction with elastic bungee-style rope and a body board style float with locking cleats. This respectively maintains constant pressure on the fish and allows the spearfisher to rest while being towed around. They can then gather the bungee line as the fish tires and lock it off in order to gradually pull the fish closer.|$|E
50|$|Drift dives can be {{done from}} the shore, but this {{requires}} some form of transport {{to pick up the}} divers where they come ashore, which is usually not accurately predictable, so it is more commonly done from a boat, which will follow the group and pick up divers as they surface. It may be possible to follow the divers by watching the bubbles, but a more reliable method is for the dive leader to tow a surface marker buoy, and for all the divers of the group to follow the leader. If a diver or buddy pair finds it necessary to surface before the leader they will ascend up the <b>float</b> <b>line</b> if possible, as this will surface them where the boat crew expects and is watching. Divers that are separated from the group are generally advised to deploy a decompression buoy and ascend on the their own line, as the buoy will alert the surface crew to a separate group, and will also help other boat traffic to notice and avoid running the divers down as they reach the surface.|$|E

40|$|December 13 - 14, 2006 Siam City Hotel, Bangkok, ThailandSea turtle bycatch {{issues are}} of special concern in tuna {{longline}} fisheries. To avoid sea turtle bycatch, {{we developed a}} mid-water float system, which is a method of setting the longline hooks at almost the same depth. When enough long <b>float</b> <b>line</b> was deployed with the mid-water float system (the mid-F system), all hooks could be set in water deeper than where sea turtle predominantly forage and in the depth of tuna habitat. Sea trials of full scale longline gear with mid-water float and long <b>float</b> <b>line</b> (long FL) were {{carried out in the}} Indian Ocean in December 2005. One mid-water float (buoyancy of 2200 gf or 2560 gf) was attached to the center of one-basket mainline, both ends of which were hung with two long float lines (100 m). The conventional longline setting (the length of float lines were 40 m) without any mid-water float was also conducted as a control. The mainline with long float lines were set at a depth from 125 m to 175 m. The depth range of hooks with mid-F system was at most 50 m, while that of the conventional longline setting was over 125. 5 m. The mid-F & long FL system allowed all hooks to be set at sufficient depth for capture of tuna, with an associated avoidance of sea turtle bycatch as well as more effective tuna catch...|$|E

Traditional fishermen also applied gill net for catching flying fish. The flying fish gill net suspected to put an extra effort in reducing fish population. This research aimed to evaluate the gill net design and construction for flying fish in the South Galesong sub-district, Takalar district. The research conducted from February to March 2010 in the South Galesong sub-district, Takalar district by using survey method. Samples were selected randomly 10 percent approximately.
