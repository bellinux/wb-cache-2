5|$|Beginning {{with the}} July 5 Battle of Osan, US troops began a {{continuous}} and unsuccessful ground {{campaign against the}} North Koreans, {{and many of the}} US air assets were used in close air support and airstrike roles to aid the faltering <b>ground</b> <b>troops.</b> From this point on bombers mounted strategic bombing missions against military targets of all types supporting the North Korean <b>ground</b> <b>troops,</b> including ports, armor concentrations and supply stockpiles. A massive interdiction campaign ensued which would have implications for the upcoming conflicts. As more US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps aviation assets arrived in the country, they increased their interdiction campaigns for several days striking bridges and strategic areas though going mostly unthreatened by the North Korean Air Force, though at least one F-80 was lost when it hit power lines during a bombing run.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{persuaded the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. <b>ground</b> <b>troops</b> and war {{planes in the}} nation.

5|$|However, {{with the}} {{widespread}} support from various countries, the Philippines finally changed its policy. After Timorese Independence, the Philippines contributed medical and logistics personnel to Interfet, rather than <b>ground</b> <b>troops.</b> The UN named a Filipino, Lieutenant General Jaime delos Santos, {{to command the}} full-fledged UN peacekeeping force which takes over from Interfet on Tuesday.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands {{saw some}} of the {{earliest}} mass paratroop drops, to occupy tactical points and assist the advance of <b>ground</b> <b>troops.</b> The German Luftwaffe used paratroopers in the capture of several airfields in the vicinity of Rotterdam and The Hague, helping to quickly overrun the nation and immobilise Dutch forces.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean <b>ground</b> <b>troops,</b> {{unprepared}} for the aggressive use of US air power and untrained in countering it, continued to operate tightly packed convoys on open roads, allowing the US air forces to attack and ravage them repeatedly. From July 7 to 9, an estimated 197 trucks and 44 T-34 tanks were destroyed between Seoul and Pyongtaek. Though they subsequently won ground engagements at the Battle of Pyongtaek and Battle of Chonan, the North Korean <b>ground</b> <b>troops</b> were taking heavy losses from US air forces. On a few occasions, the UN airpower made mistakes, such as a July 3 bombing by No. 77 Squadron RAAF that hit a South Korean convoy near Suwon. At the same time, UN aircraft began flying at higher altitudes because combined small arms fire from North Korean ground targets was taking a heavier toll on UN aircraft. By mid July, these aircraft were flying up to 200 sorties a day to support UN <b>ground</b> <b>troops,</b> who by this point were losing the Battle of Chochiwon and the Battle of Taejon. By {{the start of the}} Battle of Pusan Perimeter, the air battle for South Korea had been won by the UN, and it used its air superiority decisively to its advantage during that battle. The UN would remain unopposed in the skies until the Chinese forces entered the war in November of that year.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Korean War, Leyte was ordered to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting <b>ground</b> <b>troops</b> at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds despite the efforts of wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Bulge, a German counteroffensive during World War II, {{starting}} December 16, 1944, {{was marked}} by heavy snowstorms that hampered allied air support for <b>ground</b> <b>troops,</b> but also impaired German attempts to supply their front lines. On the Eastern Front with the Nazi invasion of Russia in 1941, Operation Barbarossa, both Russian and German soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the Russian winter. While use of ski infantry was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only one division for movement on skis.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970. This time the measure made it through both houses of Congress and became law on 22 December. As a result, all U.S. <b>ground</b> <b>troops</b> and advisors were barred from participating in military actions in Laos or Cambodia, while the air war being conducted in both countries by the U.S. Air Force was ignored.|$|E

After returning to the United States, she was decommissioned and placed in the mothball fleet in 1946.

5|$|According to Russian expert Anton Lavrov, on 8 August, Russian and South Ossetian troops {{deployed}} in South Ossetia were unaware that Russian aviation {{was involved in}} the war. Russian troops and South Ossetians often assessed Russian aircraft as hostile and fired at them before precise identification took place. On 8 August, the air force performed 63 flights in support of Russian <b>ground</b> <b>troops.</b> A total of six Russian aircraft were lost during the war: one Su-25SM, two Su-25BMs, two Su-24Ms and one Tu-22M3; friendly fire was the cause of the downing of three planes. Lavrov denies that the downed Tu-22M was used for reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|After a {{succession}} of counterattacks, {{toward the end of}} August the Libyans finally drove the 400 Chadian soldiers out of the town. This victory–the first by Libyan ground forces {{since the start of the}} Toyota War–was apparently achieved through close-range air strikes, which were followed by <b>ground</b> <b>troops</b> advancing cross-country in jeeps, Toyota all-terrain trucks, and light armored vehicles. For the Libyans, who had previously relied on ponderous tracked armour, the assault represented a conversion to the desert warfare tactics developed by FANT. To highlight the victory, Gaddafi flew foreign journalists to the region, so the news of his victory could reach the headlines.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the <b>ground</b> <b>troops</b> seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed {{in the span of}} two weeks.|$|E

5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their <b>troops</b> on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Troop</b> morale had sharply declined {{as a result}} of the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months.

5|$|During World War II, she {{was used}} to lay mines in the North Sea, to provide gunfire support to <b>ground</b> <b>troops,</b> and as a convoy escort and {{training}} ship for cadets. She participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940, Her wartime career ended in Kiel in April 1945, when British bombers badly damaged the ship while she was in dock for repairs. Her crew ran her aground to prevent her from sinking, and ultimately blew her up with demolition charges to prevent the Allies from capturing her in May. The wreck was eventually scrapped in the late 1940s.|$|E
