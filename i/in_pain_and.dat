5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed <b>in</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils <b>in</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} is Troy's {{memorial}} {{service and the}} wedding of Mayor Michael Ebbs (Ralph Fiennes) to Charlie Bratley's mother Terri (Rita Wilson). Lou finally realizes that his son actually has been kidnapped and heads out to look for him. Now at Lee's house, Crystal asks Lee to help stop the kidnapping scheme, {{but he does not}} comply. Crystal goes to Dean's house for help, where she finds him hallucinating about Troy's death and finally expressing his grief. Meanwhile, a paranoid Lee, encouraged by Billy, tries to kill Charlie Bratley to avoid being caught, but Charlie fights back and slices the knife through Billy's eye. Billy runs out into the street, screaming <b>in</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> is hit by Lou's police car.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements <b>in</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham manipulation, or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal manipulation, some describing manipulation as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal manipulation based on low quality evidence. Manipulation under anaesthesia, or medically assisted manipulation, has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Scully {{notices that}} Miles (now on life support) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to {{convince}} Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks down a hallway, rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles <b>in</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls the knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig always seems to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is <b>in</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E
5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps <b>in</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E

50|$|Thoracic outlet {{syndrome}} (TOS) is {{a condition}} in which there is compression of the nerves, arteries, or veins in the passageway from the lower neck to the armpit.
