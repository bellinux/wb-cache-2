5|$|Eadbald died in 640, and {{according}} to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as 'king', suggesting <b>either</b> <b>he</b> was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One suggestion is that the some other version {{of events in the}} 'legend', which give him no title, may have been an attempt to discredit royal claimants from Eormenred's line.|$|E
5|$|Relations between NASA and North American {{deteriorated}} over {{assignment of}} blame. North American argued unsuccessfully {{it was not}} responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design. Finally, Webb contacted Atwood, and demanded <b>either</b> <b>he</b> or Chief Engineer Harrison A. Storms resign. Atwood elected to fire Storms.|$|E
5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} of the offense. <b>Either</b> <b>he</b> or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E

5|$|After the Canadiens were {{eliminated}} {{for the third}} straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante's inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare that for the 1963–64 season <b>either</b> <b>he</b> or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with Phil Goyette and Don Marshall in exchange for Gump Worsley, Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort, and Len Ronson. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He retired in 1965 while playing for the minor-league Baltimore Clippers of the American Hockey League. His wife was ill at the time, and he required surgery on his right knee.|$|E
5|$|As Japan {{began to}} re-establish itself diplomatically, the Hinomaru {{was used as}} a {{political}} weapon overseas. In a visit by the Emperor Hirohito and the Empress Kōjun to the Netherlands, the Hinomaru was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that <b>either</b> <b>he</b> be sent home to Japan or tried for the deaths of Dutch prisoners of war during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a new Status of Forces Agreement being negotiated between U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the red flag of revolt.|$|E

He detached Whetstone and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse, which he believed would {{call at the}} port on his voyage to Cartagena, and from there he might raid English and Dutch shipping. After Whetstone had left, Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena, anticipating that <b>either</b> <b>he</b> or Whetstone would find Du Casse and bring him to battle.|$|E

5|$|The Courier is {{notified}} that Caesar's Legion is attacking Hoover Dam, {{and they}} must take part to decide the outcome. As the Legion strikes the Dam, led by the fearsome Legate Lanius, the NCR defends its position under General Lee Oliver. Depending on the faction sided with up to the battle, the Courier will either conquer the Dam for Caesar's Legion, defend it for the NCR or connect the dam's systems to House's network so <b>either</b> <b>he</b> or Yes Man can take control. The game concludes with a narrated slideshow showing and explaining {{the results of the}} Courier's actions, the battle for Hoover Dam deciding the faction that comes to power over New Vegas and the Mojave, and the fates of the various other factions based on how the player negotiated with them and which of the major factions emerged dominant.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to do <b>either.</b> <b>He</b> instead moved to New Hampshire and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E
5|$|After {{the very}} warm {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on a}} damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well <b>either.</b> <b>He</b> took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E

5|$|But Thorpe had not {{abandoned}} football <b>either.</b> <b>He</b> first played {{professional football}} in 1913 {{as a member}} of the Indiana-based Pine Village Pros, a team that had a several-season winning streak against local teams during the 1910s. He then signed with the Canton Bulldogs in 1915. They paid him $250 ($ today) a game, a tremendous wage at the time. Before signing him Canton was averaging 1,200fans a game, but 8,000 showed up for his debut against the Massillon Tigers. The team won titles in 1916, 1917, and 1919. He reportedly ended the 1919 championship game by kicking a wind-assisted 95-yard punt from his team's own 5-yard line, effectively putting the game out of reach. In 1920, the Bulldogs were one of 14teams to form the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which would become the National Football League (NFL) two years later. Thorpe was nominally the APFA's first president, but spent most of the year playing for Canton and a year later was replaced as president by Joseph Carr. He continued to play for Canton, coaching the team as well. Between 1921 and 1923, he helped organize and played for the Oorang Indians (LaRue, Ohio), an all-Native American team. Although the team's record was 3–6 in 1922, and 1–10 in 1923, he played well and was selected for the Green Bay Press-Gazette's first All-NFL team in 1923, which would later be formally recognized by the NFL as the league's official All-NFL team in 1931).|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' {{first version}} of the Chronicon was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: <b>either</b> <b>he</b> found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius {{first version of}} the Chronicon, but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{the fifth}} season's {{production}} period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate – {{especially among the}} production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – {{about the future of}} the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or full-fledged substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that <b>either</b> <b>he</b> or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.|$|E

5|$|Iona is popularly said to {{have been}} the {{traditional}} burial place of Scottish kings from the advent of the Alpínid dynasty. Contemporary evidence for such claims, however, date only to about the twelfth- or thirteenth centuries. The so-called traditions, therefore, appear to have been constructed to advance Iona's prestige as a royal burial site, and may well have been instigated and encouraged by the meic Somairle. Iona was certainly the burial place of Ragnall's later descendants, and leading members of West Highland nobility. The oldest intact building on the island is St Oran's Chapel. Judging from certain Irish influences in its architecture, the chapel is thought to date to about the mid twelfth century. The building is known to have been used as a mortuary house by Ragnall's later descendants, and it is possible that <b>either</b> <b>he</b> or his father were responsible for its erection. On the other hand, {{it is also possible that}} the chapel was constructed by the kings of the Crovan dynasty: either Guðrøðr, who was buried on the island in 1188, or else Guðrøðr's father (Ragnall's maternal-grandfather) Óláfr.|$|E
5|$|Rumours that Prince Albert Victor {{may have}} committed, or been {{responsible}} for, the Jack the Ripper murders were first mentioned in print in 1962. It was later alleged, among others by Stephen Knight in , that Albert Victor fathered {{a child with}} a woman in the Whitechapel district of London, and <b>either</b> <b>he</b> or several high-ranking men committed the murders in an effort to cover up his indiscretion. Though such claims have been repeated frequently, scholars have dismissed them as fantasies, and refer to indisputable proof of the Prince's innocence. For example, on 30 September 1888, when Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were murdered in London, Albert Victor was over 500miles (over 800km) away at Balmoral, the royal retreat in Scotland, in the presence of Queen Victoria, other family members, visiting German royalty and a large number of staff. According to the official Court Circular, family journals and letters, newspaper reports and other sources, he could not have been near any of the murders. Other fanciful conspiracy theories are that he died of syphilis or poison, that he was pushed off a cliff on the instructions of Lord Randolph Churchill or that his death was faked to remove him from the line of succession.|$|E
