40|$|Our goal is unassisted machine {{interpretation}} of a single line drawing of an engineering object (with hidden lines removed) as a B-rep model. As part of this process, we seek to deduce a frontal geometry of the object, a 3 D geometric realisation of {{that part of the}} object visible in the drawing. Inflation takes a drawing in which all lines have been line-labelled, and creates the frontal geometry by adding a z-coordinate to the x- and y-coordinates of each junction. This depth information comes from compliance functions, interpretations of drawing features expressed as equations in junction z-coordinates. We examine several compliance functions, and assessing their use in {{interpretation of}} engineering objects. We also describe a compliance function based on junction labels, and remove its previous restriction to trihedral vertices. We give a comparative analysis of applying combinations of compliance functions to a set of test drawings. As a result, we recommend using edge parallelism in combination with either corner orthogonality or <b>junction</b> <b>label</b> pairs, the latter being more reliable in general.

In the present project we investigated the distribution of big-h 3 protein in the cornea of primary GCD (PGCD), recurrent GCD (RGCD) and following epithelial debridement of RGCD. Methods The distribution of big-h 3 protein was studied in 2 PGCDs, 2 RGCDs, and in epithelial debridement specimens from 2 RCGD corneas. The corneas were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and embedded in LR white under UV light. The primary antibody big-h 3 was located by secondary, goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with gold. Results In normal cornea moderate distribution of big-h 3 was observed. In PGCD and RGCD corneas, strong labelling for big-h 3 was observed in deposits, within very thin microfilaments (nm) and at the inter-lamellar <b>junctions.</b> <b>Labelling</b> was significantly higher in GCD Descemet’s membrane compared to normal Descemet’s membrane. Very strong labelling was observed in the deposits and in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells, of debridement specimens. Conclusion Big-h 3 protein, of epithelial origin, is thought to diffuse into the stroma to form stromal deposits. The presence of aggregates of the protein around keratocytes {{suggests that it is}} also produced by these cells.

As in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle dystrophin seems to be excluded from membrane above densities that mark adherens junctions. Dystrophin appears as a doublet on Western blots of skeletal and cardiac muscle, and as a single band of lower abundance in smooth muscle that corresponds most closely in molecular weight to the upper band of the striated muscle doublet. The lower band of the doublet in striated muscle appears to lack a portion of the carboxyl terminus and may represent a dystrophin isoform.

Objectives To characterise the cellular mechanisms that regulate and modify spontaneous activity in trigone smooth muscle. Design, setting, and participants Muscle strips from the superficial trigone of male guinea-pigs were used for tension experiments and immunofluorescent studies. Measurements In isolated trigonal cells, intracellular Ca 2 + was measured by epifluorescence microscopy using the fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator Fura- 2. Results and limitations Spontaneous intracellular Ca 2 + transients and contractions were observed in trigonal single cells and strips and were significantly higher compared to the bladder dome. Ca-free superfusate and verapamil terminated spontaneity. T-type Ca 2 + channel block with NiCl 2 depressed slightly Ca 2 + transients but not spontaneous contractions. Neither the BKCa channel blocker iberiotoxin nor the SKCa channel blocker apamin had any effect on single cell activity. By contrast, the Cl− channel blocker niflumic acid attenuated significantly both Ca 2 + transients and muscle contractions. Agonist stimulation (carbachol, phenylephrine) up-regulated activity. Gap <b>junction</b> <b>labelling</b> (Cx 43) was approximately 5 times denser in the trigone than in detrusor smooth muscle.

40|$|Dopamine D 1 -D 5 {{receptor}} protein immunoreactivity and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity {{were investigated}} on the mesenteric arterial tree by immunohistochemistry. The density of various dopamine receptors and TH immunoreactivity was compared between young (6 -month-old), adult (15 -month-old) and senescent (24 -month-old) Fischer 344 rats by computer-assisted microdensitometry. The dopamine D 1 -like (D 1 and D 5) receptors were localized on the tunica media of different sized mesenteric artery branches. The D 2 -like (D 2, D 3 and D 4) receptors {{as well as}} TH immunoreactivity were localized only on the adventitia-media transitional zone of mesenteric arterial tree. Expression of the D 1 and D 5 receptors was decreased in both adult and senescent rats compared to the young rats, suggesting an age-related decline in these receptors. Of the D 2 -like receptors, {{the expression of the}} D 2 receptor was decreased as a function of age, while the D 3 receptor was unchanged in the senescent rats compared to the young rats. Expression of the D 4 receptor was increased in adult, but was unchanged in the senescent rats compared to young animals. TH immunoreactivity was increased as a function of age. The above data suggest that reduction in the D 1, D 2 and D 5 receptor expression may contribute to the deficiency in the dopamine-mediated vasorelaxation and hence blood flow in the mesenteric vascular tree in aging. The different sensitivity to aging of sympathetic neuroeffector <b>junctions</b> <b>labeled</b> by TH and of dopamine D 2 -like receptors that are known to be prejunctional, suggests that age-related changes of dopamine receptor expression in the mesenteric vasculature reflect more complicated mechanisms than simple up- or down-regulation phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Many {{biological}} functions, involve {{assembly of}} proteins. Protein clustering {{has an important}} role in signal transduction through the cell membrane. Model systems that simulate receptor aggregation can be used to monitor oligomerization. Techniques based on homo-FRET can reveal the aggregation state of receptor proteins because homo-FRET causes the fluorescence anisotropy of the system to decrease when the number of identical fluorophores within energy transfer distance increases. Theories that describe these systems apply an assumption of equal fluorescence efficiency for all sites [1, 2], that means emission intensity of fluorophores do not change when in close proximity with each other in a cluster. However, most fluorophores in close proximity show either self-quenching or emission enhancement. Previous theories that were devised to study fractional labelling of proteins were only applicable to cases where the distances between the labels were less than 0. 8 Ro, while in practice the distances between the dyes are more in protein aggregates. Three different systems were chosen to mimic aggregation of fluorescently labelled receptor proteins and analytical expressions were presented for fully labelled and fractionally labelled clusters and the experimental results from the three systems were analyzed. The systems were: a) stochastically labelled BSA containing up to 24 FITC, b) DNA fused trimeric clusters of fluorescein (stochastically labelled), and c) DNA Holliday <b>junctions</b> <b>labelled</b> with fluorescein (in a range of sizes). The inter-probe distances on the DNA constructs were designed to be up to 1. 5 Ro to cover cluster sizes of larger protein clusters. The experimental results showed that: 1) none of the clustered species followed the assumption of equal fluorescence efficiency, 2) by applying the assumption of equal fluorescence efficiency, anisotropies were under-predicted and cluster sizes were under-estimated in systems that show quenching and 3) anisotropy behaviour of a multiply labelled cluster of a particular size depends on the behaviour of the fluorophores and their distance in a cluster. As a result of the theory presented here, the size of larger clusters than currently considered possible can be determined; if they are strongly quenched and their fractional labelling is carefully selected...|$|R
