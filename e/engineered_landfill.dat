Before its opening, Toronto's trash was sent to the Beare Road Landfill in Scarborough, and Vaughan's trash was sent to a site about 1 kilometre north of Keele Valley, north of Teston Road. When it opened, the Keele Valley Landfill was within an almost entirely rural setting, but the rapid growth of Maple in the 1990s surrounded the site with residential developments. The site opened on 28 November 1983 based on an agreement between Metropolitan Toronto and York Region, under which Toronto was required to dispose of York's waste until 2003 in exchange for establishing the Keele Valley site. The site accepted garbage from the area of Toronto west of Yonge Street, whereas garbage from areas east of Yonge Street was sent to the Brock Road Landfills. The York municipalities of King and Georgina continued to dispose of their waste in local landfill for some time, whereas the others paid dumping fees to the city of Toronto for use of the Keele Valley Landfill. The site was originally scheduled to close in 1993, at which time it was expected to reach its capacity of 20 million tonnes.

For <b>engineered</b> <b>landfills,</b> landfill gas migration and leachate contamination to the topsoil are rarely problematic, {{but the lack of}} nutrients and moisture and poor physical soil conditions may jeopardize potential woodland establishment. The growth performance of 25 woody plant species subjected to 12 different soil amelioration and seedlings planting methods was compared. The results showed that the general performance (mortality rate, apical height, crown diameter and basal diameter) of pioneer species (notably Acacia species) was much better than that of native species in all blocks of woodland mix and scrub mix. The notch planting method was effective in helping seedling roots to have better contact with soil for water uptake, which subsequently increased the survival rates of seedlings, leading to a better tree coverage. Soil ameliorations (horticultural soil with fertilizer and horse and pig manure) generally increased the seedling survival rate and improved plant growth. Tree coverage on all the plant trial blocks was mainly established by the three Acacia species. A planting distance of 1 m was recommended for woodland establishment, and such dense seedlings planting would achieve a better tree coverage under a shorter period of time (than the distance of 3 m). Difficulties in woodland establishment were discussed, and the strategies for achieving a better tree growth were recommended. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R
30|$|Artificial {{compaction}} is {{a commonly}} practiced ground improvement technique around the world. Yield stress {{is an important}} parameter to quantify and analyze the strength and compressibility behavior of the artificially compacted clays; such materials are indeed of practical significance in various projects, e.g., <b>engineered</b> <b>landfills,</b> clay liners, etc. The present study aims to investigate the influence of different geotechnical characteristics of compacted clays of wide plasticity range on the compaction induced yield stress, and also to develop the correlational models to quickly predict the yield stress. Three natural clayey soil samples of different geotechnical properties were collected from different sites; 27 more samples of varying index properties were prepared by mixing bentonite with natural soil samples at varying rates. Series of one-dimensional consolidation tests were performed to determine compressibility parameters like yield stress, compression index, and coefficient of volume compressibility. Atterberg’s limits, grain size, compaction characteristics, and compressibility have a significant influence on the compaction induced yield stress. Predictive models of yield stress are also developed by using the plasticity index, optimum water content, and maximum dry unit weight as independent variables. Moreover, developed models are validated based on the independent data.|$|R

It takes particular view on different types of bentonite used in clay liners and their interaction with saline ground water conditions. The swelling pressure of sodium bentonite in deionised water is demonstrated to be very high. However when it is in a saline environment the magnitude of swelling pressure can be less than halved. A parallel observation is noted under conditions of free swell. These are explained as being a consequence of reduction in the double layer thickness which is further reflected in the reduction of cationexchange capacity when the bentonite is in a saline environment. Variations in cation exchange capacity, consistency limit and free swell of the bentonite products in different saline environment are observed and its significance discussed...|$|R

In recent years catastrophic flow failures have also occurred in dumps of municipal refuse {{and even in}} what {{were considered to be}} carefully controlled and well <b>engineered</b> <b>landfills.</b> Apart from the environmental devastation caused by these flows, they are also dangerous to human life and society.

The paper will briefly review some of the more typical flow slides in waste materials, analysing the mechanics of failure and pointing to ways of preventing this type of failure by a combination of sound design and operating procedures. In the case of existing deposits modified operating procedures can be adopted, reducing the probability of failure as well as constructing deflecting structures to protect communities and facilities from the consequences of failure...|$|R

Thermal treatments of red mud samples and their characterisations were investigated under inert (N₂) and oxidative (air) conditions with and without sawdust addition at 200 – 600 °C. After calcination, the resulting samples were analysed using thermogravimetric–infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR) for functional group transformations, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for thermal loss profiles and X-ray diffraction (XRD) for mineral transformations. The characterisation results showed that in N₂ environment, boehmite in red mud was transferred to transition alumina at around 400 °C while losing water from structural components.

Bentonite is attracting a greater attention not only as capping and lining materials in landfills but also as buffer and backfill materials for repositories of high-level nuclear waste around the world. In the design of buffer and backfill materials, {{it is important to}} know the swelling pressures of compacted bentonite with different electrolyte solutions.

To establish a relation between the swell pressure and void ratio of the soil, it is necessary to calculate the mid-plane potential in the diffuse part of the interacting ionic double layers. The difficulty in these calculations is the elliptic integral involved in the relation between half space distance and mid plane potential.
