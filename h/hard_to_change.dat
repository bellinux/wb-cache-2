25|$|After Latvia regained {{independence}} {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union, Liepāja has worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> from a military city into a modern port city (again appearing on European maps after the secrecy of the Soviet period). The commercial port was re-opened in 1991, and in 1994 the last Russian troops left Liepāja. Since then, Liepāja has engaged in international co-operation, has been associated with 10 twin and partner cities, and is an active partner in several co-operation networks. Facilities are being improved. The city is the location of Latvia's largest naval flotilla, the largest warehouses of ammunition and weapons in the Baltic states, and the main supply centre of the Latvian army.|$|E

50|$|Another key {{to having}} success with this tactic is to {{understand}} The {{ins and outs of}} returning a serve and what is involved when choosing to hit down the line as opposed to a crosscourt return. For example, it is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the direction of the ball when it is travelling quickly. Also there is a higher margin of error when hitting the ball crosscourt because the distance between the net and the baseline is longer and the net is lower in the centre where the ball path crosses the net.|$|R

He at least was true. With him {{there was no need}} of doubt. His assurances were not {{conveyed}} in words so light that they might mean much or little. This second lover was a lover, indeed, who thought no pains too great to show her that she was ever growing in his heart of hearts. For a while,--for a week or two,--she restrained her tongue; but when once she had accustomed herself to the coaxing kindness of her sister and her cousin, then her eloquence was loosened, and Gregory Newton was a god indeed. In the course of time she got a very pretty note from Ralph, congratulating her, as he also had congratulated Polly, and expressing a fear that he might not be home in time to be present at the wedding. Augusta was so fond of Rome that they did not mean to leave it till the late spring. Then, after a while, there came to her, also, a watch and chain, twice as costly as those given to Polly,--which, however, no persuasion from Gregory would ever induce Clarissa to wear. In after time Ralph never noticed that the trinkets were not worn.|$|E

This {{reduces the}} required cable pull, making them compatible with brake levers intended for cantilever brakes. Mini V-brakes retain advantages specific to V-brakes such as not requiring extra cable stops. On the downside, their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally {{make for a}} less forgiving setup: they can only accommodate smaller tyre sizes compared to cantilever brakes, may pose problems for mounting fenders, can be clogged more easily by mud, and {{they can make it}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> wheels.|$|R

50|$|The {{third wave}} of {{prohibition}} legislation, of which national prohibition was the grand climax, began in 1907, when Georgia passed a statewide prohibition law. By 1917, {{two thirds of}} the states had some form of prohibition laws and roughly three quarters of the population lived in dry areas. In 1913, the Anti-Saloon League first publicly appealed for a prohibition amendment. They preferred a constitutional amendment over a federal statute because although <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> achieve, they felt it would be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> In 1913, Congress passed the Webb-Kenyon Act, which forbade the transport of liquor into dry states. As the United States entered World War I, the Conscription Act banned the sale of liquor near military bases. In August 1917, the Lever Food and Fuel Control Act banned production of distilled spirits {{for the duration of the}} war. The War Prohibition Act, November, 1918, forbade the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages (more than 2.75% alcohol content) until the end of demobilization.|$|R

30|$|The basic {{hypothesis}} {{that we are}} testing is whether the presence of Mexican immigrants in the given occupations lowers wages for African-Americans {{and the extent to}} which task specialization may mitigate this effect. We use a factor proportion approach using variations in occupations and considering various education/occupation/industry groupings, following some previous studies (e.g., Borjas and Katz 2005; Friedberg 2001). Recognizing that Mexican immigrants and African-Americans disproportionately work in distinct occupations, we use this fact to motivate the empirical strategy for identification, exploiting variations in the inflows into occupations across time to test the effect of Mexicans on wages of African-Americans. The key assumption is, given occupation-specific human capital, it might be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> occupations (compared <b>to</b> changing location). This would reduce the speed at which workers respond <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in wages in occupations at least in the short run, creating a more persistent disequilibrium across occupations, from which to gage a potential effect of immigrants (Friedberg 2001).|$|R
