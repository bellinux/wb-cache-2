50|$|Wood had {{the ability}} to work across a variety of artistic forms, from {{straight}} photography, collage, cliché verre, solarization, mixed media, offset lithography to <b>drawing.</b> <b>Wood</b> moved freely between conceptual and visual exploration, not adhering to a single style. Although he often raised questions about political, social and environmental issues, he avoided promoting personal solutions or adding narratives to the images. The artist instead preferred to focus on the viewer’s interpretation and the possibility for multiple meanings.|$|R

50|$|Hebrew Technical Institute was a {{vocational}} High School in New York City. The {{school was}} founded on January 7, 1884 and closed in 1939. After completing two years at the school, students could specialize in wood-working, pattern making, metal working, instrument making, mechanical <b>drawing,</b> architectural <b>drawing,</b> <b>wood</b> carving, free-hand <b>drawing</b> or applied electricity. The school was founded after three Hebrew charity organizations formed a committee to promote technical education for the many Jewish immigrants arriving in New York at the time. The school originally opened at 206 East Broadway. After a number of relocations, the school moved into 34 and 36 Stuyvesant Street.|$|R
5000|$|Aficionados of Carpet Bowls are keen {{to point}} out that, because a bowl must be {{delivered}} within the 18-inch delivery area whilst not standing on the carpet, it is rare for players to attempt to [...] "break up the head" [...] (attempting to spoil the end by delivering a forceful bowl that knocks the bowls and jack randomly). Carpet Bowlers regard this {{as a point of}} superiority over Indoor Bowls and Short Mat Bowls, as Carpet Bowls is really a game that relies heavily on the art of quality <b>drawing</b> <b>woods</b> and less on power and fortune.|$|R
