25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of An Action-based Model of Cognitive-dissonance Processes (2015) proposed that psychological dissonance occurs consequent to the stimulation of thoughts {{that interfere with}} a <b>goal-driven</b> behavior. Researchers mapped the neural activity of the participant when performing tasks that provoked psychological stress when engaged in contradictory behaviors. A participant read aloud the printed name of a color. To test for the occurrence of cognitive dissonance, {{the name of the}} color was printed in a color different than the word read aloud by the participant. As a result, the participants experienced increased neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex when the experimental exercises provoked psychological dissonance.|$|E
25|$|August Weismann was {{responsible}} for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre {{to make room for}} the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution. This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a teleological or <b>goal-driven</b> explanation. In other words, a purpose for ageing has been identified, but not a mechanism by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, there is every reason to think that the opposite is true: ageing decreases individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.|$|E

2500|$|His posthumously {{published}} book, The Phenomenon of Man, {{set forth}} a sweeping {{account of the}} unfolding of the cosmos {{and the evolution of}} matter to humanity, to ultimately a reunion with Christ. In the book, Teilhard abandoned literal interpretations of creation in the Book of Genesis in favor of allegorical and theological interpretations. The unfolding of the material cosmos, is described from primordial particles to the development of life, human beings and the noosphere, and finally to his vision of the Omega Point in the future, which is [...] "pulling" [...] all creation towards it. He was a leading proponent of orthogenesis, the idea that evolution occurs in a directional, <b>goal-driven</b> way. Teilhard argued in Darwinian terms with respect to biology, and supported the synthetic model of evolution, but argued in Lamarckian terms for the development of culture, primarily through the vehicle of education. Teilhard made a total commitment to the evolutionary process in the 1920s as the core of his spirituality, at a time when other religious thinkers felt evolutionary thinking challenged the structure of conventional Christian faith. He committed himself to what the evidence showed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pedagogy}} of cognitivism {{prevalent in}} the early 1970s and early 1980s also promotes the idea of process over product, {{but it is a}} more scientific approach to composition studies and is opposed to moderate expressivism in many ways. Abstractly speaking, cognitivists believe that thinking exists in the mind apart from language and are concerned with understanding how language—or writing—is developed from mental processes of the mind. Cognitivists are primarily concerned with the goals of a writer, the decisions made during the writing process by the mind. Andrea Lunsford addresses the importance of understanding the cognitive mental faculties involved during composition, claiming {{that the best way to}} facilitate the writing process is through workshops and discussion rather than lecture-based instruction. [...] Researchers like cognitivist Sondra Perl conduct extensive studies of the composing process and the stages through which a writer goes in order to better understand how to teach writing. Cognitivists Linda Flower and John Hayes see an exigency in composition studies to understand how and why a writer makes the choices they do during the writing process. Their research led them to claim that writing is a non-linear, hierarchal, <b>goal-driven</b> process. In addition, they concentrate their study of composition on the protocol of the writing process, including planning, translating, embedding, and reviewing. While like expressivists in their greater concern with the process of writing than with the final product, distinguishing them from the essay-driven pedagogy of current-traditional rhetoric, cognitivism proposes a more scientific approach by studying universal cognitive faculties of the mind in order to better understand the composition process.|$|E

50|$|The 4D/RCS {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} a generic control node at all the hierarchical control levels. The 4D/RCS hierarchical levels are scalable to facilitate systems of any degree of complexity. Each node within the hierarchy functions as a <b>goal-driven,</b> model-based, closed-loop controller. Each node is capable of accepting and decomposing task commands with goals into actions that accomplish task goals despite unexpected conditions and dy-namic perturbations in the world.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the theory}} of model-centered instruction, there are three types of models: (a) a natural or {{manufactured}} cause-effect system, (b) an environment in which one or more systems operate, or (c) an expert performance—a set of purposeful, <b>goal-driven</b> actions that causes changes within systems and environments. These three types of models — system, environment, and expert performance - form a comprehensive framework for the representation and communication of subject-matter information in any domain.|$|E
50|$|The second {{aspect is}} called {{top-down}} processing, {{also known as}} <b>goal-driven,</b> endogenous attention, attentional control or executive attention.

5000|$|Film {{critics and}} film studies {{scholars}} typically define an art film as possessing [...] "formal qualities that mark them {{as different from}} mainstream Hollywood films", which can include, among other elements, a sense of social realism; {{an emphasis on the}} authorial expressiveness of the director; and a focus on the thoughts, dreams, or motivations of characters, as opposed to the unfolding of a clear, <b>goal-driven</b> story. Film scholar David Bordwell describes art cinema as [...] "a film genre, with its own distinct conventions".|$|E
5000|$|Temptation {{is usually}} {{used in a}} loose sense to {{describe}} actions which indicate a lack of self control. Temptation is something that allures, excites, and seduces someone. Successful endeavors of <b>goal-driven</b> activity is threatened by the tempting nature of immediate pleasure [...] Infatuation {{can also lead to}} temptation as someone might do something for love in spite of one's better judgement. In advertising, temptation is a theme common to many of the marketing and advertising techniques used to make products more attractive.|$|E
5000|$|With this theory, {{politics}} {{becomes a}} form of exchange and is therefore worthy of economic analysis, thus establishing the formal beginning of constitutional economics. By {{the end of the}} article, Buchanan enters philosophical territory, almost verging on skepticism, saying that each individual must perceive phenomena through his particular [...] "window" [...] and agreement is impossible when everyone views reality from different windows. Due to radical individualism, constitutional economics can include only people who view the world through economic paradigms or windows, not idealistic, <b>goal-driven</b> paradigms.|$|E
50|$|A {{need for}} {{cognitive}} closure may occur while engaged in <b>goal-driven</b> or goal-motivated cognitive functions (e.g., attention control, memory recall, information selection and processing, cognitive inhibition, etc.). Ideally, people {{should attempt to}} acquire new knowledge to satisfy questions regarding particular issues (specific cognitive closure) irrespective of whether that knowledge points to a conclusion having positive or negative implications for them (non-specific cognitive closure). But because urgency and permanence {{are central to the}} motivational core of this overall process, individuals (or groups) may be compelled, consciously or unconsciously, to obtain information prematurely and irrespective of content.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there are}} {{variations}} between individual children, children are generally curious about {{their bodies and}} those of others, and explore their bodies through explorative sex play. [...] "Playing doctor" [...] {{is one example of}} such childhood exploration; such games are generally considered to be normal in young children. Child sexuality is considered fundamentally different from adult sexual behavior, which is more <b>goal-driven.</b> Among children, genital penetration and oral-genital contact are very uncommon, and may be perceived as imitations of adult behaviors. Such behaviors are more common among children who have been sexually abused.|$|E
50|$|In particular, {{researchers}} have consistently {{found that children}} who exhibit a hostile attribution bias (tendency to perceive others' intent as hostile, as opposed to benign) {{are more likely to}} engage in aggressive behaviors. More specifically, hostile attribution bias has been associated with reactive aggression, as opposed to proactive aggression, as well as victimization. Whereas proactive aggression is unprovoked and <b>goal-driven,</b> reactive aggression is an angry, retaliatory response to some sort of perceived provocation. Therefore, children who are victims of aggression may develop views of peers as hostile, leading them to be {{more likely to engage in}} retaliatory, or reactive, aggression.|$|E
5000|$|Described as a [...] "performance-based and <b>goal-driven</b> roadmap", the Roadmap {{is built}} on goals without going into details,.

However, as a performance-based plan, progress will require and depend upon the good faith efforts of the parties, and their compliance {{with each of the}} obligations the Quartet put into the plan. This made the Roadmap different from former peace plans; there was no (unrealistic) time-scheme to reach the goal, a Palestinian state.|$|E
