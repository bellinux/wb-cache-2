Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its {{cloaking}} device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank {{to hold the}} whales they need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power to be restored.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Paul {{served on the}} House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for {{inflation}} and spoke against the banking mismanagement {{that resulted in the}} savings and loan crisis. Paul argued <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Inaction chafed Ball, and {{he began}} {{agitating}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No.56 Squadron RFC, considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No.56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.|$|E

5|$|Ronald Niel Stuart {{was born}} in 1886 in Liverpool to Neil Stuart and Mary Harrison, both from {{experienced}} seafaring families. Neil Sr. had been born on Prince Edward Island in Canada and had met and married Mary in Montreal. She {{was the daughter of}} a master mariner from Australia. In the 1880s the family moved to Liverpool, where Stuart was born as the youngest of six children. Neil worked in the city as a dock superintendent and owner of a wholesale tea shop before dying suddenly while preparing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Merchant Navy.|$|E
5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within that tradition. Imagism called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> what were seen as more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, {{as well as a}} willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms. Imagists use free verse.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced {{to adapt to a}} new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E

5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> higher national office. Bo {{made no secret of}} his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition would be an opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E
5|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda to escape Hutu purges. The exodus, which began during the November 1959 arson attacks, continued steadily throughout {{the revolution}}. An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E
5|$|Barrowclough's {{opportunity}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> duty overseas came {{following the}} death of Mead in an aircraft crash in July 1942. At the time of Mead's death, the Pacific Section was being recalled to New Zealand for reorganisation into a division for offensive operations in the South Pacific. In August, Barrowclough was named as commander of what was now known as the 3rd New Zealand Division. He immediately overhauled its structure and removed many officers who he considered too old for frontline duty, replacing them with personnel who had experience with the 2NZEF in Greece, Crete or North Africa. He also implemented training programs for his new command; most of its personnel had been engaged in the construction of fortifications while in Fiji, which had left little opportunity for intensive tactical training and exercises.|$|E

5|$|Concorde {{was bought}} into the navy and {{commissioned}} in the West Indies <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Britain later in the year, though her commander for this voyage is unknown. She arrived in Britain and was paid off in September at Chatham. With {{the end of the}} American War of Independence and the draw-down in the navy, Concorde was not brought into immediate service but remained laid up at Chatham until November 1790, when a great repair was begun by Wilson, of Frindsbury. The work, which cost a total of £18,259, was completed by April 1793, by which time the French Revolutionary Wars had broken out. She was fitted for service at Chatham between April and May 1793, at a cost of £6,600, and was commissioned in April under Captain Thomas Wells.|$|E
5|$|Florence Ada Fuller (1867 – 17 July 1946) was a South African-born Australian artist. Originally from Port Elizabeth, Fuller {{migrated}} as a {{child to}} Melbourne with her family. There she trained with her uncle Robert Hawker Dowling and teacher Jane Sutherland and took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, becoming a professional artist in the late 1880s. In 1892 she left Australia, travelling first to South Africa, where she met and painted for Cecil Rhodes, {{and then on to}} Europe. She lived and studied there for the subsequent decade, except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> South Africa in 1899 to paint a portrait of Rhodes. Between 1895 and 1904 her works were exhibited at the Paris Salon and London's Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the writer}} was still hoping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the {{political}} stage, {{this time with}} the Nationalist Democratic Party, which came to power under Nicolae Iorga. To this goal, he approached Internal Affairs Undersecretary Nicolae Ottescu, requesting appointment as prefect, but was refused. During the same period, Caragiale was occasionally involved in events affecting the cultural scene. In May 1930, he was present at a banquet in honor of Italian author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the ideologue of Futurism. Organized by the Romanian Writers' Society and the Italo-Romanian Cultural Association, it was also attended by many other cultural figures, most of which, including artist Marcel Janco and the writers Ion Vinea, Jacques G. Costin, Ion Minulescu and Camil Petrescu, were associates of the magazine Contimporanul. In January 1934, linguist and publisher Alexandru Rosetti signed a contract with Caragiale, through which the latter agreed to complete Sub pecetea tainei and have it published by Rosetti's Editura Fundațiilor Regale.|$|E

5000|$|Aircraft on Ground or AOG {{is a term}} in {{aviation}} maintenance indicating that a problem is serious enough to prevent an aircraft from flying. Generally there is a rush to acquire the parts to put the aircraft (A/C) back into service, and prevent further delays or cancellations of the planned itinerary. AOG applies to any aviation materials or spare parts that are needed immediately <b>for</b> <b>an</b> aircraft <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> service. AOG suppliers refer qualified personnel and dispatch the parts required to repair the aircraft <b>for</b> <b>an</b> immediate <b>return</b> <b>to</b> service. AOG also is used to describe critical shipments for parts or materials for aircraft [...] "out of service" [...] or OTS at a location.|$|R
5|$|Manchester United's first {{departure}} of the 1998–99 season was Ben Thornley, who joined Huddersfield Town for £175,000 on 3 July 1998. A day later, Leon Mills signed for Wigan Athletic for an undisclosed fee, and Adam Sadler was released. Two of the club's longest-serving players, Brian McClair and Gary Pallister, also left. McClair had been at United since 1987, and opted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Motherwell in the Scottish Premier League; he had played at Fir Park in the early 1980s. Pallister agreed to return to Middlesbrough in a £2.5million deal, nine years after he had left them for a £2.3million transfer to Old Trafford. On 4 November 1998, Chris Casper signed for Reading for a fee of £300,000.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{planned to}} return to Moscow, an effort for which she {{received}} support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the Soviet Education Ministry. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, her brother Fritz accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in Tomsk, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing his job in Germany, and was subsequently executed during the Great Purge.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{employing}} {{a system that}} returned men by units, or by employment categories, {{it was decided to}} utilise an egalitarian system that saw men who had been away for the longest period of time being returned first. Due {{to the size of the}} forces deployed overseas—roughly 167, 000 personnel in France, Britain and Egypt—and the logistical requirements of bringing them home the process was nevertheless a lengthy one and as such it became important to occupy the troops while they waited. In order to achieve this and to prepare the men <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> civilian employment, a vocational education scheme was set up by George Long and troops in Britain were offered educational courses and civilian work placement opportunities and although these programs were not as successful as hoped, several thousand soldiers took advantage of them.|$|E

5|$|The Judge Dredd {{comic strip}} is mostly set in Mega-City One in the 22nd century, {{on the east}} coast of the former United States. When President Robert L. Booth started the Third World War in 2070 (see Atomic Wars), the Judges – until then no more than a police force with {{extraordinary}} powers – deposed Booth, overthrew the Constitution and seized control of all institutions of government. Disillusioned with the elected politicians who had caused so much destruction to their country, much of the American public supported this move at the time. For the next four decades America was a dictatorship. (Mega-City One and the other American mega-cities became sovereign city-states early during this period, and the US ceased to exist.) Although the Judges were initially popular, the citizens soon grew to resent their new leaders as much as they had the old, until activists began calling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> democratic government.|$|E
5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} {{friction}} within the Catholic groups, first over Sukarno's 1957 decree {{that he was}} president for life and establishment of a guided democracy policy. A faction, led by Soegijapranata, supported this decree, while Catholic Party leader I. J. Kasimo's faction was heavily against it. Sukarno, who had a good working relationship with Soegijapranata, asked the vicar to join the National Council, a request that Soegijapranata refused; he did, however, assign two delegates to the Council, ensuring Catholic representation. This, along with Soegijapranata's support of Sukarno's decree on 5 July 1949 calling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the 1945 constitution, resulted in Bishop of Jakarta Adrianus Djajasepoetra's denunciation of Soegijapranata as a sycophant. However, Soegijapranata was strongly against Sukarno's idea of Nasakom, which based part of the nation's government on communism.|$|E
