5|$|In August 2013 an {{expansion}} pack was announced for Age of Empires II HD, entitled The <b>Forgotten.</b> <b>It</b> {{is based on}} the fan-made expansion, The Forgotten Empires. The Forgotten introduces five new civilizations: the Italians, Indians, Slavs, Magyars, and the Incas. It includes new maps, campaigns, and units, a new game mode, and numerous balance and gameplay adjustments.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never <b>forgotten</b> <b>it.</b> Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E

25|$|Palmerston is also {{remembered for}} his light-hearted {{approach}} to government.

25|$|The War of Jenkin's Ear {{broke out}} in 1739 between the Spanish and British and was {{confined}} to the Caribbean and Georgia. The major action in the War of Jenkins' Ear was a major amphibious attack launched by the British under Admiral Edward Vernon in March 1741 against Cartagena de Indias, one of Spain's major gold-trading ports in the Caribbean (today Colombia). Although this episode is largely <b>forgotten,</b> <b>it</b> ended in a decisive victory for Spain, who managed to prolong its control of the Caribbean and indeed secure the Spanish Main until the 19th century.|$|E

In 1904, they published their initial findings {{in the journal of}} the society called Bulletin de l'École française d'Extrême Orient (BEFEO). Henri Parmentier gave a description of the ruins at Mỹ Sơn, and M. L. Finot published the inscriptions that had been found there.|$|E
25|$|In the {{epilogue}} {{the characters}} are taking Arthur to a 'quiet and idyllic planet' when they come across a half-mad journalist. He tells them {{that he was at}} a court case and a witness there was given too much of a truth drug and started to tell all truth, which was driving everybody there mad. They go to the courtroom in the hope of learning the question of Life, the Universe and Everything from him. They discover he is finished (there was little truth to tell) and he has <b>forgotten</b> <b>it</b> all, except that knowledge of the Ultimate Question and Ultimate Answer is mutually exclusive. He then attempts to tell Arthur where God's last message to His creation is, though dies seemingly before Arthur is able to memorise the location.|$|E

500|$|Trimmer's {{most popular}} book, Fabulous Histories, was reprinted {{for at least}} 133 years and had a {{profound}} impact on generations of readers and writers. In 1877, when the firm of Griffith and Farran published it as part of their [...] "Original Juvenile Library," [...] they advertised it as [...] "the delicious story of Dicksy, Flapsy, and Pecksy, who can have <b>forgotten</b> <b>it?</b> It is as fresh today as it was half a century ago." [...] Tess Cosslett has also suggested that the names of Trimmer's birds — Dicksy, Pecksy, Flapsy and Robin—bear a striking resemblance to the rabbits — Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter — in Beatrix Potter's children's books.|$|E
500|$|The group toured Italy {{to promote}} the album, where they were treated like superstars and {{surrounded}} by army vehicles and riot police. They followed this with a short European tour, during which they filmed a live version of [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] for Belgian television. The production took two hours to film as the band had not intended to perform the song live and had <b>forgotten</b> <b>it.</b> The resulting film shows Hammill singing the song while reading a lyric sheet. Regular tours of Europe followed {{over the next four}} months, but the strain of the workload became too much for the band, and they split up in August 1972.|$|E
500|$|... "Bethena, A Concert Waltz" [...] (copyright {{registered}} March 6, 1905) is {{a composition}} by Scott Joplin. It {{was the first}} Joplin work since his wife Freddie's death on September 10, 1904 of pneumonia, ten weeks after their wedding. At the time the composer had significant financial problems; the work did not sell successfully {{at the time of}} publication and was soon neglected and <b>forgotten.</b> <b>It</b> was rediscovered {{as a result of the}} Joplin revival in the 1970s and has received acclaim from Joplin's biographers and other critics. The piece combines two different styles of music, the classical waltz and the rag, and has been seen as demonstrating Joplin's excellence as a classical composer. The work has been described as [...] "an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of Ragtime Waltzes", a [...] "masterpiece", and [...] "Joplin's finest waltz".|$|E

After Chocobo wins, Mog confronts Cid over his vehicle's poor performance, but Cid replies that Chocobo won because of the differences in their abilities (i.e., Chocobo's [...] "Dash").

500|$|After being dismantled, Tennis for Two {{was largely}} <b>forgotten.</b> <b>It</b> {{remained}} virtually unknown {{until the late}} 1970s and early 1980s when Higinbotham was called on to testify in court cases for defendants sued by Magnavox over the video game patents of Ralph H. Baer. Having discovered the game, the lawyers for the defense unsuccessfully attempted to have the game declared prior art to invalidate Baer's patents on television video games, resulting in attention being given to the nearly 20-year-old game as possibly the first video game. It received further attention as the subject of articles in Creative Computing and Video Replay in 1982 and 1983 highlighting its possible status as the first video game; the editor of Creative Computing, David H. Ahl, had played Tennis for Two at Brookhaven in 1958, and dubbed Higinbotham the [...] "Grandfather of Video Games". Higinbotham himself felt that the game was an obvious extension of the Donner Model 30's bouncing ball program and therefore not worthy of patenting or {{a large part of}} his legacy; he preferred to be remembered for his post-World War II nuclear non-proliferation work.|$|E
500|$|The Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice is {{a public}} {{monument}} in Postman's Park in the City of London, commemorating ordinary people who died saving {{the lives of others}} and who might otherwise have been <b>forgotten.</b> <b>It</b> was first proposed by painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts in 1887, to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The scheme was not accepted at that time, and in 1898 Watts was approached by Henry Gamble, vicar of St Botolph's Aldersgate church. Postman's Park was built on the church's former churchyard, and the church was at that time trying to raise funds to secure its future; Gamble felt that Watts's proposed memorial would raise the profile of the park. The memorial was unveiled in an unfinished state in 1900, consisting of a [...] wooden loggia designed by Ernest George, sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tiles to be designed and made by William De Morgan. At the time of opening, only four of the memorial tiles were in place. Watts died in 1904, and his widow Mary Watts took over the running of the project.|$|E
