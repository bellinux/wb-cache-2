5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter muscles in the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp <b>fully</b> <b>retracted.</b> The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial muscles in the epidermis, {{but most of the}} muscles in the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} notable aspects of the design is the stadium's retractable, fabric roof. The roof {{mechanization}} consists of two large panels that split apart at the 50yard line, lying over and above each end zone when <b>fully</b> <b>retracted.</b> 10 parallel, tri-chord trusses ride on two parallel rails, each supported by a large, -long super-truss. Roof operation is controlled in the stadium press box via computer, containing live images of the travel path of each roof panel; plus, furnishing live feedback from all roof components throughout the operation. The roof panels can be opened or closed {{in as little as}} 7minutes, moving at a speed of up to -per-minute.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, the {{gap fillers}} may be {{mounted on the}} train, and linked to the door {{operating}} mechanism. They may be found on modern trainsets, like various versions of the Stadler GTW. Train-mounted gap fillers {{eliminate the need for}} careful alignment and, as the driver only gets the signal that the doors have closed when the fillers have <b>fully</b> <b>retracted,</b> require no special synchronization on departure. Moving all active components of the system to the train instead of the platform allows maintenance to be performed in a shop, rather than in the field. The city of Singapore has committed to specifying its newer trains with gap fillers, to reduce the incidence of platform gap accidents in its crowded stations.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the MMR vaccine was {{the subject}} of {{controversy}} after the publication in The Lancet of a 1998 paper by Andrew Wakefield and others reporting case histories of 12 children mostly with autism spectrum disorders with onset soon after administration of the vaccine. At a 1998 press conference, Wakefield suggested that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single vaccination. This suggestion was not supported by the paper, and several subsequent peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. It later emerged that Wakefield had received funding from litigants against vaccine manufacturers and that he had not informed colleagues or medical authorities of his conflict of interest; had this been known, publication in The Lancet would not have taken place in the way that it did. Wakefield has been heavily criticized on scientific grounds and for triggering a decline in vaccination rates (vaccination rates in the UK dropped to 80% in the years following the study), as well as on ethical grounds for the way the research was conducted. In 2004, the MMR-and-autism interpretation of the paper was formally retracted by 10 of Wakefield's 12 coauthors, and in 2010 The Lancets editors <b>fully</b> <b>retracted</b> the paper. Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, with a statement identifying deliberate falsification in the research published in The Lancet, and is barred from practising medicine in the UK.|$|E

25|$|Slug, or land slug, is {{a common}} name for any {{apparently}} shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word slug is also often used {{as part of the}} common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name snail, which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can <b>fully</b> <b>retract</b> its soft parts into the shell).|$|R
50|$|Frenulum breve is a {{frenulum}} that is insufficiently long {{to allow}} the foreskin to <b>fully</b> <b>retract,</b> which may lead to discomfort during intercourse. Phimosis is a condition where the foreskin of an adult cannot be retracted properly. Before adulthood, the foreskin may still be separating from the glans. Phimosis can be treated by stretching of the foreskin, by changing masturbation habits, using topical steroid ointments, preputioplasty, or by the more radical option of circumcision. Posthitis is an inflammation of the foreskin.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first five}} prototypes had {{conventionally}} operating dual-strut leg rearwards-retracting main gear, but {{starting with the}} V6 prototype, a main gear design debuted that twisted the new, single-leg main gear strut through 90° during the retraction sequence, much {{like that of the}} American Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. This feature allowed the main wheels to end up above {{the lower end of the}} strut when <b>fully</b> <b>retracted</b> [...] and was adopted as standard for all future production Ju 88s, and only minimally modified for the later Ju 188 and 388 developments of it. These single-leg landing gear struts also made use of stacks of conical Belleville washers inside them, as their main form of suspension for takeoffs and landings.|$|E

2500|$|An {{investigation}} by journalist Brian Deer found that Andrew Wakefield, {{the author of}} the original research paper linking the vaccine to autism, had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest, had manipulated evidence, and had broken other ethical codes. The Lancet paper was partially retracted in 2004, and <b>fully</b> <b>retracted</b> in 2010, when Lancets editor-in-chief Richard Horton described it as [...] "utterly false" [...] and said that the journal had been [...] "deceived". Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct in May 2010 and was struck off the Medical Register, meaning he could no longer practice as a doctor in the UK. In 2011, Deer provided further information on Wakefield's improper research practices to the British Medical Journal, which in a signed editorial described the original paper as fraudulent. The scientific consensus is the MMR vaccine has no link to the development of autism, and that this vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} is semi-monocoque with an elliptical {{profile and}} a maximum width of [...] The air flow to the engine is regulated by an inlet cone in the air intake. On early model MiG-21s, the cone has three positions. For speeds up to Mach 1.5 the cone is <b>fully</b> <b>retracted</b> to the maximum aft position. For speeds between Mach 1.5 and Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the middle position. For speeds higher than Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the maximum forward position. On the later model MiG-21PF, the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed. The cone position for a given speed is calculated by the UVD-2M system using air pressures from in front and behind the compressor of the engine. On {{both sides of the}} nose there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff. In the first variant of the MiG-21, the pitot tube is attached {{to the bottom of the}} nose. After the MiG-21P variant, this tube is attached to the top of the air intake.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the reactor}} control rods are {{inserted}} from above; 24 shortened rods are inserted from below {{and are used}} to augment the axial power distribution control of the core. With the exception of 12 automatic rods, the control rods have a [...] long graphite section at the end, separated by a [...] long telescope (which creates a water-filled space between the graphite and the absorber), and a boron carbide neutron absorber section. The role of the graphite section, known as [...] "displacer," [...] is to enhance {{the difference between the}} neutron flux attenuation levels of inserted and retracted rods, as the graphite displaces water that would otherwise act as a neutron absorber, although much weaker than boron carbide; a control rod channel filled with graphite absorbs fewer neutrons than when filled with water, so the difference between inserted and retracted control rod is increased. When the control rod is <b>fully</b> <b>retracted,</b> the graphite displacer is located {{in the middle of the}} core height, with 1.25m of water at each of its ends. The displacement of water in the lower 1.25m of the core as the rod moves down causes a local increase of reactivity in the bottom of the core as the graphite part of the control rod passes that section. This [...] "positive scram" [...] effect was discovered in 1983 at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The control rod channels are cooled by an independent water circuit and kept at [...] The narrow space between the rod and its channel hinders water flow around the rods during their movement and acts as a fluid damper, which is the primary cause of their slow insertion time (nominally 18–21 seconds for the RCPS rods, or about 0.4m/s). After the Chernobyl disaster, the control rod servos on other RBMK reactors were exchanged to allow faster rod movements, and even faster movement was achieved by cooling of the control rod tubes by a thin layer of water while letting the rods themselves move in gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{foreskin}} {{of adults}} is typically retractable over the glans. Coverage of the glans in a flaccid and erect state {{varies depending on}} foreskin length.

The age at which a boy can retract his foreskin varies, but research found that 95% of males were able to <b>fully</b> <b>retract</b> their foreskin by adulthood. Inability to retract the foreskin in childhood should not be considered a problem unless there are other symptoms.|$|R

50|$|In direct {{response}} to Wilkinson's Bonded cartridge, during the following year Gillette introduced the twin-blade Trac II.
