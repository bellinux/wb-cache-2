25|$|The {{motives of}} the patient can vary: for a patient with <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder,</b> the primary aim is to obtain sympathy, nurturance, and {{attention}} accompanying the sick role. This {{is in contrast to}} malingering, in which the patient wishes to obtain external gains such as disability payments or to avoid an unpleasant situation, such as military duty. <b>Factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> and malingering cannot be diagnosed in the same patient, and the diagnosis of <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> depends on the absence of any other psychiatric disorder. While they are both listed in the DSM-IV-TR, <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> is considered a mental disorder, while malingering is not.|$|E

Some authors (such as Prior and Gordon 1997) also report good responses to antipsychotic drugs such as Pimozide. Family therapy can also help. In such therapy, families are helped to better understand patients (the individual in the family with FD) and that person's need for attention.|$|E
500|$|Munchausen by Internet is {{a pattern}} of {{behavior}} akin to the Munchausen syndrome (a psychiatric <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves) in which Internet users seek attention by feigning illnesses in online venues such as chat rooms, message boards, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC). It has been described in medical literature {{as a manifestation of}} <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> or <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> by proxy. Reports of users who deceive Internet forum participants by portraying themselves as gravely ill or as victims of violence first appeared in the 1990s due to the relative newness of Internet communications. The pattern was identified in 1998 by psychiatrist Marc Feldman, who created the term [...] "Münchausen by Internet" [...] in 2000. It is not included in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Munchausen by Internet" [...] {{was first}} used in an article {{published}} in the Southern Medical Journal written by Marc Feldman in 2000. Feldman, a clinical {{professor of psychiatry at the}} University of Alabama at Birmingham, gave a name to the phenomenon in 2000, but he co-authored an article on the topic two years earlier in the Western Journal of Medicine, using the description [...] "virtual factitious disorder". Factitious disorders are described in the [...] (DSM) as psychological disorders involving the production of non-existent physical or psychological ailments to earn sympathy. These illnesses are feigned not for monetary gain or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others. Chronic manifestation of <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> is often called Munchausen syndrome, after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by Rudolf Erich Raspe. When the symptoms of another person, such as a child or an elderly parent, are purposely induced by the caregiver, it is called <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> by proxy, or Munchausen syndrome by proxy.|$|E
500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> is a {{condition}} in which a person, without a malingering motive, acts as if they have an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms, purely to attain a patient's role. [...] <b>Factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> imposed on another ("factitious disorder by proxy", also called Munchausen's syndrome by proxy) is {{a condition}} in which a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates the symptoms of someone in their care. [...] In either case, the perpetrator's motive is to attain (for themselves or for another) a patient's role. [...] <b>Factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> differs fundamentally from malingering in that the malingerer simulates illness with a view to obtaining a material benefit or avoiding an obligation or responsibility.|$|E

40|$|This {{population-based}} study {{evaluates the}} prevalence of <b>factitious</b> <b>disorders,</b> Münchausen syndrome, and Münchausen syndrome by proxy in a clinical setting. All children referred to the Pediatric Unit of the Department of Pediatrics of the Catholic University Medical School (Agostino Gemelli Hospital) in Rome were recruited between November 2007 and March 2010. An experienced interdisciplinary team of medical professionals analyzed all suspected cases. A total of 751 patients were hospitalized. <b>Factitious</b> <b>disorders</b> were diagnosed in 14 / 751 patients, resulting in a prevalence of 1. 8 %. Three of 14 (21. 4 %) patients fulfilled the criteria for Münchausen syndrome. Münchausen syndrome by proxy was identified in four of 751 patients, resulting in a prevalence of 0. 53 %. The perpetrator was the mother in three of four of these cases. The epidemiological data obtained in this population-based study indicate that {{the prevalence of}} <b>factitious</b> <b>disorders,</b> Münchausen syndrome, and Münchausen syndrome by proxy is higher than previously observed.

2500|$|Ganser {{syndrome}} {{was once}} considered a separate <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder.</b> It is a disorder of extreme stress or an organic condition.

2500|$|Some {{individuals}} experience {{only a few}} {{outbreaks of}} the disorder. However, in most cases, <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> is a chronic and long-term condition {{that is difficult to}} treat. There are relatively few positive outcomes for this disorder; in fact, treatment provided a lower percentage of positive outcomes than did treatment of individuals with obvious psychotic symptoms such as people with schizophrenia. In addition, many individuals with <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder</b> do not present for treatment, often insisting their symptoms are genuine. Some degree of recovery, however, is possible. [...] The passage of time seems to help the disorder greatly. There are many possible explanations for this occurrence, although none are currently considered definitive. It may be that an FD individual has mastered the art of feigning sickness over so many years of practice that the disorder can no longer be discerned. Another hypothesis is that many times an FD individual is placed in a home, or experiences health issues that are not self-induced or feigned. [...] In this way, the problem with obtaining the 'patient' status is resolved because symptoms arise without any {{effort on the part of}} the individual.|$|E

DID is one of the most controversial psychiatric disorders, with no clear consensus on [...] diagnostic criteria or treatment. No clear definition of [...] "dissociation" [...] exists. Diagnosis is often difficult, as the illness is frequently associated with other mental disorders. [...] Differential diagnosis should consider malingering if the individual's principal concern is with financial or forensic gain or with the avoidance of obligations; and <b>factitious</b> <b>disorder,</b> if the individual's principal concern is with assuming a patient role.|$|E
2500|$|The word '' means 'substitute'. It is coded in the DSM-IV under <b>Factitious</b> <b>Disorder</b> NOS (not {{otherwise}} specified). Münchausen {{by proxy}} is the involuntary use of another individual {{to play the}} patient role. For example, false symptoms are produced [...] in children by the caregivers or parents, to produce the appearance of [...] illness, or they may give misleading medical histories about their children. The parent may falsify the child's medical history or tamper with laboratory tests to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, in Münchausen by proxy, the caregiver actually injures the child or makes it sick {{to ensure that the}} child is treated. For instance, a father whose son is coeliac might knowingly introduce gluten into the diet. Such parents may be validated by the attention that they receive from having a sick child.|$|E

40|$|Compared {{with other}} {{psychiatric}} <b>disorders,</b> diagnosis of <b>factitious</b> <b>disorders</b> is rare, with identification largely {{dependent on the}} systematic collection of relevant information, including a detailed chronology and scrutiny of the patient's medical record. Management of such disorders ideally requires a team-based approach and close involvement of the primary care doctor. As deception is a key defining component of <b>factitious</b> <b>disorders,</b> diagnosis {{has important implications for}} young children, particularly when identified in women and health-care workers. Malingering is considered to be rare in clinical practice, whereas simulation of symptoms, motivated by financial rewards, is regarded as more common in medicolegal settings. Although psychometric investigations (eg, symptom validity testing) can inform the detection of illness deception, such tests need support from converging evidence sources, including detailed interview assessments, medical notes, and relevant non-medical investigations. A key challenge in any discussion of abnormal health-care-seeking behaviour {{is the extent to which}} a person's reported symptoms are considered to be a product of choice, or psychopathology beyond volitional control, or perhaps both. Clinical skills alone are not typically sufficient for diagnosis or to detect malingering. Medical education needs to provide doctors with the conceptual, developmental, and management frameworks to understand and deal with patients whose symptoms appear to be simulated. Central to the understanding of <b>factitious</b> <b>disorders</b> and malingering are the explanatory models and beliefs used to provide meaning for both patients and doctors. Future progress in management will benefit from an increased appreciation of the contribution of non-medical factors and a greater awareness of the conceptual and clinical findings from social neuroscience, occupational health, and clinical psychology...|$|R
