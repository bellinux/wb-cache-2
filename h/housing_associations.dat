After World War II {{when there was a}} {{shortage}} of housing and the city council bought up older properties, including some in Royal Crescent, as public housing to rent out. The Housing Act 1985 changed the succession of Council Houses and facilitated the transfer of council housing to not-for-profit <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> Several were subsequently sold into private ownership, however one remains in council ownership.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 {{there were}} {{estimated}} to be 2.37 million households in Scotland. Of these approximately 1.5 million (62.5 per cent) were owner-occupied homes, 319,000 (12.7 per cent) homes rented from local authorities, 305,000 (11.5 per cent) privately rented homes, and 277,000 (11.5 per cent) homes rented from <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> The total number had increased by around 173,000 (7.9 per cent) over the previous ten years, with {{the rate of increase}} having slowed substantially {{since the start of the}} economic downturn in 2007. The rate of growth in households was affected by falls in new housing supply (which includes new builds, refurbishments and conversions). This fell in each year from 2008–09 to 2010–11, from around 27,600 units in 2007–08 to 17,100 units in 2010–11. The number of households increased after 2010 in every local authority except Clackmannanshire, Inverclyde and West Dunbartonshire. The area with the greatest increase since 2001 in percentage terms was Aberdeenshire with an additional 13,800 households (15.2 per cent). Edinburgh City saw the largest absolute increase of 17,000 households (8.3 per cent). Overall 2.8 per cent of dwellings are vacant and 1.5 per cent are second homes, with the largest proportions in rural areas.|$|E

500|$|A {{movement}} {{began to}} clear the slums – with Burdett-Coutts building Columbia Market in 1869 and {{with the passing of}} the [...] "Artisans' and Labourers' Dwelling Act" [...] in 1876 to provide powers to seize slums from landlords and provide access to public funds to build new housing. <b>Housing</b> <b>associations</b> such as the Peabody Trust were formed to provide philanthropic homes for the poor and clearing the slums generally. Expansion work by the railway companies, such as the London and Blackwall Railway and Great Eastern Railway, caused large areas of slum housing to be demolished. The [...] "Working Classes Dwellings Act" [...] in 1890 placed a new responsibility to house the displaced residents and this led to the building of new [...] "philanthropic housing" [...] such as Blackwall Buildings and Great Eastern Buildings.|$|E
500|$|Historically, the East End has {{suffered}} from under-investment in both housing stock and infrastructure. From the 1950s, the East End represented the structural and social changes affecting the UK economy in a microcosm. The area {{had one of the}} highest concentrations of council housing, the legacy both of slum clearance and wartime destruction. The progressive closure of docks, cutbacks in railways and the closure and relocation of industry contributed to a long-term decline, removing many of the traditional sources of low- and semi-skilled jobs. [...] However, beginning with the LDDC, in the 1980s, {{there have been a number}} of urban regeneration projects, most notably Canary Wharf, a huge commercial and housing development on the Isle of Dogs. Many of the 1960s tower blocks have been demolished or renovated, replaced by low-rise housing, often in private ownership, or owned by <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b>|$|E
