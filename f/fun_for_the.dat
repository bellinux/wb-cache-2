5|$|Jan Pinkava came up {{with the}} concept in 2000, {{creating}} the original design, sets and characters and core storyline, but he was never formally named the director of the film. Lacking confidence in Pinkava's story development, Pixar management replaced him with Bird in 2005. Bird was attracted to the film because of the outlandishness of the concept and the conflict that drove it: that rats feared kitchens, yet a rat wanted to work in one. Bird was also delighted that the film could be made a highly physical comedy, with the character of Linguini providing endless <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> animators. Bird rewrote the story, with a change in emphasis. He killed off Gusteau, gave larger roles to Skinner and Colette, and also changed the appearance of the rats to be less anthropomorphic.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Andrew Kreisberg, Josh Lieb and Matt Warburton, and Mike B. Anderson served as the director.

[...] On the other hand, Anderson stated that the episode was [...] "much harder" [...] to direct than others because, like with Treehouse of Horror episodes, the animators had to make as many character designs for one act as they would for one normal episode.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; in which negative assessments sorted {{the film as}} [...] "silly and illogical" [...] and [...] "begins with the same flawed premise" [...] of its precursor, while positive evaluations eulogized the film as [...] "a real jolter for horror fans", [...] "recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter", and [...] "surprisingly good <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> current crop of horror films". The film grossed $46 million domestically and $43 million overseas, earning $90 million internationally. It was also nominated for four awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film.|$|E

He appears in the scene where Arwen is leaving for the Grey Havens and has a vision of her future son, Eldarion, this time with two lines warning her to not delay and then exclaiming as she turns around. Director Peter Jackson stated in the DVD commentary for The Return of the King that Figwit was called back and given dialogue in the third film [...] "just for <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fans" [...] because [...] "so much fuss has been made about him {{over the last couple}} of years".|$|E
500|$|... "Tales {{from the}} Public Domain" [...] was {{directed}} by Mike B. Anderson and written by Andrew Kreisberg, Josh Lieb and Matt Warburton. It originally aired on March 17, 2002 on the Fox network. [...] "Tales from the Public Domain" [...] is the third trilogy episode produced for the series, the other two being [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories" [...] from season 10, and [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] from season 12. Al Jean, the show runner for the episode, stated that trilogy episodes are [...] "very <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> writers" [...] to do because {{it allows them to}} parody [...] "great works of literature" [...] and condense them into one act each.|$|E

500|$|Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict was {{positive}} on the season, but wrote [...] "I {{do not think}} that adults will be as entertained as in previous seasons. The comedy is more targeted at the kids than in the past." [...] In particular, Hrab cited the episode [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] as [...] "tiresome (for adults, anyway; kids will enjoy it)." [...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot of silly and good-natured <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> kids and there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement". He added [...] " [...] delivers more of what SpongeBob fans crave." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Hoshino, the series' main theme {{focuses on}} tragedy. Many {{characters}} such as Allen across the series suffer poor fates such as losing {{a loved one}} and being tempted to revive them by the Earl. Although this works, the people are revived as Akumas who consume the skin of their loved ones. This has led to state that an initial theme is that people should not be brought back to life. Although some characters like Kanda express unconditional love to Alma, their happiness is short-lived due to Alma dying shortly after this with another writer finding fitting for the series' dark narrative. Additionally, Allen's life becomes sadder across the series as he is forced to abandon the Black Order due to the Pope removing his rights as an exorcist and he is treated as Noah due to his connections with these characters. Nevertheless, Hoshino still {{tried to make it}} <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> readers, stating that Allen will always have allies.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com, and thought that Marta DuBois' {{performance}} was [...] "the only reason why this episode is in any way watchable. Barely". He thought that the episode felt more similar to an [...] story than a normal Next Generation story, and that was due to the episode's origins. He said [...] "overall, it’s just dumb" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten. Zack Handlen thought more positively of the episode when he reviewed it for The A.V. Club. He did think that Captain Picard was pretending to be Captain Kirk for most of the episode and that it didn't have any real drama but that it was [...] "silly, goofy <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part". He thought the episode was [...] "cute" [...] and gave it an overall score of B+.|$|E
5000|$|Kevin O'Sullivan of Daily Mirror {{gave the}} series a {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "atrocious" [...] and a [...] "barrel-scraping programme that’s <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> none of <b>the</b> family." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{birth of}} the Federation was first hinted at during part two of [...] "Shockwave", which opened the second season. When Manny Coto was made show runner for the fourth season, he decided that {{the focus of the}} series should be to link to that event. With this in mind, his {{intention}} was for this season to move towards that goal. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens were hired as writers on Enterprise because they wrote the non-canon novel Federation and after it was suggested by producer Mike Sussman. The episodes for the fourth season were intended to lay the framework for the later creation of the Federation. This was something that the cast said that they would have liked to see more of, with Scott Bakula later saying [...] "I {{would have loved to have}} been able to explore that journey to the Federation and their creation of it... to a greater extent. And I think that would have been, um, just more <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> audience... just better, longer storytelling." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Massa thanked Whiting in the media; {{he said he felt}} Whiting [...] "did an excellent job of managing the situation, making the right decisions as to when to start the race and when to bring in the Safety Car at the right moment". Schumacher, Petrov, Sutil and Buemi also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. Hamilton said he felt the length of time under safety-car conditions was not [...] "good for the spectators and it's not <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> drivers". He additionally felt the track was dry enough for a normal restart. BBC commentator and former driver Martin Brundle said he felt the race should have started at an earlier time, while Button said he thought the event should have been stopped before visibility became poor. Nevertheless, the Grand Prix was awarded the Race Promoters Trophy at the FIA Gala Awards held in Monte Carlo in December 2010.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} sound, Lee {{described}} [...] "What You Want" [...] as [...] "very danceable" [...] {{and her own}} vocals as [...] "fun and snappy and it gives a cool dynamic [...] ". Lee stated {{that the process of}} recording the song was <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band as they had excess time. She said that initially the song was conceived while the band was just recording demo, but as time passed it progressed and grew into something more. She wrote a chorus for [...] "What You Want" [...] and played it on the piano. Lee revealed that she was initially embarrassed when she came up with the lyrics and the melody of the song as she thought the members of her band would think she was Janet Jackson due to the usage of a hook. During an interview with M Music & Musicians Lee revealed that she wouldn't have recorded the song if it had been brought to her before the recording of Evanescence as she would have thought it was [...] "stupid".|$|E

500|$|Conversely, other columnists {{applauded the}} film's comedic theme. A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{imparted}} [...] "it's not as cheekily knowing as the Scream movies or as trashily Grand Guignol as the Evil Dead franchise, but like those pictures it recognizes the {{close relationship between}} fright and laughter, and dispenses both with a free, unpretentious hand." [...] C. W. Nevius of San Francisco Chronicle conveyed its [...] "funnier than the original." [...] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide pronounced [...] "if this is your idea of fun, step right up." [...] William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer found it as [...] "a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle admired how [...] "it is surprisingly good <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> current crop of horror films, reasonably well-plotted and full of jaw-dropping, white-knuckle scares. That said, it’s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended." [...] Nev Pierce of BBC saw that [...] "it's simple, but effective"; whereas Sheila Norman-Culp of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution proclaimed that [...] "what Final Destination did for the fear of flying, Final Destination 2 does for the fear of driving." ...|$|E
500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as [...] "something different from the norm" [...] which [...] "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being [...] "awkward" [...] which [...] "takes time to really find its rhythm". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven to be quite a lot of <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|The writers {{had gone}} through {{different}} scenarios on how Michael would leave with one suggestion being that he was fired due to a business mistake. They ultimately decided that ending would not be [...] "as much <b>fun</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> viewers". According to Daniels, filming on set actors being [...] "very emotional" [...] and would often be [...] "sadder than their characters were supposed to be". Andy Buckley confirmed filming a scene saying goodbye to Michael as David Wallace; however, these scenes were deleted from the network airing. When the episode re-aired three weeks later, it was split into two parts, and Wallace's scene was inserted into the first part. Steve Carell finished filming his final scenes for [...] "Goodbye, Michael" [...] on March 4, 2011. As a goodbye gift, Carell was given a hockey jersey with the #1—his number on the call sheet. After Carell's departure the number was no longer used. The episode ran for an extended 50 minutes {{instead of the usual}} 30 minutes. The episode marks the first extended episode since the third season penultimate episode, [...] "Beach Games". Greg Daniels stated in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that due to Ferrell's performance and Michael's goodbyes, the episode [...] "ended up being real long". NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt allowed Daniels to [...] "do whatever is best [...] to give Steve [...] the proper goodbye.|$|E
