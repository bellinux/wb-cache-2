Sexual headaches occur in the skull and neck during sexual activity, including masturbation or orgasm.|$|E
25|$|Maqam Mahour, {{which is}} related to Maqam Rast, is applied when someone is angry and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of {{emotional}} instability. The only two parashiot to have this maqam applied is Toledot and Balak when the main characters, Esau and Balak respectively, are angered. This maqam is used in other instances according to the manuscripts of Hakham Moshe Ashear and Cantor Gabriel A. Shrem.|$|E
25|$|Although {{constructed}} with different systems, {{all of the}} buildings on the site give a common image and appear as a unified whole. The architects achieved this {{by the use of}} some common elements in all the buildings. The first one is the use of floor-to-ceiling glass windows on steel frames that go around the corners of the buildings without a visible (most of the time without any) structural support. The other unifying element is the use of brick. All buildings have a base of about 40cm of black brick and the rest is built of yellow bricks. The combined effect <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of lightness or as Gropius called it “etherealization”.|$|E

500|$|The {{characters}} are depicted neither as purely good or evil: for example, Rosie in [...] "The Super" [...] triumphs over the racist, abusive superintendent by stealing his money, having him framed for pedophilia, and driving him to suicide. [...] Confinement is a prominent theme; Eisner chooses perspectives {{through which the}} reader views the characters framed by doorways, window frames, or sheets of rain. [...] Frimme Hersh seeks freedom from oppressive Eastern European antisemitism; there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of elation for characters in the final story as they find {{their way out of}} the tenement's, and the city's, confinement.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Observer, Alison Kelly of the University of Oxford {{observed}} the novel's philosophical qualities, and opined that its [...] "thriller-style hints and foreshadowings... {{form part of}} a metaphysical investigation." [...] Kelly describes it as an exposé of the worst depths of human nature, labelling it existentialist' {{to the extent that}} it confronts the minimal limits of identity". She further argues that the novel's motif of facial recognitions amounts to the message that people should be read [...] "at face value", and that furthermore, past action is the greatest indicator of future behaviour, leaving no room for [...] "change, growth, [...] self-reinvention". In terms of stylistic literary changes, Ellis also displays more fondness for the Ruskinian pathetic fallacy than in previous works. For the most part, the novel is written in Ellis' trademark writing style; Lawson refers to this as [...] "sexual and narcotic depravities in an emotionless tone." [...] With regard to this style, Ellis cites precursors to himself, particular the work of filmmakers. Ellis feels that the technique itself gives the reader a unique kind of insight into the characters, and comments that [...] "numbness <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> too. Emotionality isn't the only feeling there is." [...] In terms of style, Ellis told Vice that he enjoyed his return to minimalism, because of the challenge of [...] "rying to achieve that kind of tension with so few words was enjoyable to do." [...] While some reviewers of popular fiction derided Ellis's style as [...] "flat", others found it unexpectedly moving.|$|E

2500|$|Semantic and {{episodic memory}} {{together}} {{make up the}} category of declarative memory, {{which is one of}} the two major divisions of memory – the other is implicit memory. The term [...] "episodic memory" [...] was coined by Endel Tulving in 1972. He was referring to the distinction between knowing and remembering. Knowing is more factual (semantic) whereas remembering <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that is located in the past (episodic).|$|E

2500|$|Shortness of breath, {{also known}} as dyspnea, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> like one cannot breathe well enough. The American Thoracic Society defines it as [...] "a {{subjective}} experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", and recommends evaluating dyspnea by assessing {{the intensity of the}} distinct sensations, the degree of distress involved, and its burden or impact on activities of daily living. Distinct sensations include effort/work, chest tightness, and air hunger (the feeling of not enough oxygen).|$|E
2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the person receiving sedative, the effect <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of general relaxation, amnesia (loss of memory) and time passing quickly. [...] Many drugs can produce a sedative effect including benzodiazepines, propofol, thiopental, ketamine and inhaled general anesthetics. [...] The advantage of sedation over a general anesthetic is that it generally does not require support of the airway or breathing (no tracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation) and can have less of an effect on the cardiovascular system which may add to a greater margin of safety in some patients.|$|E
2500|$|Post-coital tristesse (PCT) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{of melancholy}} and anxiety after sexual {{intercourse}} that lasts anywhere from {{five minutes to}} two hours. PCT, [...] which affects both men and women, occurs only after sexual intercourse and does not require an orgasm to occur, and in that its effects are primarily emotional rather than physiological. By contrast, POIS affects only men, consists primarily of physiological symptoms that are triggered by ejaculation and that can last, in some people, {{for up to a}} week. While PCT and POIS are distinct conditions, some doctors speculate that they could be related.|$|E

50|$|In a 1999 {{study of}} 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, group {{discussions about the}} topic of {{how they felt about}} South Korea led to many feelings. There was anger about the {{negative}} way Koreans view adopted Koreans. There was concern over Korean orphans in South Korean orphanages, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of obligation to help the Korean orphans who remained in the South Korean orphanages. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of responsibility to change Koreans' views of domestic adoption, so that adopting an orphan in South Korea would not be something that Koreans in South Korea would be ashamed of doing.|$|R
2500|$|Fear <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{induced by}} {{perceived}} danger or threat {{that occurs in}} certain types of organisms, which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in behavior, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur {{in response to a}} specific stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to body or life. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.|$|E
2500|$|Anxiety is {{an emotion}} {{characterized}} by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death. Anxiety {{is not the same}} as fear, which is a response to a [...] real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat. Anxiety <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.|$|E

It was shot in New York City warehouses, Petty noted that the video {{unexpectedly}} celebrated Knowles' pregnancy as there are scenes in which Knowles baby bump are visible and not. She added that these circumstances meant that the video was developed under [...] "evolving circumstances that remained flexible". According to John Mitchell of MTV News: [...] " [...] a perfect mix of classic and modern, {{which seems to be}} what Beyoncé is aiming for in this era of her career.

2500|$|The novel {{explores the}} issue of {{timelessness}} or eternity even {{within the framework of}} mortal existence. A major trope with which it accomplishes this task is the alchemist's laboratory in the Buendía family home. [...] The laboratory was first designed by Melquíades near the start of the story and remains essentially unchanged throughout its course. [...] It is a place where the male Buendía characters can indulge their will to solitude, whether through attempts to deconstruct the world with reason {{as in the case of}} José Arcadio Buendía, or by the endless creation and destruction of golden fish as in the case of his son Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Furthermore, a sense of inevitability prevails throughout the text. [...] This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that regardless of what way one looks at time, its encompassing nature is the one truthful admission.|$|E
2500|$|Attempting {{to achieve}} {{recognition}} of the [...] "Circassian genocide" [...] {{is also a very}} prominent movement among Circassians, though it is not necessarily purely nationalist. Another major movement, often tied into this, but more blatantly nationalistic, is the movement to recreate a [...] "historical Circassia", the core of Circassian nationalism, with its historical territories, and make Circassian one group on the census. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> among some Circassians that the notion that Kabardins, Adyghe, Cherkes and Shapsugs (all four are separate on the Russian census) are different nations is a Kremlin strategy designed to divide the Circassian nation. Many politicians even warn that if this is not removed, that [...] "dismemberment will ultimately lead to the death of the Circassian nation". Many Circassian nationalists (moderates, such as Cherkesov) do not advocate withdrawing from the Russian federation, holding instead that a unified Circassia still within Russia is good enough. Nonetheless, most assert that this unified Circassia within Russia should have one official language, Adyghe.|$|E
2500|$|Another common {{feeling that}} {{many people who are}} adopted deal with <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of guilt. This guilt is felt towards both their birth {{families}} as well as their adoptive families. They may feel guilty towards their birth family because in many ways, they have accepted their adoptive family as their own and would not want their birth family to be upset or jealous. Many adoptees call their adoptive parents [...] "mom" [...] and [...] "dad" [...] and refer to adoptive siblings as such, which adoptees feel may hurt their biological families, should they find out. The sense of guilt towards adoptive parents comes from curiosity about biological families. Adoptees often feel that any curiosity about their origins and their birth families may hurt their adoptive one. They believe that the adoptive family will feel a sense of betrayal for wanting to know about where they came from, especially if the adoption allows for access to such information. Adoptees may also fear that their adoptive family may love them less because of their curiosity.|$|E
