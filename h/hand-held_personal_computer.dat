5000|$|The {{generic term}} <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> was in use before 1981, applied {{as early as}} 1972 to the Xerox PARC's Alto, {{but because of the}} success of the IBM <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer,</b> the term [...] "PC" [...] came to mean more {{specifically}} a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM's <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> branded products.

50|$|The {{history of}} the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> as a mass-market {{consumer}} electronic device began with the microcomputer revolution of the 1980s. The 1981 launch of the IBM <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> coined both the term <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> and PC. A <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> is one intended for interactive individual use,, {{as opposed to a}} mainframe computer where the end user's requests are filtered through operating staff, or a time-sharing system in which one large processor is shared by many individuals. After the development of the microprocessor, individual <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> were low enough in cost that they eventually became affordable consumer goods. Early <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> - generally called microcomputers - were sold often in electronic kit form and in limited numbers, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians.|$|R

40|$|A two-phased study {{investigating}} {{the role of}} attitudes and beliefs {{in the use of}} <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> was conducted in 9 organizations. During the first phase a questionnaire was administered to 278 knowledge workers within one organization. The measurement scale items were tested and revised slightly, and the research model tested also. In the second phase, the revised questionnaire was administered to 364 knowledge workers (80 % gross response rate) in 8 diverse organizations. The measures and research model were tested using Partial Least Squares. Nine of eleven hypothesized relations were supported statistically, and 38 % of the variance was explained in the major dependent variable, utilization. The general findings were: (1) There were three distinct components of attitudes identified which relate to the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers,</b> including (a) job-related expectations of use, (b) correspondence between job tasks and <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use, and (c) general beliefs about <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use (difficulty, time requirements). (2) Of the different attitude components, only correspondence had a significant influence on <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> utilization. (3) Experience with <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> strongly influenced all three components of attitudes, and also influenced the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> directly. (4) Management support had a positive influence on expectations and general beliefs about <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use, but there was no direct relation between management support and utilization. (5) A strong relation was observed between the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> and related aspects of performance.;The implications of the findings for practitioners are that organizations wishing to increase the amount and effectiveness of <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use by knowledge workers should stress the potential correspondence between the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> environment and current job tasks. As the experience level with <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> increases, further applications for job tasks are discovered and utilization increases. The cycle repeats itself, with increased use and experience leading to greater appreciation of the correspondence between job tasks and the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> environment. For researchers, the results confirmed the need to examine separate components of attitudes within the context of system utilization. Also, the measures which were developed and tested are appropriate for future research...|$|R
