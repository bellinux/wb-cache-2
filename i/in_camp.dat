40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the conceptual framework}} and application of a working model (‘EPSoCare’) for psychosocial intervention for refugees living <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> low income countries. The intervention’s main objective is social re-integration of individuals with psychosocial problems. The model was applied in pilot programmes <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> with survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The interventions aimed to cover 360. 000 refugees <b>in</b> <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> Tanzania, and 230. 000 <b>in</b> a <b>camp</b> <b>in</b> Zaire. The pilot programmes were heavily impacted by the prevalent insecurity <b>in</b> the <b>camps</b> and the atmos-phere of mistrust resulting from it, {{as well as by}} the insufficiency of social services. The development of psycho-education material took more time than expected. Medical staff was not easily ready to be trained in psychosocial concepts. The course of the programmes showed the need for protocols with a well-defined target group and support offer, and a clear-cut working plan...|$|R
