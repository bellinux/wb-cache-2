5|$|The {{question}} in the case was whether Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have no prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Tähtinen {{concludes that}} Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their {{position}} is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> happen to be his own brothers and sons.|$|E
5000|$|Feedback: Real time meters at {{the exit}} to most labs allow users to quickly check whether all the hoods are closed each <b>evening</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are {{the last one to}} leave the lab.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Although Vainio {{himself did}} not consume alcohol, he was {{tolerant}} about others' alcohol use and could {{spend time with}} his friends <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> drank, keeping alcohol in his house in case his friends came over. He also began discussing the topic of drinking in his lyrics. Getting rid of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio's domestic problems; he and Taina ended up divorcing.|$|E
5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would have been unable to field their cars, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E

5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional {{tax on the}} gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in the}} White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, when World Rugby was {{considering}} {{a change in}} the eligibility rules for international selection, FFR president Bernard Laporte announced that the body would require that all France national team members hold French passports. This requirement is in addition to then-current WR rules mandating three years' residency for international selection, a period which WR increased to five years effective from 31 December 2020. Players who represented France prior to Laporte's announcement remain eligible for selection <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do not hold French passports.|$|E

5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how surprised {{he was at the}} response from viewers who wrote to say that the episode allowed them to accept the death of a close family member, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had not acknowledged it for months or years. Joyce's death was the first by natural causes in the series.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E

5000|$|Wealthy {{consumers}} indeed {{seem more}} and more influenced by the so-called [...] "existential guilt", a particular sense of guilt individuals may <b>even</b> experience <b>if</b> <b>they</b> feel they benefit from unjustified privileges relative to others or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> accept some responsibility for social ills.|$|R
50|$|A {{person may}} not <b>even</b> know <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were charged. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> are worried {{they may have}} been charged with a crime, they can contact an {{attorney}} to find out <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were charged. A police officer may also charge someone after they investigate the possible crime they committed.|$|R

5|$|Other themes include {{chance and}} coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that {{neither he nor}} his brother would take vengeance on those who had voted against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E
5|$|The Big Four Bridge {{was finally}} {{completed}} in September 1895. Due {{to the various}} accidents, the Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company was financially strapped after building the bridge, and later in 1895 sold it to the Indianapolis-based Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, {{also known as the}} Big Four Railroad. This gave the railway its first entry into the Louisville market, although the railroad would have likely used the bridge <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had not bought it, as they desired access to Louisville.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} Graham and Macdonnell {{continue}} {{to be remembered as}} an iconic moment in the battle of Waterloo. In 1915, cigarette manufacturers W.D. & H.O. Wills portrayed Graham and Macdonnell on one of the cigarette cards printed to commemorate the centenary of Waterloo. Since then, many authors of fiction concerning Waterloo have recreated the events at the gate, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> include their own fictional heroes they attribute the closing of the gate to Macdonnell and Graham.|$|E
5|$|The {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} transmitter pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short time}} <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as the transmitter break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are {{of the same species}} is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
