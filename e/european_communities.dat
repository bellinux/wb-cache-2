5|$|Before {{deciding}} on Capital Waterside {{as the site}} of the National Assembly, Davies announced on 13 March 1998, that an international competition would be held to select the design of the building for the debating chamber. Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Competitions would oversee the competition and a design panel would recommend a design to the Secretary of State for Wales. The Design Competition Advisory Panel was made up of seven members and was chaired by Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, the former MP for Cardiff South and Penarth and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The chair and four members were appointed by Davies and the remaining two members were appointed by the RIBA. The competition was advertised in the Official Journal of the <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> on 13 June 1998.|$|E
5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|During colonial times, {{prior to}} the {{establishment}} of the ACT, the <b>European</b> <b>communities</b> of Ginninderra, Molonglo and Tuggeranong settled in and farmed the surrounding land, raising sheep in the main but also breeding horses and growing grain. The region was also called the Queanbeyan/Yass district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities. In 1882, the first allotments in the village of Hall – named after early pastoralist Henry Hall – were sold. By 1901, it was an established town with a hotel, coachbuilder, blacksmith, butcher, shoemaker, saddler, dairy and two stores.|$|E
40|$|The {{relations}} between the United States and the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> under the Nixon Administration (1969 - 1974) were considerably changing. Post- 1945 cooperation and dependence increasingly gave way to economic competition and division in military and foreign policies. Yet, the United States and the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> {{knew that they were}} strategically important to each other, thus they had to continue cooperation and coordination to defend and advance their economic and strategic interests. With a documentary research approach, this paper aims to examine how the United States and the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> their partnership evolved between 1969 and 1974. It explores the ties that the Nixon Administration designed to bind the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> and the <b>European</b> <b>Community’s</b> responses. It also puts forth that despite their efforts to continue cooperation; the {{relations between}} the United States and the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> were on a downward course. It will be concluded that the United States and the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> experienced a difficult time in their relations between 1969 and 1974, but both sides showed certain efforts to maintain the partnership...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} English and <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> administrative law. The main aim is to draw out {{the nature of this}} relationship by comparing the development of two principles, the principles of legitimate expectations and proportionality, within English and <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> administrative law. A secondary aim is to assess the challenge presented by <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> law for English law. The emphasis is on the distinct visions of law or legal traditions which have influenced both systems of administrative law rather than specific substantive laws. Chapter 2 identifies the nature of the English and Continental traditions of administrative law and the development of English and <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> administrative law. More specifically, English law is based on the common law approach while Continental and <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> administrative law has a more purposive orientation. Chapter 3 examines the pressures for the adoption of the two principles in English law. These pressures have been both internal, through the role of Lord Diplock, and external, through the influence of <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> law. In Chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 the principles are examined in depth in both <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> and English administrative law. Comparative observations of the articulation of the principles in <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> law and their development in English law are made in chapters 5 and 7. In this respect the identification of the different traditions of administrative law becomes crucial in assessing the success of the principles as legal transplants in English law. The conclusion draws together these themes in order to identify the relationship between English and <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> law. An assessment is also made of the challenge presented by <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> law and suggestions are made as to what English law ought {{to do in order to}} respond effectively...|$|R

The Taiwan and South Korea pavilions showed their rapid industrialization {{to the world and}} the benefits of capitalism over communism during the time of cold war era. Other pavilions included one featuring Brazilian tea and coffee; a <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> Pavilion from the then six countries of the European Economic Community; and a joint pavilion by those countries of Africa that had by then achieved independence. Sweden's exhibit included the story of the salvaging of a 17th-century man-of-war from Stockholm harbor, and San Marino's exhibit featured its postage stamps and pottery. Near the center of this was the DuPen Fountain featuring three sculptures by Seattle artist Everett DuPen.|$|E
5|$|Jersey {{is neither}} a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. It does, however, have a {{relationship}} with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972. However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This {{is a result of the}} manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> like Gibraltar, being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most <b>European</b> <b>communities</b> in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E

5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the <b>European</b> <b>Communities.</b> The institutions were carried {{over from the}} European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.|$|E
5|$|Under the Merger Treaty of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together {{with their}} other {{independent}} institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC, which {{would act as}} a single Council of the <b>European</b> <b>Communities.</b> In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following {{the establishment of the}} European Union by the Maastricht Treaty. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the three pillars system. However, {{at the same time the}} Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the Community pillar, curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most {{recently}} from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population saying they would not bother to vote in the 2014 EU elections. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> by 1987.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the entry}} into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union {{comprised}} a system of three legal pillars, of which only the <b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> pillar had its own legal personality. The Treaty of Lisbon abolished this pillar system, and as a consolidated entity, the European Union succeeded the legal personality of the <b>European</b> <b>Communities.</b> Therefore, the EU is now able to sign international treaties in its own name.
