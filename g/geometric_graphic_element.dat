40|$|Graduation date: 1983 An {{interactive}} {{computer graphics}} package was developed {{for the purpose of}} solving certain geometric problems in the Euclidean plane. The <b>Geometric</b> <b>Graphics</b> Package provides basic application-independent functions for creating arbitrary views of two-dimensional objects and for supporting interaction between the application program and its user. The application program contains a number of useful functions for our purpose. Our specific application of the <b>Geometric</b> <b>Graphics</b> Package was to develop a heuristic algorithm for the Euclidean Steiner Minimal Tree, known as Steiner's Problem. The problem has been proved to be at least as difficult as any of the NP-complete problems. We present a heuristic algorithm using fixed tension physical relations for the problem. The <b>Geometric</b> <b>Graphics</b> Package is {{to be used as a}} tool and to guide us in improving the heuristic...|$|R

50|$|In graphic design, a grid is a {{structure}} (usually two-dimensional) {{made up of}} a series of intersecting straight (vertical,horizontal, and angular) or curved guide lines used to structure content. The grid serves as an armature or framework on which a designer can organize <b>graphic</b> <b>elements</b> (images, glyphs, paragraphs, etc.) in a rational, easy-to-absorb manner. A grid can be used to organize <b>graphic</b> <b>elements</b> in relation to a page, in relation to other <b>graphic</b> <b>elements</b> on the page, or relation {{to other parts of the}} same <b>graphic</b> <b>element</b> or shape.|$|R

40|$|The topicality of the {{investigated}} {{problem is}} stipulated {{by the social}} need for training competitive engineers {{with a high level}} of graphical literacy; especially <b>geometric</b> and <b>graphic</b> training of students and its projected results in a competence-based approach; individual characteristics and interests of the students, as well as methodological approaches to the design of training and methodological support of the process of individualization of <b>geometric</b> and <b>graphic</b> training. The purpose of the article is to develop a structural and functional model of organization of <b>geometric</b> and <b>graphic</b> training of students of a technical University and its approbation. The leading method of research of this problem is a pedagogical modeling, which allows to consider this issue as a process of developing students readiness to operate spatial objects in the study of <b>geometric</b> and <b>graphic</b> disciplines. The article presents the structural and functional organization model of <b>geometric</b> and <b>graphic</b> training of students in technical university, consisting of interrelated components: a target, theoretical and methodological, technological, diagnostic and effective; we developed an algorithm for the implementation of this model. The article can be useful for the organization of the <b>geometric</b> and <b>graphic</b> training in universities, with appropriate adaptation in educational institutions of secondary vocational education in specialized classes in secondary schools. © 2016 Poluyanov et al...|$|R

40|$|This study tests three {{different}} interventions for {{hard of hearing}} students who have written language needs. Participants wrote first drafts of narratives, and retold the narrative to the investigator, who represented the retelling in three ways: (a) through simple picture sequences, (b) through picture sequences with added <b>graphic</b> <b>elements,</b> and (c) with direct instruction in <b>graphic</b> <b>element</b> meaning. Following the verbal-visual interventions, students wrote second drafts. The addition of <b>graphic</b> <b>elements</b> to picture sequences allowed participants to improve second drafts of stories, resulting in syntax, semantics and story grammar that more closely approximated the writing of children with normal hearing. Direct instruction in the meaning of <b>graphic</b> <b>elements</b> resulted in further improvement in second drafts by {{three of the four}} participants, with an observable impact on certain variables, specifically: (a) length of story, (b) length of T-unit, (c) increase in precise vocabulary use, (d) decrease in proportion of syntactic cohesive ties, (e) {{increase in the number of}} cohesive categories and (f) improved total scores for story grammar elements. ^ Although general trends were noted, in all cases there were complex interactions between student characteristics, targeted writing skills, and intervention types. Implications of the findings from this investigation for teachers of students who are hard of hearing are presented. The need for further study is discussed. ...|$|R
