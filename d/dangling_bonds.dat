5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds</b> which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
2500|$|They indeed {{found the}} long carbon chains {{they were looking}} for, but also found an {{unexpected}} product that had 60 carbon atoms. [...] Over the course of 11 days, the team studied and determined its structure and named it buckminsterfullerene after noting its similarity to the geodesic domes for which the architect Buckminster Fuller was known. This discovery was {{based solely on the}} single prominent peak on the mass spectrograph, implying a chemically inert substance that was geometrically closed with no <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds.</b> Curl was responsible for determining the optimal conditions of the carbon vapor in the apparatus, and examining the spectrograph. [...] Curl noted that James R. Heath and Sean C. O'Brien deserve equal recognition in the work to Smalley and Kroto. [...] The existence of this type of molecule had earlier been theorized by others, but Curl and his colleagues were at the time unaware of this. [...] Later experiments confirmed their proposed structure, and the team moved on to synthesize endohedral fullerenes that had a metal atom inside the hollow carbon shell. [...] The fullerenes, a class of molecules of which buckminsterfullerene was the first member discovered, are now considered to have potential applications in nanomaterials and molecular scale electronics. Robert Curl's 1985 paper entitled [...] "C60: [...] Buckminsterfullerine", published with colleagues H. Kroto, J. R. Heath, S. C. O’Brien, [...] and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015.

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{computer}} simulations {{of the light}} induced degradation of amorphous silicon solar cells. It is now well established that when amorphous silicon is illuminated the density of <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states increases. <b>Dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states produce amphoteric electronic mid-gap states which act as efficient charge trapping and recombination centres. The increase in <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states causes {{a decrease in the}} performance of amorphous silicon solar cells. To show this effect, a modelling approach has been developed which uses the density of localised states with exponentially increasing band-tails and <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> defect states distribution chosen according to the defect pool model. The calculation of the evolution of <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> state density during illumination has been achieved through a dynamic scaling relation derived from a defect creation model. The approach considers the amphoteric nature of the <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> state and thus accounts for the contributions of the different charge states of the <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> during the degradation process. This paper attempts to describe the simulation approach which calculates the defect density as a function of energy, position in the solar cell and illumination time. In excellent agreement with other workers, our simulation results show that the increase in the density of neutral <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states during illumination is higher than of the charged states...|$|R

30|$|It {{was well}} known that {{single-crystal}} silicon shows strong anisotropic etching behavior in alkaline solutions. Based on the electrochemical model proposed by Seidel et al. [21], the anisotropic etching behavior of silicon was mainly attributed to the differences on {{the density of the}} <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> as well as the structure and energy level of the backbond on the silicon surface. When the density of the <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> and the energy level of the backbond are high, the etching rate of the silicon surface in alkaline solutions is fast. Since { 100 } surfaces show the highest <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> density and a relatively high backbond energy level, the etching rate of { 100 } surfaces in alkaline solutions are the fastest. As a comparison, with one <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> and three backbonds per surface atom, the { 111 } surfaces show the lowest <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> density and the slowest etching rate in alkaline solutions. Finally, even with the similar <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> density as { 111 } surfaces, the { 110 } surfaces show a relatively higher backbond energy level and higher etching rate than { 111 } surfaces.|$|R

These <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds</b> can trap electron-hole pairs, thus reducing the current that can pass through. However, new experimental evidence is casting doubt on this model.

In undoped, but slightly n-type a-Si:H, the quality of the material will typically be related to the ambipolar diffusion length rather than to photoconductivity.

In this configuration, the molecule retains its intrinsic electronic properties, as confirmed by combined scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements, density functional theory calculations, and advanced STM image calculations. Continuous switching of the molecule is initiated by vibronic excitations when the electrons are tunneling through the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital state of the molecule.
