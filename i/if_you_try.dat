25|$|Ilê Aiyê's {{success has}} {{continued}} ever since and their numbers have grown into the thousands. Even today, the black only bloco continues to exclude others {{because of their}} skin color. They do this by advertising exclusive parties and benefits for members, as well as physically shunning and pushing you away <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to include yourself. Though the media has called it ‘racist’, {{to a large degree}} the black-only bloco {{has become one of the}} most interesting aspects of Salvador’s Carnaval and is continuously accepted as a way of life. Combined with the influence of Olodum in Salvador, musical protest and representation as a product of slavery and black consciousness has slowly grown into a more powerful force. Musical representation of problems and issues have long been part of Brazil's history, and Ilê Aiyê and Olodum both produce creative ways to remain relevant and popular.|$|E

500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to create that, then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality.

500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template. In an interview with Marlise Simons, García Márquez noted:In every book I {{try to make a}} different path [...] One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to use something that is not suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn't seen. I only respond to our way of life, the life of the Caribbean.|$|E

[...] Gilliam got so upset, filming {{was shut down}} for nearly two weeks. Matt Damon {{reflected}} on the situation: [...] "I've {{never been in a}} situation like that. Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like him. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to force him {{to do what you want}} creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E

At 08:32, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, notified FAA headquarters.|$|E
500|$|Modern writers also {{question}} {{the idea that}} White has an enduring advantage. Suba, in his influential 1991 book Dynamic Chess Strategy, rejects {{the notion that the}} initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage. He contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation, and that, [...] "Sometimes you must lose it, just like that. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to cling to it, by forcing the issue, your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won't be able to face a vigorous counter-attack." [...] Rowson and Watson concur. Watson also observes, [...] "Because of the presumption of White being better, the juncture of the game at which Black frees his game or neutralizes White's plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality, even though in dynamic openings, the exhaustion of White's initiative very often means that Black has seized it with advantage." ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bouchard cited [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as one of his favorite episodes of the series and revealed his liking of [...] "episodes where Louise is a little vulnerable...you don't want her to be as invulnerable as she pretends to be. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to keep the show grounded, then you periodically have to say, she's a nine-year-old girl." [...] He added that while the character has [...] "an adult sensibility about a lot of stuff," [...] he and the writing staff try to [...] "look for ways to bring her back down to earth," [...] citing the episode's depiction of Louise [...] "fighting against growing up," [...] with Tina acting as [...] "her strange ambassador into that world...in some ways, you couldn't ask for a better guide." ...|$|E

500|$|At the time, Patton's Third Army {{was engaged}} in heavy {{fighting}} near Saarbrücken. Guessing {{the intent of the}} Allied command meeting, Patton ordered his staff to make three separate operational contingency orders to disengage elements of the Third Army from its present position and begin offensive operations toward several objectives {{in the area of the}} bulge occupied by German forces. At the Supreme Command conference, Eisenhower led the meeting, which was attended by Patton, Bradley, General Jacob Devers, Major General Kenneth Strong, Deputy Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, and several staff officers. When Eisenhower asked Patton how long it would take him to disengage six divisions of his Third Army and commence a counterattack north to relieve the U.S. 101st Airborne Division which had been trapped at Bastogne, Patton replied, [...] "As soon as you're through with me." [...] Patton then clarified that he had already worked up an operational order for a counterattack by three full divisions on December 21, then only 48 hours away. Eisenhower was incredulous: [...] "Don't be fatuous, George. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to go that early you won't have all three divisions ready and you'll go piecemeal." [...] Patton replied that his staff already had a contingency operations order ready to go. Still unconvinced, Eisenhower ordered Patton to attack the morning of December 22, using at least three divisions.|$|E
500|$|Writer John Swartzwelder {{has noted}} that the staff members of the show write the {{character}} Homer {{in the same way}} that they write Santa's Little Helper: [...] "Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to take their food." [...] Although animals in cartoons often behave with [...] "semi-human awareness", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of The Simpsons tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared The Simpsons to the animated series Family Guy, Todd Camp of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram noted that [...] "though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch [...] is the brainiest member of the household". In 1991, Copley News Service's Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a [...] "sweet and stupid dog". Tom Coombe of The Morning Call wrote in 2002 that [...] "fans of The Simpsons will tell you that the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a different picture — of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [...] not given to drooling, panting".|$|E

2500|$|SST {{issued the}} Minutemen's debut EP Paranoid Time as its second release in 1980. The songs were {{recorded}} and mixed {{in a single}} night for $300.

[...] Facing hostility towards hardcore punk, SST groups like Black Flag and the Minutemen played wherever they could, mainly at house parties and in basements early on. Black Flag began traveling up the California coast to play Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, making seven trips in total.

Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, {{lack of access to}} the cockpit, and passenger injuries. At 8:24:38am, a voice believed to be Atta's was heard by air traffic controllers, saying: [...] "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport."

After pro-same-sex-marriage Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava {{withdrew from the}} race, Hoffman lost to Democrat Bill Owens, who also opposed gay marriage, by a 2.3% margin. State senators said that this congressional race affected the New York State Senate's December 2, 2009 vote against same-sex marriage legislation; all 30 Republican state senators voted [...] "no". [...] Following her unsuccessful campaign, Scozzafava acknowledged that her name had begun {{being used as a}} verb: [...] "scozzafavaed".

2500|$|In {{terms of}} continuity, events in {{different}} episodes contradict each other, {{as there is}} a loose sense of canon. One such example is in [...] "The Other Cousin" [...] and [...] "N.R.A.y RAY", in which Toot is pictured with a penis, something that is not consistent with other episodes. Another is Foxxy's various and contradictory stories about her son Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just brushing his teeth). Plots and gags are often used that do not make any type of internal sense, but are used as one-off jokes, as when Foxxy, who is in her twenties, is said to have a teenage grandson. Some episodes begin with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to executive producer Bill Freiberger, [...] "Very little on Drawn Together can be considered canon. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> to find continuity on this show you'll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that's consistent is we try to make the show as funny as possible. And we'd never let a little thing like continuity {{get in the way of}} that." ...|$|E
