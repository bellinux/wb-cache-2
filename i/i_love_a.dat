These include Robert Burns A Red, Red Rose, Hugh MacDiarmid's A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle, Sorley MacLean's Hallaig, Harry Lauder's <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>A</b> Lassie and in the 21st century, Runrig's And The Accordions Played. The last two lyrics include {{a reference to the}} bluebell. The [...] "Scottish Bluebell" [...] is Campanula rotundifolia, (known elsewhere as the [...] "Harebell") rather than Hyacinthoides non-scripta, the [...] "Common Bluebell".|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, {{the fictional}} couple {{appeared}} on Jack Benny's Shower of Stars, and, in 1960, on The Garry Moore Show. The couple won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album of 1960 {{for their work}} as the imaginary pair. While Weston was the conductor for The Danny Kaye Show, his perpetual houseguest, Jonathan Edwards, made an appearance on the program without his singing wife, Darlene. [...] The vocal for <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>a</b> Piano was provided by Kaye as the pair started the television show on March 25, 1964.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influences}} of <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>a</b> Mystery and Dobie Gillis were especially apparent {{in these early}} episodes. Of {{the similarities between the}} Scooby-Doo teens and the Dobie Gillis teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same beatnik-style goatee, similar hairstyles, and demeanors. The core premise of Scooby-Doo, Where are You! was also similar to Enid Blyton's Famous Five books. [...] Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories would often revolve around a mystery which would invariably turn out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to disguise the villain's true intent.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1976, Kiss {{appeared}} on The Paul Lynde Halloween Special, lip-synching [...] "Detroit Rock City", [...] "Beth" [...] and [...] "King of the Night Time World". The show, co-produced by Bill Aucoin, helped introduce Kiss {{to an even}} wider audience. In addition to the three songs, Kiss {{was the subject of}} a brief comedic [...] "interview" [...] conducted by Paul Lynde. This included Lynde noting, when hearing the member's first names, [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> good religious group." [...] The group was introduced to Lynde by Margaret Hamilton, reprising her character of the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard Of Oz.|$|E
2500|$|The fact is {{that for}} the whole inter-war period he was England's and Yorkshire's anchor-man, a {{personality}} as dependable as fallible human nature will allow, This does not mean that he was slow or stodgy... He lacked the polished artistry of Hobbs or the sheer princely quality of Hammond or the delightful impertinence of Holmes, but he lacked nothing else... His spirit warmed to the fight like that of an ancient warrior. His manner was suave; his hair immaculate; his voice quiet; but he revealed his truest self, after his 161 in the 1926 Oval Test, surely the most truly Sutcliffian innings of his life, when he said: 'Yes, Mr. Warner, <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>a</b> dogfight...' ...|$|E
2500|$|Fred Silverman, {{executive}} {{in charge of}} daytime programming for the CBS network at the time, {{was looking for a}} show that would revitalize his Saturday morning line and please the watch groups at the same time. The result was The Archie Show, based upon Bob Montana's teenage humor comic book Archie. Also successful were the musical numbers The Archies performed during each program (one of which, [...] "Sugar, Sugar", was the most successful Billboard number-one hit of 1969). Silverman was eager to build upon this success, and contacted producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera about possibly creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this one featuring teens who solved mysteries in between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>a</b> Mystery radio serials of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.|$|E
