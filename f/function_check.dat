40|$|Norm {{statistics}} {{allow for}} the interpretation of scores on psychological and educational tests, by relating the test score of an individual test taker to the test scores of individuals belonging to the same gender, age, or education groups, et cetera. Given the uncertainty due to sampling error, one would expect researchers to report standard errors for norm statistics. In practice, standard errors are seldom reported; they are either unavailable or derived under strong distributional assumptions {{that may not be}} realistic for test scores. We derived standard errors for four norm statistics (standard deviation, percentile ranks, stanine boundaries and Z-scores) under the mild assumption that the test scores are multinomially distributed. A simulation study showed that the standard errors were unbiased and that corresponding Wald-based confidence intervals had good coverage. Finally, we discuss the possibilities for applying the standard errors in practical test use in education and psychology. The procedure is provided via the R <b>function</b> <b>check.</b> norms, which is available in the mokken package...|$|E
40|$|A current premium {{vehicle is}} {{implemented}} {{with a variety}} of information, entertainment, and communication functions, which are generally referred as an infotainment system. During vehicle development, testing of the infotainment system at an overall level is conventionally carried out manually by an expert who can observe at a customer level. This approach has significant limitations with regard to test coverage and effectiveness due to the complexity of the system functions and human's capability. Hence, it is highly demanded by car manufacturers for an automated infotainment testing system, which replicates a human expert encompassing relevant sensory modalities relating to control (i. e., touch) and observation (i. e., sight and sound) of the system under test. This paper describes the design, development, and evaluation of such a system that consists of simulation of vehicle network, vision-based inspection, automated navigation of features, random cranking waveform generation, sound detection, and test automation. The system developed is able to: stimulate a vehicle system across a wide variety of initialisation conditions, exercise each <b>function,</b> <b>check</b> for system responses, and record failure situations for post-testing analysis. ...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to establish whether adding an additional thyroid <b>function</b> <b>check</b> between days of life 10 - 14 in infants born to mothers with known hypothyroidism identified any additional cases of congenital hypothyroidism requiring treatment that were not detected by the national newborn bloodspot screening programme. Babies who had Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs) measured at 10 - 14 days of age were identified using the Paediatric Ward attenders log from the years 2012 - 2014. Data were collected on patients’ TFTs and their mothers’ Anti-Thyroid Peroxidase (Anti-TPO) antibody levels. Of the 121 patients included, none were found to have a significantly raised TSH requiring treatment. 40 infants had repeat TFTs performed. None of the 121 infants had a significantly raised TSH, which required treatment with thyroxine. Congenital hypothyroidism is already being screened for as part of the National Newborn Screening Programme. The findings of our study have led us to recommend stopping current practice of routinely checking TFTs on day 10 - 14 of life in infants of hypothyroid mothers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{considerable}} {{variability of}} architecture and function realization of smart substation, which differ from traditional substations, makes the range of protection <b>function</b> <b>check</b> no longer restricted to one device, so {{it is necessary to}} carry out thorough monitoring and testing for various inks of functional implementation[1 - 2]. For this purpose, the automatic checking of protection functions for smart substation is researched, and a scheme for the implementation of the automatic checking is designed[3 - 4]. By means of adding various checking manners to application software implementation of the devices of protection system for smart substation, the checking and detection of various function implementation links of the protection system are performed, and by use of the expert system based on Dempster-Shafer theory a real-time virtual checking scheme is configured and through real-time analysis on checking information the conclusion of the checking is obtained. The proposed scheme enhances the self-diagnosis and self-monitoring ability of protection system for smart substation and gives full play to the superiority in digital information acquisition and information interaction of digital substation, so {{it can be used to}} the checking during on-site commissioning, besides, partial functions can be also used to perform on-line monitoring of protections being operated[5 - 9]...|$|E

There are many factors not only caused by the environment but also {{due to the lack}} of tools that simplify or reminds about beforehand inspections. The purpose of this project was to introduce a smart-phone application that can display the health state (or related parameters) of a vehicle in a brief way and indicate if a part or function of the truck is not working properly. There are six functions in the application. Function status and function fault codes can display information about vehicles by giving two-dimensional plots about vehicle data, while function VSR displays some information in the form of text. Also, the user can submit their feedback through function comment. Function position is designed to give the users specific perspectives on an imported map based on their different user identity. <b>Function</b> <b>check</b> reminds about inspections that must be made before setting out on a driving mission. The application allows bus drivers and managers to continuously monitor different vehicle parameters with a statistical summary over time, as well as providing a method for following-up that drivers perform basic checks on the vehicle before it is taken into traffic...|$|E

40|$|Multivariate {{analysis}} was used to build macroinvertebrate predictive models for stream assessment in Britain, Australia, and the west coast of the United States. The philosophy behind these predictive models was similar, but variations exist and have been adapted for different regions. The macroinvertebrate predictive model in Maryland has been improved using Region-style models, including the Assessment by Nearest Neighbour Analysis (ANNA), the Burn’s Region of Influence (BROI), and the New Datum Region of Influence (NROI) predictive schemes. For better prediction precision, different parameter selection methods (stepwise AIC, exhaustive AIC, and exhaustive BIC) and rational multiple regression <b>function</b> <b>checking</b> have been used to prevent overfitting. Root mean squared error (RMSE) was used to select the final best model. The calibration results from the Region-Style models are better than those from previously built River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System (RIVPACS) -style model.
