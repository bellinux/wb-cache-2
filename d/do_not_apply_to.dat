5|$|Despite being {{extremely}} dense at this time—far denser than {{is usually}} required {{to form a}} black hole—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This {{may be explained by}} considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for gravitational collapse are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as stars, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} and subsequently filed a civil libel {{suit against the}} Liberal Party. Because libel laws <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> statements made in the House of Commons, {{the basis of the}} lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal party members outside the House and in articles which appeared on the Liberal party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Pentecostalism, female members of La Luz del Mundo do not wear jewelery or makeup and are instructed to wear full, long skirts. Women can have their hair as short as their shoulder blades. These restrictions <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> recreational activities, where wearing bathing suits is permitted. Women wear a head covering during religious meetings. According to an interview of one adherent, women in the Church are considered equal to men in social spheres and have equal capacities for obtaining higher education, social careers, and other goals that may interest them.|$|E
50|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{the rule}} is of relatively limited application. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> property settled inter vivos. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> specific residuary bequests.|$|R

5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Senior {{members are}} members who joined CAP {{for the first}} time past the age of 18, or who are former cadets who {{transferred}} to the senior member program, which must happen by the cadet's 21st birthday. Senior members who have not yet turned 21years are eligible for flight officer grades, which include flight officer, technical flight officer, and senior flight officer. There is no mandatory retirement age for CAP members, and there are no physical requirements for joining. Members may enter retired status after twenty years of service. The only physical requirements an officer must follow are the grooming and weight standards required of members who wear the United States Air Force-style uniforms (these <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> members who choose to wear those uniform designs unique to Civil Air Patrol).|$|E
5|$|The monarch {{also has}} power to {{exercise}} her prerogative over {{the granting of}} honours, the regulation {{of the armed forces}} and ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the monarch is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the monarch has complete discretion to grant. In relation to the armed forces, the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The prerogative empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible. The monarch also exerts a certain influence power on His or Her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Further the {{posting rule}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> {{instantaneous}} forms of communications. For example, in Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation 1955 2 QB 327, the Court {{held that the}} posting rule <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> an acceptance by telex as the Court regarded it as an instantaneous form of communication. The general principle that acceptance takes place when communicated <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> instantaneous forms of communication. Courts have similarly held that the posting rule <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> acceptances by telephone or fax.|$|R

50|$|Article 1: The Convention <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> {{stateless}} persons {{under the}} protection of the UNHCR but not to those {{under the protection}} of other UN Agencies. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> persons with rights and obligations acknowledged by their country of residence as indistinguishable from those attached to the possession of that country's nationality. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> war criminals or to the perpetrators of crimes against humanity or against peace.

25|$|Barclays also {{provides}} two of Mugabe's associates with bank accounts, ignoring European Union sanctions on Zimbabwe.

Barclays has defended its position by insisting that the EU rules <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> its 67%-owned Zimbabwean subsidiary because it was incorporated outside the EU.|$|E
