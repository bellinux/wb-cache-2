5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women.

5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is found among all social, {{racial and ethnic}} groups and has been reported {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of Tourette syndrome begin <b>in</b> <b>childhood</b> and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than <b>in</b> <b>childhood.</b>|$|E
