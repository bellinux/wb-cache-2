5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England, Pantulf held {{lands in}} Shropshire from Earl Roger de Montgomery. The earl settled {{a number of}} his Norman vassals, {{including}} Pantulf, on his new lands in Sussex and Shropshire.

Pantulf's grants totalled eleven manors located in Hodnet Hundred. Pantulf's lands in England were centered on Wem, and are considered a feudal barony, making Pantulf the first Baron of Wem.
