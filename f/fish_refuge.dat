25|$|The {{uninhabited}} {{island in}} public ownership is fairly wooded {{and is used}} for nature conservation and appreciation. The west has a backwater dug out to provide a <b>fish</b> <b>refuge</b> when the stream is strong and a fish spawning stream constructed in 1999. The island has many paths laid out for viewing its trees, squirrels, nesting birds, fish and waterfowl. These particularly cater for angling; for the Thames two permits are issued by the Environment Agency that can be bought online or in post offices.|$|E

2500|$|A {{proposal}} to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to create a <b>fish</b> <b>refuge</b> in the Koktuli and Talarik watersheds was supported by mine opponents and opposed by Northern Dynasty. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted to create a panel to study the proposal (which could decide to recommend a refuge to the legislature). Both sides claimed this as a victory.

40|$|In rural Cambodia, fish is {{a source}} of food and income to {{millions}} of people. However, there has been a real threat to fish populations in natural wetlands due to the degradation of aquatic biodiversity and habitat, illegal fishing, increase of population and demand for fish, and the use of harmful pesticides for agriculture. The Rice Field Fisheries Enhancement Project (RFFEP) seeks to rebuild and protect the fish populations through innovative methods. The project works with communities to sustainably strengthen the rice field fisheries near their villages by improving protected habitats called "community fish refuges". This handbook characterizes rice field fisheries that are connected to community <b>fish</b> <b>refuges.</b> Community <b>fish</b> <b>refuges</b> are designated <b>fish</b> conservation areas promoted by the Fisheries Administration of the Royal Cambodian Government. It also examines the characteristics of rain-fed rice field ecosystems that are connected to community <b>fish</b> <b>refuges</b> in order to further refine descriptive criteria and better understand potential benefits and management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{reserves}} (or No-Take Zones) {{are implemented}} to protect species and habitats, {{with the aim}} of restoring a balanced ecosystem. Although the benefits of marine reserves are commonly monitored, {{there is a lack of}} insight into the potential detriments of such highly protected waters. High population densities attained within reserves may induce negative impacts such as unfavourable trophic cascades and disease outbreaks. Hence, we investigated the health of lobster populations in the UK’s Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) at Lundy Island. Comparisons were made between the <b>fished,</b> <b>Refuge</b> Zone (RZ) and the un-fished, No-Take Zone (NTZ; marine reserve). We show ostensibly positive effects such as increased lobster abundance and size within the NTZ; however, we also demonstrate apparent negative effects such as increased injury and shell disease. Our findings suggest that robust cost-benefit analyses of marine reserves could improve marine reserve efficacy and subsequent management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Fishes may exploit {{environmental}} vortices to save in {{the cost}} of locomotion. Previous work has investigated <b>fish</b> <b>refuging</b> behind a single cylinder in current, a behavior termed the K?rm?n gait. However, current-swept habitats often contain aggregations of physical objects, and it is unclear how the complex hydrodynamics shed from multiple structures affect <b>refuging</b> in <b>fish.</b> To begin to address this, we investigated how the flow fields produced by two D-shaped cylinders arranged in tandem affect the ability of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to K?rm?n gait. We altered the spacing of the two cylinders from l/D of 0. 7 to 2. 7 (where l=downstream spacing of cylinders and D=cylinder diameter) and recorded the kinematics of trout swimming behind the cylinders with high-speed video at Re= 10, 000 ? 55, 000. Digital particle image velocimetry showed that increasing l/D decreased the strength of the vortex street by an average of 53 % and decreased the frequency that vortices were shed by ? 20 % for all speeds. Trout were able to K?rm?n gait behind all cylinder treatments despite these differences in the downstream wake; however, they K?rm?n gaited over twice as often behind closely spaced cylinders (l/D= 0. 7, 1. 1, and 1. 5). Computational fluid dynamics simulations show that when cylinders are widely spaced, the upstream cylinder generates a vortex street that interacts destructively with the downstream cylinder, producing weaker, more widely spaced and less-organized vortices that discourage K?rm?n gaiting. These findings are poised to help predict when <b>fish</b> may seek <b>refuge</b> in natural habitats based on the position and arrangement of stationary objectsPeer reviewe...|$|R
