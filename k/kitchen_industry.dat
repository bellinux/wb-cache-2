40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a framework to support cost transparency implementation. Though cost transparency is a well-known practice in supply chain management literature, {{there is a lack of}} guidelines supporting managers to effectively implement it. The study has been developed using empirical findings from an action research, the authors conducted in close collaboration with an Italian manufacturer of modular kitchens and 19 suppliers. This research discusses a methodology to support (1) the selection of those customer-supplier relationships worth being developed into cost transparency, and (2) the identification, for each of these relationships, of appropriate forms of actions/incentives to stimulate suppliers to share cost information. The key outcome lies in the theoretical framework emerging from on-field empirical evidences supporting managers in cost transparency implementation. The proposed model fills some gaps found in supply chain literature and explicitly addresses an unusual variable to be considered in the suppliers' selection phase: the buyer's interest. From a managerial point of view our model provides a framework buying companies use to select and classify the subset of suppliers willing and worth being engaged in cost transparency initiatives, and to identify appropriate actions to implement cost transparency. The findings of a single action research cannot be generalized to the overall population of manufacturing entities. Large sample data collection efforts will be needed to test the proposed findings and make our prescriptions more robust. Additionally, the proposed model could be tested in other industries outside the modular <b>kitchen</b> <b>industry...</b>|$|E

The instrument consisted of design features inclusive of the full scope of visual communication of design solutions in graphic format. ^ All software was installed on baseline hardware according to installation routines outlined in documentation accompanying the software. The instrument was administered independently for each current copy of the software. Whereas the instrument was administered during the design phase, judgments were exercised and inferences drawn, both during the administration of the instrument on the software, as well as after the completion of the design, using the printed document generated by the software. The data were summarized into a frequency distribution. The location of each software within the distribution was used for comparison. ^ As a result of the study it was found no one software performed design features fully and completely in conformance to industry standards in production of project documents. Some software came closer than others to total conformance. Determining how close each individual software came to conformance was realized by examining the amount of remediation each software required in order to conform. Aggregate remediation required by individual software to conform ranged from nearly one-half to nearly two-thirds of all design features necessary to produce printed project documents. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of body cooling effects via a cooling vest with two fans and three gel packs. Physiological responses and subjective perceptions during daily routine work about 2 hours in four industries in Hong Kong with heat exposure were measured.

Mean perceived movement comfort/performance restriction showed no significant difference among the four industries. Workers in the construction industry had a relatively lower score of thermophysiological, sensory/tactile and fit comforts, practicality and preference, as compared with workers in other industries. Overall comfort correlated positively with perceived thermophysiological, sensory/tactile and fit comforts. Workers’ preference was strongly correlated with practicality (r = 0. 83) and overall comfort (r = 0. 75). The findings suggest that the cooling vest provided effective cooling to maintain comfortable body temperature, which has profound influences on the subjective perceptions.
