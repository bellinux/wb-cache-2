25|$|Flat, circular, and unusually shaped walls can {{be covered}} with copper cladding. Most are field-formed from sheet material. They can also be pre-manufactured. In addition, {{engineered}} systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper screen panels, and structural wall claddings are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. Beveled copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows. Structural panels {{are designed to be}} attached directly to a wall structure without the use of a continuous substrate. Diagonal <b>flat</b> <b>lock</b> panels are used on curved surfaces, such as domes, spires and vaults. Horizontal <b>flat</b> <b>lock</b> panels are basically identical to flat seam roofing applied on a vertical surface. Copper screen panels are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather. Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet.|$|E
25|$|Seaming technique. This is a {{vertical}} or horizontal classical cladding construction used in copper roof and façade designs. Available in sheets and strips, the cladding is fixed with clips. Since water tightness {{may not be}} a concern on vertical surfaces, angle standing seams are often sufficient. Double lock standing seams are often not necessary.

25|$|Another {{advantage}} of copper roofing systems {{is that they}} are relatively easy to repair. For small pits or cracks, affected areas can be cleaned and filled with solder. For larger areas, patches can be cut and soldered into place. For major areas, the affected copper can be cut out and replaced using a <b>flat</b> <b>locked</b> soldered seam.|$|R

50|$|After the Baker entered service, more {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the rifle and several different variations were produced. A lighter and shorter carbine version for the cavalry was introduced, and a number of volunteer associations procured their own models, including the Duke of Cumberland's Corps of Sharpshooters, which ordered models with a 33-inch barrel, in August 1803. A second pattern of Baker Rifle was fitted with a 'Newland' lock that had a flat-faced ring neck cock. In 1806, a third pattern was produced that included a 'pistol grip' style trigger guard and a smaller patchbox with a plain rounded front. The lock plate was smaller, flat, and had a steeped-down tail, a raised semi-waterproof pan, a flat ring neck cock, and a sliding safety bolt. With the introduction of a new pattern Short Land Pattern Flintlock Musket ('Brown Bess') in 1810, with its <b>flat</b> <b>lock</b> and ring-necked cock, the Baker's lock followed suit for what became the fourth pattern. It also featured a 'slit stock'—the stock had a slot cut in its underpart just over a quarter-inch wide. This was done after Ezekiel Baker had seen reports of the ramrod jamming in the stock after the build-up of residue in the ramrod channel, and when the wood warped after getting wet.|$|E
50|$|The slipped version {{where the}} last move {{is done with}} a bight of the end, rather than with the end itself, is {{one that can be}} {{tightened}} <b>flat,</b> slid, <b>locked</b> (like a belt buckle), and then untied quickly (like when nature calls) with an exploding pop. If not tightened flat, this Slipped friendship knot loop collapses into a cube and will neither slide nor pop.|$|R
50|$|At the National Antiquities Museum, Chinese pottery expert Soo Lin Yao (Gemma Chan) sees {{something}} frightening, and disappears. Meanwhile, Sherlock takes John to a high-powered international finance house. There, Sebastian Wilkes (Bertie Carvel), an old university acquaintance of Sherlock's, asks for help. A break-in occurred {{in which an}} apparently meaningless pair of symbols were spray-painted onto {{a portrait of a}} banker. Sherlock realises that was a message meant for one man - Edward Van Coon of the Hong Kong desk - who has not come to work. Sherlock breaks into Van Coon's <b>locked</b> <b>flat</b> and finds him dead. The police, under Detective Inspector Dimmock (Paul Chequer), regard it as a suicide, though Sherlock sees it as murder. Soon, journalist Brian Lukis (Howard Coggins) is also killed inside his <b>locked</b> <b>flat.</b> Sherlock and John investigate, and in a library where Lukis had been they find the same mysterious symbols painted on a shelf.|$|R
5000|$|Although rigid {{handcuffs}} are advantageous {{when the}} arresting officer has {{to break the}} resistance of a violent individual, they are rather bulky to carry. Therefore, Hiatts developed a folding rigid handcuff they called the [...] "Ultimate" [...] handcuff. It can be folded away when carried, e.g., on a duty belt. When extracted from the holster, it snaps open to a <b>flat</b> profile and <b>locks</b> into position, becoming rigid for use.|$|R
40|$|A {{dexterous}} robot manipulator {{must be able}} to {{feel what}} it is doing. The mechanical hand of the future will be able to roll a screw between its fingers and sense, by touch, which end is which. This paper describes a step toward such a manipulator, an imaging tactile sensor with hundreds of pressure sensors in a space the size of a fingertip. The sensor was designed as part of a tendon-actuated mechan-ical finger, similar in size and range of motion to a human index finger (Hillis 1981). As a demonstration, the device was programmed to distinguish among several commonly used fastening devices&mdash;nuts, bolts, <b>flat</b> washers, <b>lock</b> washers, dowel pins, cotter pins, and set screws&mdash;by touching them with the finger and analyzing the tactile image...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} hand of {{the future}} will roll a screw between its fingers and sense, by touch, which end is which. This paper describes a step toward such a manipulator ?? robot finger that is used to recognize small objects by touch. The device incorporates a novel imaging tactile sensor ?? artificial skin with hundreds of pressure sensors in a space the size of a finger tip. The sensor is mounted on a tendon-actuated mechanical finger, similar in size and range of motion to a human index finger. A program controls the finger, using it to press and probe the object placed in front of it. Based on how the object feels, the program guesses its shape and orientation and then uses the finger to test and refine the hypothesis. The device is programmed to recognize commonly used fastening devices ??ts, bolts, <b>flats,</b> washers, <b>lock</b> washers, dowel pins, cotter pins and set screws...|$|R
50|$|Booth nearly {{burned to}} death in November 1979 when, during a drunken attempt to get into his <b>locked</b> <b>flat,</b> he fell into a drum of paraffin. He spent six months in {{hospital}} and needed 26 skin graft operations. Shortly after his discharge from hospital, he went to visit an 'old flame', Coronation Street actress Pat Phoenix. She took him in and nursed him back to full health, and they lived together for six years, but eventually, Pat Phoenix's own health began to fail; she became his second wife in 1986, just days before her death from lung cancer.|$|R

Fire crews with breathing apparatus searched for people trapped in the building and carried them out; they reported thick smoke and zero visibility above the fourth floor. After three hours, the original teams of firefighters were replaced by new crews. A contingent of riot police was present; each of them attended a firefighter and held a shield horizontally above their heads to protect the two from falling heavy debris such as burning pieces of the cladding.

5000|$|The final episode, [...] "The Ghost Talks" [...] (actually {{released}} as the 21st to be filmed) contained extended flashbacks of Hopkirk alone solving a case—Jeff {{being out of}} town—before his death. This was necessitated by Mike Pratt having been injured in a fall from a drainpipe while {{trying to get into}} his <b>locked</b> <b>flat.</b> Pratt broke both his legs, rendering him bedridden in a real hospital bed (Pratt also had a nurse in attendance) on the set of a hospital room for duration of filming for that episode. Jeff's incapacity in the episode was explained by his having fallen off a balcony whilst in pursuit of a safe-cracker.|$|R

50|$|Poirot and Hastings are {{in their}} rooms with a neighbour, Dr Hawker, when the medical man's {{housekeeper}} arrives with the message that a client, Count Foscatini, has phoned for the doctor, crying out for help. Poirot, Hastings and Hawker rush to Foscatini's flat in Regent's Court. The lift attendant there, unaware of any problems, says that Graves, the Count's man, left half an hour earlier with no indication of anything wrong. The <b>flat</b> is <b>locked</b> but {{the manager of the}} building opens it for them. Inside, they find a table set for three people, with the meals finished. The Count is alone and dead - his head crushed in by a small marble statue. Poirot is interested in the remains on the table. He questions the kitchen staff {{at the top of the}} building. They describe the meal they served and the dirty plates passed up to them in the service elevator. Poirot seems especially interested in the fact that little of the side dish and none of the dessert were eaten, while the main course was consumed entirely. He also points out that after crying out for help on the phone, the dying man replaced the receiver.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1980, John MacLennan, {{a police}} inspector, was found shot {{five times in}} the chest and body in his <b>locked</b> <b>flat</b> on the day he was to have been arrested on {{homosexual}} charges. Elliott suggested that MacLennan was being persecuted because he [...] "knew too much" [...] about the names of homosexuals in his investigation of homosexuality in the police. As a result, Elliott corresponded with Murray MacLehose, Commissioner of the Commission of Inquiry and MacLennan's family, J. M. Duffy, the Senior Crown Counsel, John C. Griffiths, the Attorney General and also collected information on MacLennan's case as well as the Inquest and Inquiry. The event led to the setting up of the Commission of Inquiry and a review of the laws on homosexuality.|$|R
50|$|Ritchie then {{introduces}} John to Kecks (Postlethwaite) a British Rail buffet car attendant {{with high}} ambitions who sold the van to Ritchie. After a quick drink and a French Revolution, Kecks {{tells them to}} “take it to our kid's {{in the morning and}} he will fix it free of charge.” Then offers them a bit of paid work moving some gear from his lock up. The following night Ritchie and John arrive outside Kecks's lock up to find a strange noise coming from within. ”What’s he doing in there, drilling for oil?” Ritchie queries. Kecks appears with a number of parcels which they load into the van and take to Kecks's flat. When they arrive, Kecks tells the lads to go on up to his <b>flat</b> while he <b>locks</b> up their van, but sneakily hides a parcel in the freezer compartment.|$|R
5000|$|The GAZ-24 was {{displayed}} at the London Motor Show in 1970. Full-scale manufacturing started 15 July 1970. Export sales began in 1971. During 1970-74 the Volga remained almost unchanged. Only minor modifications took place in 1972-73, when the car got new trunk decklid <b>lock,</b> <b>flat</b> ashtrays in rear doors instead of early ashtrays that were built in rear doors armrests, new rear bumper and new radio with more pleasant appearance and modified construction. In 1973 dashboard with simulated wood insert appeared (also there was a [...] "silver" [...] grained finish, used until 1974). After 1973, the ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to under the steering wheel to prevent knee injuries in road accidents, although that was inconvenient for the driver. Also in 1974, the Volga got additional C-pillar parking lights on (something like opera lights). The 24-01 was joined in 1977 by the 24-07, which was fitted to use liquified propane.|$|R
50|$|The {{recreational}} park, Ballincollig Regional Park, {{includes the}} former gunpowder mill and measures approximately 135 acres, with 52 structures in varying stages of decay surviving from the gunpowder manufacturing process. The site is approximately 2.4 kilometres {{in length and}} the River Lee runs the northern length of the site. The site contains a system of canals used during the manufacturing process connecting all the process areas in a single <b>flat</b> system without <b>locks.</b> The canals are fed from the River Lee at {{the western end of}} the site. The park contains soccer pitches, a rugby pitch, walkways, a skateboard facility, and free-to-use outdoor fitness equipment - the latter installed on the park's western end in November 2011. As a result of a 2012 development plan, which outlined the future of the Regional Park by the Recreation & Amenity section of the local authority, planning was approved for multi-use games areas and a children's playground. This work started December 2014 and is now completed. An eighty plot allotment scheme was also identified within the development plan, and was opened in November 2013 at the Innishmore entrance to the Regional Park. A series of marked trails were laid-out in 2014, and consist of four looped walks, colour-coded according to length. The Military Trail begins at the Shopping Centre Square and continues to the Regional Park by a westerly route. Three other trails of varying lengths begin and end at the western end of the park - at Inniscarra Bridge.|$|R
