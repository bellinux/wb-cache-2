Drechsler found that graminicolous forms of Helminthosporium {{produced}} teleomorphs with characteristic features of greater ascus and ascospore width as well as helicoiod ascospores with bipolar germination, which deviates from previously described characters of Ophiobolus. To accommodate these species, he introduced the new genus Cochliobolus transferred several species to Cochliobolus. Another genus Pseudocochliobolus was separated from Cochliobolus based {{on the presence of}} stromatic tissue below the ascomata and the degree of ascospore coiling. The sexual states of Cochliobolus are only found associated with Bipolaris and Curvularia. Bipolaris and Curvularia share some morphological similarities and cannot be easily distinguished by any distinct taxonomic criteria. Although few morphological differences were reported, conidia of Bipolaris are distoseptate while the conidia of Curvularia are bigger and euseptate. Some scientists believe that Bipolaris and Curvularia are synonymous, however there is an existing debate regarding this issue. The different species of fungi belonging to Cochliobolus with asexual states in Bipolaris and Curvularia have undergone frequent name changes as a result of refinement to the taxonomy that has resulted in some confusion. The perfect stage of this fungus was first named as C. carbonum by R. R. Nelson in 1959. The <b>imperfect</b> <b>stage</b> was named as Bipolaris zeicola in 1959. The commonly used synonyms of Cochliobolus carbonum were Helminthosporium zeicola (1930), Helminthosporium carbornum (1944), Drechslera zeiocola (1966) and Drechslera carbonum (1984). Several phylogenetic studies of Bipolaris and Curvularia showed that Bipolaris is not monophyletic and some Bipolaris species are nested within Curvularia.|$|E

40|$|Structure of {{this thesis}} Part I deals with basic bio-physics and bio-effects of {{clinical}} ultrasound {{of the head}} and neck. Furthermore, the ultrasound anatomy {{of the head and}} neck is described and illustrated. In addition, the technique of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (UGFNAB) is outlined. In part H the significance of ultrasound with UGFNAB in the evaluation of the neck of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aero-digestive tract is outlined. In the comment. possible clinical consequences of ultrasound with UGFNAB in the assessment of cervical node metastasis are formulated. In part m the ultrasound findings in a number of pathologic conditions in the head and neck region are described. In the comment, the value of ultrasound in the evaluation of a head and neck mass is appraised. In part IV an alternative approach to the treatment of deep neck abscesses is presented. Some general remarks on ultrasound {{of the head and neck}} are presented in part V. The fallibility of palpation and current diagnostic tests to detect subclinical (occult) nodal disease in patients with upper aero-digestive tract cancer results in <b>imperfect</b> <b>staging,</b> improper treatment and delayed identification of recurrences in the neck. With continuous advances in imaging techniques (CT, MRI), the sensitivity for the detection of cervical lymph nodes is true enough increasing, while the specificity for detecting metastasis with these techniques remains low. An ideal diagnostic test should be suitable for screening, demonstrating and excluding cervical metastasis. In addition, the test should have no morbidity. The diagnostic work-up of patients with a head and neck mass is another important diagnostic problem. Although careful history taking and thorough ENT examination may be sufficiently characteristic to permit diagnosis, every clinical diagnosis will be associated with a certain degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is mainly deterntined by the lintitations of clinical exantination in differentiating between solid and cystic lesions on one hand, and the establishment of exact anatontic properties on the other. In addition, there is a proportion of lesions which, despite thorough diagnostic work-up. remain elusive and are subjected to premature surgical exploration. CT may contribute to the pre-treatment work-up but is associated with several important drawbacks: high costs, lintited availability, radiation exposure and the need to use intravenous contrast. A simple, uniformly reliable, non-invasive and cost-effective test would be beneficial in these cases. The low accuracy of current diagnostic methods in the assessment of cervical nodal disease and the difficulties to evaluate head and neck masses actuated the present study, which started in 1984. By that time small-parts ultrasound transducers had been developed. These high-frequency transducers seemed better suited for examination of the superficial tissues in the head and neck region than earlier ultrasound equipment. In close cooperation between the departments of Radiology and Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery. a prospective study on the value of ultrasound examination of the head and neck was designed. The purpose of this study was to deterntine the values of palpation and ultrasound examination in the assessment of cervical metastatic disease in patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancer and in the evaluation of head and neck masses. An additional purpose of this study was to appraise the adjunctive value of cytologic exantination in the above mentioned clinical problem...|$|R

40|$|Young {{birds and}} mammals are {{extremely}} vulnerable to predators and so should benefit from responding to parental alarm calls warning of danger. However, young often respond differently from adults. This difference may reflect: (i) an <b>imperfect</b> <b>stage</b> in the gradual development of adult behaviour or (ii) an adaptation to different vulnerability. Altricial birds provide an excellent model to test for adaptive changes with age in response to alarm calls, because fledglings are vulnerable to a different range of predators than nestlings. For example, a flying hawk is irrelevant to a nestling in a enclosed nest, but is dangerous to that individual once it has left the nest, so we predict that young develop a response to aerial alarm calls to coincide with fledging. Supporting our prediction, recently fledged white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, fell silent immediately after playback of their parents' aerial alarm call, whereas nestlings continued to calling despite hearing the playback. Young scrubwrens are therefore exquisitely adapted to the changing risks faced during development...|$|E

500|$|The {{life cycle}} of this fungus allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia [...] ) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different name, because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The <b>imperfect,</b> or conidial <b>stage</b> of this fungus is the plant pathogen Geniculodendron pyrofirme, first reported in 1964, and known to infect dormant seeds of the Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis. A 1978 study showed that about a third of Sitka spruce seed lots stored by the British Columbia Forest Service (Canada) contained diseased seeds, and these diseased seeds failed to germinate when sown in local nurseries. The fungus can grow at low temperatures, contributing to its ability to kill seeds before {{they have a chance to}} germinate. Infected seeds tend to shrivel and dry up rather than rot. It was also demonstrated that seed lots from squirrel seed caches have increased incidence of C.fulgens infection. Squirrels tend to cache pinecones repeatedly in the same location, and in cool, moist conditions favorable for fungus growth. In 2002, G.pyriforme was found on imported conifer seeds in Germany, the first such report in continental Europe.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. - International {{cooperation}} {{to regulate the}} movement of people and the harmonization of migration policies at the regional level tend to advance slowly and in an ad hoc basis, mostly due to the reluctance of nation-states to delegate sovereignty on such a sensitive matter for their domestic constituencies. Nonetheless, as {{the case of the}} EU shows, such harmonization may be necessary when the economic integration process is well advanced, institutionalized, and expanding (i. e., if a single market is in place and enlarging, supranational norms and institutions are binding, and integration is to deepen). The case of MERCOSUR presents some theoretical and empirical puzzles. Although the integration process (and the analysis of it) has modeled the European experience in several respects, the bloc has been unable to move pass an <b>imperfect</b> custom unions <b>stage</b> and unwilling to develop more than a loose institutional structure. Yet, rapid advances in the harmonization of migration norms and policies have occurred in the last decade, apparently driven by factors that lie outside the economic integration realm and remain relatively unexplored.

The comparison aims at making a contribution to our understanding the mechanisms that unable or constraint policy convergence in highly sensitive areas such as migration; it also explores the applicability of some concepts usually used to study regional integration across regions...|$|R

Further observations on the cultural characteristics are described in Tables 1 ～ 4. The physiological characteristics are listed in Table 5 summarily, which brought {{out the fact that}} the test-yeasts dissimilate sugars rather oxidatively than fermentatively, i. e. gaseous fermentation was not observed in the liquid cultures but some strains showed it by Lindner’s method only, and no remarkable difference from the true yeasts was observed on the assimilabilities of nitrogen compounds and ethyl alcohol. Most of the yeasts tested showed the lipolytic abilities when tributyrin agar was used as substrate(Table 6). Their growth-pH, -temperature and thermal death points are shown in Table 7. The optimum pH of their growth (5. 0 ～ 7. 0) is comparatively higher than in the case of true yeasts(4. 0 ～ 6. 9). The salt tolerance was apparently lower than in the case of true yeasts (Table 8).

40|$|Vertebrate alarm calls {{can contain}} {{information}} about the type of predator {{and the degree of}} danger, but young animals often respond to alarm calls differently from adults. The distinct behaviour of young may reflect an <b>imperfect</b> <b>stage</b> in the gradual development of the adult response, or a response adapted to specific risks faced by young. In this study, we tested whether nestling white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, responded to different alarm calls according to their specific risks of predation. As predators on the ground pose a danger to scrubwren nestlings, whereas flying predators do not, we predicted that they would respond to ground alarm calls but not to aerial alarm calls. In a field playback experiment, we tested the response of young to aerial and ground alarm calls, each presented in a shorter (less urgent) and longer (more urgent) form. We found that both 5 - and 11 -day-old nestlings responded to ground alarm calls, and did so more strongly to the more urgent playback. By contrast, the response to aerial alarm calls started to develop only {{towards the end of the}} nestling stage. Thus, scrubwren nestlings can distinguish between different types of alarm calls and react more strongly to calls warning of a predator posing greater danger, appropriate to the nestling stage of development. Furthermore, they use the length of ground alarm calls as an indicator of the degree of danger...|$|E

40|$|Famous for his {{attention}} to the psychological development of his characters, Jean Racine is less well known for exploring politics in his theater. In my dissertation, I argue that Racine uses kingly characters in an unusual way. In seventeenth-century French theater, stage kings generally fulfilled two basic kinds of roles: the hero-king who was the subject of the tragedy, and what I call the “secondary king”—that is, a monarch who possesses supreme authority over other characters but is not the explicit focus of the play 2 ̆ 7 s conflict. Tragic heroes were expected to have flaws or commit errors that endangered their political status, but secondary kings were traditionally used as simple authority figures whose commands or judgments moved plots forward or brought matters to a conclusion. At the height of absolutism in France, Racine endowed his secondary kings with critical imperfections that prevented the kings from functioning according to the idealized character type. ^ In close readings of Bajazet, Iphigénie and Phèdre, I demonstrate how uncertainties underlying each king 2 ̆ 7 s authority are key to the tragedies 2 ̆ 7 plots. The fragility of each monarch 2 ̆ 7 s reign leads his subjects to consider alternate models of kingship. These reflections raise questions about key aspects of absolute monarchy: who possesses sovereignty and whether that sovereignty is unified or shared, to what purpose a monarch must use his power, and finally, the source of the right to rule, whether by royal lineage, tradition, reliance on the religious establishment or military might. The political stakes of these tragedies reflect central issues in the works of prominent French political theorists of the age, such as Jean Bodin, Cardin Le Bret and Jacques-Benigne Bossuet. In each of the three play I examine, Racine uses the monarch 2 ̆ 7 s imperfect exercise of his rule to create situations conducive to tragedy. In each case, the play 2 ̆ 7 s events test the king 2 ̆ 7 s administration and ultimately lead to the firmer establishment of a newly legitimized monarchy. Although he <b>stages</b> <b>imperfect</b> kings, Racine does not question the absolutist ideal; rather, he supports it by showing the tragedies that occur when that ideal is not met. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to study the {{biochemical}} and cell wall changes involved during the induction of paramorphs of the ascomycete fungus Ceratocystis adiposa by sorbose and bile salts and to find how early these effects could be detected during {{the formation of a}} mycelium from spores. It was found that the reduction in radial growth rate (Kr) by sorbose was an osmotic effect. The rate of increase in dry weight with time was linear and not significantly reduced by the concentration of sorbose, glucose or polyethylene glycol which halved Kr; 0. 25 M. Botrytis fabae was sensitive to much lower concentrations of sorbose, Kr being halved at 0. 01 M sorbose and 1. 0 M glucose. The bile salt, sodium deoxycholate, caused a 50 % reduction in Kr at 0. 25 x 10 M without reducing specific growth rate In the paramorphs, Kr reduction was correlated with increased branch frequency. Electron micrographs of the cell wall showed no differences between the normal and restricted forms : the cell wall had three layers. The structure of the hyphae and especially of the septum was similar to that found in the human pathogen Sporothrix schenckii which has been proposed as an <b>imperfect</b> <b>stage</b> of Ceratocystis (Nicot and Mariat, 1973). Ungerminated and inhibited conidia showed the same cytoplasmic and cell wall structure reported by Hawes (1979). The cytoplasm contained many lipid droplets as energy reserves and these were not present in germinated conidia. Chemical analysis of the cell walls revealed that when Kr was reduced to 50 % by O. 25 M sorbose and PEG 200, the glucan content of the cell walls was decreased. Glucose increased the glucan level while Na deoxycholate caused only a slight decrease. The only sugars found on hydrolysis of the cell wall fractions were glucose, mannose and N-acetyl glucosamine. Melanin in the cell wall prevented extensive enzyme dissolution. Only Na deoxycholate inhibited germination (50 % at 7. 5 x 10 M) although reversible inhibition occurred at concentrations of PEG which prevented growth (1. 0 M). When Na deoxycholate was used in glucose solution, the conidia seemed to swell and show nuclear division earlier than those incubated in SSM. * PEG = Polythylene glycol SSM = standard synthetic medium<p...|$|E

O fungo Oidiopsis haplophylli (= O. sicula) foi identificado como sendo o agente causal de uma nova doença do tipo oídio em beijo-de-frade (Impatiens balsamina: Balsaminaceae), capuchinha (Tropaeolum majus: Tropaeolaceae), copo-de-leite (Zantedeschia aethiopica: Araceae), lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum: Gentianaceae) e flor-borboleta (Asclepias physocarpa: Asclepiadaceae) em Brasília-DF, Brasil. Esta doença foi observada em condições de casa de vegetação em beijo-de-frade, copo-de-leite, lisianthus e flor-borboleta e em condições de campo na capuchinha. O sintoma típico é o aparecimento de uma área clorótica na superfície superior da lâmina foliar que corresponde a uma colônia fúngica na superfície inferior. Com o progresso da doença, estas lesões tornavam-se necróticas e eventualmente coalesciam. As características morfológicas, observadas em microscopia de luz, corresponderam àquelas descritas para a fase imperfeita do fungo Leveillula taurica (O. haplophylli). Os testes de patogenicidade foram completados via inoculação por contato entre folhas sadias e folhas apresentado colônias do fungo. Um isolado de pimentão foi também patogênico a estas cinco espécies ornamentais (pertencentes a diferentes famílias botânicas) confirmando a ausência de especialização por hospedeiro deste fungo. Este é o primeiro registro deste patógeno nestas espécies ornamentais no Brasil e, provavelmente, o primeiro relato de flor-borboleta como hospedeira. Este oídio pode se tornar importante para o cultivo destas espécies em cultivo protegido ou condições de clima quente e seco...|$|E
