40|$|In north China, most {{earthquakes}} {{occur at}} depths of 10 – 25 km and {{are considered to}} be the direct result of deformation or rupture of the brittle upper crustal layer. To describe this mechanism, a planar horizontal negative dislocation plane is used to represent the force of action of the lower crustal layer on an overlying brittle upper crust layer. An area around Beijing in north China has been chosen for applying this negative <b>dislocation</b> <b>layer</b> assumption. A GPS network (Capital Circle GPS Network, CCGN), has been set up for monitoring crust deformations since 1992. In this paper, observations from 1992, 1995, and 1996 GPS surveying campaigns were used to determine model parameters of a negative <b>dislocation</b> <b>layer.</b> Using a Bayesian inversion procedure, more than 95 % of data residuals are found to be < 2 mm/yr, indicating that the negative <b>dislocation</b> <b>layer</b> model can fit GPS data well. The inversion results show that the local tectonic movement is − 2 ± 1 mm/yr in the north and 7 ± 1 mm/yr in the east, and the high negative dislocation rates occur mainly in the south part of the north Taihang mountain zone with a magnitude of ∼ 4 ± 1 mm/yr, and the east part of the Yan mountain zone with a magnitude of ∼ 3 ± 1 mm/yr. By applying this negative <b>dislocation</b> <b>layer</b> model, the continuous GPS surveying data can be inverted to determine the negative dislocation rate distributions in the middle or upper seismogenic crust layer, so as to predict the locations of potential earthquake sources.

40|$|Growth of GaN under {{pressure}} from solution in gallium results in almost dislocation free plate-like crystals but with size limited to app. 1 - 2 cm (lateral) and 100 µm (thickness) or up to about 1 cm long needles. Deposition of GaN by HVPE on the pressure grown seeds allows stable crystallization (in terms of flatness of the crystallization front and uniformity of the new grown material) {{at a rate of}} about 100 µm/h on both types of seed crystals. However, in the thick GaN crystals grown on almost dislocation free plate-like substrates quite a high number of dislocations appears if the crystal thickness exceeds certain critical value. Since the critical thickness for defect generation is of the order of 100 µm, almost <b>dislocation</b> free <b>layers</b> (density below 104 cm- 2) thinner than 100 µm can be grown. The most obvious further step is removing the substrate and continuation of the HVPE deposition on the free standing low <b>dislocation</b> density <b>layer</b> of sub-critical thickness. The pressure grown substrates were removed by mechanical polishing or conductivity sensitive electrochemical etching (for strongly n-type substrates). Then the HVPE low dislocation density GaN 1 platelets were used as substrates for the growth of a few mm thick bulk GaN crystals.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{original work}} {{in the development of}} multi-strata subsurface infrared (1. 342 [mu]m) nanosecond pulsed laser die singulation (stealth dicing) to enable defect-free ultra-thin stacked memory dies. The over-arching contribution is the first comprehensive and systematic experimental study of stealth dicing, encompassing process physics and simulation, characterization, optimization, and integration, as well as operations management, including statistical process control, sensitivities, interactions, and risk analysis. This work exploits the multi-strata interactions between generated thermal shockwaves and the preceding <b>dislocation</b> <b>layers</b> formed to initiate controlled crack fractures that separate the individual dies from within the interior of the wafer as a method for significant singulation-related defect reduction and die strength enhancement. A new partial-stealth dicing before grinding (p-SDBG) integration based upon the tandem use of three-strata stealth dicing followed by static loading from backgrinding to complete full kerf separation has successfully demonstrated defect-free eight die stacks of 25 and 46 [mu]m thick 2 D NAND memory dies on high backside reflectance wafers for the first time. This work resulted in a 3. 5 % mean increase in memory/system test yield and has been used to realize production-worthy 64 GB retail memory products after passing reliability tests.
