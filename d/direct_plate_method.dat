Egg shells were inoculated with approximately 10 ? S. typhimurium organisms. Initial experiments evaluated the amount of colony forming units recovered from 50 ml of sterile Phosphate Buffered Solution (PBS) inoculated with a 1 ml dilution (ranges 10 ??- 10 ?? inoculum dilution). This experiment was replicated three times, with a recovery dilution {{in the second and third}} trials. The filter method recovered significantly more bacteria than the <b>direct</b> <b>plate</b> <b>method.</b> Experiments were then conducted in order to determine if these two methods would be comparable when using commercial table eggs. Primary experiments of this type used autoclaved eggs inoculated with approximately 10 ? S. typhimurium (marker strain). The eggs were allowed to remain in the inoculum for five minutes, aseptically removed, and incubated for thirty minutes, after which the eggs were rinsed in 50 ml of sterile PBS (rinsate procedure), 1 ml was plated using conventional methods and the remainder of the rinsate was filtered. This experiment was replicated six times. The final experiment conducted was to determine the sensitivity of the filter to the plating method. Using farm fresh chicken and turkey eggs, approximately 7. 85 - 9. 70 log??CFU/ml (ranges 10 ??- 10 ?? inoculum dilution) S. typhimurium organisms were inoculated. Chicken egg rinsate was plated in 1 ml triplicate samples and 1, 5, and 9 ml duplicate samples were filtered. Turkey egg trials plated triplicate 1 ml samples of the rinsate and a 10 ?? dilution of the rinsate and filtered 1, 5, and 9 ml samples of the rinsate and 1 ml triplicate samples of the diluted rinsate. All samples in all three experiments were placed on Brilliant Green Agar containing 20 mg/ml novobiocin and 25 mg/ml naladixic acid and were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C.

In current research, incidence of mycoflora associated with different water springs of Samahni Valley (SV), district Bhimber, Azad Kashmir was screened by using Plating and Baiting Techniques. The pH value of water samples ranged from 5. 5 to 7. 5. The minimum and maximum temperature of sampled springs was between 18 oC– 36 oC. Total 33 fungal specimens belonging to 21 different species were isolated from different analyzed samples by employing two approaches. In Baiting Technique (BT) 13 species and in <b>Direct</b> <b>Plate</b> <b>Method</b> (DPM) 8 species were isolated, respectively. Highest number of mycoflora was determined by BT, followed by DPM. Aspergillus sp. was dominant species followed by Cephalosporium sp. and Botrytis sp. found in drinking water of springs. The highest number of species was found in Parshala sample (6 spp) which proves that place has favorable conditions for flourishing of fungi. The present study depicts that various springs of SV have different number of mycoflora depending on soil type, temperature, altitude and neighboring flora. Furthermore, ethnobotanical study of the area indicates that these pathogenic species present in spring water cause many diseases in plants, animals and human beings, hence hampering health and economic status of inhabitants.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Malaria {{is caused}} by {{protozoan}} parasites of the genus Plasmodium, of which Plasmodium falciparum is the most widespread and dangerous. Around 800 000 {{children under the age}} of five die from malaria every year. An increase in resistance to previously effective drugs is also evident. This disease therefore has social and economical consequences. The isolation of antimalarial compounds from medicinal plants may provide the solution to an ever increasing demand for new effective antimalarial agents. Compounds with antimalarial activity also tend to have antimicrobial activity, thus when testing plants for antimalarial activity, it must be considered that they may also provide effective antimicrobial agents. Six plants were selected and 62 extracts of the different morphological plant parts were prepared, using Soxhlet extraction with petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and ethanol consecutively. The antimalarial activity was assessed by employing the [3 H] - hypoxanthine incorporation assay against the chloroquine-resistant Gambian FCR- 3 strain of P. falciparum. The dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts of Crinum bulbispermum exhibited the most promising activity, with IC, values of 0. 379 + 0. 126 and 0. 08 f 0. 004 kg/ml respectively, and were selected for further study. Two acids, namely linoleic acid (24), oleic acid (25) and an alkaloid, namely lycorine (26) was isolated with column and thin layer chromatography and structures were elucidated by using nuclear magnetic resonance, mass and infrared spectrometry. The antimalarial activity of the isolated compounds (24 - 26) were assessed. The IC, value of the isolated compound lycorine (26) (0. 0291 f 0. 01 kg/ml) compares well to that of chloroquine (1) and quinine (2) (IC, values of 0. 04 + 0. 01 and 0. 17 + 0. 02 pg/ml, respectively). These compounds (24 - 26) were found to be relatively non-toxic as determined by an in vitro cellular toxicity assay. IC, values for toxicity were determined for the respective compounds (24 - 26) and lycorine (26) had the best toxicity index of > 15 000. Since this compound had such a high toxicity index it was regarded as suitable for further investigation as an antimalarial drug. Antimicrobial activity was assessed with the <b>direct</b> <b>plate</b> <b>method</b> and minimum inhibitory concentration values were determined. The best activity was observed for the alkaloid lycorine (26) against 6. subtilis. The isolated alkaloid lycorine (26) is not structurally related to any other antimalarial drug currently in use and could therefore be used as a lead compound for a new class of antimalarial drugs. The diverse chemistry of medicinal plants affords a viable source in the search for biologically active compounds. Master...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>methods</b> for {{the estimation}} of Salmonella load in poultry carcass rinses. Methods and Results: Two <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> tools, the spiral <b>plate</b> count <b>method</b> (SPCM) and the hydrophobic grid membrane filtration (HGMF) method, were adapted to support quantification of Salmonella during poultry processing. Test samples consisted of 180 broiler carcasses from a commercial abattoir, 60 from each of three points in the processing line [pre-inside–outside bird wash (pre- IOBW), prechill and postchill]. The SPCM was used to estimate Salmonella load in pre-IOBW rinses, while HGMF was used to estimate Salmonella levels in prechill and postchill rinses. Carcass rinses were also evaluated for Salmonella prevalence by enrichment methods. Mean prevalences of Salmonella were 95 %, 100 % and 41 · 7 %, and the geometric mean loads were 3 · 7 × 101, 5 · 6 × 100 and 5 · 0 × 10 - 2 CFU ml- 1 for pre-IOBW, prechill and postchill rinses, respectively. Conclusions: The methods described are useful for estimating the concentration of viable and typical Salmonella in poultry carcass rinses.

40|$|Quantification of Campylobacter spp. on {{the surface}} and in the muscle of chicken legs at retail; {{comparison}} of different sampling techniques and enumeration methods In order to collect data about the quantitative load of Campylobacter in chicken and thus defining the risk for consumers, the object {{of the present study was}} to determine the prevalence and number of Campylobacter {{on the surface}} and in the meat of chicken legs at retail level and to investigate seasonal influence on the prevalence and number of these pathogens. In the context of quantitative investigations, two different ways of sample preparation for the isolation of Campylobacter combined with two different enumeration methods were compared to develop an applicable method for the isolation and enumeration of these pathogens. From November 2003 to December 2004, 140 packages of raw chicken legs, 10 each month, were bought from different retail outlets in Berlin. At the beginning of the quantitative investigations, the distribution of Campylobacter-counts within the same package was examined in ten packages containing 4 to 5 legs to determine homogeneity within the sample. Results demonstrated that there is only a small difference between Campylobacter-counts on the surface of chicken legs within the same package which is a condition for the comparison of the sample preparation types. The comparison of the sample preparation types was carried out by rinsing one chicken leg (rinse sample) and homogenising the skin (skin sample) of the other leg of the same package with 90 packages. Both sample preparation types were examined by <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> and MPN technique in 40 packages and compared based on the colony forming units of Campylobacter per leg. 70 % (63 / 90) of the skin samples and 77 % (69 / 90) of the rinse samples were Campylobacter-positive. Enumeration of Campylobacter by <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> revealed a median of log 4. 0 CFU/leg surface in skin samples (SD = 0. 6) and a median of log 4. 3 CFU/leg surface in rinse samples (SD = 0. 9). 73 % (37 / 51) of the rinse samples revealed higher numbers of Campylobacter than the skin samples. Concerning the sample preparation types, the <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> detected higher numbers of Campylobacter in 80 % of the compared rinse samples with a median count of log 4. 2 CFU/leg surface (SD = 1) than the MPN technique where a median of log 4. 0 CFU/leg surface (SD = 1. 1) was obtained. The difference was not significant. Furthermore, a highly significant positive correlation was observed between both methods. Due to the results achieved in the comparative examination, the further investigations were continued with skin samples and <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method.</b> In total, results of the quantitative and qualitative investigation show that a high percentage of superficially contaminated chicken legs is sold to the consumer. 66 % of the examined chicken legs were contaminated with Campylobacter {{on the surface and}} the numbers of Campylobacter with a median of log 2. 4 CFU/g are remarkable. Incidence and number of Campylobacter detected by MPN technique in the muscle were comparatively low. Only 27 % of the muscle samples were Campylobacter positiv with a detection limit of > 0, 3 MPN Campylobacter/g. The low contamination rate of meat allocates raw meat a minor role in the epidemiology of human campylobacteriosis. Cross contamination of ready to eat food or contaminated surfaces during food preparation may pose a higher health risk than the consumption of insufficient heated chicken meat. Regarding the species distribution, in both, skin and muscle samples, C. jejuni was isolated more frequently (84 % and 97 %, respectively) than C. coli (16 % and 3 %, respectively). The increasing quinolone-resistance of Campylobacter isolates from retail is alarming and should be considered when treating Campylobacter infection antibiotically. The increased prevalence and number of Campylobacter on chicken legs during warmer months shows a seasonal influence on Campylobacter contamination indicating a higher risk at certain seasons...|$|R

The biphasic method required 5 days for cultures to become positive, whereas the other systems required 2 to 3 days to detect all positive cultures (P = 1. 3 X 10 (- 5) by Friedman group statistic, and P less than 10 (- 5) for comparison of the biphasic and other <b>methods).</b> The <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> demonstrated the best quantitative recovery of L. pneumophila in comparison to the other methods tested (P = 2. 0 X 10 (- 5) by analysis of variance group statistic and P less than 0. 05 for comparison between each of the methods). Quantitative recovery by the Isolator method was intermediate between the <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> and buffy coat methods. The biphasic and Isolator blood culture methods performed poorly in comparison to the other methods, indicating the need for caution in choosing blood culture methods for Legionella isolation...|$|R
40|$|Aeromonas {{has been}} {{described}} as an emergent foodborne pathogen of increasing importance. In this study, we report that 48 % of 50 Pintado fish samples collected at the retail market of São Paulo city were positive for Aeromonas sp, as detected by the <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method.</b> When the presence/absence method was used, the positivity was 42 %. A. caviae was the most frequent species, followed by A. hydrophila and A. sobria. Production of cytotoxic enterotoxin, observed in suckling mouse assay, was detected in 67 % of A. sobria strains, in 60 % of A. hydrophila strains and in 40 % of A. caviae strains. In vitro tests, performed with HEp- 2 cells, showed that 88 % of A. hydrophila, 27 % of A. sobria and 13 % of A. caviae strains were positive for this toxin. The in vivo production of cytotonic enterotoxin, tested after heating the filtrates at 56 ºC for 20 minutes, was detected in 17 % of A. sobria, in 10 % of A. caviae and in none of A. hydrophila strains in vivo. All analyzed strains did not alter HEp- 2 cells. 20 % and 16 % of A. sobria and A. caviae isolates, respectively, presented capacity to adhere to HEp- 2 cells. In counterpart, invasion of HEp- 2 cells was not observed in any isolate. The Aeromonas isolates were sensitive to the majority of the antimicrobiol agents tested...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Validation studies {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the effect of}} a thermal process on survivability of a pathogen requires a reliable enumeration method to successfully determine the survivability during food processing. <b>Direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> have been utilised in many research for determining the initial and final level of microorganisms in order to calculate the microbial log reduction achieved during a process validation study. Also research have shown that Salmonella species could become heat injured during thermal processing which makes it difficult to recover their cells. Purpose: This study was designed to assess the efficiency of a non-selective agar; Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) and five selective media; Bismuth Sulfite Agar (BSA), Chromogenic Agar (CHR), Hektoen Enteric Agar (HEA), MacConkey Agar (MAC) and Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate Agar (XLD) for the detection, enumeration and recovery of Salmonella before and after heat treatment. Methods: Artificially inoculated almonds were roasted in rapeseed oil heated to approximately 120 °C for 95 seconds. The population of Salmonella before and after heat treatment was then enumerated by <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> on TSA, BSA, CHR, HEA, MAC and XLD. Results: The mean level of Salmonella (n= 4) before heat treatment ranged from 8. 69 – 9. 68 Log Cfu/g of almonds for the three serovars. After heat treatment (n= 4) Log Cfu/g level of SEPT 30, 775 W and DT 104 recovered ranged from 5. 01 ± 0. 01 (HEA) to 5. 55 ± 0. 26 (TSA), 4. 01 ± 0. 20 (XLD) to 5. 16 ± 0. 30 (TSA) and 4. 82 ± 0. 15 (CHR) to 5. 84 ± 0. 05 (TSA) respectively. The media that were optimal for the recovery of SEPT 30 and 775 W included TSA, BSA and MAC, which recovered more cells (P ≤ 0. 01) than CHR, HEA and XLD. For DT 104, TSA, HEA and MAC recovered more cells. Significance: The result obtained in this study suggests the use of TSA in combination with BSA and/or MAC agar for maximum recovery of Salmonella cells after oil roasting process...|$|R
40|$|During a 1 -year period, three {{bacteriological}} {{systems for}} detecting bacteremia in children were analyzed, namely, the BACTEC system (Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Cockeysville, Md.), the Fisher/Lederle bottle (Lederle Diagnostics, Pearl River, N. Y.), and a <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> of blood termed quantitative <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> (QDP). Of 2, 123 blood cultures, 135 (6. 4 %) were positive; Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 3. 4 %, representing 61 patients, other pathogens accounted for 0. 6 %, and contaminants accounted for 2. 4 %. Of 72 cultures yielding H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae, 60 were recovered by both broth systems, 2 by BACTEC only and 10 by Fisher/Lederle bottle only. The BACTEC system failed to register a positive growth index reading by 24 h in 15 cultures which were positive for H. influenzae, even though growth had occurred, {{as shown by}} positive subculture and microscopy at this time. QDP detected 89 % of the cultures positive for H. influenzae and N. meningitidis, of which 55 % yielded results before either broth procedure. Only 50 % of the cultures positive for S. pneumoniae yielded growth on QDP. This difference in the recovery rate probably is {{accounted for by the}} number of organisms in the blood. Thus, more than 100 organisms per ml of blood were found in 71 % of cultures positive for H. influenzae and N. meningitidis but in only 7 % of those positive for S. pneumoniae. These studies, then, have revealed that H. influenzae, which grew well in BACTEC broth, did not, however, give a significant growth index reading during day 1 of incubation, in contrast to N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae. The QDP system not only provided information on the magnitude of bacteremia due to H. influenzae and N. meningitidis but frequently allowed earlier diagnosis and, thus, proved to be a valuable, simple, and inexpensive supplementary technique for broth cultures, although not for the diagnosis of S. pneumoniae bacteremia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some marine cyanophage are temperate and can be induced from a lysogenic phase to a lytic phase by different agents such as heavy metals. However, to date no significant reports have focused on the temperate nature of freshwater cyanophage/cyanobacteria. Previous experiments with cyanophage AS- 1 and cyanobacteria Anacystis nidulans have provided some evidence that AS- 1 may have a lysogenic life cycle in addition to the characterized lytic cycle. Results In this study, the possible temperate A. nidulans was treated with different concentrations of heavy metal-copper. CuSO 4 with concentrations of 3. 1 × 10 - 3 M, 3. 1 × 10 - 4 M, 3. 1 × 10 - 5 M and 3. 1 × 10 - 6 M were used to detect the induction of AS- 1 from A. nidulans. The population of the host, unicellular cyanobacteria Anacystis nidulans, was monitored by direct count and turbidity while the amount of virus produced was derived from plaque forming units (PFU) by a <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method.</b> The ratio of AS- 1 release from A. nidulans was also determined. From these results it appears that AS- 1 lysogenic phage can be induced by copper at concentrations from 3. 1 × 10 - 6 M to 3. 1 × 10 - 4 M. Maximal phage induction occurred at 6 hours after addition of copper, with an optimal concentration of 3. 1 × 10 - 6 M. Conclusion Cu 2 + is a significant inducer for lysogenic cyanobacterial cells and consequently would be a potential control agent in the cyanobacteria population in fresh water ecosystems. </p...|$|R
40|$|The fungus Fusarium sporotrichioides, {{capable of}} {{producing}} T- 2 toxin (T- 2), was grown on irradiated corn kernels remoistened to 22 % and kept in atmospheres of different CO 2 -O 2 combinations. The production of T- 2 was totally inhibited under 60 % CO 2 - 20 % O 2, whereas only trace amounts were detected when the gas combination was 40 % CO 2 - 5 % O 2. Under all other combinations tested, the amount of T- 2 produced was reduced by 25 to 50 % {{as compared with the}} control. Fungal growth was not inhibited by any of the gas mixtures examined, and the growth rate (measured by <b>direct</b> <b>plating,</b> dilution <b>method,</b> and CO 2 production) was almost identical to that in grains kept under air. It is concluded that although F. sporotrichioides is tolerant to high CO 2 levels, T- 2 formation on corn can be inhibited by CO 2 concentrations less than that required to inhibit fungal growth...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{investigation was}} made for the natural fungal contamination of imported and locally grown milled rice grains. Twenty four samples of each type of rice were obtained from various market centers within and around Kampala capital city. Contaminating fungi were enumerated by <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> on two isolation media including dichloran rose-bengal chloramphenicol agar (DRBC) and dichloran 18 % glycerol agar (DG 18) media. The locally grown rice recorded a total of 62 species belonging to 34 genera while the imported rice had 61 species belonging to 31 genera, on both isolation media. The broadest species spectrum on both types of rice grains were from the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Eurotium followed by Fusarium, Cladosporium and Cochliobolus. Both types of rice grains were predominantly contaminated by Aspergillus candidus, A. flavus, A. niger, Eurotium amstelodami, E. rubrum, Penicillium citrinum, P. oxalicum and Talaromyces spp. on the two isolation media used. The incidence levels of xerophilic fungi especially A. candidus and Eurotium spp. were however, comparatively higher on the imported rice than the local rice. Field fungi including Acremonium strictum, Fusarium moniliforme, F. solani, Scytalidium lignicola and Trichorderma harzianum occurred only on the local rice while xerophilic fungi including Aspergillus penicillioides, A. wentii, Eurotium repens and Paecilomyces lilacinus occurred only on the imported rice, on both isolation media. The imported rice grain samples recorded comparatively higher moisture contents than the local rice whereby 15. 50 % was the highest level for the import while for the local it was 14. 60 %. A half of the imported rice samples had moisture content above the recommended level for safe storage of milled rice while for the local rice only 12. 5 % of the samples moisture content were above this level...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{consumption}} {{combined with}} increasing risk to foodborne illnesses makes {{it necessary to}} identify potential sources of contamination in the food chain and apply intervention processes that prevent/minimize the risk of contamination. The current study investigated {{the effect of the}} decontamination treatments with chlorine and lactic acid on the survival of Salmonella on the rind and stem scar portions of inoculated mangoes. The presence of the pathogen in the treatment water, internalization and the effect of the treatments {{on the quality of the}} fruit were also determined. For scar (hydrothermal), a 3. 0 log reduction was obtained for control and additional reductions of approximately 2. 2 and 1. 3 log cycles were obtained with lactic acid and chlorine respectively. Data indicates reduction in pathogen population in cooling for all the treatments except two (Control ? increase of 0. 3 logs, LA-LA ? increase of 0. 3 logs). A 0. 5 log reduction was obtained for the control (initial - 4. 4 log 10 CFU/ 10 cm 2) and additional reductions of approximately 1. 7 and 1. 3 log cycles were obtained for treatments with lactic acid and chlorine respectively during hydrothermal treatment on the rind. For cooling, lactic acid and chlorine gave an overall reduction of approximately 1. 3 and 1. 4 logs respectively compared to control. Although Salmonella was not detected in the core stem tissue by <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>method</b> for most of the samples, it was detected after the enrichment method. The pathogen was detected on the rind, stem scar and the stem tissue for most of the samples for as long as 12 days. Salmonella was detected in treatment water with and without sanitizers after dipping mangoes. Lactic acid was found to be more effective in reducing pathogen population compared to chlorine in all the treatment combinations; however, the sensory aspects (color and texture) of the fruit were compromised...|$|R
40|$|For years, {{quantitative}} blood cultures {{found only}} limited use as {{aids in the}} diagnosis and management of septic patients because the available methods were cumbersome, labor intensive, and practical only for relatively small volumes of blood. The development and subsequent commercial availability of lysis-centrifugation <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> <b>methods</b> for blood cultures have addressed many of the shortcomings of the older methods. The lysis-centrifugation method has demonstrated good performance relative to broth-based blood culture methods. As a result, quantitative blood cultures have found widespread use in clinical microbiology laboratories. Most episodes of clinical significant bacteremia in adults are characterized by low numbers of bacteria per milliliter of blood. In children, the magnitude of bacteremia is generally much higher, with the highest numbers of bacteria found {{in the blood of}} septic neonates. The magnitude of bacteremia correlates with the severity of disease in children and with mortality rates in adults, but other factors play more important roles in determining the patient's outcome. Serial quantitative blood cultures have been used to monitor the in vivo efficacy of antibiotic therapy in patients with slowly resolving sepsis, such as disseminated Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex infections. Quantitative blood culture methods were used in early studies of bacterial endocarditis, and the results significantly contributed {{to our understanding of the}} pathophysiology of this disease. Comparison of paired quantitative blood cultures obtained from a peripheral vein and the central venous catheter has been used to help identify patients with catheter-related sepsis and is the only method that does not require removal of the catheter to establish the diagnosis. Quantitation of bacteria in the blood can also help distinguish contaminated from truly positive blood cultures; however, no quantitative criteria can invariably differentiate contamination from bacteremia...|$|R
