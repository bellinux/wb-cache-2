40|$|From the Introduction On {{behalf of}} the Notre Dame Law School student body, we are thrilled {{to be among the}} first to welcome you to the NDLS Community! We know that this is an {{exciting}} time for you and–if you are anything like we were {{just a couple of years}} ago–you probably have plenty of questions about law school and Notre Dame, whether it’s about academics, professors, student life, or just where to get a good dinner. That’s why we’ve prepared the Guide. This is called an Insider’s Guide because it has been written by students. Over the past year, we’ve updated and revised old sections, compiled and created new ones, and edited and re-edited the whole book in hopes of making your transition to Notre Dame easier. This isn’t a comprehensive guide to everything you need to know to get through law school or thrive in South Bend, but it is a great place to start. Whether you’re trying to figure out where to live next year, the best way to get to and around town, what law students do on the weekend, or which daycare is best <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>kids,</b> the Guide is a terrific resource. Please note that some information may have changed since the date of publication, so be sure to confirm pertinent information. We all treasure our experiences here at NDLS. The professors, the students, and the staff of the Law School are unique – their warmth, friendship, and true support have made studying law at Notre Dame a pleasure! We hope that our enthusiasm will be apparent throughout the Guide. We have appreciated reflecting on our experiences here and enjoyed putting the Guide together for you. Although we know that you will receive a variety of additional information from the Law School and the University, we hope that this look at NDLS from the perspective of your soon-to-be colleagues will be valuable as you prepare to start here in August...|$|E
40|$|Although Eden-Monaro is Australia’s best-known {{bellwether}} seat, the NSW electorate of Macarthur {{has acted}} as a bellwether for much longer - back to 1949, {{when it was first}} created. David Burchell visits Macarthur for APO and finds an electorate that seems relaxed and comfortable about another three years of Coalition government [...] . WHEN Sydney journalist Michael Duffy was researching his joint biography of Mark Latham and Tony Abbott earlier this year, he visited Latham at his family home in the outer-Sydney suburb of Glen Alpine, on the southern outskirts of Campbelltown. They chatted in the backyard, amidst the humming of lawnmowers and the hissing of barbecues from neighbouring houses beyond the Colorbond fence. Duffy was struck by the idyllic, and to his mind nostalgic, qualities of the scene. Where else in modern-day Sydney would one have so close a sense of connection to community, and yet so perfect a sense of family autonomy, all in the one sprawling backyard? And he guessed this must {{have something to do with}} Latham’s championing of Australian suburbanism and its distinctive ethos. The question, he asked himself, was how typical this scene was of contemporary Australia as a whole. The answer, of course, depends upon the vantage-point you’re looking from. While the name Western Sydney still conjures up for many eastern Sydneysiders a kind of undifferentiated urban badlands, large tracts of the city’s outer western fringes are actually a full-on nostalgia trip for anyone with bitter-sweet memories of suburban childhoods from the fifties and sixties: kids cycle up the middle of half-deserted streets, backyards are strewn with old car-parts, garden sheds are full of unfinished home-handyman projects, and the steady throb of cicadas fills the air. While the denizens of these suburbs are just as preoccupied with the obsessions du jour - interest rates, home renovation and the vaudeville villains of reality TV - as anybody, there’s a persistent nagging sense in the mind of the casual visitor that somehow, some way, the ethos of a quieter if more naïve era still lingers here, like an undead retro pop melody on a ‘greatest hits’ radio station’s playlist. While Latham is MP for the neighbouring seat of Werriwa, based around the Labor-dominated city of Liverpool, his home in Glen Alpine sits in the heart of the bellwether electorate of Macarthur. It’s a strategic location. Just to the east is the Campbelltown Hospital, where some of the best-publicised controversies around Sydney’s public hospital system have been played out in recent years. Next to it is the Marcarthur Square shopping centre, currently under redevelopment to fit its new role as the commercial ‘town square’ of what is projected top be Sydney’s fastest-growing region in the next decade. The new Macarthur Square will have three hundred shops, thousands upon thousands of parking spaces, a bowling alley and an ice-skating rink, and it will be extended right up to the gates of the local station. Just across the railway line from the building site is the precinct that houses the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney and the local TAFE College. A perpetual afterthought in the calculations of higher education planners, the university sprawls untidily across the entirety of the city’s west, from Richmond in the outer-north-west to Penrith in the outer west, Parramatta on the hinge of the west, and Bankstown and Campbelltown in the south-west. Nearly every one of its campuses is an old converted college of advanced education from before the ‘Dawkins era’ of higher education: many of the humanities tutorial rooms are converted labs, the carpets are often threadbare and the facilities sparse. The Campbelltown campus, on the other hand, is architect-designed, stylistically coherent and impeccably neat. The lawns curve like a GI’s crew-cut. There’s a grassy verge called the Fellows Lawn, and if you cross it you evoke raised eyebrows. It’s a very Campbelltown kind of place. Past the campuses you can see the tree-tops of Mount Annan Botanic Garden, perhaps the lushest location in this rather parched electorate. Finally, nestled among the winding streets of Glen Alpine itself the unsuspecting traveller hits upon the twists and turns of the local golf course, complete with ample clubhouse and artificial lake. Like Campbelltown proper, Glen Alpine may not be a Happening Place, but it’s doing just fine, thank you very much. Indeed, it may be that Latham’s feel for the electoral pulse of his home city derives as much from the bustle of Macarthur Square and the ‘puck’ of golf-balls as it does from the neighbourhood lawnmowers and barbeques. Sydney in the first decade of the new millennium is a boom-town, and decidedly pleased with itself and its progress. And while sophisticates from the city of apartments and European caryards to the east probably couldn’t locate it on a map of Sydney if their lives depended on it, Campbelltown is garnering its fair share of the affluence. It’s a paradox of electoral science that ‘bellwether’ seats are often quite atypical of the wider electorate: their marginality is a product of a fragile balance of local interests and subcultures, rather than some judicious admixture of the nation’s leading tribes. Macarthur is a classic instance. It may straddle the electoral fault-line of Sydney, and it may traditionally have sat on an electoral knife-edge. (Every party since 1949 to win Macarthur won Australia as well.) Yet it doesn’t look typical of Sydney as a whole - it doesn’t even seem typical of the city’s West. In many respects it feels more like the country. Drive to Campbelltown from Penrith down then Northern Road (as I do for my work), and you sometimes have to remind yourself which side of the Great Dividing Range you’re on: at times you could be on the road to Mudgee, in the NSW mid-west. There are old, parched-looking farms with some cattle and emerald-green lucerne, and scrawny avenues of trees leading up to 1940 s fibro cottages - and others, attached to grand houses on a pattern loosely derived from Gone With the Wind, which look remarkably like hobby farms for cashed-up tradespeople from the east. There’s even a winery with a cellar door, though you’re not likely to see its products in the stores. It’s one lane the whole way, and road-trains are plentiful, so the regular traveller has ample opportunity to practice the ancient art of overtaking via the oncoming lane. It’s not quite Route 66, but it’s close. EVEN today the twin towns of Campbelltown and Camden have a certain bucolic air. Campbelltown Sports Ground is part-time host to the Wests Tigers, the Sydney rugby league ‘joint venture’ that brought together two old inner-city teams and presented them to the denizens of the city’s fringe, with only moderate success. Season by season, though, the ‘franchise’ is slowly disentangling itself from the unsteady grip of the Macarthur region and slipping back to its roots in the Big Smoke. (Next year only three club games will be played out here.) Somehow, like the vines of the part-time winery up the road, the grafting of the inner-city football culture onto the urban fringe didn’t quite take. Flip through the sports pages of the local newspaper, the Advertiser, and it’s clear the football heroes out here don’t hail from the Olympian reaches of the Sydney first-grade competition. The full-colour poster-boys here are the broad-shouldered warriors of the Narellan Jets and the Camden Rams, two entirely amateur teams playing under the auspices of the NSW Country Rugby League. Looking at the photos you can almost smell the sausages sizzling. As you might expect, then, with the exception of some parts of Campbelltown, Macarthur is bungalow-and-backyard territory. Sydneysiders as a whole have been opting increasingly for flats and apartments in recent years - in the former case because it’s all they can afford in the areas they choose to live in, and in the latter because it’s felt to be New-York-loftish and chic. About one in three Sydney dwellings at the time of the 2001 census were either flats, apartments or semi-detached properties - and the number has undoubtedly grown since. Across Macarthur, though, more than seven out of eight occupied dwellings are free-standing houses - and that proportion is surely destined to grow, given the sprawling estates destined to spring up on the electorate’s northern outskirts, around the Sleeping Beauty hamlet of Bringelly. Here anyone who shares their building with others has almost certainly hit hard times: chic has nothing to do with it. Much has been made in recent years of Sydney’s status as Australia’s premier migrant city. The NSW Premier Bob Carr has suggested the city is suffering migration overload, and has floated what look suspiciously like off-the-cuff plans to direct new migrants towards regional centres, or else (horror of horrors!) interstate. Earnest academics (and Latham himself, come to that) have raised anxieties about a new phenomenon of ‘white flight’ to the outer suburbs, where buying land is still cheaper than building a house, the crime rate is believed to be lower and the ‘urban problems’ of the inner-city can be left behind. Demographers with a flair for the graphic are wont to depict Sydney (like an onion, apparently) as composed of concentric circles, with privilege in the centre, deprivation in the middle ring, and aspirational refugees from care clinging to the outer edges like gravity-affected water molecules in a school science experiment. When the bicycle bells peal and the cicadas buzz it may seem like a plausible hypothesis. Catch the train from Central Station to Campbelltown or vice versa and you’ll certainly be struck by the ‘cultural’ shift. Almost one-third of the four million residents of the Sydney statistical district were born overseas; the figure for the Macarthur electorate is less than one in five. More than a quarter of the population of Sydney speaks a language other than English at home; in Macarthur about half as many do. And the greatest body of migrants in Macarthur (like other parts of the city’s outer West) come from the sleepy provincial burgs of Old Blighty, rather than the turbulent townships of Indochina or the Middle East. Yet to depict the hardy souls of Macarthur as a flock of Robinson Crusoes fleeing a troubled metropolis for the verdant fields is to succumb to the academic’s fetish for intellectual neatness. If Sydney does have an urban social crisis - and it’s far from clear that it does - migration and ethnicity comprise only a small part of it. On the whole migrant Sydneysiders are doing just as well for themselves as their Australian-born neighbours: home ownership among migrant families is at least as high as among non-migrants, and unemployment rates are, at worst, no higher. When the ‘problems’ of Sydney are invoked in public debate it’s a fair bet this is a code for a gaggle of quite specific localities (the areas surrounding Cabramatta and Bankstown come to mind) in which local migrant communities have battled against community dysfunction of different kinds. Ironically, the same intellectual hygiene which requires liberal-minded intellectuals to avoid specifying the social problems of ‘minorities’, lest this fuel their victimization, can also conspire to give the impression that those problems are far more widespread than they actually are. In any case, to depict the residents of Macarthur as creating for themselves a privileged cocoon is to underrate them. The term ‘aspirational’ has become a ready-made insult among some tertiary-educated commentators for whom a passion for upward social mobility without the imprimatur of upward educational attainment seems a form of social gaucherie. (Which is odd, given how many current-day academics are themselves the beneficiaries of their parents’ determination for their children to have ‘better opportunities’.) It’s the kind of pained cultural disdain couched as social critique that fuels the popularity of ABC TV’s Kath and Kim. Yet if being ‘aspirational’ means anything it generally means, not naked personal ambition, as such, so much as the desire <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>kids</b> to have better lives than your own, or at least the chance for it. This doesn’t necessarily require that anybody else’s kids have to have a worse life: after all, hasn’t the postwar history of Australia been a tale of social improvement through individual striving? All it means is that, when your kids are the centre of your life, the horizons of society seem in comparison blurred and unreal. The focus of aspiration is the people immediately around you - kith and kin rather than Kath and Kim. On the evidence of the ABS figures, Macarthur’s demographic heartland is composed of tradespeople, shop-owners and skilled blue-collar workers. Not that many people above thirty have finished high school; fewer still have a post-school qualification. Sydneysiders who left school at Year Twelve are nowadays more numerous than those who left at Year Ten; in Macarthur, however, Year Ten school-leavers still outnumber Year Twelve graduates by a factor of two to one. Four in ten Sydneysiders nowadays have some post-school qualification, while in Macarthur only one in eight do (and most of those have trade certificates). Residents of Macarthur as less than half as likely to have a university degree than Sydneysiders as a whole - despite that manicured campus down the road. The list goes on, but I’ll spare you it. Despite these striking differences, however, there’s an inter-generational change in Campbelltown and environs that is as obvious in the tutorial room as in the classroom. ‘Aspiring’, after all, is generally about aspiring <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>kids</b> - and when employers still take note of such things in CVs, it may seem that attention to educational choices is the key. While the parents of Macarthur have mostly graduated through the ‘university of life’ - and while the grander private schools have all chosen to raise their front gates and unfurl their manicured lawns elsewhere - the children of the area are almost exactly as likely to be attending private schools as their cousins in the north and east. Labor’s complicated if well-intentioned schools policy - with its focus on the few elite private schools attended by the old families from the old suburbs - was crafted precisely with areas like this in mind. AND SO, given the obvious links between the zeitgeist of Labor’s new leader and the area in which he’s placed his own roots, it’s bound to be a cause of disappointment to Labor’s strategists right now that Macarthur, at the time of writing, shows no obvious sign of swinging to the Labor side of the electoral ledger. With a 7 per cent margin and a broad smile, the local member, Pat Farmer, a former long-distance runner, is looking reasonably comfortable - and his demeanour reflects it. Farmer’s rhetorical stock in trade - like that of other recently-installed Liberal MPs in outer-Western Sydney, like Lindsay’s almost pathologically easy-going Jackie Kelly - is the persona of the non-political politician. For the papers he’s the slow-moving, fast-smiling local boy with a Mr Smith Goes to Washington distaste for the wiles and seductions of Canberra, and an insatiable appetite for the smell of bricks, mortar and potting mixture. Right now the smile is a genuine one. When the PM visited Western Sydney in the fourth week of the election campaign the curtain behind the podium was festooned with larger than life images of all the regions Liberal MPs, each with the same bland and forthright smile, as if crafted by digital enhancement. Mr Howard, smiling in an altogether more fox-like manner, observed: ‘This is a great way to begin the second part of the campaign, here in territory the Liberal Party thought it could never have. ’ In front of him, on the face of the lectern, was the succinct electoral slogan: ‘Keeping Interest Rates Low’. The slogan’s astute enough, of course: it bites. A couple of interest-rate percentage-points west, and a lot of house-proud home-buyers here with private school fees to pay could be in real trouble. Yet it also hints at the hidden fragility of the Coalition’s hold on Sydney’s West. Labor’s long slide in Western Sydney began in 1993 : it’s a hard task to turn around a decade of decline in twelve months. So long as the Keating-era image of Labor as big-city social engineers for the chattering classes lingers, candidates like Pat Farmer have an easy time of it. Yet the image is fading fast, thanks to the good burgher from Glen Alpine. So long as interest rates do stay low, the government doesn’t really have to project forward-looking policies for the new communities springing up here like fields of lucerne. But they may not stay low for much longer. The pendulum may not have swung, yet. But if it were the needle of a barometer it might be wobbling, signaling stormy weather ahead.
