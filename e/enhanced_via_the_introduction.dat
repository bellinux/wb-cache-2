40|$|Drawing on {{data from}} the first {{national}} survey of trade union equality representatives, this article assesses the role and impact of equality representatives in Britain. While the majority of equality representatives report having had {{a positive impact on}} employer equality practice, the analysis also suggests that equality representative effectiveness might be <b>enhanced</b> <b>via</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of statutory rights to time off. In addition, it points to the need for unions to include equality on the bargaining agenda, attract new representatives to the role, and ensure that equality representatives have the confidence and skills to represent members effectively within grievance procedures. It also suggests an important role for the government in encouraging employers to engage in meaningful dialogue with equality representatives...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} practical {{aspects of}} {{the application of the}} backstepping method to the control of industrial processes. The limitations are emphased and solutions are proposed. The steady-state performances of the backstepping-based controllers are <b>enhanced</b> <b>via</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of an integral action in the controller. In presence of non-zero mean perturbations, this modification guarantees vanishing residual errors. The manipulated variable behavior is also improved by the introduction of a new Lyapunov-based filter. In noisy contexts, the later ensures a small variance of the control, without altering the closed-loop stability. Finally, it is shown that an appropriate time scale selection is needed to obtain the desired closed-loop dynamics specification. The proposed scheme is applied to the control of a flotation column. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent years have witnessed a rapid emergence of new methodologies for feedback control of nonlinear systems.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} a 1 : 3 year return period flood on benthic and pelagic coupling in the river-dominated sub-tropical Brunswick Estuary. The flood {{had a significant impact on}} the study site flushing it with freshwater, reducing the flushing time 0. 6 days, increasing nutrient concentrations in the water column and scouring the sediment surface. In the three weeks post-flood the benthic and pelagic systems alternated between being coupled and un-coupled via dissolved, particulate and living material pathways. Immediately post-flood benthic and pelagic coupling <b>via</b> <b>the</b> deposition of phyto-detritus and viable algal cells was reduced due to the scouring of the top sediment layers, and benthic respiration and productivity and NH 4 + effluxes all decreased correspondingly. In contrast, benthic and pelagic coupling was <b>enhanced</b> <b>via</b> <b>the</b> uptake and denitrification of NO 3 - due to elevated NO 3 - concentrations in the water column. Some of the NO 3 - consumed by the sediments may have also been converted to DON. Two weeks post-flood benthic and pelagic coupling was significantly <b>enhanced</b> <b>via</b> <b>the</b> deposition of phyto-detritus and viable algal cells associated with a phytoplankton bloom in the water column. This increased supply of phyto-detritus and viable algal cells rapidly increased benthic respiration and productivity and NH 4 + efflux. The depletion of water column DIN by the phytoplankton bloom resulted in a de-coupling of the benthic and pelagic systems <b>via</b> <b>the</b> uptake and denitrification of NO 3 -. However, benthic and pelagic coupling was <b>enhanced</b> <b>via</b> <b>the</b> uptake of NH 4 + by benthic microalgae. Three weeks post-flood the phytoplankton bloom had collapsed and the coupling between the benthic and pelagic systems <b>via</b> <b>the</b> deposition of phyto-detritus and living algal cells had diminished. Again benthic and pelagic coupling was <b>enhanced</b> <b>via</b> <b>the</b> uptake and denitrification of NO 3 - due to elevated NO 3 - concentrations in the water column associated with the recycling of bloom material. Overall the sediments became less heterotrophic (increasing benthic productivity/respiration ratio) following the flood. Floods can cause rapid and complex changes in the coupling between benthic and pelagic systems in sub-tropical estuaries...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: While {{adaptive}} mutations can bestow new functions on proteins <b>via</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> or optimization of reactive centers, {{or other}} structural changes, {{a role for}} the optimization of protein dynamics also seems likely but has been more difficult to evaluate. Antibody (Ab) affinity maturation {{is an example of}} adaptive evolution wherein the adaptive mutations may be identified and Abs may be raised to specific targets that facilitate the characterization of protein dynamics. Here, we report the characterization of three affinity matured Abs that evolved from a common germline precursor to bind the chromophoric antigen (Ag), 8 -methoxypyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonate (MPTS). In addition to characterizing the sequence, molecular recognition, and structure of each Ab, we characterized the dynamics of each complex by determining their mechanical response to an applied force via three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3 PEPS) spectroscopy and deconvoluting the response into elastic, anelastic, and plastic components. We find that for one Ab, affinity maturation was accomplished <b>via</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> of a single functional group that mediates a direct contact with MPT...|$|R
