5|$|The owner at {{the time}} of the building's {{nomination}} to the National Register of Historic Places, Phil Becker, grew up living on Mazon Street (Illinois Route 17). He had been <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station since he was nine and began working at the station in 1964. One year after Becker's employment began, Ambler sold the station to Earl Kochler. Kochler sold the station to Royce McBeath, who ran it between 19651970. The station changed hands once again when Becker bought the station from McBeath on March 4, 1970. About a year after Becker took over operation of the station, Texaco suddenly stopped supplying the location with gasoline and Becker contracted with Marathon Oil. The brand change was accompanied by a name change to Becker's Marathon Gas Station, a name the station would be known by for over 26years. Becker operated the station, along with his wife Debbie, from the time of purchase until 1996. After closing the station, the couple leased the building out as an auto repair shop and eventually donated the building to the village of Dwight.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with David Letterman, Lewis talked about hitchhiking across the country back to New York City and how he learned to play the harmonica while waiting for rides. He talked about <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport for three days until he stowed away {{on a plane to}} Europe. In later interviews, Lewis would reveal other encounters he had traveling around Europe. While visiting Aberdeen, Scotland, with no money and nowhere to sleep, he claimed that the locals were very hospitable by offering him somewhere to stay. In Madrid, Spain, he became an accomplished blues player as he hitchhiked and supported himself by busking with his harmonica. He gave his first concerts in Madrid, earning enough money to buy a plane ticket back to the USA.|$|E
25|$|When Ashanti was 16, she was {{discovered}} by P.Diddy's Bad Boy Records. Initially, she went to Bad Boy Records and sang one of Mary J. Blige's songs in front of P. Diddy and Biggie Smalls. After being impressed by her singing ability, Diddy had her sign to a development deal. In the end, due to a bad contract, Ashanti did not sign with Diddy. This ultimately led to a record deal with Jive Records in 1997. This relationship soured when Jive tried to make Ashanti into a pop singer. Ashanti subsequently involved herself in schoolwork, cheerleading, and running on her school's track team. She belonged to the English club where she began writing poetry. She {{was also in the}} Drama club and performed in a few plays. She put college pursuits aside when Epic Records approached her with a contract in 1998. However, the label's management changes quickly made Ashanti a low priority. She continued to perform at local New York clubs and began <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Murder Inc. recording studio, hoping for another big break.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{joining the}} cast of Tangled, Moore was {{initially}} unaware that the film was slated to be Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature film. Since that time, she has received her ignorance with gratitude, explaining, [...] "I feel lucky because I would've probably felt a bit more pressure had I known going into the recording process." [...] Moore hardly worked with co-stars Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, who provided the voices of Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel, respectively, never meeting Murphy and having only met Levi once to record their characters' duet [...] "I See the Light". Moore {{was surprised to learn}} that she would be isolated from her co-stars against initial expectations that [...] "we're all going to be chummy, <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> studio laughing and going out to dinner together". Moore had little idea of what her character looked like because, in terms of visual aid, she was only provided with rough, incomplete sketches and storyboards, while [...] "everything else had to be explained" [...] by Howard and Greno. The majority of the images were created by Moore herself in her own mind.|$|E

5000|$|Jones {{attended}} {{grammar school}} at Sacred Heart of Jesus then the prestigious Roman Catholic High School in Center City, Philadelphia. At Roman he played basketball {{for two years}} {{with some of the}} country's top athletes such as Allan Watkins, Bernard Jones and future Hall of Fame wide receiver, Marvin Harrison. After getting involved with the wrong crowd Jones quit playing basketball and transferred to a local public school.. During this time he also began trafficking in narcotics which eventually lead to him temporally dropping out of school. After getting arrested in 1991, he decided the lifestyle he so desired was no longer for him and returned to school to earn his diploma that same year. [...] "That decision changed my life", Jones later said, because I would have been dead in the direction I was going. Most of the guys I was <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> with <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time are wasting away in jail today or laying in a graveyard. They were nice guys but fell victim to the streets". After graduating high school he received numerous academic scholarships to various colleges but he chose Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, Arkansas. He stayed there for one year before returning to Philadelphia to find employment to provide for his one-year-old daughter and newborn son. During this time he also attended Cheyney University of Pennsylvania and the Community College of Philadelphia.|$|R

[...] "That decision changed my life," [...] Washington later said, [...] "because I wouldn't have survived in the direction I was going. The guys I was <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> with <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, my running buddies, have now done maybe 40 years combined in the penitentiary. They were nice guys, but the streets got them." [...] After Oakland, Washington next attended Mainland High School, {{a public high school}} in Daytona Beach, Florida, from 1970 to 1971. He was interested in attending Texas Tech University: [...] "I grew up in the Boys Club in Mount Vernon, and we were the Red Raiders. So when I was in high school, I wanted to go to Texas Tech in Lubbock just because they were called the Red Raiders and their uniforms looked like ours." [...] Washington earned a B.A. in Drama and Journalism from Fordham University in 1977. At Fordham, he played collegiate basketball as a guard under coach P.J. Carlesimo. After a period of indecision on which major to study and taking a semester off, Washington worked as creative arts director at an overnight summer camp, Camp Sloane YMCA in Lakeville, Connecticut.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains two}} studies, which {{are intended to}} expand our current knowledge about girls with ASD without intellectual disability. The first study examined sex-differences in ASD symptom endorsement and coexisting internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The second study explored the social behaviors {{of boys and girls}} with ASD <b>at</b> school, and <b>the</b> extent to which they endorsed masculine and feminine social preferences and social behaviors. There is some literature to suggest that boys and girls differentially endorse ASD social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Additionally, girls are reported to endorse greater internalizing behaviors than boys. Yet girls with ASD without intellectual disability are underrepresented in the literature and less is known about their experiences. It is unclear how gender and the deficits associated with ASD affect the social relationships of girls and boys with ASD at school. Thirty-eight girls with ASD were matched by age (&# 956; = 9. 97 (3. 86)), grade, IQ (&# 956; = 93. 29 (13. 34)), and city of residence to boys with ASD. In the first study, between-group comparisons of IQ, the deficits associated with ASD, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors were examined. The second study used mixed methods analysis to examine participant observation field notes and to explore the social characteristics of boys and girls with ASD at school during unstructured social periods. In the first study, differences in IQ and ASD symptom endorsement were not detected, however, the findings indicated that both parents and teachers report that girls with autism endorse greater internalizing symptomology than boys with ASD. In the second study, gender differences were also detected in the observed social characteristics and behaviors of children with ASD. Both boys and girls with ASD primarily engaged in same-gender play and socializing activities when <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> school. Within <b>the</b> ASD sample, girls with ASD made more social initiations and were more persistent in gaining access into peer groups compared to boys with ASD. Boys with ASD spent more time alone and rejected more social initiations compared to girls with ASD. The challenges associated with ASD were more difficult to detect in girls than in boys. Modifications to social skills interventions at school are needed to better address the environmental factors that influence the social behaviors of boys and girls with ASD...|$|R
