40|$|The {{claim of}} {{individuals}} to a private cohesive self might be interestingly thought of as an effect of consciousness. Even if illusory, the self is an object to which one establishes relations, and can be usefully examined by object-relations theory, especially when 2 ̆ 2 troubled 2 ̆ 2 by feminist and gender theory. This self resists institutional identities and received knowledges [...] perceived as 2 ̆ 2 rot 2 ̆ 2 because they conceal at their core secrets and lies [...] through the snooping processes of <b>epistemophilia.</b> <b>Epistemophilia</b> responds to the lure of suppressed knowledge, what cannot be out-spoken or often even conceptualized. Literature of the {{nineteenth and twentieth centuries}} displays cultural ideas about self-fashioning and the ideal self. Epistemophilic characters in George Eliot 2 ̆ 7 s Daniel Deronda, Virginia Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s To the Lighthouse, and Jeanette Winterson 2 ̆ 7 s Written on the Body resist or utilize their perceived 2 ̆ 2 calls 2 ̆ 2 to marry, to enter profession, and to fall in love, developing their own less predetermined epistemologies based on a newly reclaimed desire for self. <b>Epistemophilia</b> teases out the issues of the role of early interests, talents, and premonitions of genius, the perfomativity of reunions, and the lesbian sublime. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of nonoppressive {{ways of knowing}} other persons, often across significantly different social positions, is an important project within feminism. An account of epistemic responsibility attentive to feminist concerns is developed here through a critique of <b>epistemophilia</b> — the love of knowledge {{to the point of}} myopia and its concurrent ignoring of ignorance. Identifying a positive role for ignorance yields an enhanced understanding of responsible knowledge practices. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} surrealist artists' and writers' {{appropriation of}} Lewis Carroll. Predominantly {{focusing on the}} work of Dorothea Tanning and Max Ernst, it suggests that Carroll's work appealed to the surrealists' fascination with their childhood selves, and their wish to identify with the curious character of Alice as femme-enfant as a way of subverting their bourgeois family backgrounds. Whether stepping Through the Looking Glass or breaking the rules in Wonderland, Alice can be read as a transgressive character apt for surrealist appropriation. The paper traces Carroll's reception in the surrealist movement, and articulates the curious character of the surrealist femme-enfant in order to reinscribe her <b>epistemophilia</b> in line with surrealism's orientation towards research...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the reportage on the Edison Chen sex photo scandal in Hong Kong. Chen, a popular actor and singer, {{took pictures of}} himself and his various sexual partners, and the pictures were leaked onto the internet in late 2007 and early 2008. The incident received widespread coverage in the local media. This article {{examines the}} construction of Chen’s identities as sexual deviant and criminal in the journalistic discourse of this period. It also argues that this discourse tapped into local readers’ scopophilia and <b>epistemophilia</b> in its presentation of the event. It concludes by using the Chen case to highlight the need for cultural-legal scholars to scrutinise media representations of issues relating to sexual identity and behaviour...|$|E
40|$|At each {{successive}} moment in their development new reproductive technologies {{have provided the}} occasion for virulent argument {{about the role of}} technology in human affairs. And more generally, technoscientific knowledge has long been held both in awe and suspicion, with the latter acting as a kind of counterbalance to the continuing cultural investment in the image of scientific knowledge as empowerment, as the motive force of beneficial change. Given this cultural ambivalence the paper focuses on media representations of cloning and the 'designer baby' (with the latter enveloping a debate that has run for almost a decade now) and explores the ways utopian images of a world rendered ever more amenable to human desires have been closely shadowed by just as compelling dystopian visions which are nevertheless constructed from the same cultural material. Figures of occidental folklore such as Frankenstein (or Jeckyll or Brave New World), thus function as something of a convenient shorthand for articulating unease with the direction and pace of technological development, or even voicing loss of confidence in the modernist technoscientific project of instrumental control. In these circumstances, the chimeric notions of the 'designer baby' or the human 'clone' appear Janus-faced, concurrently representing the powers of human creativity as well as the monstrous progeny of an excessive <b>epistemophilia.</b> They are in this sense potent metaphors for the biotechnological revolution's declared power to re-shape both nature and society - for 'good' or 'ill'...|$|E
40|$|Film and {{cultural}} studies scholars have conducted numerous critical analyses of violent women in popular cinema: from the female monsters of horror film and the vigilantes of exploitation cinema to the femmes fatales of film noir and the muscular heroines of action cinema. However, {{few studies have}} examined the depiction of violent women outside the domain of popular film. This thesis addresses this omission by investigating violent women in a series of texts positioned in counter-distinction to popular genres, such as the art-house films Trouble Every Day (Claire Denis, 2001), Antichrist (Lars von Trier, 2009) and The Book of Revelation (Ana Kokkinos, 2006), prestige pictures Monster (Patty Jenkins, 2003) and The Reader (Stephen Daldry, 2008) and festival films Sister My Sister (Nancy Meckler, 1994) and Fun (Rafal Zielinski, 1994). Posing this grouping as “distinguished cinema” because of their special status in critical discourse, I argue that these texts creatively respond to the challenge that the violent woman makes to hegemonic conceptions of feminine non-violence. Distinguished films share a structuring <b>epistemophilia</b> or “desire-to-know” the violent woman’s ontology that arises from the exclusion of violent femininity within cultural discourse. Proceeding from this, each chapter examines how these films produce the violent female subject via the mechanisms of narrative, the structures of film form and the processes of spectatorship. By undertaking this research, this thesis extends critical knowledge about the violent woman by illuminating how distinguished cinema texts construct her subjectivity...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} first elucidates some central {{problems with}} contemporary environmental and animal ethics, arguing that most arise from {{a reliance on}} heavily anthropocentric concepts such as reason, sentience, and rights. Second, it investigates the possibility of ontology and ethics beyond anthropocentrism, in which relationships between beings are based on neither identity nor difference alone, but rather on ‘indistinction’. There is a particular focus on how mainstream western philosophy and science suffer from a failure to recognize and overcome two particularly insidious founding dichotomies of western thought and culture: those that oppose humans to (other-than-human) animals, and animals to the environment. The argument that the primacy of ethics must be acknowledged is central, as {{is the notion that}} bodily comportment must be engaged in ethical behaviour. Drawing parallels between Merleau-Ponty and other thinkers, especially feminists, the dissertation also interrogates the role science plays in philosophy, especially in respect of its contributions to shaping and promulgating Cartesian notions of the self, and to widespread treatment of both other-than-human animals and other ‘natural’ entities as ‘other’ to and separable from human beings, as objects rather than subjects. A central argument is that Merleau-Ponty’s later ontology offers the most promising prospect in establishing a non-anthropocentric ethics. Drawing on other thinkers’ ideas to ‘flesh out’ Merleau-Ponty’s unfinished work, the issue of how ethical behaviour might be motivated in a less anthropocentric culture is discussed, as is the issue of western philosophy’s <b>epistemophilia.</b> The conclusion is that environmental ethics must embrace an ontology of the flesh in which human/animal and animal/environment dichotomies are overcome, the embodied and intersubjective nature of being is acknowledged, and ‘environment’ is recognized as something that we all live rather than live in...|$|E
