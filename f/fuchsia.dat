25|$|The {{woody plants}} of the Antarctic Floristic Kingdom include {{conifers}} in the families Podocarpaceae, Araucariaceae and the subfamily Callitroideae of Cupressaceae, and angiosperms {{such as the}} families Proteaceae, Griseliniaceae, Cunoniaceae, Atherospermataceae, and Winteraceae, and genera like southern beech (Nothofagus) and <b>fuchsia</b> (<b>Fuchsia).</b> Many other families of flowering plants and ferns, including the tree fern Dicksonia, are characteristic of the Antarctic flora. In the past Tasmania was omitted since its plant species are {{more closely related to}} those found in the Australian Floristic Kingdom. Good noted, as had Joseph Dalton Hooker much earlier, that many plant species of Antarctica, temperate South America and New Zealand were very closely related, despite their disjunction by the vast Southern Ocean. Tasmania and New Caledonia share related species extinct in Australia mainland.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} era, the {{principal}} distinctions between men's kimono {{are in the}} fabric. The typical men's kimono is a subdued, dark color; black, dark blues, greens, and browns are common. Fabrics are usually matte. Some have a subtle pattern, and textured fabrics are common in more casual kimono. More casual kimono may be made in slightly brighter colors, such as lighter purples, greens and blues. Sumo wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colors such as <b>fuchsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a <b>fuchsia</b> jersey, representing the Tauron Group, the sponsors of the classification. In the mountains classification, points were won by reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other cyclists, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs, which were split into three distinctive categories. Double points were awarded for the final climb of the race, on the penultimate stage. The third jersey represented the points classification, marked by a white-and-red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 20 in a stage. For all stages, the win earned 20points, second place earned 19points, third 18, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 20th.|$|E

50|$|Horticultural <b>fuchsias</b> may be {{categorised}} as {{upright and}} bushy, or trailing, and some {{can be trained}} as hedges, such as F. magellanica. Faster-growing varieties are easiest to train. Care {{should be taken to}} choose the hardier cultivars for permanent plantings in the garden as many popular upright <b>Fuchsias</b> such as 'Ernie', 'Jollies Nantes' and 'Maria Landy' are not reliably winter hardy, but rather extremely tender (hardiness zone 10).|$|R
25|$|Traditional Australian ugg {{boots are}} made from sheepskins with fleece attached. The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is {{assembled}} with the fleece on the inside. Some ugg boots have a synthetic sole, commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). The stitching is often prominent {{on the outside of}} the boot. The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives isothermal properties to the boots: the thick fleecy fibres on the inner part of the boots wick moisture and allow air to circulate, keeping the feet at body temperature and allowing the boots to keep feet warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. Produced by a number of manufacturers, they come in a variety of colours, including black, pink, blue, chestnut, and <b>fuchsia.</b> They are available in both pull-on and lace-up varieties and their height can range from just above the ankle to above the knee.|$|E

Giacomo Luke is the inspiration behind the name of Kentucky Derby-winning horse Giacomo.|$|E
25|$|Other {{buildings}} {{belonging to}} Egeskov include Ladegården, a thatched half-timbered building {{which is now}} part of the museum. Other buildings are used by the museum and for farming. Surrounding the castle is an old park, covering 20 hectares (49 acres) of land. The park is divided into a number of gardens. The renaissance garden features fountains, a gravel path and topiary figures. The <b>fuchsia</b> garden, {{one of the largest in}} Europe, contains 104 different species. Other gardens near the castle include an English garden, a water garden, an herb garden, a vegetable garden, and a peasant's garden (bondehave). The gardens also feature four hedge mazes. The oldest is a beech maze several hundreds of years old. This garden is trimmed every year to prevent the trees from dying. The newest maze is the world's largest bamboo maze. It features a Chinese tower in the centre, and a bridge from the tower provides the exit from the maze. The parks feature a three-meter-tall sundial designed by Danish poet and mathematician, Piet Hein.|$|E

On {{either side of the}} Great Plat are raised terraces with brick water channels.
