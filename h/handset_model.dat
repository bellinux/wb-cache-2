50|$|In the 1920s, {{developments}} in anti-sidetone circuitry and non-positional transmitters, which worked in any orientation, permitted Western Electric {{to develop a}} <b>handset</b> <b>model</b> free of these problems. The resulting E1 handset was ready for production in 1927. This handset was paired with a base that was essentially a candlestick with a shortened neck of approximately one inch in height, topped with a new cradle for the handset. The cradle incorporated the hookswitch as a vertical plunger actuating the electrical switch contacts. This initial design was tested in the central offices and released in limited supply as Western Electric's first handset subscriber telephone, the model A1.|$|E
50|$|Another hurdle to the {{acceptance}} of a common <b>handset</b> <b>model</b> was that audio from the receiver was picked up acoustically by the transmitter and amplified, resulting in howling tones, called acoustic feedback, due to the hollow handles providing an acoustic channel between receiver and transmitter. The problems were aggravated by the signal boosting circuitry used in the subscriber set {{which resulted in a}} strong signal (sidetone) at the receiver of the speech of the user. Sidetone is desirable only to some fraction of volume so that the user has the assurance that the telephone is working correctly. Strong sidetone may cause users to lower the voice to unacceptable levels, so that the recipient receives insufficient signal level.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, a SIM-locked handset is {{sold at a}} {{substantially}} lower price than an unlocked one, because the service provider expects income through its service. SIM locks are employed on cheaper (pay-as-you-go) handsets, while discounts on more expensive handsets require a subscription that provides guaranteed income. Unlocked handsets have a higher market value, even more so if they are debranded. Debranding involves reflashing or replacing the firmware to remove the operator logo or any limitations or customisations that have been imposed on the handset by the operator, and is usually accomplished with software designed for a particular <b>handset</b> <b>model,</b> however most smart-phones can be debranded and unlocked solely with use of special software.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{numerical}} simulation and measurements of three-dimensional radiation patterns of a mobile <b>handset</b> <b>model</b> {{in the presence}} of a human head phantom were performed at 1800 MHz. Based on theoretical and experimental results, the influence of the human head on the radiation efficiency of the handset has been investigated as a function of the handset size and the distance between the head and the handset during its operation. Furthermore, the relative amount of the electromagnetic power absorbed in the head has been obtained. It was found that significant reduction of the absorbed power (about 50 %) with proportional increment of the handset radiation efficiency could be achieved by moving the phone for 1 cm only away from the head. Agreement between theoretical and experimental results was found to be very good...|$|E

40|$|We {{document}} {{the evolution of}} product innovation and features in the mobile telephone handset market. We distinguish between two types of product innovation: vertical and horizontal innovation.

For horizontal product characteristics, some horizontal innovations remained differentiated, whereas others were adopted in all new <b>handset</b> <b>models,</b> thus forming a dominant design in horizontal product features. We explain this pattern using the concept of dominant design and results from the theoretical literature on the incentives for horizontal and vertical differentiation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} home testing of the inTouch system, a video link designed specifically for people with dementia to use. Iterative, user centered design of four user interaction models was carried out at a day centre.

This model was developed into a fully working prototype and tested in two home trials, linking two households together over domestic broadband connections. The recruitment of participants for home testing proved to be a significant challenge with no single reason being given for declining or not continuing. Two in-home evaluations of the system were carried out; the system was perceived as easy to use and participants could see the potential benefits, such as being reassured about each other’s wellbeing, and enjoyed engaging visually. The poor reliability of existing broadband connections in the homes was a significant limitation to gathering data within the trials.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{determining}} factors for the pricing of handsets sold with service plans, using the hedonic price method. This was undertaken by building a database comprising 48 <b>handset</b> <b>models,</b> under nine different service plans, over a period of 53 weeks in 2008, and resulted in 27 different attributes and a total number of nearly 300, 000 data registers. The results suggest that the value of monthly subscriptions and calling minutes are important to explain the prices of handsets. Furthermore, both the physical volume and number of megapixels of a camera had an effect on the prices. The bigger the handset, the cheaper it becomes, and the more megapixels a camera phone has, the more expensive it becomes. Additionally, it was found that in 2008 Brazilian phone companies were subsidizing enabled data connection handsets...|$|R

This new <b>handset</b> design is <b>modeled</b> and simulated using a finite difference time-domain (FDTD) -based platform SEMCAD. The proposed handset {{is based on}} a current commercially available bar-phone type with a curvature shape, keypad positioned above the screen, and top-mounted antenna. The specific absorption rates (SARs) are determined computationally in the specific anthropomorphic mannequin (SAM) and anatomically correct model of a human head when exposed to the EM-field radiation of the proposed cellular handset and the handset with top-mounted antenna. The two cellular handsets are simulated to operate at both GSM standards, 900 [*]MHz as well as 1800 [*]MHz, having different antenna dimensions and intput power of 0. 6 [*]W and 0. 125 [*]W, respectively.

50|$|In the U.S. the FCC {{requires}} that all carriers meet certain criteria for supporting location-based services (FCC 94-102). The mandate requires 95% of handsets to resolve within 300 meters for network-based tracking (e.g. triangulation) and 150 meters for handset-based tracking (e.g. GPS). This {{can be especially}} useful when dialing an emergency telephone number - such as enhanced 9-1-1 in North America, or 112 in Europe - so that the operator can dispatch emergency services such as emergency medical services, police or firefighters to the correct location. CDMA and iDEN operators have chosen to use GPS location technology for locating emergency callers. This led to rapidly increasing penetration of GPS in iDEN and CDMA handsets in North America {{and other parts of}} the world where CDMA is widely deployed. Even though no such rules are yet in place in Japan or in Europe the number of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA <b>handset</b> <b>models</b> is growing fast.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to simplify the {{exchange}} (in both directions) of multimedia content between mobile phones and network attached web servers. The solution proposed in this report specifically concerns displaying Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) messages via a web browser connected to a network-attached web server and graphically authoring MMS messages via a web interface. This thesis project {{is important because it}} brings multimedia content, in the form of MMS messages, from isolation in the telecommunication world closer to wide availability via the Internet. This transition is very important as the Internet is where media is shared with the world today. This approach brings added value to end users who want to share content generated using their phone on a web site. It also provides added value to operators who want {{to increase the amount of}} MMS traffic in their networks. The solution is non-trivial because there are a number of complexities at both ends. This is because the MMS messages that are authored at mobile phones differ between both <b>handset</b> <b>models</b> and manufacturers. Moreover, the format used for MMS (MMS SMIL) is not widely used on the Internet, thus a transformation to an Internet browser supported format must be performed.

40|$|Finland {{has been}} a forerunner in mobile {{communications}} for years. However, the situation has changed and the competition has become extremely tough.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} mobile payments {{market is}} expected to have reached “$ 171. 5 billion as a total in 2012, with a 61. 9 % increase compared to 2011 ” and a constant annual forecasted growth of 42 % until 2016 according to (Christy, 2012, para. 1). In this fast growing market, there are two major categories identified, according to (Cluckey, 2011, p. 1) : proximity and remote payments. For the mobile proximity case, NFC is a technology that has seen a tremendous hype in the last years. However, barcode and QR code are also relevant and are addressed in the analysis section as well. NFC is a set of wireless standards based technology, that functions in short distance radio frequency identification (RFID) of approximately 4 inches and that can be applied in areas from simple data transfers to payments, by replacing credit card, according to (Hasoo, Lee, & Heekuck Oh, 2013). The same source mentions that the protocol is extremely secure, by granting privacy of the user and in the same time enabling personalized services, fact seen as very suitable for its usage in mobile payments services. Thus, in mobile proximity payments, NFC is a set of standards that enable device-to-device communication between mobile phones and other pieces of equipment, such as POS terminals. The thesis focuses mainly on NFC “self-organized” phone-based schemes, (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p. 2), owned by players such as Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer that are looking forward to enter the market from outside and thus cause disruption in relation to the already existing initiatives, the “operator-driven ones” (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p. 2), where the banks and MNOs take the lead together. In the current thesis, the concept of the operator-driven models is extended to that of collaboration models(Smart Card Alliance, 2008), referred here as the collaborative models. These type of models are already working according to the functional standardized “four corners card payment working model” (LLC, 2010, p. 1) and have the banks as leaders in network in charge of payments, and the mobile network operators, responsible for storing the payment credentials in the mobile handsets. According to (LLC, 2010), the four corners card payment model links the buyer and the merchants through their issuing and acquiring banks, by making use of the card schemes companies (ex. Visa, MasterCard, Maestro). Thus, these so called “disruptive or insurgent players” (Jan Ondrus & Lyytinen, 2011,p. 2) have different organizational models compared to what is considered the traditional, reference one, in their attempt to step in the in-store payment by making use of NFC or other proximity payments technologies. Thus, companies such as Google, PayPal, and A Handset Manufacturer might find themselves in a position to exploit at maximum their resources and chose suitable strategies in relation to the other actors to gain support for initiatives and so reach success, by giving a high value for the network they are part of. Taking into account this problem, the research question to be answered is the following: What kind of network strategies should new-coming players in the mobile proximity payment market Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer deploy in relation to the most relevant actors in their networks, in order to ensure their successfulness in the international market? For answering the research question, the author has created a theoretical framework that is applied to reach the research objective. It is important to emphasize that when referring to strategies, the researcher refers to certain manners the owners of the three disruptive ecosystems should treat the relation with the most important actors in their network in order to obtain support and obtain “multiple sourcing” for their models (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p. 41). That is why he names them “network strategies”. For this, {{it should be noted that}} the researcher considers that the more support in the network an owner of a certain value proposition has, the higher the chances for reaching success are. That is because he views success mainly from the perspective of the value delivered inside the value network. That means that certain “blocking parties” or parties with “diffuse power position” (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p. 40 - 41) should be dealt with in such a manner that more support is built with them and blockage is avoided. On the other hand, parties with “production power” should be kept close to the value proposition and involved in key decisions and benefits sharing. In order to measure the potential success of the disruptors and, based on that, derive the degree of successfulness of the strategies, the researcher has created a successfulness indicator, based on a network approach. This indicator measures success by taking into account the roles of the most important actors in the network (ex. how many supporters, blockers). The research approach taken to solve the problem is that of comparative analysis, between the roles that the most important actors (ex. banks, MNOs, card payment scheme) have in the new entrants’ ecosystems (Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer) vis-à-vis their considered, static roles in the collaborative, traditional, operator-centric model. The latter is used as a reference, because it is considered in this research as the traditional, established model of performing mobile payments, as being based on the already standardized four corners model. In addition, all the critical parties seem to align their interests and thus increase the value for the all network in this case, thus labeling this model as Highly successful. As this latter model is considered a reference, it is the change in roles for the most important actors in the three disruptive networks compared to it that is relevant for giving insights regarding successfulness and then right network strategies that should be recommended. In order to be able to gather information about the case studies analyzed and then clarify the roles of the parties and then also quantify success, the researcher makes use of a business model based on platform theory called VISOR. For the collaborative model, the researcher uses a simple stakeholder analysis. As a manner of gathering data, the researcher has performed two sets of interviews. The first set was focused on gathering information about the business models of the disruptors and of the collaborative case. For this, he retrieved information from 7 consultants working for THE CLIENT, as well as consulting specialized materials about mobile payments. The second set of interviews was used in order to clarify the roles of the most important actors (ex. banks, card payment schemes and banks), by involving 7 experienced experts belonging to the entire mobile payments field. This set of interviews was recorded, transcribed and coded. The conclusions of the research are that Google scores “Low” as successfulness potential, PayPal “Low towards Medium”, whereas A <b>Handset</b> Manufacturer’s <b>model</b> is labeled as “High”. This is placed in the context where the reference, the collaborative model, is also labeled as High. That justification of these results is given by the fact that whereas Google has 3 major blockers and no supporters in its network on its Google Wallet’s product and PayPal has only 2, but still no major supporters, A <b>Handset</b> Manufacturer’s <b>model</b> is backed by 3 strong parties and 2 that seem possible to be activated. Thus, the researcher argues that the network strategies of A Handset Manufacturer’s are potentially more successful than Google’s and PayPal’s. Google is advised to bring banks and card payments schemes closer to the Google Wallet initiative, PayPal to strengthen the relationship with the banks for its close loop mobile in-store payment <b>model,</b> whereas A <b>Handset</b> Manufacturer’s should continue to focus on the relationship with the banks and build scale.
