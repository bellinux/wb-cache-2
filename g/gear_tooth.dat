50|$|In form milling, {{the cutter}} called a form cutter travels axially {{along the length}} of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> at the {{appropriate}} depth to produce the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth.</b> After each tooth is cut, the cutter is withdrawn, the gear blank is rotated, and the cutter proceeds to cut another tooth. The process continues until all teeth are cut.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{spalling}} of the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> {{surface was}} studied. It {{was concluded that}} there did not exist any contact fatigue dehiscence in the gear through macroscopic analysis, microstructure analysis and morphology of incision analysis. The main reason of the dehiscence spalling in the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> was the presentation of fissuary. The fissuraing expanded and developed under the alternating stress to the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> surface layer spalling.

Examination of the engine revealed that the #2 cylinder connecting rod had failed in overload. A small piece of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> was found inside the engine and it exhibited evidence of fatigue failure modes. The loose <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> was free {{to move through the}} engine cavity and initiate other failures. Probable cause was total failure engine connecting rod.|$|E
50|$|The AA80E (Aisin TL-80SN) {{becomes the}} world's first eight-speed {{automatic}} transmission. Smaller parts, a hydraulic circuit with fewer components allow the transmission {{to maintain the}} same size as the previous LS 430's unit. The aluminum die-cast case is 10% lighter, yet 30% more rigid, even with two additional gears and a 22% greater torque capacity the new transmission weighs 95 kg or 10% more than the previous unit. With new micro-laser technology <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> production tolerances have been reduced 50%. Aluminum has also replaced steel on <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surfaces. Shift times are as low as 350 milliseconds or 41% faster than the previous LS 430's six-speed auto.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cylindrical}} <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> profile {{corresponds to}} an involute, whereas the bevel <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> profile is an octoid.All traditional bevel gear generators (such as Gleason, Klingelnberg, Heidenreich & Harbeck, WMW Modul) manufacture bevel gears with an octoidal tooth profile.IMPORTANT: For 5-axis milled bevel gear sets {{it is important}} to choose the same calculation / layout like the conventional manufacturing method.Simplified calculated bevel gears on the basis of an equivalent cylindrical gear in normal section with an involute tooth form show a deviant tooth form with reduced tooth strength by 10-28% without offset and 45% with offset Hünecke, TU Dresden.Furthermore, those [...] "involute bevel gear sets" [...] causes more noise.|$|E

40|$|A {{planetary}} gear system includes a sun gear coupled to an annular ring gear through a plurality of twist-planet gears, a speeder gear, and a ground structure having an internal ring gear. Each planet gear includes a solid gear having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur gear which includes vertical <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur gear which includes helical <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> that are offset from the vertical <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> and which contact helical <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> on the speeder gear and helical <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> on the outer ring gear. One half of the twist planet gears are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet gear seats against the sun gear, the outer ring gear, the speeder gear, and the inner ring gear. The resulting configuration is an improved stiff anti-backlash gear system...|$|R

5000|$|The {{cycloidal}} gear profile {{is a form}} of toothed gear used in mechanical clocks, rather than the involute gear form used for most other gears. The <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> profile is based on the epicycloid and hypocycloid curves, which are the curves generated by a circle rolling around the outside and inside of another circle, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{way to measure}} {{torsional}} vibration is the approach of using equidistant pulses over one shaft revolution. Dedicated shaft encoders as well as <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> pickup transducers (induction, hall-effect, variable reluctance,etc.) can generate these pulses. The resulting encoder pulse train is converted into either a digital rpm reading or a voltage proportional to the rpm.|$|E
50|$|As {{the teeth}} of the {{rotating}} wheel (or other target features) pass by the face of the magnet, the amount of magnetic flux passing through the magnet and consequently the coil varies. When the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> is close to the sensor, the flux is at a maximum. When the tooth is further away, the flux drops off. The moving target results in a time-varying flux that induces a proportional voltage in the coil. Subsequent electronics are then used to process this signal to get a digital waveform that can be more readily counted and timed.|$|E

30|$|As the {{existence}} of manufacturing errors, the quasi-static engagement process of mating <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> will be not identical with the ideal one. The contact regions will come into contact earlier or later, and overloading or contact loss of mating <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> will occur in some engagement positions, which will affect mesh stiffness significantly in different loading conditions, and influence the dynamic behaviors of gear system.|$|R
50|$|The {{valvetrain}} {{features a}} number of innovations: friction reducing roller swing arm, hydraulic lash adjusters which ensure proper clearances between the valve stem and roller swing arm, which significantly reduce valve tapping noise. The valve springs feature a beehive shape and smaller retainer. The reduced weight and spring load further help lower friction and improve fuel economy. The valvetrain is driven by a silent-type, maintenance free steel timing chain that replaces a roller-type timing chain: The optimized design greatly reduces impact forces and noise when the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> and chain engage.|$|E

5000|$|There is an 8.9" [...] {{diameter}} Dana 44 {{ring and}} pinion that {{is very different from}} the standard Dana 44. This {{ring and pinion}} is significantly stronger with a better pinion to ring <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> contact patch and angle. It was typically used in the back of jeep JKs, Isuzus and Nissan pickups. This ring and pinion does share some components and can be adapted into an earlier Dana 44 but requires some work, different bearings and spacers. The benefit is the larger ring gear, better angle cut on the teeth and Dana 60 diameter pinion shaft.|$|E

50|$|By 1896 Fellows had fully {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth. Upon the completion of each <b>gear</b> <b>tooth,</b> the gear blank was indexed to a new position to mill the next tooth, which could lead to problems in accurate spacing of gear teeth and the shaping of the individual teeth. Fellows conceived a method whereby the gear cutter, which was itself a gear with hardened cutting edges, and gear blank revolved together as if they were a pair of gears. This process required no intermediate template or other type of mechanical guide for shaping the gear. Hobbing has become the preferred approach to manufacturing spur gears and helical gears.|$|E
50|$|The most {{remarkable}} mechanical improvement was arguably the traction motors {{used on the}} new locomotives. They were known as bipolar motors, because each of the locomotive's 12 motors had only two field poles, mounted directly to the locomotive frame beside the axle. The motor armature was mounted directly on the axle, providing an entirely gearless design. This design was almost entirely noiseless, as it eliminated not only <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> growl, but also the whine of higher-RPM electric motors typically used in standard nose-mounted applications. The EP-2s were not the first electric locomotives to use bipolar motors, which had first been designed by Asa F. Batchelder for the New York Central S-motors over a decade earlier, {{but at the time}} they were the largest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{workpiece}} mounts on a rigid, box-shaped {{table in}} front of the machine. The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram. Table motion may be controlled manually, but is usually advanced by an automatic feed mechanism acting on the feedscrew. The ram slides back and forth above the work. At {{the front end of the}} ram is a vertical tool slide that may be adjusted to either side of the vertical plane along the stroke axis. This tool-slide holds the clapper box [...] and tool post, from which the tool can be positioned to cut a straight, flat surface on the top of the workpiece. The tool-slide permits feeding the tool downwards to deepen a cut. This adjustability, coupled with the use of specialized cutters and toolholders, enable the operator to cut internal and external <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> ...|$|E
