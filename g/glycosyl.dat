25|$|Glycosyltransferases {{have been}} widely used in the both {{targeted}} synthesis of specific glycoconjugates as well as the synthesis of differentially glycosylated libraries of drugs, biological probes or natural products in the context of drug discovery and drug development (a process known as glycorandomization). Suitable enzymes can be isolated from natural sources or produced recombinantly. As an alternative, whole cell-based systems using either endogenous <b>glycosyl</b> donors or cell-based systems containing cloned and expressed systems for synthesis of <b>glycosyl</b> donors have been developed. In cell-free approaches, the large-scale application of glycosyltransferases for glycoconjugate synthesis has required access to large quantities of the <b>glycosyl</b> donors. On the flip-side, nucleotide recycling systems that allow the resynthesis of <b>glycosyl</b> donors from the released nucleotide have been developed. The nucleotide recycling approach has a further benefit of reducing the amount of nucleotide formed as a by-product, thereby reducing the amount of inhibition caused to the glycosyltransferase of interest – a commonly observed feature of the nucleotide byproduct.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} <b>glycosyl</b> {{transfer}} {{can be a}} carbohydrate, glycoside, oligosaccharide, or a polysaccharide. Some glycosyltransferases catalyse transfer to inorganic phosphate or water. <b>Glycosyl</b> transfer can also occur to protein residues, usually to tyrosine, serine, or threonine to give O-linked glycoproteins, or to asparagine to give N-linked glycoproteins. Mannosyl groups may be transferred to tryptophan to generate C-mannosyl tryptophan, which is relatively abundant in eukaryotes. Transferases may also use lipids as an acceptor, forming glycolipids, and even use lipid-linked sugar phosphate donors, such as dolichol phosphates.|$|E
25|$|Rhamnolipids are a {{class of}} {{glycolipid}} produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, amongst other organisms, frequently cited as the best characterised of the bacterial surfactants. They have a <b>glycosyl</b> head group, {{in this case a}} rhamnose moiety, and a 3-(hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acid (HAA) fatty acid tail, such as 3-hydroxydecanoic acid.|$|E
25|$|All {{cells have}} {{proteins}} {{attached to their}} membranes, often serving {{as a mode of}} communication or signaling between the cell and the surrounding environment. These signaling proteins are physically attached to the cell membrane in various ways, commonly anchored by glycolipids such as <b>glycosyl</b> phosphatidylinositols (GPI). PNH occurs {{as a result of a}} defect in the assembling of these glycolipid-protein structures on the surface of blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Ludwik Hirszfeld and E. von Dungern {{discovered}} the heritability of ABO blood groups in 1910–11. Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of multiple alleles at one locus in 1924. Watkins and Morgan, in England, {{discovered that the}} ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B-type. After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent {{the majority of the}} antigens. The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin. Later, Yamamoto's group showed the precise <b>glycosyl</b> transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.|$|E
2500|$|Glycosyltransferases (GTFs, Gtfs) are enzymes (EC 2.4) that {{establish}} natural glycosidic linkages. They catalyze {{the transfer}} of saccharide moieties from an activated nucleotide sugar (also known as the [...] "glycosyl donor") to a nucleophilic <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor molecule, the nucleophile {{of which can be}} oxygen- carbon-, nitrogen-, or sulfur-based.|$|E
2500|$|Glycosylation (see also {{chemical}} glycosylation) is {{the reaction}} in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a <b>glycosyl</b> donor, {{is attached to a}} hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced: ...|$|E
50|$|Other glycosidation {{methods are}} Fischer glycosidation, use of <b>glycosyl</b> acetates, thioglycosides, <b>glycosyl</b> trichloroacetimidates, <b>glycosyl</b> {{fluorides}} or n-pentenyl glycosides as <b>glycosyl</b> donors, or intramolecular aglycon delivery.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} armed and {{disarmed}} <b>glycosyl</b> donors {{refers to the}} increased reactivity of benzylated over benzoylated <b>glycosyl</b> donors, a phenomenon observed very early, and which originates from the greater electron-withdrawing capability of ester blocking groups over ether blocking groups. However, it was Bertram Fraser-Reid who realised that benzylated <b>glycosyl</b> donors can be activated when benzoylated are not, and invented the terms armed <b>glycosyl</b> donor to the former and disarmed <b>glycosyl</b> donor to the latter. He and his group showed that armed <b>glycosyl</b> donors could be coupled onto a <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor, {{that at the same}} time was a disarmed <b>glycosyl</b> donor, without self-coupling of the disarmed donor/acceptor. This methodology allowed him to perform a one-pot synthesis of a trisaccharide via the O-pentenyl method.|$|E

50|$|The {{glycosylation}} reaction {{involves the}} coupling of a <b>glycosyl</b> donor and a <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor via initiation using an activator under suitable reaction conditions.|$|E
50|$|CAZy {{identifies}} evolutionarily related {{families of}} <b>glycosyl</b> hydrolases using the classification introduced by Bernard Henrissat. As of 2012 CAZy contains 131 families of <b>glycosyl</b> hydrolase families. These families {{are given a}} number to identify them, so for example <b>Glycosyl</b> hydrolase family 1 contains enzymes that possess a TIM barrel fold. These families are clustered into 14 different clans that share structural similarity. CAZy contains 94 families of <b>Glycosyl</b> transferase enzymes, 22 families of polysaccharide lysases and 16 families of carbohydrate esterases.|$|E
50|$|Glycosylamines are a {{class of}} {{biochemical}} compounds consisting of a <b>glycosyl</b> group attached to an amino group, -NR2. They are also known as N-glycosides, as they are a type of glycoside. <b>Glycosyl</b> groups {{can be derived from}} carbohydrates. The <b>glycosyl</b> group and amino group are connected with a β-N-glycosidic bond, forming a cyclic hemiaminal ether bond (α-aminoether).|$|E
50|$|Dolichyl β-D-glucosyl {{phosphate}} is {{a molecule}} involved in glycosylation. It is a polyprenyl <b>glycosyl</b> phosphate having dolichol as the polyprenyl component and β-D-glucose as the <b>glycosyl</b> component.|$|E
50|$|Glycosylation of {{an alcohol}} using a <b>glycosyl</b> halide as a <b>glycosyl</b> donor and a mercury salt as {{promoter}} (cf the Koenigs-Knorr reaction, which uses silver salts as promoters).|$|E
5000|$|The {{glycosidic bond}} is formed from a <b>glycosyl</b> donor and a <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor. There are {{four types of}} glycosidic {{linkages}}: 1, 2-trans-α, 1, 2-trans-beta, 1, 2-cis-α, and 1, 2-cis-beta linkages. 1, 2-trans glycosidic linkages can be easily achieved by using 2-O-acylated <b>glycosyl</b> donors (neighboring group participation). To prevent the accumulation of the orthoester intermediates, the glycosylation condition should be slightly acidic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Fischer glycal synthesis was the {{reductive elimination}} with zinc of a <b>glycosyl</b> halide. This <b>glycosyl</b> halide was formed from a monosaccharide starting material. Some other synthetic routes include: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{concept has}} been {{extended}} to superarmed <b>glycosyl</b> donor by Mikael Bols and his collaborators. He realised that hydroxylic functional groups of carbohydrates are less electron-withdrawing toward the anomeric center when they are axial than equatorial, which means that <b>glycosyl</b> donor conformers with more axial oxy functions are more reactive. Protection of a <b>glycosyl</b> donor with bulky silyl groups (tert-butyldimethylsilyl or triisopropyl) cause it to change conformation to a more axial-rich conformation that, as a consequence, is more reactive, which Bols and his groups called superarmed. They showed that a superarmed donor can be coupled to an armed <b>glycosyl</b> donor/acceptor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glycosyl</b> iodides {{were first}} {{introduced}} {{for use in}} glycosylation reactions in 1901 by Koenigs and Knorr although were often considered too reactive for synthetic use. Recently several research groups have shown these donors to have unique reactive properties and can differ from other <b>glycosyl</b> chlorides or bromides with respect to reaction time, efficiency, and stereochemistry. <b>Glycosyl</b> iodides may be made {{under a variety of}} conditions, one method of note is the reaction of a 1-O-acetylpyranoside with TMSI.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of “arming” and “disarming” <b>glycosyl</b> donors lies in their synthetic use. By disarming the <b>glycosyl,</b> a selective coupling can be achieved. The disarmed {{portion of the}} disaccharide can then be armed through selective deprotection. The disaccharide can then be coupled to a disarmed sugar. This process can be repeated {{as many times as}} necessary to achieve an efficient synthesis of a desired oligosaccharide with minimal loss of material to undesired coupling. This can be especially useful in “one-pot” synthetic methods. In these methods, multiple sugars are added to the reaction mixture. One of the sugars is armed as the <b>glycosyl</b> donor, and reacts quickly with a <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor. The non-reducing sugar then acts as a <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor as a protecting group that is easily lost in solution reveals a free hydroxyl group. This reacts with a donor that was disarmed, forming the oxocarbenium ion at a slower rate, producing the desired trisaccharide.|$|E
50|$|A {{modified}} silicon tethering method involves {{mixing of}} the <b>glycosyl</b> donor with the <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor and dimethyl dichloro silane {{in the presence}} of imidazole to give the mixed silaketal in one pot. Activation of the tethered intermediate then leads to the β-glycoside product.|$|E

50|$|A <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor: is any {{suitable}} nucleophile-containing molecule {{that will}} react with a <b>glycosyl</b> donor {{to form a}} new glycosidic bond. By convention, the acceptor is the member of this pair which did not contain the resulting anomeric carbon of the new glycosidic bond. Since the nucleophilic atom of the acceptor is typically an oxygen atom, this can be remembered using the mnemonic of the acceptor is the alcohol. A <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor can be a mono- or oligosaccharide that contains an available nucleophile, such as an unprotected hydroxyl.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>glycosyl</b> donor, a leaving {{group is}} {{required}} at the anomeric position. The simplest leaving {{group is the}} OH group that is naturally present in monosaccharides, but it requires activation by acid catalysis in order to function as leaving group (in the Fischer glycosylation). More effective leaving groups are in general used in the <b>glycosyl</b> donors employed in chemical synthesis of glycosides. Typical leaving groups are halide, thioether, or imidate, but acetate, phosphate, and O-pentenyl are also employed. The natural <b>glycosyl</b> donors contain phosphate as leaving group.|$|E

50|$|Oligosaccharides have diverse structures. The {{number of}} monosaccharides, ring size, the {{different}} anomeric stereochemistry, {{and the existence}} of the branched-chain sugars all contribute to the amazing complexity of the oligosaccharide structures. The essence of the reducing oligosaccharide synthesis is connecting the anomeric hydroxyl of the <b>glycosyl</b> donors to the alcoholic hydroxyl groups of the <b>glycosyl</b> acceptors. Protection of the hydroxyl groups of the acceptor with the target alcoholic hydroxyl group unprotected can assure the regiochemical control. Additionally, factors such as the different protecting groups, the solvent, and the glycosylation methods can influence the anomeric configurations. This concept is illustrated by an oligosaccharide synthesis in Scheme 1. Oligosaccharide synthesis normally consists of four parts: preparation of the <b>glycosyl</b> donors, preparation of the <b>glycosyl</b> acceptors with a single unprotected hydroxyl group, the coupling of them, and the deprotection process.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of asparagine-linked glycoproteins utilizes a dolichyl diphosphate-linked <b>glycosyl</b> donor.|$|E
50|$|To act as <b>glycosyl</b> donors, those monosaccharides should {{exist in}} a highly {{energetic}} form. This {{occurs as a result}} of a reaction between nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) and <b>glycosyl</b> monophosphate (phosphate at anomeric carbon). The recent discovery of the reversibility of many glycosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions calls into question the designation of sugar nucleotides as 'activated' donors.|$|E
50|$|A <b>glycosyl</b> donor is a {{carbohydrate}} mono- or oligosaccharide {{that will}} react with a suitable <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor {{to form a}} new glycosidic bond. By convention, the donor is the member of this pair that contains the resulting anomeric carbon of the new glycosidic bond. The resulting reaction is referred to as a glycosylation or chemical glycosylation.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the Koenigs-Knorr {{reaction}} {{refers to}} the use of <b>glycosyl</b> chlorides, bromides and more recently iodides as <b>glycosyl</b> donors. The Koenigs-Knorr reaction can be performed with alternative promoters such as various heavy metal salts including mercuric bromide/mercuric oxide, mercuric cyanide and silver triflate. When mercury salts are used, the reaction is normally called the Helferich method.|$|E
50|$|A {{chemical}} glycosylation reaction {{involves the}} coupling of a <b>glycosyl</b> donor, to a <b>glycosyl</b> acceptor forming a glycoside. If both the {{donor and acceptor}} are sugars, then the product is an oligosaccharide. The reaction requires activation with a suitable activating reagent. The reactions often result {{in a mixture of}} products due {{to the creation of a}} new stereogenic centre at the anomeric position of the <b>glycosyl</b> donor. The formation of a glycosidic linkage allows for the synthesis of complex polysaccharides which may play important roles in biological processes and pathogenesis and therefore having synthetic analogs of these molecules allows for further studies with respect to their biological importance.|$|E
