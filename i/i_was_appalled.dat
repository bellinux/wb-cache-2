5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
500|$|While Vicky {{was close}} with her eldest daughter, this changed {{as the girl}} grew older; {{by the time she}} was two years old, Charlotte had become known as [...] "sweet naughty little Ditta" [...] and would prove to be the most {{difficult}} of the family's eight children. As a young girl, she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation, such as pulling at her clothes. An early habit of biting her nails led to preventative measures like the forced wearing of gloves, but any methods only provided temporary relief. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter, [...] "tell Charlotte <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> to hear of her biting her things. Grandmamma does not like naughty little girls". In 1863 the Crown Princess recorded in her diary that Charlotte's [...] "little mind seems almost too active for her body – she is so nervous & sensitive and so quick. Her sleep is not so sound as it should be – and she is so very thin". Charlotte developed violent tantrums, to her mother's displeasure; Vicky described them as [...] "such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that she screams blue murder". The young girl was also underweight and had a troublesome digestion.|$|E
2500|$|Carl states that: [...] "It was she [...] who {{introduced}} me to science fiction and fantasy in general and Tolkien in particular." [...] and [...] "Recently I re-read my first published fantasy novels. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> to discover I'd used several Tolkien-esque phrases — quite unconsciously, as {{so much of his}} prose is now lodged deep in my subconscious." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{have watched}} {{particularly}} the chaos {{in my own}} state of Anambra where a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the brazenness of this clique and the silence, if not connivance, of the Presidency." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus was {{momentum}} {{gained in}} the Younger World. But we were without this momentum. We were just getting started, {{and we could}} not go far in a single generation. We were without weapons, without fire, and in the raw beginnings of speech. The device of writing lay {{so far in the}} future that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> when <b>I</b> think of it.|$|R
5000|$|He twice {{refused the}} Nigerian honour Commander of the Federal Republic, in 2004 and 2011, saying:"I have watched {{particularly}} the chaos {{in my own}} state of Anambra where a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the brazenness of this clique and the silence, if not connivance, of the Presidency." ...|$|R
60|$|Of course, {{from the}} nature of our business, Pinkerton could do a thing of that kind at a figure {{extremely}} reduced; for all that, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at the extravagance, and said so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it {{suggested}} to me words one night; it poured a strain which I {{could have written}} down, only <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled,</b> and dared not rise to seek pencil and paper by the dim watch-light.|$|E
6000|$|... "Too much {{is written}} by the men who can't write about the men who do write," [...] Martin concurred. [...] "Why, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at the {{quantities}} of rubbish written about Stevenson and his work." ...|$|E
60|$|Personally <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the {{destruction}} already {{done in the}} world in the past seven years. I doubt if any untravelled American can realize how much of Europe is already broken up. I do not think many people realize how swiftly Europe is still sinking, how urgent it is to get European affairs put back upon a basis of the common good if civilization is to be saved.|$|R
60|$|Poor fellow! Little we both {{thought that}} before very long he himself... However, I {{could give him}} no comfort. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather <b>appalled</b> myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "when I {{first went}} out to the prairie, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost <b>appalled.</b> Everything <b>was</b> so crude and barbarous--but you know the country." ...|$|R
60|$|I, who, {{in view of}} Schultz's psychology, {{knew how}} true that must be, admit that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled.</b> So this was how a perfidious destiny took {{advantage}} of a generous impulse! And I felt as though I were an accomplice in this perfidy, since I did {{to a certain extent}} encourage Jasper. Yet I had warned him as well.|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at {{the price}} French Frank had paid--eighty cents. EIGHTY CENTS! It was an outrage to my thrifty soul. Eighty cents--the {{equivalent}} of eight long hours of my toil at the machine, gone down our throats, and gone like that, in a twinkling, leaving only a bad taste in the mouth. There was no discussion that French Frank was a waster.|$|E
60|$|As I say, I was {{not afraid}} to meet my own death, there, {{a few hundred yards}} to leeward; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at the thought that Maud must die. My cursed {{imagination}} saw her beaten and mangled against the rocks, and it was too terrible. I strove to compel myself to think we would make the landing safely, and so I spoke, not what I believed, but what I preferred to believe.|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said [...] "I {{was deeply}} {{shocked to learn}} of the bomb blasts in Karachi that have killed over a hundred people and injured so many others. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by this horrific use of {{violence}} against entirely innocent people...On behalf of the British Government please accept my sincerest condolences for those Pakistanis {{who have lost their}} lives. You can be assured of the United Kingdom's continuing support to work with all those committed to building a peaceful and democratic Pakistan" ...|$|R
60|$|Mingled with my anxiety, {{which was}} real, was an exultation {{that would not}} down. Nevertheless, the idea of {{developing}} Tom into a Shakespeare,--Tom, who had not the slightest desire to <b>be</b> one <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalling,</b> besides having in it an element of useless self-sacrifice from which I recoiled. On the other hand, if Alonzo should discover that I had written his theme, there <b>were</b> penalties <b>I</b> did not care to dwell upon.... With such a cloud hanging over me I passed a restless night.|$|R
2500|$|She {{subsequently}} {{was dropped}} by Squatty Potty {{as a marketing}} spokesperson. On May 31, 2017, CNN fired her from its New Year's Eve broadcast with Anderson Cooper. CNN {{said in a statement}} prior to announcing her termination, [...] "We found what she did disgusting and offensive. We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down." [...] Cooper said, [...] "For the record, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; when my {{eyes were}} once opened to the festering sin and misery around, when I saw the evil nourished at my own door by my neglect, and {{perceived}} that those dependent on me were doomed to degradation and oppression that I might gratify my craving for art,--then, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled!</b> Those paintings and statues seemed to cry out to me that human souls had been sacrificed to them! The toil and devotion of a life would be too little to atone! Oh! that it were more able and effective. Means and judgment go but a little way!' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{lifted me}} out of my sheets (<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> to {{discover}} my weakness), and bundled me with tender care in a dozen shawls and blankets. My feet were thrust into two pairs of heavy woollen stockings, and Dorothy bound her own silk kerchief at my throat, whispering anxious questions the while. And when her mother and mammy went from the room, her arms flew around my neck in a passion of solicitude. Then she ran away to dress for the journey, and in a surprising short time was back again, with her muff and her heavy cloak, and bending over me to see if I gave any signs of failure.|$|E
6000|$|In {{after years}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at the audacity of that schedule, and I think I had the grace {{to be scared}} at the time, but I swung into it recklessly. Tickets had been taken {{by some of the}} best known men among the teachers, and I was assured by Mrs. Payne that we would have the most {{distinguished}} audience that ever graced Hyde Park. [...] "Among your listeners will be the literary editors of several Boston papers, two celebrated painters, and several well-known professors of oratory," [...] she said, and like Lieutenant Napoleon called upon to demonstrate his powers, I graved with large and ruthless fist, and approached my opening date with palpitating but determined heart.|$|E
5000|$|As a Latina {{and a new}} American citizen, I {{believe in}} this country and its people, and I believe that we need more than just [...] "change." [...] We need a leader who can bring about the right kind of change, and John McCain has the {{experience}} and judgment necessary to lead us in these uncertain times. I grew up in Cuba and Venezuela, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> that Barack Obama apparently wants to emulate the [...] "spread the wealth" [...] economic policies of those countries and negotiate with their leaders.|$|R

6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the night, Betsey and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>appalled</b> by a {{tremendous}} knocking on the wall. I threw on a dressing-gown and made for the door, while Betsey felt for the matches. As I opened a crack of the door, Charlie's voice was to be heard, 'Yes, yes; I'll get you some, sir. You'll be better presently,' interspersed with heavy groans; then, seeing me wide awake, he begged that Betsey would go down and get some hot water--'and mustard,' called out a suffering voice. 'Oh, those chops!' ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at his expression. A look of {{contempt}} was now {{added to his}} acute, penetrating gaze. [...] "I have been mistaken," [...] he said slowly; [...] "I had not allowed for your weakness and cowardice! I thought too highly of you even in your guilt! But I see now why you tampered with that drawer the other night. By some inexplicable means--possibly another theft--you took the cigar case out of pawn and, like a whipped hound, restored it to me in this feeble, clumsy fashion. You thought to deceive me, Hemlock Jones! More, you thought to destroy my infallibility. Go! I give you your liberty. I shall not summon the three policemen who wait in the adjoining room--but {{out of my sight}} forever!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} this time that the {{warnings}} of coming events began to fall about us thick and fast. Ernest had already questioned father's policy of having socialists and labor leaders at his house, and of openly attending socialist meetings; and father had only laughed at him for his pains. As for myself, I was learning much from this contact with the working-class leaders and thinkers. I was seeing {{the other side of}} the shield. I was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism I encountered, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> by the vast philosophic and scientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me. I was learning fast, but I learned not fast enough to realize then the peril of our position.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at this declaration, {{which seemed}} to {{threaten}} a long continuance, and a dangerous termination, of my captivity. I deemed it best, however, to show some spirit, {{and at the same}} time to mingle a tone of conciliation. 'Mr. Herries,' I said '(if I call you rightly by that name), let us speak upon this matter without the tone of mystery and fear in which you seem inclined to envelop it. I have been long, alas! deprived of the care of that affectionate mother to whom you allude--long under the charge of strangers--and compelled to form my own resolutions upon the reasoning of my own mind. Misfortune--early deprivation--has given me the privilege of acting for myself; and constraint shall not deprive me of an Englishman's best privilege.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There! There! Don't talk of it. The {{first time}} I saw him, <b>I,</b> too, <b>was</b> <b>appalled.</b> They cried me down. We were always telling each other, 'Oh! you mustn't mind his appearance.' And {{then he was}} always ready to kill. There was no doubt of it. He killed--yes! in both camps. The fiend...." ...|$|R
5000|$|Thiokol {{management}} initially supported its engineers' {{recommendation to}} postpone the launch, but NASA staff opposed a delay. During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>appalled.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by your recommendation." [...] Mulloy said, [...] "My God, Thiokol, when {{do you want me}} to launch — next April?" [...] NASA believed that Thiokol's hastily prepared presentation's quality was too poor to support such a statement on flight safety. One argument by NASA personnel contesting Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed, the secondary O-ring would still seal. This was unproven, and was in any case an argument that did not apply to a [...] "Criticality 1" [...] component. As astronaut Sally Ride stated when questioning NASA managers before the Rogers Commission, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a [...] "Criticality 1" [...] component.|$|R
6000|$|After the Supervisor {{had rolled}} {{himself in the}} blanket, long after all sounds had ceased in the tent, there still {{remained}} for the youth a score of manifold excitations to wakefulness. Down on the lake the muskrats and beavers were at their work. Nocturnal birds uttered uncanny, disturbing cries. Some animal with stealthy crackling tread was ranging the hillside, and {{the roar of the}} little fall, so far from lulling him to sleep--as he had imagined it would--stimulated his imagination till he could discern in it the beat of scurrying wings and the patter of pernicious padded feet. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the wilderness now, what would it seem to me <b>were</b> <b>I</b> alone!" [...] he whispered.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Silence! If {{you make}} a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my {{shoulder}} and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You {{may as well be}} quiet. It is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I suppose it {{is a part of the}} horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!" [...] Her husband groaned again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on.|$|E
60|$|Monday, April 13th.--This {{morning was}} chill, and, worse, it was showery, {{so that our}} {{purposes}} to see York were much thwarted. At about ten o'clock, however, we took a cab, {{and drove to the}} cathedral, where we arrived while service {{was going on in the}} choir, and ropes were put up as barriers between us and the nave; so that we were limited to the south transept, and a part of one of the aisles of the choir. It was dismally cold. We crept cheerlessly about within our narrow precincts (narrow, that is to say, in proportion to the vast length and breadth of the cathedral), gazing up into the hollow height of the central tower, and looking at a monumental brass, fastened against one of the pillars, representing a beruffed lady of the Tudor times, and at the canopied tomb of Archbishop de Grey, who ruled over the diocese in the thirteenth century. Then we went into the side aisle of the choir, where there were one or two modern monuments; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> to find that a sermon was being preached by the ecclesiastic of the day, nor were there any signs of an imminent termination. I am not aware that there was much pith in the discourse, but there was certainly a good deal of labor and earnestness in the preacher's mode of delivery; although, when he came to a close, it appeared that the audience was not more than half a dozen people.|$|E
5000|$|Photojournalist Kevin Carter was {{the first}} to {{photograph}} a public execution by necklacing in South Africa in the mid-1980s. He later spoke of the images: [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at what they were doing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at what I was doing. But then people started talking about those pictures... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do.|$|E
5000|$|On {{occasion}} he also {{attempted to}} force votes on issues {{he was concerned}} with, such as the motion for increasing assistance to the unemployed on 25 March 1958:"I wish to state that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> at the callous indifference of the Parliamentary Secretary... The statement {{that there is no}} money to give these unfortunate people a further increase will be regarded by decent Christian people as a downright lie. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still convinced that, with any kind of honest effort, the lot of the poorer sections of our people could be improved. The unemployed and the old age pensioners will continue to press for elementary Christian justice. I have asked, and I now repeat my request, for a free vote of the House on this issue." ...|$|R
60|$|Altogether a {{depressing}} day of rain-splatter and wash of water across the deck. I can see, now, {{that the problem}} of sailing a ship with five thousand tons of coal around the Horn is more serious than I had thought. So deep is the Elsinore in the water that she is like a log awash. Her tall, six-foot bulwarks of steel cannot keep the seas from boarding her. She has not the buoyancy one is accustomed to ascribe to ships. On the contrary, she is weighted down until she is dead, so that, for this one day alone, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> at the thought of how many thousands of tons of the North Atlantic have boarded her and poured out through her spouting scuppers and clanging ports.|$|R
40|$|At a point {{halfway through}} this {{institute}} {{and at the}} commencement of the second evening session, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> at the problem of making my contribution intellectually stimulating as well as entertaining. I cannot regard my paper as {{something other than a}} watershed. Earlier ones have stressed the history of the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and its place in the North American scene, while <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> invited to survey somewhat wider horizons (with apologies to the North American continent) in the shape of British use and influence, with what <b>I</b> trust will <b>be</b> a suitable appendix on the European scene. My own direct involvement with DDC is relatively recent, although I have a professional relationship which goes back to the twelfth edition.
