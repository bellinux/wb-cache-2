These ions were prepared by collisional <b>deiodonation</b> of protonated iodoanilines previously generated by chemical ionization (CI) or even better by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) conditions. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations were also used to probe the protonation of aniline and halogeno-anilines, X-C 6 H 4 -NH 2 (X = F, Cl, Br and 1) and the relative stabilities of ionized aniline and its distonic radical cation isomers. Proton affinities (PAs) of anilines at nitrogen and carbon sites were found rather dependent on the nature and {{the position of the}} substituents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Biochemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. This {{dissertation}} {{brings to}} the fore the “Characterization of the SULT 1 A 1 polymorphism in a South Africa Tswana population group. ” The primary experimental group studied came from South African homogeneous Tswana individuals who participated voluntarily in an ongoing large-scale epidemiological Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study the North-West University (Potchefstroom Campus) participates in, {{as one of the}} 16 low- middleand high-income countries across the world. The primary aspect investigated was the comprehensive profile of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variation (CNP) of the SULT 1 A 1 gene. Using the PCRbased RFLP method, SULT 1 A 1 genotypes, and allele frequency distributions in an experimental group of 1 867 individuals were determined. According to the literature this is by far the largest and most homogeneous group from which such information has been acquired to date. The SULT 1 A 1 * 1, SULT 1 A 1 * 1 /* 2 and SULT 1 A 1 * 2 genotypes were found to be present at a percentage of 43. 76, 47. 12 and 9. 11 respectively. In comparison to similar studies in other population groups, results from this study indicate that there are ethnic differences in the SULT 1 A 1 genotypes incidence. Asian group differs from Caucasian and Tswana groups because of its exceptionally high prevalence of individuals with the SULT 1 A 1 * 1 genotype and a very low incidence of the SULT 1 A 1 * 2 genotype. The SULT 1 A 1 * 1 genotype profiles of Caucasian and Tswana groups were comparable, but notable differences were observed for the SULT 1 A 1 * 2 genotype. Using a quantitative multiplex PCR method for the CNV study, the numbers of copies of the SULT 1 A 1 gene in the Tswana population were determined, and the results showed 1 to ~ 5 copies: only 0. 65 % of the subjects had a single copy, whereas 59. 69 % of the subjects had 3 or more copies. This result shows a significant discrepancy between the Caucasian-American samples, which showed that only 26 % from that group had more than three copies. However, there is a significant relationship with the African-American population, which presented 63 % with 3 or more copies. This finding confirms results from a much smaller African-American study, and suggests a possible genetic link between the African Tswana and the heritage of the African-Americans. These findings were submitted for publication to the South African Journal of Science, as that journal specializes in publication of new knowledge that has a regional focus on Africa. Simultaneous phenotypic consequences of the SNP and CNP of the SULT 1 A 1 gene, as well as the thermo-stable and thermo-labile forms of the sulfotransferases were determined. For this, the formation of [35 S]- 4 -nitrophenyl sulphate from 4 -nitrophenol and [35 S]- 3 ’-phosphoadenosine- 5 ’-phosphosulfate ([35 S]-PAPS) in platelet homogenates were measured, with the data normalized to a common platelet count. This investigation required fresh blood for enzyme activity. These samples came from 98 Caucasian subjects who voluntarily participated {{in this part of the}} study. The experimental data presented a unique challenge to develop a statistical model to accommodate the complexity of the distribution of the data in the phenotype and genotype components, which could be achieved by the development of a mixed model. The model indicated that product formation increased through increasing copy number, but did not differ for SULT 1 A 1 * 1 and SULT 1 A 1 * 1 /* 2. However, the rate of increase in product for the thermo-stable forms of the SULTs was greater than that of thermo-labile forms. In contrast, copy number effect for SULT 1 A 1 * 2 differed considerably from that of the other two genotypes. Since genotype is also a significant factor, it was concluded from Tukey post-hoc tests that the population group means for product formation differ significantly (for all levels). These results are presently being prepared for publication in an accredited international journal. Finally, perturbations in 23 biochemical parameters measured in the PURE study were analyzed as a function of the SULT 1 A 1 SNP and CNP were evaluated. No group separation in this regard could be found. It could be shown however, that sulfonation of the iodothyronines, which are endogenous substrates for the SULTs, was influenced by the SULT 1 A 1 genotype. The relative concentrations in plasma of the sulphonated iodothyronines may be expressed as T 2 S > T 3 S >> T 4 S, which coincides with the substrate preference of the SULT 1 A 1 enzymes. This observation may, however, only be qualitatively interpreted as (1) the targeted metabolomics mass spectrometric method used for the quantitative analysis of these substances needs further development, and (2) the influence of <b>deiodonation</b> was not taken into account in these studies. In conclusion, three perspectives are given at the end of the thesis which might be considered for further investigations. Doctora...|$|E
