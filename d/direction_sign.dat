2500|$|From 1989-2005, signage on {{motorways}} {{was nearly}} identical to that on UK motorways (but see new motorway signage, below); although in Ireland, motorway junctions were not always numbered, or the number was not always signposted. The sign at the actual exit, which in the UK shows the road number to be reached, {{was replaced by a}} flag sign with the destination instead. On the M50, in the case of junctions with national routes, the initial advance <b>direction</b> <b>sign</b> was replaced with a list of destinations for that national route. [...] The 1989 design of signs can still be seen on older sections of the M4 and M7.|$|E

5000|$|The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals {{divides the}} direction, position, or {{indication}} <b>sign</b> category into <b>direction</b> <b>signs,</b> which are only those giving distances or directions {{to a given}} location; road identification signs (also known as [...] "reassurance signs"), which repeat the name or number of the road, and place identification signs, which give {{the name of a}} landmark, such as a town, river or border. Unlike the other classes of <b>sign,</b> <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> remain broadly undefined by the convention; the only restrictions given are that <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> must be either a rectangle or an arrow shaped pentagon, and that they may not contain placenames in more than two languages. Additionally, <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> on motorways must be blue or green, while temporary <b>direction</b> <b>signs</b> are yellow or orange.|$|R
