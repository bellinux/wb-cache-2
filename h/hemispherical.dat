5|$|Resonant {{oscillations}} of spherical and <b>hemispherical</b> liquid drop: The {{technique is}} based on measuring the resonant frequency of spherical and <b>hemispherical</b> pendant droplets driven in oscillations by a modulated electric field. The surface tension and viscosity can be evaluated from the obtained resonant curves.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis is a {{tripartite}} lichen—containing a fungus, a green alga, and a cyanobacterium. Cephalodia (lichenized aggregations of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria) {{are present}} on the primary thallus; smaller cephalodia {{are also on the}} pseudopodetia. <b>Hemispherical</b> to irregularly shaped, and light to dark brown in color, they contain species from the genus Nostoc. The green algal photosynthetic symbiont (photobiont) associated with P.acicularis is Asterochloris magna (formerly Trebouxia magna).|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily <b>hemispherical</b> in shape and {{partially}} or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large <b>hemispherical</b> masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of Lepidoptera {{are usually}} rounded and small (1mm) {{though they may}} be as large as 4mm in the case of Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others <b>hemispherical,</b> conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are barrel-shaped or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or blemished.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and deeply pitted; some were of a roughly <b>hemispherical</b> shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These deeply pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|The History of Roman and Byzantine domes {{traces the}} {{architecture}} of domes throughout the ancient Roman Empire and its medieval continuation, today called the Byzantine Empire. Domes were important architectural elements in both periods and had widespread influence on contemporary and later styles, from Russian and Ottoman architecture to the Italian Renaissance and modern revivals. The domes were customarily <b>hemispherical,</b> although octagonal and segmented shapes are also known, and they developed in form, use, and structure over the centuries. Early examples rested directly on the rotunda walls of round rooms and featured a central oculus for ventilation and light. Pendentives became common in the Byzantine period, provided support for domes over square spaces.|$|E
5|$|The first {{philosophical}} cosmologists reacted against, {{or sometimes}} built upon, popular mythical conceptions that had {{existed in the}} Greek world for some time. Some of these popular conceptions can be gleaned from the poetry of Homer and Hesiod. In Homer, the Earth {{was viewed as a}} flat disk afloat on the river of Oceanus and overlooked by a <b>hemispherical</b> sky with sun, moon, and stars. The Sun (Helios) traversed the heavens as a charioteer and sailed around the Earth in a golden bowl at night. Sun, earth, heaven, rivers, and winds could be addressed in prayers and called to witness oaths. Natural fissures were popularly regarded as entrances to the subterranean house of Hades and his predecessors, home of the dead.* K. Algra, The Beginnings of Cosmology, 45 Influences from other cultures always afforded new themes.|$|E
5|$|Trials {{conducted}} using a conventional, powered C-47, first conducting ordinary deadstick landings, then being towed by another C-47, {{indicated that the}} scheme was feasible. Therefore, a C-47-DL was taken in hand for conversion into a glider, which was given the designation XCG-17. The aircraft, formerly a Northwest Airlines DC-3 that had been impressed into military service {{at the start of}} World War II, was modified by the removal of the aircraft's engines; the nacelles, containing the landing gear, remained in place, covered with aerodynamically profiled <b>hemispherical</b> domes for streamlining, containing fixed weight to compensate for the removal of the engines. Other equipment, no longer necessary with the conversion to an unpowered configuration, was also removed to save weight; items removed included the aircraft's wiring and bulkheads, along with the navigator's and radio operator's positions.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as <b>hemispherical</b> bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6–10cm (2.5–4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). The cap is initially <b>hemispherical</b> before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. The cap margin is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the cap margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of Sarcodon imbricatus. The gills are free (unattached to the stalk), white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may {{the top of the}} stalk when broken. With age, the gill edges can become jagged and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100–120 gills extend fully from the stalk {{to the edge of the}} cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to cap margin).|$|E
5|$|The solar {{magnetic}} field extends {{well beyond the}} Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's {{magnetic field}} into space, forming {{what is called the}} interplanetary magnetic field. In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite <b>hemispherical</b> polarities {{on either side of the}} solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral. The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50–400μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5nT, about a hundredtimes greater. The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.|$|E
25|$|The lens used in <b>hemispherical</b> {{photography}} is generally a circular fisheye lens, {{such as the}} Nikkor 8mm fisheye lens. Full-frame fisheye lenses are not suitable for <b>hemispherical</b> photography, as they only capture a full 180° across the diagonal, and do not provide a complete <b>hemispherical</b> view.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hemispherical</b> {{resonator}} gyroscope (HRG), {{also called}} wine-glass gyroscope or mushroom gyro, makes using a thin solid-state <b>hemispherical</b> shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused-quartz structures {{that surround the}} shell. Gyroscopic effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural standing waves.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hemispherical</b> domes. Byzantine {{churches were}} always crowned with simple <b>hemispherical</b> domes. Sometimes, {{as in the}} Theotokos Orans (Our Lady of the Sign) church in Vilnius, they {{featured}} a small curvilinear pointed top {{at the base of}} a cross, otherwise the cross was mounted directly at the flattened apex of the dome. Onion domes and tented roofs of vernacular Russian architecture were ruled out; they remained exclusive features of Russian Revival architecture sponsored by Alexander III, and were considerably heavier and more expensive than domes of the same diameter.|$|E
25|$|Each gallery {{ends with}} a small chapel, which lies {{respectively}} above the prothesis and diaconicon. Both chapels are surmounted by <b>hemispherical</b> domes which are built directly above the pendentives.|$|E

25|$|A masonry dome {{produces}} thrusts {{down and}} outward. They are thought of {{in terms of}} two kinds of forces at right angles from one another. Meridional forces (like the meridians, or lines of longitude, on a globe) are compressive only, and increase towards the base, while hoop forces (like the lines of latitude on a globe) are in compression {{at the top and}} tension at the base, with the transition in a <b>hemispherical</b> dome occurring at an angle of 51.8 degrees from the top. The thrusts generated by a dome are directly proportional to the weight of its materials. Grounded <b>hemispherical</b> domes generate significant horizontal thrusts at their haunches.|$|E
25|$|Photograph {{registration}} involves aligning {{the photographs}} with the <b>hemispherical</b> coordinate system used for analysis, {{in terms of}} translation (centering), size (coincidence of photograph edges and horizon in coordinate system), and rotation (azimuthal alignment with respect to compass directions).|$|E
25|$|In {{other species}} like the African shield bug (Calidea panaethiopica), the dorsal cuticle {{is dotted with}} tiny {{regularly}} spaced <b>hemispherical</b> cavities. The depressions act like Bragg mirrors. When light hits the pitted surface, it gives off multiple reflections resulting in the distinctive two tone yellow-blue iridescence.|$|E
25|$|The cup nest is {{smoothly}} <b>hemispherical</b> inside, {{with a deep}} depression {{to house}} the eggs. Most are made of pliable materials—including grasses—though a small number are made of mud or saliva. Many passerines and a few non-passerines, including some hummingbirds and some swifts, build this type of nest.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} {{detonation}} produces energies over 100keV (~109 K temperatures), suitable {{not only for}} nuclear fusion, but other higher-order quantum reactions as well. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centered and focused <b>hemispherical</b> implosions to generate neutrons from D–D reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved {{to be in a}} predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium and oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere. In brief, PETN solid explosive is used to form a <b>hemispherical</b> shell (3–6mm thick) in a 20-cm diameter <b>hemispherical</b> cavity milled in a massive steel chamber. The remaining volume is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center. The arrival of the detonation wave at the spherical surface instantly and simultaneously fires the explosive liner. The detonation wave in the explosive liner hits the metal cavity, reflects, and implodes on the preheated burnt gases, focuses {{at the center of the}} hemisphere (50microseconds after the initiation of the exploding wire) and reflects, leaving behind a very small pocket (1mm) of extremely high-temperature, high-pressure and high-density plasma.|$|E
25|$|While historians {{agree on}} {{the color of the}} 16th-century domes, their shape is disputed. Boris Eding wrote that they most likely were of the same onion shape as the present-day domes. However, both Kolomenskoye and Dyakovo churches have {{flattened}} <b>hemispherical</b> domes, and the same type could have been used by Barma and Postnik.|$|E
25|$|The new {{basilica}} {{was begun}} as a single-naved church, {{like that of}} St Francis of Assisi, with an apsidal chancel, broad transepts and two square nave bays roofed with <b>hemispherical</b> domes like that of San Marco, Venice. The exterior style is a mixing of mainly Romanesque and Byzantine elements, with some Gothic features.|$|E
25|$|The current {{structural}} temple, {{built and}} renovated {{many times in}} the period 8th-17th century, gave rise to a hybrid indigenous style that is sometimes called the Nilachal type: a temple with a <b>hemispherical</b> dome on a cruciform base. The temple consists of four chambers: garbhagriha and three mandapas locally called calanta, pancharatna and natamandira aligned from east to west.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{imposing}} appearance, {{the diameter}} {{is in fact}} a little less than that of the Pantheon, a factor which led to considerable criticism of the architect. The interiors are richly decorated in a pure Neoclassical style with groups of statues by Pompeo Marchesi and frescoes by Angelo Inganni. The impressive <b>hemispherical</b> dome has a coffered ceiling.|$|E
25|$|These {{plants are}} {{adapted to the}} tough {{environmental}} conditions on the volcano, such as high altitude, intense sunlight, extreme temperature variations, and lack of moisture. Adaptations include <b>hemispherical</b> forms, a downy or waxy cover, a reduction of the exposed leaf area, and a high flower production. Flowering {{takes place in the}} late spring or early summer, in May and June.|$|E
25|$|Functions of two {{variables}} {{were provided by}} three-dimensional cams. In one good design, one of the variables rotated the cam. A <b>hemispherical</b> follower moved its carrier on a pivot axis parallel {{to that of the}} cam's rotating axis. Pivoting motion was the output. The second variable moved the follower along the axis of the cam. One practical application was ballistics in gunnery.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, the three-litre engine had a {{cast iron}} block, an {{aluminium}} head with <b>hemispherical</b> combustion chambers, two valves per cylinder, angled 90° and timed by directly acting, chain driven dual overhead camshafts. Fed by a twin-choke carburettor, it developed , {{sent to the}} rear wheels through a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox with a column-mounted shifter as on the 6C 2500.|$|E
25|$|Renaissance style places {{emphasis}} on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts {{as they are}} demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, {{as well as the}} use of semicircular arches, <b>hemispherical</b> domes, niches and aedicules replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings.|$|E
25|$|The Crusades, {{beginning}} in 1095, {{also appear to}} have influenced domed architecture in Western Europe, particularly in the areas around the Mediterranean Sea. The Mausoleum of Bohemond (c. 1111-18), a Norman leader of the First Crusade, was built next to the Basilica of San Sabino in the southern Italian province of Apulia and has a <b>hemispherical</b> dome in a Byzantine style over a square building with a Greek cross plan.|$|E
