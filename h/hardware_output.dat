40|$|ABSTRACT: Recursive Least Square (RLS) {{algorithm}} which recursively {{find the}} filter coefficients that minimises a weighted linear least square cost function. Recent digital transmission systems impose {{the application of}} channel equalizers with short training time and high tracking rate. These requirements turn our attention to adaptive algorithms, which converge rapidly. The demand for fast convergence and less MSE level cannot be met by conventional adaptive filtering algorithms such as LMS. The best choice is the block recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. Block Recursive Least Squares algorithms are known to exhibit better performances. In this paper we present a simple architecture {{for the implementation of}} a variant of Block RLS algorithm where the weight updation and error calculation are both calculated block wise.

40|$|Least Mean Square (LMS) {{algorithm}} is undoubtedly the most resorted to algorithm in diverse fields of engineering.

The algorithm performs considerably well with a slight trade off in the learning curve time and misadjustment, both of which can be adjusted by varying the step size depending on the requirement. The architecture can be further modified to perform the variants of LMS algorithm such as sign-sign, signerror and sign-data algorithms.

40|$|Abstract — This work {{is part of}} {{a project}} that aims to develop and operate {{integrated}} evolvable hardware systems using unconstrained evolution. Experiments are carried out on an evolvable hardware platform featuring both combinatorial and registered logic as well as sequential feedback loops. In {{order to be able to}} accurately assess the transient output of the system and at the same time speed up evolution, new fitness evaluation methods are introduced. These bitwise and hierarchical fitness evaluation methods are adapted and further developed specifically for hardware implementation. It is shown that the newly developed approaches are particularly powerful in coping with two important issues: computational ambiguities, which generally occur when evaluating binary strings, and transient effects resulting from measuring <b>hardware</b> <b>output.</b> On two combinatorial problems it is shown that the new fitness functions improve the performance of evolution and allow stable solutions to be found more reliably.

30|$|The {{valve lift}} is read {{directly}} into the gas turbine controller. The pilot gas valve position is changed by the valve lift controller of the pilot gas. Both valves have electro-hydraulic actuators which are operated via two <b>hardware</b> <b>outputs</b> to the two coils of the electro-hydraulic actuators. Undesirable compressor operation is prevented via the compressor pressure ratio limit controller (also known as π controller). The function of the cool air limit controller is to rule out mode of operations, which leads to inadequate flow of cooling air to the turbine blades. The system exhausted temperature is being controlled by the IGVs by varying the air mass flow into the combustion chamber. Exhausted temperature is measured immediately downstream of the gas turbine via 24 triple-element thermocouples (MBA 26 CT 101 A/B/C to MBA 26 CT 124 A/B/C) placed around the surroundings of the exhaust diffuser. All B and C signals from the 24 triple-element thermocouples are {{used to calculate the}} mean turbine outlet temperature. These IGVs signal is influenced, in such a way, by two signals: one from the exhausted temperature control and the other from the compressor pressure ratio limit controller (Daewoo E&C, Siemens 2009 Approval).
