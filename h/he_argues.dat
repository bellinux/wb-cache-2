5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{folly of}} the First World War as {{a choice of}} policy; <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> {{that the costs of}} modern war, direct and indirect, predictably {{exceeded}} the benefits of eliminating the Hohenzollerns.|$|E
5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection. Such language, <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E
60|$|He {{could in}} every action show Some sin, and nobody could doubt him. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> high, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> low, <b>He</b> also <b>argued</b> round about him.|$|R

5|$|Democratic transhumanists, such as American {{sociologist}} James Hughes, {{counter that}} many influential {{members of the}} United States Establishment are bioconservatives strongly opposed to human enhancement, as demonstrated by President Bush's Council on Bioethics's proposed international treaty prohibiting human cloning and germline engineering. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that {{across the}} world, cannibals {{are viewed as}} {{non-human}} entities, committing acts that no human would ordinarily perpetrate. In this way they were akin to various non-human species of animal, and Arens notes that in some societies, cannibals are believed to physically transform into different species in order to kill and consume humans.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>argued</b> {{that in all}} {{countries}} and times, the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>argued</b> {{that science}} {{does not use}} {{induction}}, and induction {{is in fact a}} myth. Instead, knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism. The main role of observations and experiments in science, <b>he</b> <b>argued,</b> is in attempts to criticize and refute existing theories.|$|R
2500|$|In 1922, William Jennings Bryan {{published}} In His Image, {{in which}} <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that Darwinism was both irrational and immoral. On the former point, {{he pointed to}} examples such as the eye, which <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> could not be explained by Darwinian evolution. On the latter point, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that Darwinism advocated the policy of [...] "scientific breeding" [...] or eugenics, by which the strong were to weed out the weak, a policy that directly contradicts the Christian doctrine of charity to the helpless.|$|R
5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E
5|$|Sweden {{receives}} Booth's strongest criticism, where consumerist influences are {{blamed for}} the apparent downfall of the Nordic model of social democracy and recurrent failures of the Swedish justice system. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that Sweden, with its strict rules of social etiquette, has a strong culture of conformity.|$|E
5|$|A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair is a 2003 book by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, {{previously}} {{the author}} or Hitler's Willing Executioners (1996). Goldhagen examines the Roman Catholic Church's {{role in the}} Holocaust, and offers a review of scholarship in English addressing what <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> is antisemitism {{throughout the history of}} the Church, which he claims contributed substantially to the persecution of the Jews during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Rowe's {{defense was}} {{noted by the}} Miami Herald, when <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> {{that it was not}} a {{question}} of prostitution, but rather that there had been no coercion of any kind. Since prostitution in Australia was legal, <b>he</b> <b>argued,</b> the case was [...] "much ado about nothing." ...|$|R
50|$|In his {{philosophical}} work <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> for personalism.|$|R
50|$|On 13 February 2015, Kahraman {{attended}} a career's {{day at a}} girls' school in Rize. In his speech, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that students should avoid turning to fashion and instead be faithful and devout. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that students should {{follow the example of}} President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's mother, Tenzile Erdoğan.|$|R
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|Fairman {{discusses}} {{the efforts of}} conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts {{are opposed to the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fairman warns against a tendency toward self-censorship. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E
50|$|Koerbagh {{described}} the Bible and dogmas like the Trinity and the divine nature of Christ as only {{the work of}} men. Also, like his contemporary Baruch de Spinoza, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that God is identical with nature and that nothing exists outside of nature. Therefore, <b>he</b> <b>argued,</b> natural science, not theology, was the real theology of the world. In his views about the secularization of the Republic of the Netherlands and the limitation of ecclesiastical powers, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that religion is irrational and only maintains its position through deception and violence.|$|R
50|$|In Blakey's first {{appearance}} before the United States Supreme Court, he filed a brief {{on behalf of the}} Attorneys General of Massachusetts and Oregon and the National District Attorneys Association in the case of Berger v. New York (1967), which dealt with wiretapping. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> on behalf of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation in what became Holmes v. SIPC (1992); <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> on behalf of pro-life activist Joseph Scheidler in what became Scheidler v. National Organization for Women (2006), and <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> on behalf of the beneficiaries of insurance policies in what became Humana, Inc. v. Forsyth (1999).|$|R
50|$|On February 22-27, 1819, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> {{before the}} United States Supreme Court in the McCulloch v. Maryland case {{as part of}} the defense counsel. In this case <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> against Daniel Webster, {{speaking}} directly after him, and specifically his idea of equating taxation with the power to destroy. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> strongly for States' rights: claiming a United States Bank Branch was unconstitutional based on the prohibition of congress to delegate power, a co-equal taxation power between the federal and state governments, the enumerated nature of {{the federal government and the}} reserved powers of the states (declared in the 10th amendment).|$|R
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>argued</b> {{that all}} {{separation}} agreements should be binding, {{whether they are}} made before a marriage, after it, or once the marriage has already deteriorated. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that the case for recognising prenuptial agreements has strengthened since {{it has come to}} be accepted that both parties to a marriage are to be treated equally.|$|R
5000|$|The Republican Minority Leader, John Boehner (R-Ohio), {{opposed the}} {{legislation}} from its introduction. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that the DISCLOSE Act violated the First Amendment {{and that the}} bill is a scheme {{on the part of}} the majority to silence their opponents. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that the legislation had fallen victim to back-room deals and special interest exemptions: ...|$|R
5000|$|Mosley {{detected}} a linear growth within British history {{and he saw}} Europe a Nation as the culmination of this destiny. Therefore, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that it was [...] "part of an organic process of British history", as Britain had united into one nation <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that it was Britain's national destiny to unite the whole continent.|$|R
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
5|$|Published {{partially}} {{in response}} to Dissenting clergyman Richard Price's sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and primogeniture. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that citizens {{do not have the}} right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.|$|E
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E
25|$|Also in {{this book}} <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> for the {{expropriation}} of unused land.|$|R
