40|$|Purpose – To expand beyond {{existing}} {{research on the}} integration of supply chain and new product development that has a limited focused {{on the need to}} pre-inform supply chain before product launch, the need for new product development to consider the impact of product design on supply chain operations and research has focused on <b>ensuring</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> at the <b>product</b> launch. Design/methodology/approach – This research note suggests avenues forward and areas for practice and research to progress. Findings – The existing and limited focus on involving supply chain in new product development overlooks several central issues and opportunities that companies are beginning to explore and that can be supported by research. In particular the opportunity to focus on leveraging supply chain in new product development, for greater market impact and revenue growth. Practical implications – Addressing the path forward, beyond limited approaches requires greater alignment between new product development and supply chain, it requires a focus that goes beyond just <b>ensuring</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> and it requires alignment much further upstream in the new product development process. Examples of early progress in companies are provided. Originality/value – In addition to summarizing {{existing research}}, new avenues for research and practice are offered that can tremendously improve alignment and the contribution of supply chain on new product development, {{for the good of the}} company as a whole. Specific research areas are suggest to enable research to support the realization of the path forward in this area...|$|R
30|$|Dynamics in the SC {{can arise}} from order oscillations, {{seasonality}} or minimum order quantities and {{may result in}} a bullwhip effect [50, 85]. <b>Ensuring</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> at <b>product</b> launch can also create internal dynamics within an SC, especially if a significant proportion of demand is expected at or shortly after product launch and thus needs to be pre-produced and distributed thereby maintaining a short time to market [41]. This phenomenon is known as pipeline filling, which is defined as the production and distribution of a product prior to product launch in order to <b>ensure</b> sufficient <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> across all stocking points at the launch date, i. e., at a time when product demand is fostered by strong marketing campaigns [72]. During pipeline filling activities, all stocking points are filled with a major portion of the expected annual demand before the product is actually launched in the marketplace. In this early phase of the PLC, production capacity demand strongly differs from market demands of finished products. As a result, the capacity requirements or inventory levels during the more static maturity phase of the PLC can be up to 60  % lower than during the highly dynamic product launch phase (see Fig.  1).|$|R

40|$|The nineties have {{witnessed}} substantial progress in {{supply chain management}} with many organizations realizing that supply chain initiatives have increased their competitiveness, reduced inventory, and improved their ability to meet customer demand. The challenges in managing supply chains are to <b>ensure</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> {{and the ability to}} respond to market signals through accurate demand forecasts. Global competitiveness, faster product development, shorter product life and recent advances in information technology have placed increasing attention on the development of better approaches to manage supply chains. In this research, we model a multi-stage supply chain network representing a typical manufacturing/distribution environment made up of stores, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities. The stores sell different product types and replenish them from distribution centers. Customer orders arrive at the stores and are satisfied from the available on-hand inventory. Daily review of inventory is employed at all echelons in this study. If the inventory level falls below a predetermined level, orders are placed to bring it up to its target level. A similar inventory control activity is maintained at the distribution centers. Production at the plants is carried out on an order by order basis.

Twizza enjoyed huge success between the years 2010 - 2014 as a medium to large sized manufacturer of carbonated soft drinks in the Eastern Cape. In light of this, the current study seeks to answer the following: What business level strategy did top management at Twizza adopt to compete and grow in the BoP market in the Eastern Cape, South Africa? The study takes the form of a case study to explore and understand the patterns of decisions adopted by Twizza’s top management in competing at the bottom of the pyramid. As such, the main objective of the study was to identify the business level strategy adopted by Twizza which enabled their superior performance within the BoP market. The study adopts Porter`s typology to explore business level strategy. Stratified, purposive sampling was used to identify 4 top managers as participants in this study. A total of 7, semi-structured, interviews were used to collect critical incidents from top management of Twizza. This was the primary data used in this study. This type of data was combined with relevant information which was gathered via published press articles and on-line commentary. The study found that central to Twizza’s business strategy were four pillars, namely, strict control and management of manufacturing costs, product quality equal to that of market leaders, the ability of the organisation to manufacture its own raw materials and ability to <b>ensure</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> to the market to the market. These findings reveal that Twizza employed a hybrid strategy, anchored by cost leadership.

40|$|Two and a {{half years}} after the {{emergence}} of the first pandemic influenza virus of the 21 st century, we are certain there is space for improvement in the area of preparedness, and thus for mitigation. The persistence of a dogmatic approach for controlling factors underlying the emergence of influenza virus strains that are capable of both jumping the species barrier and spreading among human populations has produced negative outcomes. Such consequences range from mistrust of public health authorities to the delayed availability of vaccines. For this reason, our prediction skills must be improved, and the first step in this direction {{is to be able to}} comprehensively analyze the pandemic potential of animal influenza viruses. Paradoxically, we have the dataset, but we just do not look at it with the appropriate tools and mindset. What we need is a “One Flu ” approach. This approach includes the development of a permanent observatory (either virtual or physical), including analytic tools that can identify and grade animal strains that fulfill some or all the requisites of a pandemic virus before the virus becomes a problem in humans. This would enable us to have a library of “potentially pandemic ” strains which can be used as seeds for vaccine manufacture to <b>ensure</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> in a shorter period of time. The creation of an interdisciplinary data library requires an ongoing and timely mechanism to ensure transparency between the veterinary and medical communities on genetic and epidemiological data, which are routinely collected through surveillance efforts worldwide; such a library is in line with the “One Health ” vision. This interdisciplinary approach would pave the way for similar methodologies applicable to other emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases, thus complementing other efforts in the fields of preparedness, response, and mitigation...|$|E

In the US, 45 % of all pregnancies are either mistimed or unwanted. Mishaps with contraceptives, such as condom breakage, missed pills, incorrect timing of patch or vaginal ring application, contraceptive nonuse, forced intercourse, and other circumstances, place women {{at risk of}} unintended pregnancy. There is a critical role for emergency contraception (EC) in preventing those pregnancies. There are currently three methods of EC available in the US. Levonorgestrel EC pills have been available with a prescription for over 15 years and over-the-counter since 2013. In 2010, ulipristal acetate EC pills became available with a prescription. Finally, the copper intrauterine device remains the most effective form of EC. Use of EC is increasing over time, due to wider availability and accessibility of EC methods. One strategy to expand access for both prescription and nonprescription EC products is to include pharmacies {{as a point of}} access and allow pharmacist prescribing. In eight states, pharmacists are able to prescribe and provide EC directly to women: levonorgestrel EC in eight states and ulipristal acetate in seven states. In addition to access with a prescription written by a pharmacist or other health care provider, levonorgestrel EC is available over-the-counter in pharmacies and grocery stores. Pharmacists {{play a critical role in}} access to EC in community pharmacies by <b>ensuring</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> in the inventory, up-to-date knowledge, and comprehensive patient counseling. Looking to the future, there are opportunities to expand access to EC in pharmacies further by implementing legislation expanding the pharmacist scope of practice, ensuring third-party reimbursement for clinical services delivered by pharmacists, and including EC in pharmacy education and training.

30|$|Existing {{inventory}} {{models for}} multi-customers {{are not applicable}} to pharmaceutical products for several reasons. Pharmaceutical products can be more expensive than other products to purchase and distribute, and shortages and improper use of essential medicines can have a high cost in terms of wasted resources and preventable diseases and death. Therefore, special care should be taken in pharmaceutical inventory decisions to <b>ensure</b> 100 % <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> at the right time, at the right cost, and in good condition to the right customers. The quality of health care industries strongly depends {{on the availability of}} pharmaceuticals on time. If a shortage occurs at a hospital, an emergency delivery is necessary, which is very costly and can affect the patient health. Inventory management strategies that are unsuitable for health care industries may lead to large financial losses and a significant impact on patients. Hence, inventory strategies for pharmaceutical products are more critical than those for other products. Thus, a specific inventory model is necessary to control pharmaceutical products, to save patient lives and reduce unnecessary inventory costs.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the robotics industry have given the military an opportunity to capitalize on industry's innovation. Not only has core robotics technology improved but robotics manufacturing technology has also made significant improvements. This has enabled the U.

40|$|Objectives of the Research The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the entry mode strategies of Japanese electronics manufacturers entering the Russian market and how the entry mode strategy influences the distribution strategy and the transportation route selection. Additionally the objective is to examine what other factors influence the choice of transportation route to Russia, and what are the benefits of using one route over the other. In the study three routes of the Baltic Sea are compared: Finland, the Baltic countries and St. Petersburg. Methodology The research is a qualitative single case study. Structured interviews were used for data collection, as well as other materials provided by the company and found on the company web pages. Data collection and analysis were done around the themes of market entry modes, distribution strategy and transport route selection. Findings and Conclusions The main findings of this thesis suggest that the entry mode strategies of companies operating in Russia have developed over time from non-equity to equity entry modes. Companies are finding the environment more suitable for FDI and are therefore establishing sales subsidiaries in the country. The institutional environment of Russia affects the entry modes as the factors affecting the strategies may not be the same as in the western countries. The distribution strategy closely follows the entry mode strategy, and needs to be developed as the entry mode strategy changes. Both of these strategies are guided by the tradeoffs between costs and services as well as efficiency and responsiveness. As the companies decide on an appropriate strategy, the transportation route is selected to support this strategy. Routes that offer better lead times can present companies a change to have better customer service, however reliability needs to be also considered to <b>ensure</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability.</b> On top of these, the costs are also important factors companies consider when selecting the most suitable transportation route.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the findings from}} a consumer survey that was conducted to understand the consumer characteristics and preferences for organic products in Kampala, Uganda. The survey used a mall intercept survey method to investigate consumer revealed preferences for key organic and conventional products attributes. A face-to-face interview was used {{to collect data on}} consumer preferences towards organic food attributes that reveals preference for specific organic and conventional products. The survey was conducted in two purely organic retail outlets in Kampala as well as from consumer outlets that sell conventional alongside few organic products. A sample of 228 respondents was interviewed. An empirical analysis of the factors that influenced consumption of organic products indicated: (i) that being female positively and significantly (p≤ 0. 05) influenced a consumer‟s decision on choosing an organic product. (ii) being a foreigner was associated with higher odds of being an organic consumer as compared to being of Ugandan decent; (iii) there was a positive and significant relationship (p≤ 0. 1) that consumers attached to organic product taste when purchasing; (iv) price positively and significantly (p≤ 0. 1) affected the decision to purchase an organic product; (v) organic product availability at the retail outlets positively and significantly (p≤ 0. 01) influenced a consumer‟s decision to purchase an organic product. It was therefore established that product availability increased a consumer‟s predisposition to buying organic food products; (vi) WTP for quality products was negative though significant (p≤ 0. 01). People bought organic products because they felt that they were getting a higher quality for organic products and because they perceived it as more of a quality product than the conventional food products. (vii) consumers‟ decisions to purchase organic products was influenced by their concern for the environment (p≤ 0. 05); (viii) the study revealed a positive and statistically significant (p≤ 0. 1) relationship between concern for health benefits and whether a consumer will purchase an organic product which indicated that the more consumers believed that organic foods were healthier than conventional foods or attached greater importance to the organic food product healthiness attribute when shopping, the more they were likely to buy organic food products. Drawing from key findings, the study recommends that all products aimed for the domestic market should be packaged with concise messages that appeal to the differing consumer base in terms of sensory preferences (taste); affordable pricing; appealing product appearance; <b>ensure</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> at the different retail outlets and communicate health benefits that accrue due to organic consumption. In addition, since majority of the consumers reported that they were of foreign descent and majority doubled as tourists, creation of purely organic retail shops at for example the most visited tourist destinations in the country or having organic food served on the menus would in turn help tap into the un-served tourist organic market. Furthermore, increasing foreign consumer awareness of the local certification labelling synonymous with locally grown certified organic food {{would go a long way}} in increasing consumer trust. At a policy level, the government of Uganda should promote local consumption of sustainably and locally grown organic food through enacting favorable policies for example the Uganda Organic Agriculture Policy. Besides government, NGOs and NOGAMU should increasingly consider the development of products for particular consumer categories for example supplying primary schools, secondary schools and other government institutions through government procuremen...|$|E
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 33). As a part of completion of my ‘Bachelors of Business Administration’ program, I had completed my Internship at the Human Resources Department of the ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’. The AGM & the Head of the Human Resources Department of ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ had supervised me {{with the help of}} her subordinates during this period. In this report I tried to reflect some of my observations which I had found during this internship period. During this time I had the opportunity to learn about its organizational cultures, different practices at the Human Resources Department and mainly it’s recruitment and selection process. ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ is one of the largest manufacturers of toiletries products in Bangladesh, and had started its journey in the year 1988 under the supervision of ‘Square Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ’. It’s vision is to understand each and every customers’ needs, and to satisfy those needs by providing good quality products & high level of customer service at reasonable price. It offers more than fifty five products under twenty brands and covers a wide range of categories like skin care, hair care, oral care, baby care, fabric care, scourers, male grooming and OTC. But ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ is mainly popular for its winter care products. The head office of the ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ is situated at Mohakhali, Dhaka and it has two production facilities which are located at Pabna and at Rupshi. So the Human Resources are mainly allocated in these sites of operations. But there are some other staffs who are working for the sales team throughout the country. According to the functions and nature of work ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ had divided its human resources into twelve separate departments like ‘Human Resources Department’, ‘Product Development’, ‘Production Planning and Inventory Control’ etc. ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ follows a well defined hierarchy or structure for management employees to maintain the chain of command, and it starts with the General Manager and ends with the Junior Executive. It also follows different hierarchy for it’s sales team. The organization has some strengths & opportunities and on the other hand it also has weaknesses and threats. But it is capable of moving ahead by overcoming most of the limitations. During my internship I got involved with different types of jobs, but most of them were linked with the recruitment and the selection process. It’s recruitment and selection process includes a total number of fourteen steps starting from the ‘Hiring requisition from the department’ to ‘Personal database maintain at HRIS and close recruitment’. My performance during my internship was evaluated on different criterions like the accuracy and efficiency of my work, punctuality, behavior, understanding of the nstructions, communication skills, availability, interest in learning, tidiness, formal get-up etc. Therefore I would like to give some recommendations based on my observations during this Internship program. ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ should conduct more researches for knowing customers’ perception, interests & preferences about the products, and for developing better quality products. It should take some initiatives to increase cooperation among departments, and to minimize internal conflict. It should implement more innovative marketing strategies to attract customers. It should have to take necessary step to <b>ensure</b> <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> at most of the stores. Otherwise it will keep losing revenues which it might get from a group of customers. It might think about producing some of it’s raw materials by itself which will help it to save some extra cost. As a member of the same group of companies, the HR department may take some initiatives to increase cooperative attitude of it’s employees towards other sister concerns. It should become more punctual during execution of written exam and interview sessions. It should allocate necessary time to the recruitment process. In some cases the organization had tried to save some time and tried to complete the job fast. But ultimately it failed to select and hire enough number of candidates from them. It should evaluate the candidates on the basis of the same standard. If two different group of candidates are judged on the basis of two different standard for the same vacancy or for the same position, then I think that the process get biased. It should develop compensation policies for its Interns. Now they don’t pay anything to it’s interns, but they are able to attract more talented interns by paying a good remuneration for their service. By doing this it can ensure another pool of competitive and talented candidates for it’s future recruitments. ‘Square Toiletries Ltd. ’ should provide better training facilities to it’s employees. It should design it’s training programs more thoughtfully, and should run the program according to the predetermined schedule. It should monitor and evaluate it’s employees’ performances more carefully. Some of them are not always committed to their responsibilities, and some of them are using company’s resources for their personal purposes. Though it was not possible for me to get the best outcome from this internship program due to some limitations, but it had helped me to get introduced with the organizational practices practically and helped me to learn about different issues. Unlike other organizations ‘Square Toiletries Ltd’ is also running it’s business operations besides some of the limitations, but it have huge opportunity to perform better in it’s sector. It’s recruitment policies are transparent, and it generally tries to evaluate it’s candidates fairly. But still there are some scopes for improvement, and it need to work on it.

This thesis project is conducted by collaboration of Han, Hua and Lee as a team through interviewing stakeholders, performing historical data analysis and model simulation. Hua's thesis focuses on safety stock allocation in different stages of column supply chain and Lee's thesis focuses on replenishment policy of products with consistent high demands and production policy for build-to-order products. This thesis focuses on improving <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> of <b>products</b> with relatively low demands and high variability. Due to the high uncertainty of geographical demand distribution and unbalanced on-hand inventory at major distribution centers around the world, pooling inventories into a single global distribution center is proposed to increase the company's capability to better fulfill customer requests. A single global distribution model is designed for Waters Corporation's column products to analyze the change in <b>product</b> <b>availability.</b> Further optimization on inventory using lot size-reorder point model with manufacturing lot size constraint reduces the total cost of inventory. As a result of constructing a single global distribution center, the <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> can be improved to 100 % for products with current <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> of 70 % or higher. For products with current <b>product</b> <b>availability</b> lower than 70 %, an improvement to 80 % to 90 % can be achieved.
