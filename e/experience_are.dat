40|$|History of {{philosophy}} is built upon rigid discrimination between various human <b>experiences.</b> Human <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> divided mainly into two major experiences: Perceptual and intelectual. Perceptual <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> deined by empiricism as an aposteriori experience of empirical sensations. Meanwhile, rationalism {{claims that the}} only acceptable <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> apriori <b>experience</b> of intelectual object (natural laws, mathematical equations and logical operations).

30|$|The {{learning}} <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> {{a notion}} derived from user <b>experience</b> and <b>is</b> also {{a kind of}} experience.

5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942, Koppelman {{was drafted}} into the United States Army and in 1943 he married painter Dorothy Myers. He worked as a radio {{weatherman}} during World War II, guiding ships through the rough waters of the English Channel, which was {{a critical part of}} the Invasion of Normandy. He manned an anti-aircraft machine gun in the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, and later, as staff sergeant, was awarded a Bronze Star. Before the invasion, {{he had been able to}} study at the Art College of Western England in Bristol, and later at the École des Beaux-Arts in Reims. While on leave, he visited Picasso's studio in Paris, and it was Picasso and Louis Aragon who told Koppelman that the war in Europe was over. Letters describing his wartime <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> in the Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman papers at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.|$|E
40|$|That current {{ideals of}} {{cognition}} impoverish <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> a classical observation, and complaint, {{of the early}} Frankfurt School. Adorno reacts to this phenomenon in several ways, among them his conception of metaphysical <b>experiences.</b> Metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> conventionally understood as promissory notes, as metaphors for rich experiences. This article takes {{a different view of}} metaphysical experiences. It discusses them in light of Adorno's notion that objects have priority in experience and of his further remark that metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> constituted by error. It argues that rather than promissory notes or metaphors for rich <b>experiences,</b> metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> attempts at taking things literally...|$|R

5|$|Lasting {{impressions}} of the war <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the Newfoundland Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of Newfoundland, was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who {{had lost their lives}} in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six caribou memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, and the establishment of the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourists a year. The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site also serves an informal ambassadorial function, educating visitors not only about the experience of the Newfoundland Regiment but also regarding the history of the island.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

50|$|Further {{blurring}} {{the lines of}} behavioral spheres, Gabriel Weimann wrote that media scholars have found that virtual <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> very similar to real-life experiences, and people can confuse their own memories and have trouble remembering if those <b>experiences</b> <b>were</b> mediated or not.|$|R
5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency. In the most basic sense, this <b>is</b> the <b>experience</b> of the other's body and, in this sense, it <b>is</b> an <b>experience</b> of [...] "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> modified so that what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> as being the other's experience; in <b>experiencing</b> empathy, what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "my" [...] experience, even though I <b>experience</b> it.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question about human memory <b>is</b> why some <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> remembered whereas others are forgotten. Brain activation during word encoding {{was measured using}} blocked and event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to examine how neural activation differs for subsequently remembered and subsequently forgotten experiences. Results revealed that the ability to later remember a verbal <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> predicted by the magnitude of activation in left prefrontal and temporal cortices during that experience. These findings provide direct evidence that left prefrontal and temporal regions jointly promote memory formation for verbalizable events.

40|$|One {{diagnosis}} {{of what is}} wrong with the Knowledge Argument rests on the Ability Hypothesis.

Nevertheless I deny that knowing phenomenal propositions is part of knowing what an <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> like.

25|$|Decades {{into the}} desktop {{publishing}} revolution, few typographers with metal foundry type <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> still working, and few digital typefaces are optimized specifically for different sizes, so {{the misuse of}} the term display typeface as a synonym for ornamental type has become widespread; properly speaking, ornamental typefaces are a subcategory of display typefaces.

25|$|Under British National Hunt racing (i.e. Steeplechase) rules, to {{minimize}} {{the health and safety}} risk for horses, riders, and spectators, nearly all participating horses are geldings.

25|$|In the United States {{each year}} an {{estimated}} 30 million people ride horses, resulting in 50,000 emergency room visits (1 visit per 600 riders per year).
