40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{the mandate of the}} European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), {{established}} in 2007, {{from the perspective of the}} Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which entered into force in 2009. It explores the relationship between FRA and the Charter by looking at the agency’s institutional practice, its <b>founding</b> <b>regulation</b> and its Multiannual Framework, on which the Council of the European Union agrees every five years. The Florence-based European University Institute (EUI) proposed some 15 years ago an European Union (EU) human rights agenda for the new millennium. Many of the agenda’s policy proposals have materialised ever since, including the establishment of a ‘European Human Rights Monitoring Agency’. The Charter was not part of this set of proposals. However, this prominent bill of rights and the new Agency in Vienna are obviously closely related to each other. The author concludes that the agency, despite certain limitations in its mandate, is a ‘full-Charter-body’ which could unfold its potential better following a revision of its <b>founding</b> <b>regulation.</b> Such a revision should reflect that the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights has entered into force in the meantime. The author identifies two additional key elements for the need of revision: FRA’s mandate should include the possibility for the agency to deliver opinions on proposed EU legislation on its own motion, and the agency should autonomously adopt its multiannual priorities...|$|E

The organization’s role is to provide the European Union (EU) and its Member States with a factual overview of European drug problems and a common information framework to support the drugs debate. In order to achieve its mission, the EMCDDA coordinates and relies on a network of 30 national monitoring centres, the Reitox National Focal Points. The Centre publishes {{on a wide range}} of drug-related topics, across epidemiology, interventions, laws and policies. Every November, the EMCDDA publishes its Annual Report, providing a yearly update on the European drug situation, translated into 23 EU languages.

While not a research centre in the formal sense, the results the Centre generates serve as catalysts for new research questions and help to identify priorities.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the contribution of the}} activities of FRONTEX, the Agency in charge of managing operational cooperation at the external borders of the European Union (EU), to the securitisation of asylum and migration in the EU. It does so by applying a sociological approach to the study of securitisation processes, which, it argues, is particularly well-suited to the study of securitisation processes in the EU. Such an approach privileges the study of securitising practices over securitising ‘speech acts’ in securitisation processes. After identifying two main types of securitising practices in general, the article systematically examines the activities of FRONTEX {{and the extent to which}} they can be seen as securitising practices on the basis of these two (non-mutually exclusive) criteria. The article shows that all the main activities of FRONTEX can be considered to be securitising practices. The article therefore concludes that the activities of FRONTEX contribute to a significant extent to the ongoing securitisation of asylum and migration in the EU. It also highlights that this does not automatically make FRONTEX a significant securitising actor in its own right and that more research is needed on the relations between FRONTEX and the EU institutions, especially in the light of the current negotiations aiming to amend the <b>founding</b> <b>Regulation</b> of FRONTEX...|$|E

40|$|Following {{a series}} of food scares in the 1990 s (e. g. BSE, dioxins) which {{undermined}} consumer confidence {{in the safety of}} the food chain, the European Union (EU) concluded that it needed to establish a new scientific body charged with providing independent advice on food safety issues associated with the food chain. Its primary objective was to contribute to a high level of consumer health protection in the area of food safety. To voice concerns about food safety and the ability of regulatory authorities to fully protect consumers, the result was the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was established funded by the European Community as an independent agency in 2002. In close collaboration with national authorities and in open consultation with its stakeholders, EFSA provides independent scientific advice on all matters linked to food and feed safety- including animal health and welfare and plant protection- and provides scientific advice on nutrition in relation to Community legislation. EFSA’s work falls into two areas: risk assessment and risk communication. In particular, EFSA’s risk assessment provides risk managers (EU institutions with political accountability, i. e. the European Commission, European Parliament and Council) with a sound scientific basis for defining policy-driven legislative or regulatory measures required to ensure a high level of consumer protection with regards to food and feed safety. EFSA communicates to the public in an open and transparent way on all matters within its remits. Collection and analysis of scientific data, identification of emerging risks and scientific support to the Commission, particularly in case of a food crisis, are also part of EFSA’s mandate, as laid down in the <b>founding</b> <b>Regulation</b> (EC) No 178 / 2002 of 28 January 2002.

40|$|On 29 May, the Council and the Parliament {{reached a}} {{political}} {{agreement on a}} package reforming the legislation on new psychoactive substances (NPS) used as alternatives to illicit drugs. The new mechanism will allow for a more effective and efficient EU response to new psychoactive substances, which are appearing on the EU market at an unprecedented pace, posing a risk to public health and safety. Carmelo Abela, {{minister for home affairs}} and national security of Malta said: "Legal highs are a growing problem for public health in Europe and it is young people who are most at risk. With these new rules, the EU will provide a faster and more effective response. We will be able to drastically reduce the time needed to assess and possibly decide on an EU wide ban of new psychoactive substances". The package will streamline the procedure at EU level for assessing the potential negative effects of a new psychoactive substance and decide on a possible ban. This procedure will now be nearly twice as quick as before. Also, the new rules will further reduce from 12 to 6 months the time for member states to implement the EU decision at the national level. The package also aims at improving the information exchange, early warning system and risk assessment procedure at EU level. The package is composed of an amendment to the <b>founding</b> <b>regulation</b> of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) regarding information exchange, early warning system and risk assessment procedure on psychoactive substances and a directive amending the Council framework decision from 2004 on the minimum provision on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking. Next steps Based on the political agreement reached between the two institutions, the texts will be formally adopted by both institutions in the coming months. Background New psychoactive substances are natural or synthetic substances that affect the central nervous system and induce an effect, similar to that of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, heroin or cannabis. They can cause hallucinations, alterations in thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood and other undesired effects. In fact, they are often marketed as legal alternatives to illicit drugs, hence the name of so-called 'legal highs'. The need for an amendment to the legislation on psychoactive substance {{was the result of the}} rapid and massive expansion of new psychoactive substances (NPS), at global level and in Europe. 98 new psychoactive substances were reported for the first time to the EU Early Warning System (EWS) in 2015 and 66 in 2016, bringing the total number of new substances monitored to more than 600 - with more than 460 (over 75...|$|E
