5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|Representations of lions {{date back}} to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The {{sculpture}} has been determined to be at least 32,000years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago. The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, however, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> represent a deity. Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000years of age, though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.|$|E
25|$|Exfoliative toxins are exotoxins {{implicated in}} the disease staphylococcal scalded skin {{syndrome}} (SSSS), which occurs most commonly in infants and young children. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> occur as epidemics in hospital nurseries. The protease activity of the exfoliative toxins causes peeling of the skin observed with SSSS.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be {{used for}} noun inflections which confer verbal {{properties}} to the noun. When a noun takes certain cases, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> agree with the verb in tense-aspect-mood, for example, and so not behave as a typical noun.|$|R
5000|$|Eyes down - Avoiding eye contact, {{or looking}} down, {{can be a}} sign of {{submission}} or fear. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> indicate that someone feels guilt. However, depending on the culture of the person, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> just {{be a sign of}} respect.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be {{said before}} a long journey, {{and some people}} will write it out and wear/keep it as an amulet. It is often used in the liturgy as {{the first section of}} Torah to be read in the morning after reciting the blessing before {{studying}} Torah.|$|E
25|$|Diclofenac {{may also}} be a unique member of the NSAIDs. Some {{evidence}} indicates it inhibits the lipoxygenase pathways, thus reducing formation of the leukotrienes (also pro-inflammatory autacoids). <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> inhibit phospholipase A2 as part of its mechanism of action. These additional actions may explain its high potency - it is the most potent NSAID on a broad basis.|$|E
25|$|As already mentioned, the lantern's {{structure}} {{is meant to}} symbolize the five elements of Buddhist cosmology. With the sole exception of the fire box, any parts may be absent. For example, an oki-dōrō, or movable lantern (see below) lacks a post, and rests directly on the ground. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> lack an umbrella.|$|E

25|$|Leonardo {{always loved}} nature. One {{of the reasons}} was because of his {{childhood}} environment. Near his childhood house were mountains, trees, and rivers. There were also many animals. This environment gave him the perfect chance to study the surrounding area; <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> have encouraged him to have interest in painting. Later in life he recalls his exploration of an ominous cavern in the mountains as formative.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine {{may also}} {{interact}} with epinephrine (adrenaline) {{to produce a}} paradoxical fall in blood pressure. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and thiazide diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment. Quinidine may interact with chlorpromazine to increase myocardialdepression. Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of clonidine and guanethidine. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its early}} {{development}} in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI {{has proven to be}} a highly versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be used to form images of non-living objects. MRI scans are capable of producing a variety of chemical and physical data, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within the healthcare industry has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis.|$|E

25|$|Other authors {{speculate}} that turacos and other birds employing {{the use of}} turacoverdin may derive a physiological and biochemical benefit from synthesizing the pigment. Copper, like porphyrins, can be damaging to birds when accumulated at high concentrations. Turacos may detoxify {{the high levels of}} copper ingested in a diet rich with porphyrins, thereby advertising the protection they've granted themselves by depositing the copper-rich pigments in their feathers. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be of some biological significance that turacos all seem to be pigmented with turacin and turacoverdin in exactly the same regions of the wing feathers.|$|E
25|$|It {{is noted}} in the {{literature}} that occupational therapists should use specific occupational therapy vocabulary along with the ICF {{in order to ensure}} correct communication about specific concepts. The ICF might lack certain categories to describe what occupational therapists need to communicate to clients and colleagues. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the ICF categories to occupational therapy terms. The ICF is not an assessment and specialized occupational therapy terminology should not be replaced with ICF terminology. The ICF is an overarching framework for current therapy practices.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1920s and 1930s {{a series}} of conferences, congresses and {{meetings}} were held, dealing with sexual education and prostitution. Much of this attention {{was in response to}} the 1926 passage of the Reglamento para el Ejercicio de la Prostitución (Regulation for the Practice of Prostitution), an ordinance requiring prostitutes to register with authorities and submit to inspection and surveillance. But <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> have been part of a normal phenomenon which occurs at the end of conflict. Katherine Elaine Bliss has noted that often, at the end of armed conflict, citizens turn to reordering the social and moral codes, regulating sexuality and redefining social roles.|$|E

25|$|Injuries {{generally}} are classified by either severity, {{the location of}} damage, {{or a combination of}} both. Trauma also may be classified by demographic group, such as age or gender. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be classified by the type of force applied to the body, such as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma. For research purposes injury may be classified using the Barell matrix, which is based on ICD-9-CM. The purpose of the matrix is for international standardization of the classification of trauma. Major trauma sometimes is classified by body area; injuries affecting 40% are polytrauma, 30% head injuries, 20% chest trauma, 10%, abdominal trauma, and 2%, extremity trauma.|$|E
25|$|Martingales {{are very}} common, {{especially}} on horses {{used at the}} Grand Prix level. The majority of jumpers are ridden in running martingales since these provide the most freedom over fences. Although a standing martingale (a strap connecting directly to the horse's noseband) is commonly seen on show hunters and may be helpful in keeping a horse from throwing its head up, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> be quite dangerous {{in the event of}} a stumble, restricting a horse from using its head to regain its balance. For this reason, standing martingales are not used in show jumping or eventing. Breastplates also are common, used to keep the saddle in place as the horse goes over large fences.|$|E
25|$|The second area of Council {{power is}} the {{interpretation}} of the fundamental meanings of the constitution, procedure, legislation, and treaties. The Council can declare dispositions of laws to be contrary to the Constitution of France or to the principles of constitutional value that it has deduced from the Constitution or from the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> declare laws to be in contravention of treaties which France has signed, such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Their declaring that a law is contrary to constitutional or treaty dispositions renders it invalid. The Council also may impose reservations as to the interpretation of certain provisions in statutes. The decisions of the Council are binding on all authorities.|$|E

25|$|Inventory {{management}} {{involves a}} retailer seeking to acquire {{and maintain a}} proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling and related costs are kept in check. It also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques, report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved {{into and out of}} stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> include ABC analysis, lot tracking, cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs.|$|E
25|$|Radar {{estimates}} of rainfall and general weather forecasting techniques {{are also important}} components of good flood forecasting. In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{studies have}} {{consistently}} associated medical and recreational opioid use with hypogonadism and hormone imbalance in different sexes. The effect is dose-dependent. Most {{studies suggest that}} the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users suffer hormone imbalances. Opioids can also interfere with menstruation in women by limiting the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). Opioid-induced endocrinopathy likely causes the strong association of opioid use with osteoporosis and bone fracture. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>may</b> increase pain and thereby interfere with the intended clinical effect of opioid treatment. Opioid-induced endocrinopathy is likely caused by their agonism of opioid receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. One study found that the depressed testosterone levels of heroin addicts returned to normal within one month of abstinence, suggesting that the effect is not permanent. , the effect of low-dose or acute opiate use on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E
