40|$|In Haupt t/a Softcopy v Brewers Marketing Intelligence (Pty) Ltd 2006 4 SA 458 (SCA) Haupt {{sought to}} enforce a {{copyright}} claim in the Data Explorer <b>computer</b> <b>programme</b> against Brewers Marketing Intelligence (Pty) Ltd. His claim was dismissed in the High Court and he appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Court held that copyright in the Data Explorer programme vested in Haupt. Haupt acquired copyright in the Data Explorer programme regardless {{of the fact that}} the programme was as a result of an unauthorised adaptation of the Project AMPS programme which belonged to Brewers Marketing Intelligence (Pty) Ltd. This case note inter alia analyses the possibility of an author being sued for infringement even though he has acquired copyright in a work that he created by making unauthorised adaptations to another's copyright material. Furthermore, it examines whether or not the law adequately protects copyright owners in situations where infringement takes the form of unauthorised adaptations of <b>computer</b> <b>programmes.</b> It is argued that the protection afforded by the Copyright Act 98 of 1978 (Copyright Act) in terms of section 27 (1) to copyright owners of <b>computer</b> <b>programmes</b> is narrowly defined. It excludes from its ambit of criminal liability the act of making unauthorised adaptation of <b>computer</b> <b>programmes.</b> The issue that is considered is therefore whether or not the unauthorised adaptation of <b>computer</b> <b>programmes</b> should attract a criminal sanction. In addressing this issue and with the aim of making recommendations, the legal position in the United Kingdom (UK) is analysed. From the analysis it is recommended that the Copyright Act be amended by the insertion of a new section, section 27 (1) (A), which will make the act of making an unauthorised adaptation of a <b>computer</b> <b>programme</b> an offence. This recommended section will close the gap that currently exists in our law with regard to unauthorised adaptations of <b>computer</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

BACFIRE is a <b>computer</b> <b>programme</b> to search among the basic events of a minimal cut set for potential common casuse failures. Both codes are written in FORTRAN IV for the IBM 360 / 370 computer series. The input data to MOCUS-BACFIRE are the fault tree and common cause susceptibilities.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present thesis is to clarify the term of software piracy and to determine responsibility of individual entities as to actual realization of software piracy. First, the thesis focuses on a <b>computer</b> <b>programme,</b> causes, realization and pitfalls of its inclusion under copyright protection. Subsequently, it observes methods of legal usage of a <b>computer</b> <b>programme.</b> This {{is the point of}} departure for the following attempt to define software piracy, accompanied with methods of actual realization of piracy, mainly by creation and distribution of piracy software. Moreover, the thesis aims to delve into recent events exerting impact on software piracy, and it intends to consider the future development of intellectual property rights. The thesis is divided into twelve chapters. The introduction engages in the phenomenon of piracy of intellectual assets and the history of software piracy. The second chapter comprises definitions of basic terms largely of a non- legal nature, the interpretation of which terms is important to appreciate the thesis contents. A substantial part of the chapter defines a <b>computer</b> <b>programme.</b> The following part of the thesis analyses a <b>computer</b> <b>programme</b> as a copyright work. It describes reasons for inclusion of a <b>computer</b> <b>programme</b> under the regime of copyright protection, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Copyright law is {{the area}} o f {{intellectual}} property law that regulates the creation and use {{of a range of}} cultural goods such as books, songs, films and <b>computer</b> <b>programmes.</b> The paper focuses on the protection o f <b>computer</b> <b>programmes,</b> and, in particular, on the rights of their lawful users, such as buyers and licensees in Poland. The Polish regulation is based on the Council Directive o f 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of <b>computer</b> <b>programmes</b> (91 / 250 /EEC) which was introduced to the Copyright Law during the process of harmonization of the Polish Law with the European Law (Dz. U. from 2006, No 90, item 631). The paper is divided into four parts which reflect the rights o f a legal user. The first part presents the right to use the <b>computer</b> <b>programme</b> in accordance with its intended purpose, including the correction of errors. The second part explains the right to make a back-up copy. The third one focuses on the right to observe, study or test the functioning of the programme {{in order to determine the}} ideas and principles which underlie its elements. Finally, the fourth part deals with the right of decompilation. The intention o f the author was to write an exhaustive paper that would explain the rights of a lawful user.

40|$|Polarcardiographic {{criteria}} for myocardial infarction were established using an analogic computer and human readers. The sensitivity for revealing old myocardial infarction {{was found to}} be 37 % greater than for ECG, with a false positive rate of less than 5 %. The introduction of digital minicomputers, performing electronic measurements and vector analysis, allowed to process a daily large number of electrocardiologic tests as a routine clinical service (Woodward <b>ECG</b> <b>Computer</b> System). In the present study, the performance of the computer program in applying the polarcardiographic {{criteria for}} myocardial infarction was matched with that previously applied by human readers. Using the coronary-ventriculography as a golden standard, {{there were no significant differences}} in the specificity and the sensitivity was 51 % for human readers versus 53 % for the computer; when combined, both the computer and the cardiologist’s overread, the sensitivity was increased to 61 %. Using the new computer expanded diagnostic criteria, the sensitivity was 61 %, and was raised to 67 % with combined overreading. The sensitivities and the specificities obtained when the computer diagnosis and visual interpretations are combined, are those that apply to the Woodward <b>ECG</b> <b>Computer</b> System in daily use...|$|R
