5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi, {{along with}} a large variety of spiders and insects, is often found in the dense, large webs of the diplurid Ischnothele karschi (about 15millimetres long), which are {{especially}} abundant in partly cleared secondary bush where rain forests have been cut down, and usually about one metre above the ground. A survey of one area suggested that there <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> P. schultzi per three I. karschi webs. P. schultzi {{is also found in}} its own web and those of other spiders, on tree trunks and the walls of buildings, and in leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will almost certainly be detected.|$|E

5|$|WASP-15b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{discovered}} in 2008 by the SuperWASP collaboration, {{which seeks to}} discover exoplanets that transit their host stars. The planet orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.05 AU every four days. The mass of this planet <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> third of the polluted water, and lies {{on the border of}} Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E
5|$|At {{the church}} council, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E

5|$|In Vienna, {{two women}} were {{poisoned}} at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of them}} were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in young people today. She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope. The average virion <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E
