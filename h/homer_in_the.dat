5|$|In {{the season}} 9 DVD {{release of the}} episode, The Simpsons animators use a telestrator to show {{similarities}} between Krusty and <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode. This episode contains the last showing of character Lionel Hutz. He is seen standing {{at the bus stop}} with Lisa, but does not speak. Due to Phil Hartman's death, the recurring characters of Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure were retired.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} tied and bases loaded {{with two outs}} {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning, Mr. Burns elects to field a {{right-handed}} hitter against a left-handed pitcher and pinch hits Homer for Strawberry. Distracted by Mr. Burns, the first pitch hits <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> head, rendering him unconscious, but forcing in the winning run. The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 2011, Kinsler {{became the}} first player in major league history to hit a lead-off {{home run in the}} first two games of a season (giving him a total of 15 lead-off homers in his career). In his next game against the Red Sox, he hit another home run in the third inning. Kinsler and Nelson Cruz also {{became the first}} two {{teammates}} to homer in each of the first three games in a season. The two also joined Dean Palmer (1992) as the only Texas ballplayers to ever <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first three games of the season.|$|E
50|$|Gonzalez hit three {{home runs}} and Tulowitzki went 5-for-5 with two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rockies win over the Cincinnati Reds on June 5. It's <b>the</b> first time <b>in</b> Major League history that one player had a three-homer game while a {{teammate}} had at least five hits including two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same game.|$|R
50|$|A wild {{ninth inning}} ended with Joe Page the winning pitcher, {{even though he}} gave up two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inning.</b> <b>The</b> game had stood 1-1 until the ninth, when Johnny Mize {{delivered}} a two-run pinch single. Brooklyn starter Ralph Branca was then replaced by Jack Banta, who gave up an RBI hit to Jerry Coleman that made it 4-1. It seemed safe until Luis Olmo and Roy Campanella both <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the ninth, but Page hung on for the win after 5.2 innings of relief.|$|R
50|$|Belle <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final at-bat of his major-league career, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on October 1, 2000.|$|R
5|$|Hartnett was an {{all-around}} player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for {{his strong}} and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing percentage {{and was the}} first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, he took part {{of some of the most}} memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike-out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs in first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became immortalized as the <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gloamin'.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2012, Ross {{finalized}} {{a one-year}} contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was supposed to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the second inning off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He {{was placed on the}} disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 1938, the {{two teams}} met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett {{experienced}} the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless Wrigley Field and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that the ninth inning {{would be the last}} to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with two out {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning. With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Hartnett's walk-off home run became immortalized as the <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gloamin'.|$|E

5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E
5|$|Frank Lucchesi {{continued}} {{to manage the}} Sounds in 1989, leading the team to a third-place finish with a 74–72record. Pitcher Hugh Kemp set the career franchise records for games started (73) and walks (207) while playing for the team from 1987 to 1989. The Sounds returned in 1990 to experience their most successful season in the American Association, when they compiled an 86–61 record under manager Pete Mackanin. Ending the regular season in a tie with the Buffalo Bisons, the Sounds won the Eastern Division championship in a one-game playoff. The extra-inning affair was ended by Chris Jones' two-run <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top of the eighteenth inning. The Sounds advanced to their first American Association championship series, where they lost to the Omaha Royals, three games to two. Left-hander Chris Hammond won the league's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1990, having led the league with 15wins and 149strikeouts. That year, Nashville set their all-time attendance record when a total of 605,122fans came out to Greer Stadium. Skeeter Barnes, who played with Nashville in 1979 and from 1988 to 1990, holds three career franchise records: games played (514), at bats (1,848), and hits (517).|$|E

Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers started September with a 2-1 win {{to finish}} off a sweep of the San Diego Padres. Zack Greinke allowed one run on two hits and Yasiel Puig <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> win.|$|R
50|$|On July 3, new Twin Jim Thome <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>inning</b> for his 574th career home run. With that four-bagger, {{he passed}} Twins legend Harmon Killebrew's 573 {{on the all-time}} career home run list.|$|R
50|$|On June 10, 1880, Jones {{became the}} first big leaguer to hit two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same <b>inning.</b> Both home runs came off Buffalo Bisons' pitcher Tom Poorman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighth <b>inning</b> of a 19-3 rout.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in the}} opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and a two-run homer by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, the Phillies jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. The Phillies also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E
5|$|The score {{remained}} the same through the fourth inning. Fogg was relieved by Taylor Buchholz {{in the top of}} the fifth and, following a double by Tulowitzki, Peavy allowed the game-tying run to score on a Holliday single. Seth Smith, pinch hitting for the pitcher in the bottom of the sixth, hit a triple and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Matsui to give the Rockies a 6–5 lead. The Rockies' Garrett Atkins appeared to <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the seventh, extending the Rockies lead, but umpires ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall, which was still in play, and awarded Atkins a double. Jamey Carroll pinch ran for Atkins, but no runs scored in the inning. The Rockies brought in closer Brian Fuentes {{in the top of the}} 8th, but the Padres re-tied the game when Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning, advanced to second base on a wild pitch, and scored on a double by Brian Giles. This was Fuentes' seventh blown save of the season.|$|E
25|$|Silverio hit {{a two-run}} <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, but the World team lost 6-4.|$|E
50|$|In Game 3 of the 1976 NLCS, George Foster and Johnny Bench hit {{back-to-back}} <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last of {{the ninth}} off Ron Reed to tie the game. The Series-winning run was scored later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>inning.</b>|$|R
50|$|Anthony Lamar Lewis (born February 2, 1971) is {{a former}} {{professional}} baseball player who hit over 200 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor leagues.

25|$|The Dodgers finally {{beat the}} Diamondbacks on September 1 as Josh Beckett only allowed one run in 6 innings, while {{striking}} out 9, tying his season high. Andre Ethier and Hanley Ramírez each hit solo homers {{to account for}} the 2–1 victory. The Dodgers finished off the series with another win, thanks to a two-run walk-off double by Adrian Gonzalez off Diamondbacks closer J. J. Putz for the 5–4 win. The Dodgers won again the next night against the San Diego Padres as Ethier hit a solo <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the ninth to tie the game and A. J. Ellis hit a walk-off single {{in the bottom of the}} 11th for the 4–3 victory. Clayton Kershaw only allowed one run in 7 innings on September 4, while striking out 9. Kerhsaw became just the fifth Dodgers pitcher to post three straight 200 strikeout seasons (Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Fernando Valenzuela and Hideo Nomo). Ethier hit a solo <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second inning for his 1,000th career hit but it wasn't enough as Matt Guerrier gave up a two-run game-tying <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighth and John Ely allowed three runs to score in the 11th as the Dodgers lost to the Padres 6–3. The Dodgers lost the series finale as well, 4–3, to the Padres.|$|E

A three-run homer by Matt Kemp in the eighth inning gave the Dodgers another loss, this time to the Padres, 5–1. The Dodgers ended the month of April on a six-game losing streak, thanks to another 5–2 loss to the Padres on April 30.|$|E
50|$|The Pirates' José Lind was {{responsible}} for his team's only run as he <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighth <b>inning</b> off of Smoltz.
