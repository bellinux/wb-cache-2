40|$|A simple {{hand-held}} <b>grinding</b> <b>fixture</b> {{is discussed}} which can produce microtome mounts of hard materials, oriented interfaces, and powders {{embedded in a}} 5 / 16 -in plastic rod. The device {{has been used for}} the ultramicrotomy of meteorite samples, 10 - 50 micron interplanetary dust particles, and thin films on plastic. Results are presented for a layer lattice silicate from the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite, illustrating the resolution and structural detail that can be obtained with the method...|$|E
40|$|The force exerted {{during the}} {{grinding}} {{process is a}} key influential factor for grinding quality and the design of <b>grinding</b> <b>fixtures.</b> In this research, {{a model of the}} grinding force for aerospace alloys was built using an empirical approach. A robust design of experiments that included orthogonal arrays and the signal-to-noise ratio were tightly integrated to acquire reliable force data. In order to obtain clear and correct force signals, an optimized matching method to select parameters and filters was put forward based on a correlation function. The results verified that a wavelet filter gives much better accuracy. A set of empirical models of the grinding force for superalloy CMSX 4 were build up using multivariate analysis and these models are characterized by the process parameters such as depth of cut, feed rate, wheel speed as well as wheel diameter. They have been verified through further experiments and the correlation coefficients between these models and experimental data are around 0. 91...|$|R
40|$|The use of high-strength, {{lightweight}} composites for {{the fixture}} is the novel {{feature of this}} innovation. The main advantage is the light weight and high stiffness-to-mass ratio relative to aluminum. Meter-class optics require support during the grinding/polishing process with large tools. The use of aluminum as a polishing fixture is standard, with pitch providing a compliant layer to allow support without deformation. Unfortunately, with meter-scale optics, a meter-scale fixture weighs over 120 lb (. 55 kg) and may distort the optics being fabricated by loading the mirror and/or tool used in fabrication. The use of composite structures that are lightweight yet stiff allows standard techniques to be used while providing for a decrease in fixture weight by almost 70 percent. Mounts classically used to support large mirrors during fabrication are especially heavy and difficult to handle. The mount must be especially stiff to avoid deformation during the optical fabrication process, where a very large and heavy lap often can distort the mount and optic being fabricated. If the optic is placed {{on top of the}} lapping tool, the weight of the optic and the fixture can distort the lap. Fixtures to support the mirror during fabrication are often very large plates of aluminum, often 2 in. (. 5 cm) or more in thickness and weight upwards of 150 lb (68 kg). With the addition of a backing material such as pitch and the mirror itself, the assembly can often weigh over 250 lb (. 113 kg) for a meter-class optic. This innovation is the use of a lightweight graphite panel with an aluminum honeycomb core for use as the polishing fixture. These materials have been used in the aerospace industry as structural members due to their light weight and high stiffness. The <b>grinding</b> polishing <b>fixture</b> consists of the graphite composite panel, fittings, and fixtures to allow interface to the polishing machine, and introduction of pitch buttons to support the optic under fabrication. In its operation, the <b>grinding</b> polishing <b>fixture</b> acts as a reaction structure to the polishing tool. It must be stiff enough to avoid imparting a distorted shape to the optic under fabrication and light enough to avoid self-deflection. The fixture must also withstand significant tangential loads from the polishing machine during operations...|$|R
50|$|A radius grinder (or {{radius tool}} grinder) {{is a special}} grinder used for {{grinding}} the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it {{may be used for}} other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and holding fixture. The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpeice, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius <b>grinds.</b> The holding <b>fixtures</b> can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a collet or chuck fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can dress the grinding wheel itself with a particular radius.|$|R
40|$|Ion milling, wedge cutting or polishing, {{and focused}} ion beam (FIB) milling are widely-used {{techniques}} for the transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample preparation. Especially, the FIB milling provides a site-specific analysis, deposition, and ablation of materials in the micrometer and nanometer scale. However, the cost of FIB tools has been always a significant concern. Since it is inevitable to use the FIB technique, the improvement of efficiency is a key point. Traditional TEM sample preparation with FIB was routinely implemented on a single sample each time. Aiming at cost efficiency, a new pre-thinning technique for batch sample preparation was developed in this paper. The present proposal combines the sample preparation techniques with multi-samples thinning, cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wedge cutting, FIB and other sample pre-thinning techniques. The new pre-thinning technique is to prepare an edge TEM sample on a <b>grinding</b> and polishing <b>fixture</b> with a slant surface. The thickness of the wedges sample can be measured to 1 ∼ 2 μm under optical microscope. Therefore, this fixture is superior to the traditional optical method of estimating the membrane thickness. Moreover, by utilizing a multi-sample holding fixture, more samples can be pre-thinned simultaneously, which significantly improved the productivity of TEM sample preparation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work was primarily concentrated on precise ductile-mode grinding (milling) of flat surfaces of silicon, mainly Integrated Circuit (IC) silicon chips (dies), which were about 700 Âµm thick {{and the top}} of their surfaces covered with a silicon nitride layer. Substantial amount of partial-ductile streaks on a machined silicon surface shortens polishing time dramatically. This is of vital importance particularly in chip-making and optical industries for failure analysis. Failure analysis is a technique usually practised for locating a fault in a finished IC product. In chip-making industries, the analysis is done on the damage-free mirror-like finished silicon die of the IC. Grinding, lapping and/or polishing operations are required to get such a smooth surface. Precision grinding in a ductile mode therefore remains the critical and most important machining operation as the surface and sub-surface damages will be minimized. This results in good quality surface in terms of surface finish and flatness {{and at the same time}} generating the maximum amount of ductile streaks on the machined surface. Silicon material other than the IC silicon was also tried out for purpose of comparison and because of limited number of IC chips. Silicon like any hard and brittle material is well known for its low machinability unless it is machined under ductile mode condition. Ductile mode machining is a process that makes brittle materials to behave like ductile materials. A low cost machining technique, which facilitates partial-ductile mode grinding of small areas on thin wafer-like silicon, was developed. A specially modified conventional MAHO CNC Vertical Milling Centre that has an air driven low powered high-speed attachment (precision jig grinder) facilitated the diamond <b>grinding.</b> Special <b>fixtures</b> were designed and fabricated that held the workpieces in position and prevented them from damage during machining. Both traditional and statistical techniques for designing of experiments and subsequent analysis of results were employed in this study. A low cutting force dynamometer (Compacdyn) was used to measure cutting forces. Form Talysurf and Surfcom Surface Analysers and Atomic Force Microscope were used to measure surface texture parameters. Optical, Scanning Electron microscopy techniques, together with the Surfcom Surface Analyser and Atomic Force Microscope, were used to examine the surface morphology of the machined silicon surfaces. It was found that the amount of ductile streaks generated on a work-piece surface was not only dependent on feed and depth of cut but also on the grit size of diamond abrasive. The machining technique of grinding yielded ground surfaces with Ra as low as 50 nm, and forces around 0. 8 Newton. Flatness of the machined surfaces is very good. A model of surface roughness (Ra) for precision grinding of thin silicon has been established...|$|R
40|$|Machining of {{hard and}} brittle {{materials}} always pose {{problems such as}} rough surface, cracks, subsurface damage and residual stresses mainly due to its brittle nature. Recent developments in cutting tool technology coupled with rigid ultraprecision machine tools {{have made it possible}} to machine hard and brittle materials like optical glass in ductile mode with crack free surfaces. However this technique is reported to be relatively slow and too expensive for manufacturing less precision products like ophthalmic lenses, which do not require extreme form accuracy. Though not possible to machine glass in fully ductile mode with conventional grinding, substantial amount of partial ductile mode areas generated on the ground surface is proven to reduce polishing time significantly to get mirror finish. In this study, resinoid bonded diamond pins, with and without a central hole were used to grind BK 7 optical glass. Plano grinding operation was carried out using a high-speed jig grinder air motor, which was attached to a vertical spindle CNC milling machine. Both wet and dry grinding operations were performed. In wet grinding, ductile-fracture areas and surface roughness of ground surface were investigated by varying grinding conditions. Diamond grinding pins with and without central hole were found to have an effect on surface finish and flatness on the ground surfaces. Central holed diamond pins produced better surface finish and were 5 times superior in flatness compared to surfaces ground with diamond pins without central hole. Subsequently, zero velocity effect that cause chips trapped underneath of diamond pins are completely eliminated. Insufficient coolant penetration into <b>grinding</b> zone and <b>fixture</b> rigidity were found to have contributed stalling marks. Applications of higher coolant flow rate of 5 litres/min together with a rigid pocket groove holder were successfully used to eliminate stalling and this set-up was used in subsequent experimental trials for ductile-fracture and surface roughness analysis. Maximum ductile streaks were obtained at the lowest feed (5 mm/min) and in-feed (5 Âµm) for both 64 Âµm and 126 Âµm grit diamond pins. Finer ductile streaks were observed with 64 Âµm than 126 Âµm grit diamond pins in almost all conditions probably due to grain size effects. An image processing procedure has been successfully developed to quantify objectively the fraction of ductile and fracture areas generated on ground surfaces. Among the four alternatives developed, method B provided the least error. A linear relationship model was established for surface roughness when grinding with 64 Âµm grit diamond pins. The feed was found to have significant effect on the response investigated. The model was verified by the confirmation run and therefore can be used for prediction within the limits of the factors investigated. In dry grinding, various types of chips morphology were observed. A discovery was made during this study, namely the observation of solid spherical glass chips obtained at the lowest cutting condition (feed = 2. 5 mm/min and infeed = 5 Âµm) and its formation mechanism is described. ...|$|R
