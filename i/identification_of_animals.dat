However, the forensic <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> (non-human) hairs requires different skill sets and competencies to those required for human hair comparisons. The aim of this is paper {{is not only to}} highlight the intrinsic differences between forensic human hair comparison and forensic animal hair identification, but also discuss the utility and reliability of the two in the context of possibilities and pitfalls. It also addresses and dispels some of the more popular myths and misconceptions surrounding the microscopical examination <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> hairs. Furthermore, future directions of this discipline are explored through the proposal of recommendations for minimum standards for the morphological <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> hairs and the significance of the newly developed guidelines by SWGWILD is discussed...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European Union funded research project STRATFEED for detection and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> proteins in feeds, the microscopic method was optimized at several key steps and better documented. A check list was developed for uniform reporting. Characters of bone fragments, hairs, muscles and gills are fully documented. A so-called muscle ratio has been developed for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> muscle fibers at the level of vertebrate classes (mammals, birds and fishes). Both the improved protocol and the entire range of characters which can be observed, are documented in a Decision Support System called ARIES (Animal Remains Identification and Evaluation System). A second internet-based system called STRATFEED-DSS exclusively assists in <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> particles in feeds. A new strategy with microscopy as screening technique and either DNA or protein identification as confirmation technique is proposed.

30|$|The {{recognition}} of individuals {{is the main}} objective in many population studies on behavior, ecology, and biology allowing to estimate its population parameters through capture-recapture models and to produce models of its social structure [1]. Artificial marking is a unique identification mechanism (i.e., metal clips, tattoos) for individuals of a specific species, but this method is not very reliable because the animals can be moved or lose their markings [2, 3]. To address some of these problems, the individual <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> by their natural markings has become an important tool {{for the study of}} some populations of animals and has been applied to an equally wide range of animals such as whales, manta rays, and frogs [4].|$|E
