However, there are virtually no studies on energy harvesting with these systems to produce tens {{or hundreds of}} milliwatts. The goal of this work was to study which design parameters from large-scale systems {{can be applied to}} small-scale systems. Two types of hydro turbines were evaluated. The first one was a Pelton turbine which is suitable for high heads and low flow rates. The second one was a propeller turbine used for low heads and high flow rates. Several turbine geometries and nozzle diameters were tested for the Pelton system. For the propeller, a three-bladed turbine was tested for different heads and <b>draft</b> <b>tubes.</b> The mechanical power provided by these turbines was measured to evaluate the range of efficiencies of these systems.

However, difficulties may arise during operation, such as unstable spouting, dead zones formation and limited flexibility in adjustment of maximum spoutable height and residence time.

The distinct flow regimes were identified by capturing high-speed images and Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of measured pressure signals.

40|$|The {{strongly}} swirling {{turbulent flow}} through an abrupt expansion is investigated using highly resolved LES and SAS, to shed more {{light on the}} stagnation region and the helical vortex breakdown. The vortex breakdown in an abrupt expansion resembles the so-called vortex rope occurring in hydro power <b>draft</b> <b>tubes.</b> It is known that the large-scale helical vortex structures can be captured by regular RANS turbulence models. However, the spurious suppression of the small-scale structures should be avoided using less diffusive methods.

The computations are conducted using a general non-orthogonal finite-volume method with a fully collocated storage available in the OpenFOAM- 2. 1. x CFD code. The dynamics of the flow is studied at two Reynolds numbers, Re= 6. 0 × 104 and Re= 105, at the almost constant high swirl numbers of Sr= 1. 16 and Sr= 1. 23, respectively.

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a <b>draft</b> <b>tube</b> is to recover the {{residual}} kinetic energy of the water that exits over the turbine.

Moreover, it also converts the wasteful kinetic energy at the exit of the runner into the useful pressure energy.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to improve numerical predictions of unsteady turbulent flows in the <b>draft</b> <b>tubes</b> of hydraulic power plants. The standard two-equation turbulence models {{are known to have}} a strong damping effect on the resolved turbulence in this type of flow. In order to reduce this negative influence of the model, while retaining the usually satisfying near-wall behaviour, a dynamic filtering technique of the turbulent length and time scales is generalised, employed and evaluated. The filter limits the influence of the modeled turbulent length and time scales on the mean flow in regions where unsteadiness can potentially be resolved. The Wilcox (1988) k-ω turbulence model was chosen as basis for the investigations, and the effects of five different filter widths were examined. The original non-filtered model is also evaluated. A swirling flow through a straight axisymmetric diffuser was chosen as a test case and detailed measurements carried out by Clausen et al. were used to validate the numerical results. The influence of the filtering approach on the resolved frequencies and the time averaged solutions were analysed. It is shown that the filtering procedure gives better predictions of the time-averaged velocity field and more information on the large scale unsteadiness...|$|R

But local bricklayers demanded that they be paid the salary offered by the city rather than the lower rate offered by Montana Power. The company refuse to hire the workers, and built the structure of concrete instead. Concrete and masonry retaining walls {{north and south of}} the powerhouse were also built to help prevent erosion of the riverbank into the forebay and tailrace. The new forebay was [...] long and [...] wide. The forebay was slightly extended downstream to the new powerhouse, and brick arches of the old powerhouse incorporated into the forebay's walls. The new powerhouse contained three vertical Kaplan turbines (supplied by the S. Morgan Smith Company) capable of generating 18 MW of power, which gave Black Eagle the smallest generating capacity of any of Montana Power's five dams in the Great Falls area. The Smith company also made the oil-pressure governors (which regulated each turbine's speed) and <b>draft</b> <b>tubes</b> (which slowed the water down as it left the turbine, allowing the faster-moving water above to keep imparting energy to the turbine's propellers). The scroll-shaped inlets and wicket gates around the turbines were cemented into the powerhouse's basement, and each turbine installed in its own pit. Each turbine connected through the first floor roof to an Allis-Chalmers generator rated at 7,000 kVA. DC generators acted as exciters for the Allis-Chalmers generators. Six 6,600/2,200 volt transformers stepped down the power for usage.|$|R

It was found that profiles of biomass concentration, average particle size and SVI of biomass showed the same changing trends during the first 40 -day operation in the bubble column and the airlift reactor. After 60 -day operation, the biomass concentration, average particle size, and SVI of biomass reached 4. 5 g l? 1, 1300 ?m and 30 ml g? 1, respectively, and then maintained at these values during the next 3 -month operation in airlift reactor. However, morphology of granular sludge in bubble column changed at day of 50 and then disintegrated into bioflocs at day of 67 when biomass concentration reached to 8. 0 g l? 1, which led to the great increase of SVI of biomass and the wash-out of lots of biomass from reactor. Clear and regular granules were seen again at day of 75 and granules gradually grew to bigger sizes. But the system deterioration happened again when biomass in bubble column increased to about 8. 0 g l? 1. It was found that DO concentration in feast period was about 35 – 40 % with biomass concentration of 8. 0 g l? 1 in bubble column while DO concentration was above 60 % with biomass concentration of 4. 5 g l? 1 in airlift reactor.
