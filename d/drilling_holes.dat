5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E

30|$|An aqueous {{solution}} of phenolic resin was impregnated through <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> in wood, and we manufactured compressed wood with the deformation fixed by the phenolic resin. The methods of impregnation {{used in this}} study were an in-liquid platen-pressing method and a vacuum treatment. The effect of the <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> on solution retention was examined. Moreover, the control of solution retention was examined under the application of compression drying. The impregnation of resin into the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> was insufficient, and the deformation could not be fixed. On the other hand, sufficient impregnation was possible in the specimen with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes,</b> and the deformation fixation was observed. At the stage of compression when the solution was squeezed out of the specimen, the solution retention of each specimen was accurately controlled in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b> At the stage of compressive deformation and deformation fixation using a hot press, the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> could not be processed normally because swelling occurred. However, swelling did not occur in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the last}} year of the operation, the massive scope of full {{excavation}} and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E

25|$|The process {{consists}} of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base. The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and <b>drilling</b> <b>holes,</b> grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.|$|E

40|$|Yucca Mountain in {{southern}} Nye County, Nevada, {{has been proposed}} as a potential site for the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste. An exploratory <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> designated UE 25 p# 1 was drilled 3 km east of the proposed repository site to investigate the geology and hydrology of the rocks that underlie the Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rock sequence forming Yucca Mountain. Silurian dolomite assigned to the Roberts Mountain and Lone Mountain Formations was intersected below the Tertiary section between a depth of approximately 1244 m (4080 ft) and {{the bottom of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> at 1807 m (5923 ft). These formations are part of an important regional carbonate aquifer in the deep ground-water system. Tertiary units deeper than 1139 m (3733 ft) in <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> UE 25 p# 1 are stratigraphically older than any units previously penetrated by <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> at Yucca Mountain. These units are, in ascending order, the tuff of Yucca Flat(?), an unnamed calcified ash-flow tuff, and a sequence of clastic deposits. The upper part of the Tertiary sequence in <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> UE 25 p# 1 is similar to that found in other <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> at Yucca Mountain. The Tertiary sequence is in fault contact with the Silurian rocks. This fault between Tertiary and Paleozoic rocks may correlate with the Fran Ridge fault, a steeply westward-dipping fault exposed approximately 0. 5 km east of the <b>drill</b> <b>hole.</b> Another fault intersects UE 25 p# 1 at 873 m (2863 ft), but its surface trace is concealed beneath the valley west of the Fran Ridge fault.

25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component.

40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} {{the volume of}} injury to the physis during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in pediatric patients. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 10 pediatric knees were converted into 3 -dimensional models. Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing software placed <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> (6, 7, 8, and 9 mm in diameter) in these models, simulating tunnels used for ACL reconstruction. The software was used to calculate total physeal volume and volume of physis removed by the tunnel. The ratio of physeal volume removed to the total physeal volume was determined. Results For 6 -, 7 -, 8 -, and 9 -mm-diameter <b>drill</b> <b>holes,</b> the mean percent of physeal volume removed/total physeal volume was 1. 6 %, 2. 2 %, 2. 9 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively, for the tibia and 2. 4 %, 3. 2 %, 4. 2 %, and 5. 4 %, respectively, for the femur. For all subjects, the volume removed was less than 7. 0 % for the tibia and 9. 0 % for the femur by use of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> from 6 to 9 mm. The tibial <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> was centrally placed in all cases compared with a more peripheral <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> placement of the femur. Conclusions <b>Drill</b> <b>hole</b> placement during ACL reconstruction produces a zone of physeal injury. The overall volume of injury is relatively low, which {{reduces the risk of}} physeal arrest. With careful <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> placement, the region of injury is central on the tibia, and the total volume of injury can be less than 5. 0 % of the physeal volume. For the femur, the total volume can be less than 5. 0 % as well. However, the region of injury is peripheral, which carries a higher risk of physeal arrest. Clinical Relevance A better understanding of the relation between the ACL and physis may guide the placement of <b>drill</b> <b>holes,</b> which have a lower risk of producing physeal arrest...|$|R
