60|$|This <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{was aware}} that Brother John had a foolish {{objection}} to uttering, or even acting lies.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hark to me, Nyleptha,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{put down}} the empty tankard. 'Hast thou here among these thy waiting-ladies any two of discretion?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, let's {{hear about}} the caterpillars," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> drew the pebbles {{together}} into a heap and began dividing them into colours.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Break not {{the thread}} the spider [...] Is labouring to weave.' [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> nor <b>as</b> <b>I</b> eyed her [...] Could dream she would deceive.|$|R
6000|$|... "'He came {{to examine}} the premises, I 'm sure of it, {{but we will be}} ready for him,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> fiercely, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> told the family about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> sweetheart, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> lifted your dear head from the ground when you reeled from your horse just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> overtook you at Springfield?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Abdul," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{straightened}} up his cushions {{and made him}} a little more comfortable, [...] "what is it? What is the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How d'you think Harvey's coming on?' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{rubbed the}} brute's gulping neck. The vet had warned {{me of the}} {{possibilities}} of spinal trouble following distemper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} going out, sir," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> set a chair for him, [...] "to speak to Mr. Robert Nicholson about a very {{extraordinary}} circumstance--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought it}} best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it. So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> much. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it lightly, because I felt her trembling.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be {{the simpler}} way to return," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> smiling, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> handed the forged order to the boy. [...] "Come, we shall see now how well it works." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{we shall}} meet again, <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> hastily, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> saw him hurrying towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is metal there," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> gazed. [...] "Would {{that there}} were fire also, living ardour to make the steel glow--then I could love her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurry, Ben," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{finished}} my third set of five shots, the last shot {{of which was}} my best and knocked dirt {{in the face of}} the grizzly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pat will do very well," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> bade {{the good}} women farewell, and {{carefully}} guided the horse through the swarms of youngsters who had {{gathered around the}} carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a cent!" [...] said Skim indignantly. [...] "Ye didn't tell me {{to write}} a story; <b>I</b> <b>said</b> myself <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could do it. An' I know where to use the money, Peggy, ev'ry dollar of it, whether it's thirty er fifty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Darling, be brave, {{you have}} only fainted. I will take you home to the dear Do√±a Maria," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> {{naturally}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could speak, for I {{was finding}} my young friend a trifle overpowering, [...] "this is most satisfactory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'There,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> put the parings {{into her}} hand. 'Just {{to show you}} what I think of it. There's bait and to spare. Go on and anaana me if you can.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One last question, Holmes," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> rose. [...] "Surely {{there is}} no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he after?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cis," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{scrambled}} {{up to his}} side, [...] "I {{want you to go}} home by the Lincoln Road and call at Dr. Schofield's. It isn't far out of the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg pardon, monsieur," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{followed}} him to his private sitting-room, [...] "for having returned so late--it was not my fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{tremendous}} haul!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> joined my friend, who {{stood at the}} outer end of our little wharf, enjoying the scene.|$|R
6000|$|... "'We {{will lose}} no time' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> reassuringly, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{looked at my}} watch. 'It is now seven-thirty. We will reckon the time from now, with {{overtime}} at time and a half. But if I am {{to do anything for}} you I must have some idea of what has happened.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For life or death, I {{care not}} which, {{so long as}} I am with you!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> moved off. Descending the Jacob's ladder, I made my way down the rock-hewn passage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some time I {{must come}} {{here in the}} moonlight," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> descended and entered the chilly old church. [...] "Surely I would learn sweet secrets which the sun each day effaces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why no, Squire; <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} go for a holiday, and that ain't no holiday to take the old missus too," [...] and George chuckled in a manner which evidently meant volumes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak of}} Walter any more," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could control myself. [...] "Oh, Laura, spare us both the wretchedness of talking of him now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Catch another horse--there {{are plenty}} {{good enough for}} a light weight like you, Salamander," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> put my horse to its utmost speed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Go slow, friend--go slow, and heave your lead-line! You {{have got}} out of your channel, and are in shoal water. <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> <b>as</b> how <b>I</b> was betrothed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ere many days," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{terminated}} my musings, [...] "I {{will know}} something of him whose voice seemed {{last night to}} summon me. Letters have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get back, Hans, {{before the}} {{lightning}} shows you," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> slid gently from a mangrove-root into that filthy stream, [...] "and {{tell them to}} keep my coat and trousers dry if they can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Hold fast to the line, Miss Middleton,' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> set my foot {{against a}} {{projecting}} rock. (Please {{note that the}} Air-and-Grass Hero in these stories always calls the Heroine Miss Middleton {{right up to the}} very end.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Jack," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I</b> sorrowfully, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{rubbed the}} mud off my garments, [...] "if we had {{remained}} at home {{this would not}} have happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I answered; [...] "it {{does not}} weigh anything, and I can sling it over my shoulder. By-the-way," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> turning <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{was about to}} leave the room, [...] "I have {{forgotten}} something." [...] I put my hand into my pocket; it would not do to forget that I was, after all, only a departing guest.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is little}} chance of that," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> told you, I have never shot {{pheasants}} before. Still, I'll try, as you wish it." ...|$|R
