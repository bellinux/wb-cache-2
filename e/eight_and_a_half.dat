5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, {{and almost}} the whole diet consists of grasses. Water {{is an essential}} requirement. There are three distinct social groups: the female herds, the bachelor herds and the territorial bulls. They are fast runners, and communicate {{using a variety of}} visual and vocal communication. The primary breeding season for the black wildebeest is from February to April. A single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about <b>eight</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> months. The calf remains with its mother until her next calf is born a year later. The black wildebeest inhabits open plains, grasslands and Karoo shrublands.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily on}} the short grasses. It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations, the animals being fast runners and extremely wary. The mating season begins {{at the end of}} the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about <b>eight</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> months. The calf remains with its mother for eight months, after which time it joins a juvenile herd. Blue wildebeest are found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid. Three African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about <b>eight</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour {{do not move}} away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} maternal imprisonment on children's probability of retention using propensity score matching. The sample consists of children attending Chicago Public Schools during years 1991 and 2004 between grade levels kindergarten and eighth grade. These children have mothers who either enter Illinois state prison or Cook county jail during <b>an</b> <b>eight</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>half</b> year sampling period. The effect of maternal imprisonment is identified using a difference-in-difference strategy on a sample of children matched by different algorithms. I find that children whose mothers enter prison {{are less likely to}} experience grade retention than their matched counterparts at least in the immediate years following the mother's prison entry. These results are robust to different matching schemes as well as to different levels of maternal contact prior to the mother's incarceration. ...|$|R
