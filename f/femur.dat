5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated {{in an attempt to}} avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the <b>femur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Skulls of P. mongoliensis {{are flat}} on top, {{especially}} {{over the back}} of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in P. meileyingensis or P. major (=P. lujiatunensis). P. mongoliensis is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which is probably a juvenile, is 15.2centimetres (6in) long, and the associated <b>femur</b> is 16.2centimetres (6.4in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented <b>femur</b> measuring about 21centimetres (8.25in) long.|$|E

40|$|Male {{and female}} Sprague-Dawley rats {{derived from a}} single mating were raised for three generations under {{constant}} centrifugation at 1. 03 G (Rotation Controls) and at 2 G. When the third generation rats were 3 months old, they were sacrificed, and their <b>femurs</b> removed. After fixation and cleaning, the <b>femurs</b> were then measured for length and diameter. Then right <b>femurs</b> were sectioned longitudinally, left <b>femurs</b> transversely. After staining with Hematoxylin and Eosin, right <b>femurs</b> were examined for ossification patterns and left <b>femurs</b> were measured for cortical thickness. All rotation control rats showed marked stimulation of ossification in the femoral head, and males showed significant cortical thinning when compared to non-rotated earth gravity controls. All 2 G <b>femurs</b> showed decreased length and aspect (L/D) ratios, and increased cortical thickness/diameter ratios when compared to earth controls or rotation controls.

5|$|The {{remains of}} K. guimarotae are stored at the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Free University of Berlin (hereafter IPFUB). Alongside the type {{specimen}} IPFUB Gui Croc 7308 - {{which consists of}} a partial skull with jaws, a vertebra from the sacrum, and two osteoderms - over 400 additional specimens are known, most of them consisting of single isolated bones. Among these, the more complete specimens are IPFUB Gui Gui Croc 7352 (tail vertebrae, <b>femur,</b> osteoderms); 7441 (osteoderms and ulna); 7545 (dorsal vertebrae, ischia, osteoderms); 7564 (<b>femur,</b> humerus, osteoderms); 7634 (dorsal vertebrae, rib, osteoderms); and 8037 (cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and osteoderms). More specimens are known, but they remain unprepared. Some specimens show the marks of scavenging.|$|E
5|$|The thorax bears {{three pairs}} of legs, one pair on each segment. The {{prothorax}} (T1) has a functional spiracle which is actually derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, <b>femur,</b> tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced {{in the case of}} certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three-segmented, as the coxa, trochanter and <b>femur</b> are fused.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused {{to each other and}} to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia was shorter than the <b>femur,</b> giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E

30|$|Previous work by Cristofolini et al. [17] has {{demonstrated}} that the mechanical strength variability of cadaveric <b>femurs</b> may be up to 200 times that of composite synthetic <b>femurs.</b> These results help rationalise our choice in using mainly synthetic bones, which benefit from consistent geometries and mechanical properties. Their use also enabled accurate and reproducible implant positioning. In addition, previous studies have shown they do behave similarly to human <b>femurs</b> in mechanical testing protocols [13, 18 – 20]. Synthetic <b>femurs</b> may thus be a reasonable surrogate for human bone and our cadaveric testing results further support this conclusion.|$|R
5|$|Alexander Vinokourov was the team's leader {{alongside}} Kreuziger. Vinokourov stated {{before the}} season that 2011 would likely be his {{last year as a}} professional rider. He sustained a serious crash at the Tour de France.

5|$|Angular motions (or rotary motions) {{occur when}} an object is around another object {{increasing}} or decreasing the angle. The {{different parts of}} the object do not move the same distance. Examples include a movement of the knee, where the lower leg changes angle compared to the <b>femur,</b> or movements of the ankle.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} Calment {{was still in}} good shape, and {{continued}} to walk (without a cane) until she fractured her <b>femur</b> during a fall at age 114 years 11 months (January 1990), which required surgery. After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair and abandoned her daily routine.|$|E
30|$|No {{macroscopic}} {{injuries were}} detected {{on any of}} the <b>femurs</b> after loading. Fluid redistribution was seen in all <b>femurs</b> on MRI compared with the unloaded control. Injuries were seen in all loaded <b>femurs</b> on microscopic examination of histological samples. Injuries, perpendicularly to the physeal plate and fractures adjacent to the plate, were seen in the vertically loaded specimens. In the antero-superiorly loaded specimen, the injury in the growth plate was parallel to the plate.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of genetic {{and environmental factors}} to variations in bone quality are understood poorly. We tested whether bone brittleness varies with genetic background using the A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J inbred mouse strains. Whole bone four-point bending tests revealed a 70 % decrease in postyield deflection of A/J <b>femurs</b> compared with C 57 BL/ 6 J, indicating that A/J <b>femurs</b> failed in a significantly more brittle manner. Cyclic loading studies indicated that A/J <b>femurs</b> accumulated damage differently than C 57 BL/ 6 J <b>femurs,</b> consistent with their increased brittleness. Differences in matrix composition also were observed between the two mouse strains. A/J <b>femurs</b> had a 4. 5 % increase in ash content and an 11. 8 % decrease in collagen content. Interestingly, a reciprocal relationship was observed between femoral geometry and material stiffness; this relationship {{may have contributed to}} the brittle phenotype of A/J <b>femurs.</b> A/J <b>femurs</b> are more slender than those of C 57 BL/ 6 J femurs; however, their 47 % smaller moment of inertia appeared to be compensated by an increased tissue stiffness at the expense of altered tissue damageability. Importantly, these differences in whole bone mechanical properties between A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J <b>femurs</b> could not have been predicted from bone mass or density measures alone. The results indicated that bone brittleness is a genetically influenced trait and that it is associated with genetically determined differences in whole bone architecture, bone matrix composition, and mechanisms of cyclical damage accumulation.

5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{generally}} similar to H.antimena, the largest living rodent of Madagascar, but even larger, with {{little if any}} overlap in measurements. Grandidier described the extinct species as more robust, with more prominent muscle scars on the long bones and with longer molars with more distinct crests and lobes. The length of the first lower molar is 5.2 to 6.4mm, averaging 5.7mm, in ten H.australis and 3.9 to 5.5mm, averaging 4.8mm, in twenty-four H.antimena. The width of the <b>femur</b> at the proximal (near) end is 18.6 to 21.5mm, averaging 19.9mm, in thirteen H.australis and 16.8 to 18.5mm, averaging 17.5mm, in nine H.antimena. In ten H.australis, total length of the <b>femur</b> is 69.9 to 75.1mm, averaging 72.1mm, compared to 59.7 to 69.9mm, averaging 63.8mm in nine H.antimena.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the <b>femur,</b> which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} <b>femur</b> is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} reported that human neonatal foreskin stromal cells (hNSSCs) promote angiogenesis in vitro and in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay in vivo. To examine the in vivo relevance of this observation, we {{examined in the}} present study the differentiation potential of hNSSCs in ex vivo organotypic cultures of embryonic chick <b>femurs.</b> Isolated embryonic chick <b>femurs</b> (E 10 and E 11) were cultured for 10 days together with micro-mass cell pellets of hNSSCs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or {{a combination of the two}} cell types. Changes in <b>femurs</b> gross morphology and integration of the cells within the <b>femurs</b> were investigated using standard histology and immunohistochemistry. After 10 days, the <b>femurs</b> that were cultured in the presence of hNSSCs alone or hNSSC+HUVEC cells grew longer, exhibited thicker diaphysis and an enlarged epiphyseal region compared to control <b>femurs</b> cultured in the absence of cells. Analysis of cell–femur interactions, revealed intense staining for CD 31 and enhanced deposition of collagen rich matrix along the periosteum in <b>femurs</b> cultured with hNSSCs alone or hNSSCs+HUVEC and the most pronounced effects were observed in hNSSC+HUVEC cultures. Our data suggest that organotypic cultures can be employed to test the differentiation potential of stem cells and demonstrate the importance of stem cell interaction with 3 D-intact tissue microenvironment for their differentiation...|$|R

30|$|The {{replicate}} <b>femurs</b> {{were subjected}} to axial and torsional loading protocols designed to simulate physiological loading (Table  1). Cyclical axial loading was performed at two loading levels (150 and 800  N) on all <b>femurs,</b> during 100  cycles for each load {{at a rate of}} 0.5  Hz. Cyclical torsional loading was thereafter performed in all <b>femurs.</b> Internal rotation around the Z-axis with a cyclical moment loading of 5  Nm at a rate of 0.25  Hz was applied during 100  cycles, with an increasing axial pre-load (Table  1). The different axial preloads were used to simulate no, partial and full weight bearing.|$|R
50|$|In the female, the acetabula, the concave {{surfaces}} {{to which}} the balls of the <b>femurs</b> attach via ligaments, are located farther apart, which increases {{the distance between the}} most outer points of the <b>femurs</b> (their greater trochanters) and thus the width of the hips; female <b>femurs</b> are therefore, more generally angled (laterally, further away from vertical). This greater angle applies a larger portion of the gravitational/vertical load as valgus torque (rotational force against the knee). This, combined with the female's weaker tendons & ligaments and a narrower intercondylar notch, causes increased susceptibility to injury of the ACL in female athletes.|$|R

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Brancasaurus brancai is GPMM A3.B4, stored at the University of Münster. It originates from a clay pit {{near the city}} of Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The specimen was discovered in July 1910 by workers in the clay pit, who dug it out using pickaxes; in doing so, they damaged the specimen (in particular, the pubis had been broken into 176 pieces), and left behind a number of small fragments that were later personally collected by paleontologist Theodor Wegner, who in 1928 described the specimen in detail. The skeleton is fairly complete, consisting of various parts of the skull, most of the vertebrae, several isolated ribs and gastralia, parts of the pectoral and pelvic girdles, both humeri, one <b>femur,</b> and various foot bones from the flippers. Over time, a number of parts have been lost, including several pieces of the skull, teeth, gastralia and caudal vertebrae, a second <b>femur,</b> and a radius, tibia, and fibula. A wax endocast of the brain of the type specimen is stored as SMF R4076 in the Naturmuseum Senckenberg.|$|E
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The <b>femur</b> was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the <b>femur)</b> was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E
