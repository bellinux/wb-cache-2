25|$|The {{variability}} of production {{from a single}} wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, {{as long as the}} correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system.|$|E

25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two.

25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This {{is also the case}} with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.|$|E

25|$|Probably no one {{living in}} the eighth century would have {{predicted}} that the great Mercian empire would be destroyed and that the West Saxons with their poor track record for feuds and infighting within the royal house would emerge as the dominant kingdom in the ninth century. The nobility {{under the influence of}} Alfred became involved with developing the cultural life of their kingdom. As the kingdom became one they brought the monastic and spiritual life of the kingdom under one rule and stricter control. However the Anglo-Saxons believed in 'luck' as a random element in the affairs of man and so would probably have agreed that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the extent one can understand why one kingdom failed while another succeeded. They also believed in 'destiny' and interpreted the fate of the kingdom of England with Biblical and Carolingian ideology, with parallels, between the Israelites, the great European empires and the Anglo-Saxons.

500|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> the {{applicability}} of this lumped element model. [...] The model works well if the components are small enough that the time taken for a wave to cross them is insignificant, or equivalently, {{if there is no}} significant phase difference in the wave either side of the component. [...] What amounts to significant depends on how accurate the model is required to be, but a common rule of thumb is to require components to be smaller than one sixteenth of a wavelength. [...] Since wavelength decreases with frequency, this puts an upper limit on the frequency that can be covered in this kind of design. [...] This limit is much lower in the mechanical domain than the equivalent limit in the electrical domain. [...] This is because the much higher propagation speeds in the electrical domain lead to longer wavelengths (mechanical vibrations in steel propagate at about 6,000m/s, electromagnetic waves in common cable types propagate at about [...] ). [...] For instance, traditional mechanical filters are only made up to around 600kHz (although MEMS devices can operate at much higher frequencies due to their very small size). [...] In the electrical domain, on the other hand, the transition from the lumped element model to the distributed element model occurs in the hundreds of megahertz region.|$|E

You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|E

He prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences, stating in 1999, [...] "I will never make movie-like games"; therefore, the more than 90 total minutes of short cutscenes interspersed throughout Ocarina of Time deliver more interactive cinematic qualities. His vision mandates a rapid and malleable development process with small teams, as when he directed substantial changes to the overall game scenario in the final months {{of the development of}} Ocarina of Time.

2500|$|The {{question}} whether there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> {{the degree of}} coldness possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first addressed by the French physicist Guillaume Amontons in 1702, in connection with his improvements in the air-thermometer. His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury—the volume, or [...] "spring" [...] of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling-point of water at +73 and the melting-point of ice at 51, so that the zero was equivalent to about −240 on the Celsius scale.|$|E
