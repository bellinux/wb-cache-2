40|$|Introduction: Exercise {{disturbs}} the homeostatic {{state of}} the human body causing an increase in heat production which is exacerbated in hyperthermic conditions. Ice vest cooling both before and during exercise has been shown to alleviate thermal strain and attenuate a rise in core temperature. It has been proposed that skin blood flow may be significantly reduced during cooling and blunted during subsequent exercise with increases in skin blood flow, due to exercise, cooling the perfusing blood which abate a rise in core temperature on return. Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether pre-cooling (COOL), with an ice vest, reduces skin blood flow compared to a no cooling control (CON), and whether subsequent exercise and 3 -km performance times in the heat are improved on a cycle ergometer. A secondary aim was to determine the effects of ice vest cooling on the physiological responses during seated rest and heat exposure to observe the responses of cooling without exercise metabolic heat production. Methods: Eight male participants volunteered to take part in the study. The mean (±SD) age, height, weight and maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 max) were; 24. 5 ± 5. 0 years, 178. 7 ± 2. 6 cm, 77. 5 ± 13. 7 kg, and 43. 4 ± 8. 6 ml. min. - 1 kg. - 1, respectively. Ice vest cooling was applied in cool conditions for 20 min prior to exercise and seated rest in the heat (35. 4 ± 0. 4 °C, 26. 3 ± 4. 1 % RH). The intermittent exercise protocol was carried out on a cycle ergometer and consisted of nine × five min bouts of exercise consisting of; 2 min 30 seconds at 40 % V̇O 2 max, 1 min 30 seconds at 60 % V̇O 2 max, 30 seconds at 100 % V̇O 2 max, and 30 seconds of unloaded cycling at a cadence of 70 rev. min. - 1. Following this, a three <b>kilometre</b> <b>performance</b> trial (PT) was performed at a resistance set at 60 % V̇O 2 max with the instruction to complete the distance as fast as possible. Seated rest in the heat was undertake for 45 min. Rectal (Trec) and aural (Taur) temperature, mean skin temperature (Tms), skin blood flow (SkBF), heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO 2), blood lactate ([BLa]), perceived exertion (RPE), thermal strain (RPTS), and profile of mood states (POMS) were recorded throughout the trial. A two-way analysis of analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on both factors (trial × time) was used to determine statistical differences. Results: SkBF was not significantly affected by ice vest cooling at any time point during cooling, seated rest in the heat or exercise trials (P> 0. 05). No significant interactions were observed during cooling for both Taur and Trec (P> 0. 05). Taur throughout the seated rest trial (P 0. 05). Tms and RPTS was significantly lower during cooling compared to CON (P< 0. 01) but did not differ thereafter. No significant difference was observed for performance between trials. Discussion: It appears that the attenuated rise in core temperature is not due to a blunted rise in SkBF during exercise. It is possible that following cooling there is a significant heat sink created at the skin which cools the perfusing blood in the cutaneous circulation which would cool the core on return. Despite this, there were no physiological or POMS data to demonstrate that ice vest cooling improved exercise in hyperthermic conditions. As it was shown in the present study Trec only significantly differed after 45 min of seated rest in the heat following cooling, therefore future research should assess the optimum post cooling time for which exercise should begin...|$|E
5000|$|To {{support his}} 2001 {{independent}} debut album, Back Porch Spirituals, Fisher {{spent six months}} touring from Seattle, across Canada to Halifax, Nova Scotia by bicycle. The tour, dubbed [...] "One Less Tourbus", travelled 7500 <b>kilometres,</b> included 30 <b>performances,</b> and worked with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy {{to raise funds for}} the [...] "Tour des", promoting access to bicycle transport and to education for girls in Africa.

2500|$|A stay at Vilina Vlas {{during a}} visit to Višegrad {{inspired}} the Australian performance artist Kym Vercoe's work [...] "seven <b>kilometres</b> north-east: A <b>performance</b> about geography, tourism and atrocity". In 2013 a film by Jasmila Žbanić and Kym Vercoe For Those Who Can Tell No Tales was released. It shows how the horrific crimes committed against women in Vilina Vlas are being swept under the carpet even today, as the perpetrators remain unpunished and the hotel operates as if nothing had happened.|$|R
5000|$|The eRuf Model A is an all-electric {{sports car}} made by Ruf Automobile. The car {{is powered by}} UQM Technologies [...] {{propulsion}} system (a UQM PowerPhase 150). The car has {{a top speed of}} 225 km/h and it's capable of making 150 kW (201 horsepower) and 479 lb-ft of torque (650 Nm). Estimated range per charge is 250 kilometres to 320 <b>kilometres,</b> depending on <b>performance</b> level, using iron-phosphate, lithium-ion batteries built by Axeon of Great Britain. [...] The power and torque produced by the 3-phase motor can be used to recover almost as much power as it can put out. During coasting the engine works as a generator producing electricity to charge the batteries.Alois Ruf is going to provide a 204 kW brushless three-phase motor which will catapult the Porsche 911 to a speed of 100 km/h in less than 7 seconds, offering a torque of 650Nm.|$|R
30|$|The {{condition}} of line 3 apparently got better in 2011, but eventually deteriorated in 2012. Since, maintenance and renewal (M&R) efforts are often focused on lines with high class and capacity consumption, {{the conditions of}} line 2 and line 3 are, therefore, suspected to be low owing to their low capacity consumption. Line 4 is a mixed and double line on the western region and has maintained a health value greater than 0.6 over the 3  years under consideration. Even though the total length of the track is long, the reported failure frequency has been consistently low and the track quality index is high. These make {{the integrity of the}} line to be considerably good in relation to the average capacity utilisation, however, if the operational capacity is to be further increased, additional M&R measures would be required. The {{condition of}} line 5 is quite good owing to its high health value that is above 0.8 during 2010, 2011 and 2012. It is a line with more than 200 trains per day and high gross tonnage <b>kilometre,</b> yet the <b>performance</b> or condition of the infrastructure is remarkable. An apparent inference is that the M&R practice on this line is effective in relation to the capacity condition and could be extended to other lines. Also, the state of the line is an indication that it is ready to accommodate more traffic as long as possible conflicts can be resolved during timetable simulation.|$|R
