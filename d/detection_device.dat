Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations).

500|$|Ideally, {{at least}} one of the methods {{utilized}} for confirming tracheal tube placement will be a measuring instrument. Waveform capnography has emerged as the gold standard for the confirmation of tube placement within the trachea. Other methods relying on instruments include the use of a colorimetric end-tidal carbon dioxide detector, a self-inflating esophageal bulb, or an esophageal <b>detection</b> <b>device.</b> The distal tip of a properly positioned tracheal tube will be located in the mid-trachea, roughly [...] above the bifurcation of the carina; this can be confirmed by chest x-ray. If it is inserted too far into the trachea (beyond the carina), the tip of the tracheal tube is likely to be within the right main bronchus — a situation often referred to as a [...] "right mainstem intubation".

[...] Launders set about the task, making one risky but calculated decision: he decided to switch off Venturers ASDIC (a then-advanced form of sonar), which would severely limit their ability to detect other submarines, but would greatly reduce the chance of being detected themselves.

2500|$|The German {{inventor}} Christian Hülsmeyer was {{the first}} to use radio waves to detect [...] "the presence of distant metallic objects". [...] In 1904, he demonstrated the feasibility of detecting a ship in dense fog, but not its distance from the transmitter. He obtained a patent for his <b>detection</b> <b>device</b> in April 1904 and later a patent for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship. He also got a British patent on September 23, 1904 for a full radar system, that he called a telemobiloscope. It operated on a 50cm wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a spark-gap.

2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation.

On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether we prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E

2500|$|The common {{intention}} of these {{several types of}} experiments is to first do something that, some interpretations of theory say, would make each photon [...] "decide" [...] whether {{it was going to}} behave as a particle or behave as a wave, and then, before the photon had time to reach the <b>detection</b> <b>device,</b> create another change in the system that would make it seem that the photon had [...] "chosen" [...] to behave in the opposite way. Some interpreters of these experiments contend that a photon either is a wave or is a particle, and that it cannot be both at the same time. Wheeler's intent was to investigate the time-related conditions under which a photon makes this transition between alleged states of being. His work has been productive of many revealing experiments. He may not have anticipated the possibility that other researchers would tend toward the conclusion that a photon retains both its [...] "wave nature" [...] and [...] "particle nature" [...] until the time it ends its life, e.g., by being absorbed by an electron which acquires its energy and therefore rises to a higher-energy orbital in its atom. However, he himself seems to be very clear on this point. He says: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{complementarity}} principle, a photon can manifest {{properties of}} a particle or of a wave, but not {{both at the}} same time. What characteristic is manifested depends on whether experimenters use a device intended to observe particles or to observe waves. When this statement is applied very strictly, one could argue that by determining the detector type one could force the photon to become manifest only as a particle or only as a wave. Detection of a photon is a destructive process because a photon can never be seen in flight. When a photon is detected it [...] "appears" [...] in the consequences of its demise, e.g., by being absorbed by an electron in a photomultiplier that accepts its energy which is then used to trigger the cascade of events that produces a [...] "click" [...] from that device. A photon always appears at some highly localized point in space and time. In the apparatuses that detect photons, the locations on its detection screen that indicate reception of the photon give an indication of {{whether or not it was}} manifesting its wave nature during its flight from photon source to the <b>detection</b> <b>device.</b> Therefore, it is commonly said that in a double-slit experiment a photon exhibits its wave nature when it passes through both of the slits and appears as a dim wash of illumination across the detection screen, and manifests its particle nature when it passes through only one slit and appears on the screen as a highly localized scintillation.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} use of <b>detection</b> <b>devices</b> in entanglement-based state preparation. In {{particular}} we consider optical <b>detection</b> <b>devices</b> such as single-photon sensitivity detectors, single-photon resolution detectors and detector cascades (with {{an emphasis on the}} performance of realistic detectors). We develop an extensive theory for {{the use of}} these devices. In entanglement-based state preparation we perform measurements on subsystems, and we therefore need precise bounds on the distinguishability of these measurements (this is fundamentally different from, e. g., tomography, where an ensemble of identical states is used to determine probability distributions, etc.). To this end, we introduce the confidence of preparation, which may also be used to quantify the performance of <b>detection</b> <b>devices</b> in entanglement-based preparation. We give a general expression for detector cascades of arbitrary size for the detection up to two photons. We show that, contrary to the general belief, cascading does not give a practical advantage over detectors with single-photon resolution in entanglement-based state preparation.

40|$|Metallic {{nanostructures}} {{have been}} investigated with various applications especially for integration with light <b>detection</b> <b>devices.</b> The incident light can be manipulated by those nanostructures to enhance light absorption therefor improve device performance. However, previous studies focused on optical design. The electrical properties of these integrated light <b>detection</b> <b>devices</b> have not been fully considered. The photon generated carriers transport and collection are critical for light <b>detection</b> <b>devices</b> as well. An optimized device platform considering from both the optical and electrical aspects to fully utilize these nanostructures is highly desired for future light <b>detection</b> <b>devices.</b> This dissertation targeted on three objectives, beginning with the fabrication process development of various nanostructures on different substrates. High quality nanostructures were achieved with minimum 20 nm gap and 45 nm line width. The second objective was developing the metallic fishnet nanostructures integrated Schottky contact a-Si solar cell to improve both light absorption and photon generated carrier collection. The fishnet was designed as the light trapping structure and 2 D connected top contact to collect carriers. The third objective was developing metallic nanostructures integrated GeSn photodetectors. The H shape nano antennas were integrated on GeSn photodetectors. Multiple resonant absorption peaks at infrared range were observed using spectroscopic ellipsometry. However, there was no obvious photoresponse value improvement of developed solar cells and H shape antennas integrated GeSn photodetectors. For further investigation, interdigitated electrodes integrated GeSn photodetectors were designed. With less carrier transit time, the responsivity value of the integrated Ge 0. 991 Sn 0. 009 photodetector was 72 µA/W at 1. 55 µm at room temperature which was 6 times higher comparing to device without integration. Meanwhile, with the increased carrier life time by decreasing temperature, the responsivity value of integrated Ge 0. 93 Sn 0. 07 detectors at 1. 55 µm at 100 K was 8. 5 mA/W which was 200 {{times higher than the}} value at 300 K. These results suggest relative large surface recombination rate was the dominant loss mechanism in metallic nanostructures integrated light <b>detection</b> <b>devices,</b> as the ratio of carrier life time and transit time determines the gain of photodetector.
