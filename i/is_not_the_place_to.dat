5|$|This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> pass judgements, {{but perhaps}} I may say that, {{as it seems}} to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
500|$|A Fast-Track {{audition}} {{that was}} to be held at SM City Sta. Mesa was canceled, leading to complaints from hopefuls and their parents. [...] After hours of waiting, a representative of ABC arrived and relocated each of the 160 frustrated applicants to other scheduled screening. [...] Meanwhile, Filipinos living in Mindanao reacted negatively to what Philippine Idol judges said after a low Gold Pass turnout at the Davao Main Auditions, with Corrales (a Cebuana herself) saying that [...] "Davao <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> look for an Idol" [...] and [...] "all the good ones are in Cebu". [...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output. She added that [...] "Davao's best talents" [...] might have probably auditioned earlier in Manila.|$|E
2500|$|The G8 {{summit is}} an {{international}} event which is observed and reported by news media, but the G8's continuing relevance after more than 30 years is somewhat unclear. More than one analyst suggests that a G-8 summit <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> flesh {{out the details of}} any difficult or controversial policy issue {{in the context of a}} three-day event. Rather, the meeting offers an opportunity to bring a range of complex and sometimes inter-related issues.

2500|$|This {{preference}} for book learning {{and lack of}} intense involvement {{in the world around}} him were detrimental to Mackintosh's later career, even though he drifted back to a more liberal political stance. Hazlitt, who heard him speak in Parliament, observes that, just as his previous appointment as a judge in India was unsuited to a man who worked out his thought in terms of [...] "school-exercises", Mackintosh's mind did not fit well the defender of political causes, which needed more passionate engagement. [...] "Sir James is by education and habit and ... by the original turn of his mind, a college-man [...] in public speaking the logician takes place of the orator". Hazlitt recalls having heard him speak publicly in the House of Commons [...] "seldom ... without pain for the event." [...] The House <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> speak only the truth. Too much [...] "interest" [...] rather than pure [...] "love of truth" [...] enters into the decisions made in Parliament. And [...] "the judgment of the House is not a balance to weigh scruples and reasons to the turn of a fraction. ... Sir James, in detailing the inexhaustible stores of his memory and reading, in unfolding the wide range of his theory and practice, in laying down the rules and the exceptions, in insisting upon the advantages and the objections with equal explicitness, would be sure to let something drop that a dexterous and watchful adversary would easily pick up and turn against him...." ...|$|E

He (Lin 2008 : 76) thinks that (8) is a clause of occurrence, with Wáng Miǎn as the locative subject. But Lin (2008) is an exclusive study of the locative subject in Chinese.
