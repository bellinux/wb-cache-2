40|$|Life {{insurance}} {{is one of}} the most heavily regulated businesses in the United States economy. Because of the industry’s importance to American families, to our economy, and to our tax system, policy decisions that affect life insurance products receive a great deal of scrutiny. That scrutiny is likely to increase in the wake of recent insolvencies. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for evaluating tax and regulatory policies in the life insurance market. Life Insurance Products Life insurance companies are in the business of providing risk coverage and investing the customer’s savings. Traditionally, they offer <b>insurance</b> <b>against</b> three kinds of risk: (1) <b>Insurance</b> <b>against</b> early death, which by analogy to <b>insurance</b> <b>against</b> fire should have been called death insurance, but in a masterstroke of salesmanship was called life insurance; (2) <b>Insurance</b> <b>against</b> living too long, provided by life annuities...|$|R

Second, to what extent does the public sector reduce long-term differences between regions?
