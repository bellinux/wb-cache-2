50|$|The Indian Forest Act, 1927 {{was largely}} based on {{previous}} Indian Forest Acts implemented under the British. The most famous one was the Indian Forest Act of 1878. Both the 1878 act and the 1927 one sought to consolidate and reserve the areas having forest cover, or significant wildlife, to regulate movement and transit of forest produce, and duty leviable on timber and other forest produce. It also defines the procedure to be followed for declaring an area to be a Reserved Forest, a Protected Forest or a Village Forest. It defines what is a <b>forest</b> <b>offence,</b> what are the acts prohibited inside a Reserved Forest, and penalties leviable on violation of {{the provisions of the}} Act.|$|E
40|$|The {{documented}} {{analysis of}} the forest offences revealed eight <b>forest</b> <b>offence</b> types with prevalent cases being chainsaw milling, illegal logging and illegal farming. Between 2005 and 2010, the district recorded 121 offences with more offences occurring in the on-reserve areas than in the off-reserve areas. The timber species, which was most exploited illegally is Triplochiton scleroxylon (wawa), a scarlet star-rated species, which is under imminent economic threat. Analyses of the official records revealed lapses in record keeping {{since there are no}} references to the outcomes of most offences, especially those relating to cases under investigation by the Police and Regional Forest Services Division. A call for capacity development of the frontline staff of the Forest Services Division at the District levels is paramount especially in detecting, collecting, entering and analyzing forest offences cases and outcomes as well as training in forest investigation and incident management. Furthermore, equipping the district offices with the requisite technological equipment like computers and accessories, software and real-time Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers will enhance effective monitoring and data management of forest resources especially when Ghana is committed in ensuring timber legality under the Voluntary Partnership Agreement...|$|E

40|$|This article {{study the}} {{discrepancy}} between theory and practice, especially the roles play by Land Office and Forestry Department in term of overlapping of power and penalties between Land Office and Forestry Department especially the forest on the state land leading to susceptibility in monitoring and enforcement system. The whole empirical works {{took place in the}} Central Region of Peninsular Malaysia namely as Negeri Sembilan. The total area of permanent reserved forest in that state is 155, 531 hectares including the Permanent Reserved Forest Johol which was selected as the case study in this research. An exploratory research design was adopted in this research. Therefore, in-depth interviews have been done with officers from the Land Office and Forestry Department regarding their role and powers in monitoring and enforcement system to combat <b>forest</b> <b>offences</b> in Permanent Reserved Forest Johol. While data collected was analyzed using the descriptive analysis method. Content analysis was used to identify the similarities and dissimilarities of acts that empower Land Office and Forestry Department to taking action against <b>forest</b> <b>offences.</b> Theoretically, there are overlapping powers occurs between Land Office and Forestry Department identified in National Land Code 1965 and National Forestry Act 1984 in terms of arrestment of the forest offenders and seized their equipment. However, penalties imposed by both acts are very different. Practically, both authorities have divided their responsibility and power accordingly to avoid overlapping. Issues and challenges that faced by them have been found {{and most of them are}} similar. There should be an amendment to the acts in terms of the penalty imposed by both authorities. The penalty stated in both acts should be synchronized or the related sections be removed if the authorities do not implement it practically to avoid overlapping and conflicting of action imposed between two acts.

5000|$|In 1300 many (if not all) forests were perambulated {{and reduced}} greatly in their extent, in theory to their extent {{in the time}} of Henry II. However, this {{depended}} on the determination of local juries, whose decisions often excluded from the Forest lands described in Domesday Book as within the forest. Successive kings tried to recover the [...] "purlieus" [...] excluded from a forest by the Great Perambulation of 1300. Forest officers periodically fined the inhabitants of the purlieus for failing to attend Forest Court or for <b>forest</b> <b>offences.</b> This led to complaints in Parliament. The king promised to remedy the grievances, but usually did nothing.|$|R
500|$|A great {{council was}} called in October and November {{to take stock of}} the post-war situation; this council is thought to have {{formulated}} and issued the Charter of 1217. The charter resembled that of 1216, although some additional clauses were added {{to protect the rights of}} the barons over their feudal subjects, and the restrictions on the Crown's ability to levy taxation were watered down. There remained a range of disagreements about the management of the royal forests, which involved a special legal system that had resulted in a source of considerable royal revenue; complaints existed over both the implementation of these courts, and the geographic boundaries of the royal forests. A complementary charter, the Charter of the Forest, was created, pardoning existing <b>forest</b> <b>offences,</b> imposing new controls over the forest courts, and establishing a review of the forest boundaries. To distinguish the two charters, the term magna carta libertatum, [...] "the great charter of liberties", was used by the scribes to refer to the larger document, which in time became known simply as Magna Carta.|$|R

Edmund met {{the cost of this}} campaign with loans from Italian merchants of about Â£10,000. In June 1289 Edmund mediated between Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, in a dispute over the Welsh marches between their lands, and forbade de Clare to build a castle at Morlais in Brecknockshire. Edward's return to England was followed by an inquiry into wrongdoings by the government during his absence, and though several judges and officials were disgraced, Edmund was retrospectively pardoned for any <b>forest</b> <b>offences</b> and allowed to answer by proxy any complaints against his administration in Cornwall, where he was High Sheriff from 1289 to 1300.|$|R

50|$|At {{some time}} under {{the kings of}} Mercia an area in {{the centre of the}} parish was {{enclosed}} for use as a royal hunting park, known as Feckenham Park, and this certainly existed by the time of Domesday, when indeed all the parish was regarded as in the Royal Forest of Feckenham. However, in 1301 the area of the Forest was reduced, and from that time till dissaforestation in 1629 only that part of the parish lying to the east of Church Hill was in the Forest.

40|$|This study appraises taungya farming as a {{sustainable}} land-use option in Vandeikya Local Government (VLG) forest estates, Variations in the yield of agricultural crops over time (years), incidences of annual <b>forest</b> fires, <b>forest</b> <b>offences</b> {{as well as}} changes in forest area between 1955 and 2000 were assessed. Six out of 12 council wards in VLG were randomly selected for the survey through multi-stage random sampling. A total of 200 farmer respondents were sampled out of a taungya farmer population of 562 in the selected wards. All the 16 members {{of staff of the}} VLG forestry service were interviewed. The two categories of respondents were then interviewed using the same type of semi-structured questionnaire. This was to check and corroborate the responses of both groups of respondents. Data collected was subjected to descriptive statistics (like percentages) and inferential statistics [such as analysis of variances (ANOVA) ]. The mean yields of yam, cassava, sweet potatoes, rice, maize, groundnuts, soybeans, guinea corn, beans, pepper and melon on taungya plots ranged from 306. 67 kg/ha for melon to 1698. 33 kg/ha for cassava. The corresponding yields of melon and cassava on non-taungya plots were 250. 00 kg/ha and 1372. 67 kg/ha, respectively. Crop yields were significantly higher on most taungya plots except that of melon (p> 0. 05). The total forest area declined from 312. 9 ha in 1995 to 83. 5 ha in 2000. Reforestation with indigenous tree species, establishment of seed and clonal banks, adoption of socially and ecologically acceptable taungya practices, review of land tenure laws and sensitization of farmers on sustainable taungya practices are advocated...|$|R
40|$|Forestry {{sector is}} highly {{influenced}} by the economical, political, demographical and social factors rather than the labor force in the sector. This situation necessitates the management of forest resources on sustainable basis to guarantee the continuous flow of forest products to present and future generations. Natural resources, particularly forests, are deteriorating at alarming rates due to several factors among which is the irrational use exploitation of forests resources. Accordingly, the concept of joint management emerged as a reasonable remedy. Suntubar forest in Gezira State (ELHAJ ALDALL PROVINCE) was selected for this research. The broad objective of the research is to investigate the potentiality of the local people {{in the management of}} forest resource through joint management approach. Two types of data were collected for this research, namely; primary data and secondary data. The primary data represented in surveying, inventory and social survey. The main findings of the research are; the local people are capable of managing Suntubar forest through their involvement in silvicultural thinning, production thinning, broadcasting and protection of the forest. The effectiveness of the joint management is represented in the sharp decline of the <b>forest</b> <b>offences</b> and creation of job opportunities to the local people. The main risk confronting the joint management approach is the felling program of the FNC, after two years all the standing trees will be felled and this will hampere the sustainability of the joint management approach. The main conclusions of this research is; the FNC has not adopted the joint management approach on scientific basis, the FNC adopted the approach as a mean to attain certain goals due to its bankruptcy. Moreover, it is difficult if not impossible to adopt the intervention of joint-management approach in the absence of specialization extension unit...|$|R
5|$|Neville {{was present}} at the Council of Clarendon, where he was among the king's followers. Neville was one of the {{witnesses}} to the Constitutions of Clarendon, which came out of the Council. In 1166 he was named chief forester of the royal forests, an office that was responsible for the royal officials in charge of administrating the forests as well as the system of royal courts that enforced the forest law. Neville headed the royal efforts to enforce the forest law, which banned cutting down timber, clearing new farm fields, poaching, or the creation of enclosures within the royal <b>forest.</b> Any <b>offences</b> against the <b>forest</b> law were subject to monetary fines, which were an important source of royal revenue. The royal forest included not only the forests owned by the king, but also many forests on lands held by other persons. After Neville's appointment as chief forester, {{he was in charge of}} hearing <b>offences</b> against the <b>forest</b> law and also imposing punishments. His activities were resented by the people subject to forest law.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{community}} forest is {{the property of}} the community so that the right to use and protect is vested on the local people. For example, the local people organized guards to monitor adherence to the rules. The community itself pays the salary of the guards. The forest guards patrol the community <b>forest</b> and report <b>offences</b> to the villagers. In addition, each villager takes an interest in {{what is going on in}} the {{community forest}}. For example, villagers enforce protection through participation and sanctions. These are reinforced by customary rules and are constituted at the village level through the involvement of village elders, who are perceived as the wise persons in the community. Traditional leaders also establish themselves as important stakeholders at community-level undertakings gelagay dagna (i.e. âmediating jurorâ). Moreover, local institutions at community and village level played a part in resolving conflicts and constraining wrongdoers. For example, accused persons were given an opportunity to defend themselves and have the right to appeal. The level of penalties varied with the violation of customary rules, which were subject to graded sanctions based on the seriousness and the context of an offence. For example, illicit tree felling, grazing in a non-grazing area, and grazing out of season carried a heavy penalty in the form of deterrent fines, social exclusion, and confiscation of valuable property. However, less destructive activities, such as unauthorized use of the forest for farm implements and collection of branches for fuelwood, carried lighter penalties.|$|R
