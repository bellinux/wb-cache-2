50|$|The ventricles are histologically and {{electrically}} {{isolated from the}} atria by the unique and electrically impermeable collagen layers of connective tissue known as the cardiac skeleton. The bulwarks of this entity stem from the central body to form the four valve rings. Collagen extensions from the valve rings seal and limit atrial electrical influence from ventricular electrical influence to the SA/AV/Purkinje pathways. Exceptions such as accessory pathways may occur in this firewall between atrial and ventricular electrical influence but are rare.The compromised load of atrial fibrillation detracts from overall performance but the ventricles continue {{to work as a}} physiologically effective pump. Given this pathology, ejection fraction may deteriorate by ten to thirty percent. Uncorrected atrial fibrillation can lead to heart rates approaching 200 beats per minute. If one can slow this rate down to a normal range of approximately 80 beats per minute, the filling time of the <b>heart</b> <b>cycle</b> is longer and confers additional benefit to the pumping ability of the heart. Breathless individuals with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation can be rapidly returned to normal breathing when conversion with medication or electrical cardioversion is attempted.Pharmacological manipulation of rate control, for example, by beta blocker|beta adrenoceptor antagonists, non-dyhydropyridine calcium channel blockers and digoxin are important historical interventions in this condition. Individuals prone to a hypercoagulable state are at a decided risk of thromboembolism, thus requiring therapy with warfarin for life if the defined pathology cannot be corrected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Heart {{motion is}} a crucial problem in cardiac to-mographic cone-beam image reconstruction. It {{requires}} special treatment to avoid motion related image artifacts. Analytic and iterative algorithms for approximative and exact motion compensated 3 -D reconstruction are known. The estimation of the motion field from the projection data is still an open problem. The inherent assumption of recent publications is a periodic heart motion. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used as an estimate for the periodically repeating heart phase. In those approaches the heart motion is averaged over several <b>heart</b> <b>cycles.</b> As a consequence heart beat variabilities cannot be captured. However, frequently arrhytmic <b>heart</b> <b>cycles</b> {{can be observed in}} a clinical environment. In addition breathing motion can still occur. We present a reconstruction method based on a 4 -D time-continuous B-spline motion field which is parameterized by the acquisition time and not the quasi-periodic heart phase. A time-correlated objective function is introduced which measures the error between the measured projection data and the dynamic forward projection of the motion compensated reconstruction. For reconstruction an analytic motion compensation algorithm is used. Our objective function formulation exploits the fact that the desired motion compensated reconstruction is totally determined by a given motion field. The motion model parameters are estimated using an iterative optimization scheme. Simulation results are provided for a synthetic cardiac vasculature phantom undergoing deformable motion which could be well recovered using the presented framework without using the ECG and assuming periodicity of the motion.

40|$|Abstract. Percutaneous transluminal {{coronary}} angioplasty (PTCA) requires both pre-interventional cine-angiograms showing the contrasted vessel tree over several <b>heart</b> <b>cycles,</b> and live X-ray monitoring (fluoroscopy) during the catheterization. Navigation during the intervention can be facilitated by fusing the automatically synchronized cineangiogram with the interventional images, e. g. by overlaying the synchronized angiogram over the interventional images. Clearly, this fusion {{should be limited}} to those frames of the angiogram which show the full contrasted vessel tree. Conversely, if contrast agent appears in the fluoroscopy images, overlay is not required and should be switched off. To these ends, we describe approaches for the detection and processing of contrast agent injections in cardiac X-ray image sequences. ...|$|R

A week later upon taking the drugs, it becomes necessary to make an additional diagnostics of the patient to complete the basic diagnostic evaluation. The reason was that upon taking the drugs there were some cases of loss of consciousnes reported by the patient.

The recommendations given upon the diagnostics were aimed at recovering the transport function of the blood vessels.

40|$|Phonocardiographic signals contain bioacoustic {{information}} {{reflecting the}} operation of the heart. Normally there are two heart sounds, and additional sounds indicate disease.

40|$|Stethoscopes are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used medical devices for diagnosing heart conditions because they are inexpensive, noninvasive, and light enough to be carried around by a clinician. Auscultation with a stethoscope requires considerable skill and experience, but the introduction of digital stethoscopes allows for the automation of this task. Auscultation waveform segmentation, which is the process of determining the boundaries of heart sound and murmur segments, is the primary challenge in automating the diagnosis of various heart conditions. The purpose of this thesis is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of established techniques for detecting, segmenting, and classifying heart sounds and murmurs in digitized phonocardiogram audio files. Two separate segmentation techniques based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the simplicity transform are integrated into a MATLAB software system that is capable of automatically detecting and classifying sound segments. The performance of the two segmentation methods for recognizing normal heart sounds and several different heart murmurs is compared by quantifying the results with clinical and technical metrics. The two clinical metrics are the false negative detection rate (FNDR) and the false positive detection rate (FPDR), which count <b>heart</b> <b>cycles</b> rather than sound segments. The wavelet and simplicity methods have a 4 % and 9 % respective FNDR, so it is unlikely that either method would not detect a heart condition. However, the 22 % and 0 % respective FPDR signifies that the wavelet method is likely to detect false heart conditions, while the simplicity method is not. The two technical metrics are the true murmur detection rate (TMDR) and the false murmur detection rate (FMDR), which count sound segments rather than <b>heart</b> <b>cycles.</b> Both methods are equally likely to detect true murmurs given their 83 % TMDR. However, the 13 % and 0 % respective FMDR implies that the wavelet method is susceptible to detecting false murmurs, while the simplicity method is not. Simplicity-based segmentation, therefore, demonstrates superior performance to wavelet-based segmentation, as both are equally likely to detect true murmurs, but only the simplicity method has no chance of detecting false murmurs...|$|R

A small fluid-filled balloon attached to a monitoring catheter was placed between the myocar-dium and the DCMP wrap. The catheter ended in a subcutaneous access port used for pressure monitoring. Sharp pressure signals produced by the contracting DCMP were obtained in all animals {{at the beginning of the}} study. An 86 % reduction of the initial amplitude of {{the pressure}} curve occurred after six months of stimulation in two goats. In the third goat, no contraction could be verified, and the DCMP was considered failed. Pressure signals transferred from the contracting myocardium could be characterized into defined segments of contraction, ejection and filling. This information allows mechanical synchronization of the DCMP contraction with the desired period of the <b>heart</b> <b>cycle.</b> The DCMP monitoring catheter successfully tranferred signals relating to the functional state of the DMCP wrap and its mechanical coupling to the <b>heart</b> <b>cycle.</b> We expect that with the use of this catheter we can better understand and optimize DMCP as a therapy for end-stage heart failure.

The catheter was connected to a subcutaneous measuring chamber whereby pressure monitoring could be accomplished. Distinct pressure signals as a result of function of the dynamic cardiomyoplasty and the heart were detected initially in all animals. Results: Maximal relative pressure from the dynamic cardiomyoplasty was calculated as 336. 2 % ± 69. 4 % on day 24 ± 6. 1 (n = 7) and end-stage pressure as 59. 8 % ± 9. 7 % on day 174. 6 ± 13. 1 (n = 4). A functional loss of pressure signals from the dynamic cardiomyoplasty was correlated to severe histologic muscle damage (n = 3).

Time resolution in this system is high; therefore, we can evaluate regional function of myo-cardium muscle. In clinic, peak velocities of iso-volumic, systolic, and diastolic phases of <b>heart</b> <b>cycle</b> are conventionally measured to diagnose and dis-criminate heart diseases. Other studies have shown the sensitivity and specificity of this method to be 70 and 80 percent. However, there is no report of the absolute displacement variation of myocardium in total <b>heart</b> <b>cycle.</b> Materials & Methods: The {{purpose of this study}} was an integral assessment of time-velocity profile from TDE images during systolic and diastolic phases of <b>heart</b> <b>cycle</b> as a new method for evaluation of total absolute displacement of myocardium muscle based on numerical integral. We also used results of some integral function for evaluation of this method. For this reason, we proposed a computer algorithm based on trapezoid sums and translated it to a computer program using image processing toolbox of Matlab- 7 software. For assessment of approximation of this method, we examined equal widths of 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, 10 -, 15 -, 20 -, 25 -, and 30 - pixel steps for estima-tion of the area under time-velocity curves (each pixel was equal to 4 ms). The results of 1 to 5 pixels were close to each other (coefficient of variation: 0. 2 %). For assessment of accuracy, polynomial of or-ders one to four and exponential function were plot-ted using the mathematical toolbox of Mathlab- 7, and the results saved as bitmap images. Then, we calcu-lated the approximate value of area under curve using the proposed algorithm and calculated the error value as the absolute difference between approximate and real results divided by real results (&# 61617; 0. 5 %). Echocar-diographic recordings (time-velocity profiles) were obtained in basal and middle segments of interven-tricular septum of a 44 -year-old man suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD) using standard four-chamber view, according to the guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography at end expira-tion with 3 MHz sector transducer at 210 frames per second, and electrocardiogram were recorded simultaneously. The time-velocity curves were saved as full-color images and were transferred to a personal computer for off-line analysis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The problem {{considered}} is that {{of trying}} to determine the potential distribution inside a human torso {{as a result of}} the heart's electrical activity. Due to the material properties of the biological tissues involved and the relatively slow frequency of the <b>heart's</b> <b>cycle,</b> the governing equation to be solved for the potential in the torso outside the heart is the generalised Laplace equation. (s f) = 0 (1) where f is the potential and s is the conductivity tensor. The most common numerical methods used to solve this equation inside a human torso are the finite element method (FEM) [1], [2] and the boundary element method (BEM) [3]-[5]. Both techniques have their relative merits for this problem. The FEM handles the highly anisotropic muscle regions well, while the BEM is more efficient in electrically isotropic and homogeneous regions (e. g. the lungs).
