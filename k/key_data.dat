40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a demonstrator system to provide secure multicast pay-per-view TV over Internet, to prove that it can be developed with existing technologies. In these pay-per-view systems, there is a single server sending the audio/video data, and a set of clients that can receive this data only if they have paid for that specific transmission. The main problem in such a system is the management and distribution of the <b>keying</b> <b>data</b> to the clients in a secure way, including rekeying when a user leaves the group. Standardisation of <b>keying</b> <b>data</b> exchange and rekeying mechanisms for multicast groups by IETF Multicast Security Working Group (MSEC) is still on draft stage ([MSEC-Draft] and [MSEC-DoI]). We propose a system that integrates different existing technologies into a Linux-based environment. Video and audio are transmitted using RTP real time protocol [RTP] through multicast IPSec [IPSec] protocols: multicast for bandwidth efficiency, and IPSec for privacy and authentication of the audio/video data. Secure rekeying data exchange between the server and the client is done through an innovative combination of technologies: Multicast messages from the server to the client for notification of <b>keying</b> <b>data</b> updates; authenticated and encrypted TLS-Tunnel [TLS] connection between the clients and the server for requesting the new keys (that are only sent to the clients that have paid for receiving that specific transmission); and IPSEC keying updating through direct interaction with IPSEC SAD database. ...|$|R
