40|$|The {{feasibility}} of employing a single laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) system to remotely measure one-, two-, and three-dimensional velocity components in atmospheric flow fields is presented. A focused continuous wave CO 2 laser emitting at the 10. 6 mu wavelength {{is used as}} the laser source. Scan configurations employed by the LDV system were single-point, two-point, conical, and spiral conical. Test results are presented, which include favorable comparisons of velocity components measured by conventional anemometry and the LDV system.

5|$|This day a <b>dense</b> <b>fog</b> {{obscured}} everything. Things a foot away {{could not}} be made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. The frightening waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up into the blue sky and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and <b>dense</b> <b>fog.</b> Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could {{look down on the}} Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless, and that he could not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E

60|$|The weather on {{the east}} side of the range differs at this season remarkably from that on the west, where the {{vicinity}} of the sea keeps the atmosphere more humid and warm, and at the same time prevents the formation of the <b>dense</b> <b>fogs</b> that hang over the valleys to the eastward every morning at sunrise. We found the mean temperature at the bungalow, from January 9th till the 13th, to be 70.2 degrees.|$|R
5|$|A <b>dense</b> <b>fog</b> {{helped to}} cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{deployed}} special police forces, {{specifically the}} Lučko, Rakitje and Sljeme special police units based {{in and around}} Zagreb, supported by additional police forces drawn from Karlovac and Gospić to retake the Plitvice Lakes area. The Croatian police force, commanded by Josip Lucić, used several buses and passenger cars, {{as well as an}} armoured personnel carrier to approach the Plitvice Lakes area. The main 180-strong group of the Rakitje Special Police Unit (SPU), directly commanded by Lucić, arrived in <b>dense</b> <b>fog,</b> along the main road from Zagreb via the Korana River bridge. The bridge was secured by the Lučko unit shortly before midnight on 30/31 March 1991. An auxiliary force approached the Plitvice Lakes via Ličko Petrovo Selo, while the Kumrovec SPU was deployed in the area between the lakes and Gospić, where it captured the Ljubovo Pass to secure the right flank of the main effort. The total attacking force comprised approximately 300 troops.|$|E
5|$|West Avenal {{departed}} Norfolk on {{a voyage}} to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but {{was forced to}} return to port after suffering an engine breakdown. Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship crop up in contemporary news accounts. In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the newspaper reported that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a <b>dense</b> <b>fog</b> {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. More than two weeks later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later showed her arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and <b>dense</b> <b>fog.</b> There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E

This method works in <b>dense</b> <b>fogs</b> (meteorological visibility distances < 400 m) with a single image and three known light sources. The method is validated on synthetic images generated with a semi Monte-Carlo ray tracing software dedicated to fog simulation.

The fact was found form another experiment that the fog generated by dry ice disappeared as soon as applying the high voltage. In this experiment, we examined the fog quenching characteristics which depend on an applied voltage, the distance of both electrode, the mesh size of the electrode net and the fog conditions. It is found that the high voltage applying is very effective for the quenching in the static and the flowing conditions and the local electric field plays the important role in it. 現在の自動車社会において，高速道路に発生した霧は様々な交通障害を引き起こしている。この霧の問題を解決することは重要な課題である。ドライアイスを用いて発生させた霧に高電圧をかけると霧が消えるという事実は他の実験から見付けられた。この実験では，電極間電圧，電極間隔，電極網目の大きさ，霧の状態と消霧の特性の関係を調べた。この結果高電圧を印加することは静止または流動しているどちらの状態の霧の消滅に対しでも大変効果的であり，局部電界が非常に重要な役割を果たしていることが分かった...|$|R
