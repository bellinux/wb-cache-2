And even <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has since}} been {{replaced}} {{with a number of}} smaller displays available to the public in the reception area showing some traditional Scouting skills, a notable collection of Baden-Powell memorabilia has been on display in the past for visitors in 'The story of B-P' exhibition. This included many drawings and letters by Baden-Powell himself, such as the original of his , Laws <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am old and several first editions of his books. The former exhibition also displayed the original painting by David Jagger, as presented to Baden-Powell on 29 August 1929 at the 'Coming of Age' 3rd World Scout Jamboree. This painting, a personal favourite of Baden-Powell, is often used in publications throughout the Scout movement. The Baden-Powell memorabilia has since been moved to the headquarters for Scouting in the UK, Gilwell Park.|$|E

2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Seder is {{a ritual}} {{performed}} by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling {{of the story of}} the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. [...] This story is in the Book of Exodus (Shemot) in The Hebrew Bible. [...] The Seder itself is based on the Biblical verse commanding Jews to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt: [...] "You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came out of Egypt.'" [...] (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the Haggadah, an ancient work derived from the Mishnah (Pesahim 10). The Haggadah contains the narrative of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, special blessings and rituals, commentaries from the Talmud, and special Passover songs.|$|E

2500|$|Rabban Gamaliel {{said that}} one needed to mention three things on Passover to {{discharge}} one's duty: the Passover offering, unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah), and bitter herbs (maror). The Passover offering was sacrificed because God passed over the Israelites' houses in Egypt. They ate unleavened bread because the Israelites were redeemed from Egypt. And they ate bitter herbs because the Egyptians embittered {{the lives of the}} Israelites in Egypt. In every generation, all were bound to regard themselves as though they personally had gone out of Egypt, because [...] says, [...] "You shall tell your child in that day: ‘It is because of what the Lord did <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came out of Egypt.'" [...] Therefore, it was everyone's duty to thank and praise God for performing those miracles for the Israelites and their descendants. God brought them forth from bondage into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning into festivity, from darkness into light, and from servitude into redemption. Therefore, they were to say hallelujah! ...|$|E
