40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s {{the concept of}} "corridor" has been an architectonic element of <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policies.</b> The trans-European corridors, as {{continental}} scale infrastructures, are not yet operational. They already became, however, a category for network analysis at different scales, especially at urban level. The notion of "major axis" {{as it is now}} assumed, just as the quest for an increased role in the future, leads the cities towards a particular urban development, building out an idea of "corridor" based on economic and symbolic considerations rather than on the achievement of the railway infrastructure. The fact is that the "corridor" actually becomes an argument for increased attractiveness of the city and almost a sort of label. Therefore, the notion of corridor shifts from the infrastructure to the cities on its route. The affected territory has another scale, as if a European scale network were symbolised by a few places...|$|R
40|$|Until the mid- 1980 s, {{transport}} policy was {{considered by many}} {{as one of the}} least successful domains of the European integration project. However, from the early 1990 s onwards, there are clear signs of a single <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policy,</b> along with the accompanying implementation of infrastructure projects. What is the explanation for such a change in pace? This paper aims to offer insight in these processes by looking at the mechanisms which form and transform this policy domain. To understand the state of a policy domain and its dynamics over time an institutional approach is taken. Two concepts in political science, ‘policy arrangements’ and ‘supranational governance’ are combined and used as a framework to analyse the <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policy</b> domain. This analysis describes the development of several elements: organisations, rules, the transnational society, power, resources, and the central transport discourse. It demonstrates that all of these elements have developed from an intergovernmental setting towards a more supranational one. This development was slow in the first decennia when <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policy</b> was rather passive, but it picked up speed in the 1980 s and 1990 s. In the pivotal year of 1985, pressure from the transnational society resulted in a rapid change of the rules, the resources and the discourse...|$|E

40|$|To {{integrate}} electromobility into modern urban mobility, it {{is necessary}} to assess the usability and potential of hybrid, plug-in and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to meet urban mobility requirements, as well as their impact on electric distribution grid. Despite the progress that has been made in this field over the last decade, many technical issues still need to be addressed. This paper presents the results of a large-scale analysis of real-world driving data from activity databases, anonymously collected by Global Positioning System devices installed on conventional fuel vehicles. These data were processed to derive whether different types of BEVs and recharging strategies can meet urban mobility needs. The impact of the electric energy demand on the grid from a partially electrified urban fleet has also been addressed. The study involves approximately 28, 000 vehicles, 4. 5 million trips and 36 million kilometres in the Italian provinces of Modena and Firenze, monitored over a one-month period (i. e. May 2011).

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} megatrends {{that are}} shaping international trade, logistics organization and (multi) modal transport in Europe. It focuses on {{impacts on the}} European context, both from the peculiarities arising from the European uniﬁcation process and the <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policies</b> but also {{taking into account the}} highly fragmented transport market that tries to cope with the increased level of congestion, the threat of increasing taxes and fuel prices as well as the ever increasing service requirements. The main message of this chapter is that there is an increasing need for consolidation and collaboration in supply chains resulting in hybrid multi-echelon networks using multiple routing options. The principles behind the design of these networks are clariﬁed, and the way these networks can be implemented in a multimodal context is presented through a description of the multimodal transport market in Europe as well as by giving a number of examples that clarify the way these networks can operate. The present trend of increasing transport costs because of internalization of external costs and higher fuel prices will strengthen the possibilities for using slow modes of transport in combination with fast modes, when necessary...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} spatial impact of two main aspects of <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policy,</b> namely {{infrastructure}} investments and pricing. In its “White Paper: <b>European</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Policy</b> for 2010 : Time to Decide ” the European Commission has laid down a comprehensive programme of transport policy within the EU, aiming at increasing {{the efficiency of}} the transport industry, developing the so-called trans-European infrastructure network and bringing the prices of transport services closer to the true marginal social cost. It is an important political issue whether the policy will enhance spatial cohesion in Europe or run counter the objective of a balanced economic development in the entire area of the EU. For one thing this is because spatial development objectives are themselves prominent goals among the catalogue of objectives to be attained by transport policy. Particularly infrastructure investments which are co-financed by the structural funds, are regarded a means of regional policy supporting less favoured regions. Furthermore, transport policies motivated by efficiency or environmental reasons may have undesired regional side effects, that could generate political backlash, unless one offers some compensation.

The project has thus both a strong research element and an element of short-term policy relevance. While this latter element requires a certain degree of simplicity the project emphasize that simplicity has to be created from the understanding of complexity. We have the ambition to have our research published in international scientific journals. We have involved different disciplines and does not focus on one single cost allocation approach but acknowledge that different viewpoints need to be taken in different situations. The project also recognizes that cost allocation (or pricing principle) recommendations need to be given in a short-term and a long-term perspective. The former stresses immediate implementation with a degree of uncertainty. The project will in a long-term perspective outline how these uncertainties can be resolved to suite the <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policy</b> for the future.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to present different types of solutions which could improve interconnectivity of passenger transport especially within interconnections between long and short transport distance. The topic has particular relevance at the European level because the <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> networks’ role as integrated international networks is compromised by poor interconnectivity and because {{the next generation of}} <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policies</b> will have {{to be sensitive to the}} differences between short, medium and long-term transport markets and the market advantages of each transport mode. In this context, a realistic assessment of intermodal opportunities is a key ingredient to future policy development. Effective interconnection requires the provision of integrated networks and services which are attractive to potential users and this is likely to require co-operation between a range of authorities and providers in the public and private sectors and may necessitate a wider vision than might otherwise prevail. The paper is based on the results of the project realised by the team of the University of Gdansk in the EU funded 7 Framework Programme - INTERCONNECT (Interconnection between short- and long-distance transport networks) with partners in the UK, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Spain and Italy. Different types of solutions will be summarized in the paper including e. g. local link infrastructure solutions, improved local public transport services, improvements at the interchange, solutions involving improved procedures for check-in or luggage transfer & documentation, pricing and ticketing solutions, solutions involving marketing, information and sales...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} methodological {{process was}} developed to evaluate the expected effect of freight villages. Because the criteria differ as do their measurement units, multicriteria analysis is proposed. The process required an in-depth analysis of the decision-making process for creating a freight village, the operations and the actors involved, {{and the most recent}} best practices. The methodology identifies a set of decision criteria, including environmental quality; contributions to local, regional, and national economies; attractiveness for private financing; contribution to land use changes; and complementarity with other policy plans. In addition, the methodology defines the most appropriate corresponding indicators. The identification of stakeholder categories and decision criteria provides added value to the proposed methodological process. The importance of <b>European</b> <b>transport</b> <b>policies</b> on freight villages and terminals development could mean that the process would be the main contributor in developing a pan-European decision tool to assess such investments, especially if private and public funds were involved.
