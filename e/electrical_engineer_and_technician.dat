5000|$|The name is {{a running}} in-joke that started among <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers</b> <b>and</b> <b>technicians.</b> It was more {{recently}} adopted by computer programmers. It is a widely used term with competitors in the FIRST Robotics Competition. [...] The given device operates until the smoke is released from it, {{at which point the}} device ceases to operate. Ergo, the smoke {{is an essential part of}} the device's operation, through undetermined ('magical') means. The joke's humor operates via the logical consistency of what is observed, versus knowledge of what is actually occurring. This is an example of the fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc.|$|R

A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81's launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair-compatible hardware.

50|$|Since about 1998, {{virtually}} all major PLC manufacturers have offered integrated HMI/SCADA systems, {{many of them}} using open and non-proprietary communications protocols. Numerous specialized third-party HMI/SCADA packages, offering built-in compatibility with most major PLCs, have also entered the market, allowing mechanical <b>engineers,</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers</b> <b>and</b> <b>technicians</b> to configure HMIs themselves, {{without the need for}} a custom-made program written by a software programmer.The Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) connects to physical equipment. Typically, an RTU converts the electrical signals from the equipment to digital values such as the open/closed status from a switch or a valve, or measurements such as pressure, flow, voltage or current. By converting and sending these electrical signals out to equipment the RTU can control equipment, such as opening or closing a switch or a valve, or setting the speed of a pump.|$|R

40|$|The {{relation}} of brain cancer and mortality from leukaemia to electrical occupations {{was investigated in}} a case-control study based on all deaths in 1985 and 1986 in the 16 states in the United States that report occupational data from death certificates to the national vital statistics registry. The case series comprised all 2173 men who died of primary brain cancer (International Classification of Diseases- 9 ((ICD- 9) code 191) and all 3400 who died of leukaemia (ICD- 9 codes 204 - 208). Each was matched with 10 controls who died of other causes in the same year. Men employed in any electrical occupation had age race adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1. 4 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 1 - 1. 7) for brain cancer and 1. 0 (95 % CI 0. 8 - 1. 2) for leukaemia, compared with men in all other occupations. Brain cancer odds ratios were larger for <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers</b> <b>and</b> <b>technicians</b> (OR 2. 7, 95 % CI 2. 1 - 3. 4), telephone workers (OR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 4), electric power workers (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 7), and electrical workers in manufacturing industries (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 3. 4). There was some evidence of excess leukaemia among the same groups (ORs of 1. 1 - 1. 5) despite absence of an association for all electrical workers. The excess of deaths from brain cancer was concentrated among men aged 65 or older, whereas leukaemia was associated with electrical work only among younger decedents and those with acute lymphocytic leukaemia. These results from a large and geographically diverse population corroborate reports of increased mortality from brain cancer among electrical workers, but gives only limited support to suggestions of excess deaths from leukaemia...|$|R

The software was developed using Java programming language and {{it serves as a}} valuable design tool for <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers,</b> students <b>and</b> <b>technicians</b> by providing a faster, easier and more accurate means of carrying out some basic calculations such as; determination of number of lighting fixtures required in a room, the design current and power required per final sub-circuit, the total connected load, voltage drop across chosen cables and load balancing across the three phases of a three-phase supplied building. The results of these calculations help the designer to make vital decisions such as types of luminaries, sizes of cables and nominal ratings of protective devices required by each circuit and by the entire installation in line with appropriate standards and regulations...|$|R
40|$|Designing {{electric}} installation projects, demands {{not only}} academic knowledge, but also {{other types of}} knowledge not easily acquired through traditional instructional methodologies. A lot of additional empirical knowledge is missing and so the academic instruction must be completed with different kinds of knowledge, such as real-life practical examples and simulations. On the other hand, the practical knowledge detained by the most experienced designers is not formalized {{in such a way}} that is easily transmitted. In order to overcome these difficulties present in the engineers formation, we are developing an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), for training and support concerning the development of electrical installation projects to be used by <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers,</b> <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> students...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the safety of their {{inhabitants}} and properties, the residential, industrial and business installations require complying with NEC (national electrical code) for electrical systems. <b>Electrical</b> design <b>engineers</b> <b>and</b> <b>technicians</b> rely heavily on these very important design guidelines. However, these design guidelines are not formally taught in engineering curriculum. Recently, a study was performed in the Department of EE (electrical engineering) at GVSU (Grand Valley State University) about the potential inclusion of NEC in our EE curriculum as a part of an existing course on power systems analysis. This paper presents the findings of this study along with the implemented recommendations undertaken after this study. A literature survey was conducted on the EE curriculums of other prominent universities in the state of Michigan and those of our national peer and aspirant peer universities with a special emphasis on power engineering. It was found that power engineering curriculum was shrinking at a steady pace. It was also found that even though NECs were important for electrical design of installations, they were too many and trivial for inclusion in a formal curriculum. It was proposed that we offer a short course on NEC so that students can get familiar with electrical codes and obtain crucial hands-on experience. Completion of this short course was made a mandatory part of qualification for our shop-lab access. Impact of this short course on student learning is presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Low voltage {{unearthed}} (IT) AC and DC {{systems are}} commonly applied for supply {{of power and}} control circuits in industry, transportation, medical objects etc. The main reasons for their use are high reliability and numerous advantages offered by isolating them against ground. Insulation level is a decisive factor for networks operational reliability and safety. Insufficient insulation-to-ground resistance can cause various disturbances. Though ground faults in IT systems do not make networks operation impossible, they may cause severe problems with their safe functioning. In this book {{the most important issues}} concerning normal operation and ground fault phenomena are described in concise form. Numerous methods of insulation resistance and capacitance measurement in live circuits are presented. Important other procedures of  these parameters determination based on measurement and calculation are explained and reviews of selected insulation resistance measurement devices as well as earth fault locating systems are included. This book is addressed to <b>electrical</b> <b>engineers,</b> <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> students and may also serve as an academic handbook. The extended second edition includes several innovative methods of insulation parameters determination as well as more detailed explanations of procedures and issues. Furthermore new important problems e. g. indirect methods of insulation resistance determination and insulation resistance monitoring in networks with frequency converters are addressed as well as examples of practical applications...|$|R
