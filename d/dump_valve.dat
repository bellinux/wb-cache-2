25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, diverter, bypass, turbo-relief valve, blow-off valve (BOV), or <b>dump</b> <b>valve.</b> It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|E
25|$|A {{weighted}} dump {{line will}} automatically start open the valve to start dumping excess air if the weight is lifted off the bottom. This {{will stop the}} lift from ascending any further if the <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> releases air fast enough. When the weight is lowered back to the bottom by the sinking load, the valve will close again, and should hold the load steady. The stability of this system depends on the preload of the valve spring {{and the size of}} the valve opening.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} components {{include a}} shell of watertight material, sufficiently flexible to allow the wearer to function adequately, seals where {{parts of the body}} pass through the suit while in use, and a method of sealing the access opening while the suit is worn. Insulation may be provided in part by the suit shell, but is usually largely provided by thermal insulation clothing worn under the suit, which relies to a large extent on trapped air for its insulating properties. An inflation valve with gas supply and <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> are generally provided, but were not standard on early models.|$|E

50|$|Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves,</b> {{also known}} as double flap valves or double flap gates, are a type of airlock valve {{commonly}} used in industrial applications as a component in bulk material handling applications. Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to discharge chunky or fibrous, bulk materials from hoppers, bins, and cyclones operating under positive or negative pressure. Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> are used to discharge a flow of material {{while at the same}} time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a rotary feeder.|$|R
50|$|Dry suit {{inflation}} only {{applies to}} diving. Survival suits and other dry suits designed for wear {{on the surface}} have no inflation or <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> as suit squeeze and achieving neutral buoyancy are not issues.|$|R
25|$|Dump valves {{are used}} to release air from the bag when in the water. They can be {{operated}} manually at the valve by a diver or may be remotely operated by a pull-cord, which may be operated by a diver or attached to a weight which will automatically open the valve if the weight is lifted off the bottom. Some dump valves can be operated in both these ways. One system operates by pressing on the top or pulling a line attached to the bottom to actuate the spring-loaded valve. The <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> may be a screw-in quick change system, and the spring tension may be adjustable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. [...] This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto <b>dump,</b> <b>valve</b> on the shoulder. [...] Automatic valves can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the automatic valve at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no <b>dump</b> <b>valve,</b> but are clamped to the helmet with a watertight seal, so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a <b>dump</b> <b>valve.</b> Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist seals or the neck seal open to vent the suit.|$|E
2500|$|Uncontrolled rate of ascent can {{increase}} risk of decompression sickness and lung overexpansion injury even when diving within the no-stop {{limits of the}} decompression tables, so the skills of buoyancy control during ascent are important for diver safety and are included to some extent in all entry level training, but the criteria for competence vary among the certification agencies. Most, if not all, agencies require the diver {{to be able to}} limit ascent rate {{and to be able to}} achieve neutral buoyancy at a specified depth during an ascent without significantly overshooting the target depth, while using only a depth gauge or dive computer as a reference to depth and ascent rate, but this is a skill which requires considerable practice to master, and few learners can achieve true competence in the short time provided for practicing the skill in recreational entry level diver training. The skills involve venting the buoyancy compensator and where applicable, the dry suit at a rate which provides neutral or slight negative buoyancy at all stages of the ascent, or for highly skilled practitioner, just sufficient positive buoyancy to cause ascent at the desired rate, and neutral buoyancy when a stop is required. Most dry suits intended for scuba diving are fitted with an automatic <b>dump</b> <b>valve,</b> which can be adjusted to provide an approximately constant volume of gas in the suit, so the diver can concentrate on controlling ascent rate by venting the buoyancy compensator. These skills become critical when [...] decompression stops are required, and even divers with excellent buoyancy control will often make use of aids to ascent rate and depth control to reduce risk. Shot lines are used at all levels of diving, and are in common use during entry level training, as a visual aid to ascent rate and depth control, and as a fall-back physical aid. The skills of deploying and using surface marker buoys and decompression buoys are generally considered advanced skills for recreational divers, but may be considered entry level skills for professional divers.|$|E
40|$|The {{load control}} system {{developed}} for the shuttle external structural tests is described. The system consists of a load programming/display module, and a load control module along with the following hydraulic system components: servo <b>valves,</b> <b>dump</b> <b>valves,</b> hydraulic system components, and servo valve manifold blocks. One load programming/display subsystem can support multiple load control subsystem modules...|$|R

25|$|Lift bag {{appropriate}} capacity should {{match the}} task at hand. If the lift bag is grossly oversized a runaway or otherwise out of control ascent may result. Commercially available lifting bags may incorporate <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> to allow the operator to control the buoyancy during ascent, {{but this is a}} hazardous operation with high risk of entanglement in an uncontrolled lift or sinking. If a single bag is insufficient, multiple bags may be used, and should be distributed to suit the load.|$|R

50|$|A {{blowoff valve}} (BOV), <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> or {{compressor}} bypass valve (CBV) is a pressure release system present in most turbocharged engines.|$|E
50|$|Double <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> {{have two}} trap-door flap plates which {{open and close}} on an {{alternating}} cycle. The top gate opens to allow collected material to drop through onto the bottom gate. The top gate then re-closes to prevent air leakage above the valve. The bottom gate then opens to allow material to pass completely through the valve. The bottom gate then re-closes to prevent air leakage below the valve. This cycle is continuously repeated {{in order to maintain}} a steady discharge of material from the valve, while maintaining a positive seal on the system.|$|R
50|$|The reactor {{consists}} of a tubed calandria vessel of austenitic stainless steel, which contains the heavy water moderator/reflector and 208 coolant tube assemblies. The moderator system {{consists of}} the calandria, coolers, pumps and purification system in the heavy water circuit, and control <b>valves,</b> <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> and helium blowers in the helium circuit. The fuel is natural uranium {{in the form of}} sintered uranium dioxide pellets sheathed in thin zirconium alloy tubes to form solid fuel elements about 19.1 inches (48.53 cm) long by 0.6 inches (1.4 cm) diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Inflator valve {{malfunction}} can {{inflate the}} bladder when the buoyancy is not needed, {{and if not}} recognized and dealt with promptly, can result in uncontrolled ascent with associated risk of decompression illness. This can happen more quickly with inflators combined with alternative demand valves as they must use a larger bore hose connector. However, the standard overpressure and <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> provided are able to vent air faster than the inflator valve can fill the bladder. This can be mitigated by the ability to disconnect the inflator hose under pressure, a skill which is trained by some agencies.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of double}} <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> works essentially, like a stacked pair of trickle valves. Each flap plate is held {{closed with a}} {{counterweighted}} arm. As material builds up on the top plate {{the weight of the}} head of material pushes it open where it dumps onto the bottom plate. This type of double <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> has no electrical or pneumatic controls and is the least expensive method of operation. However, it is difficult to sustain a properly timed cycle.|$|E
50|$|Timing of {{the flap}} plates is {{critical}} {{in order to make}} sure a double <b>dump</b> <b>valve</b> operates properly. There are several designs that have been employed in order to maintain a consistently operating valve.|$|E

A special attention is paid to the treatment of instabilities. The model is applied to the analysis of chilldown in rapid loading system developed at NASA-Kennedy Space Center. The nontrivial characteristic feature of the analyzed chilldown regime is its active control by <b>dump</b> <b>valves.</b> The numerical predictions are in reasonable agreement with the experimental time traces.

5000|$|Musick and {{his crew}} of six died in {{the crash of the}} S-42 Samoan Clipper near Pago Pago, American Samoa, on a cargo and survey flight to Auckland, New Zealand. About one hour after {{take-off}} the aircraft reportedly experienced an engine oil leak and Musick turned back toward Pago Pago. After the crew reported they were dumping fuel in preparation for a precautionary landing, an explosion tore the aircraft apart in flight. Pan American stated {{at the time that the}} fuel <b>dump</b> <b>valves</b> underneath the wings likely vented vaporized fuel near the engines' exhaust ports, causing the explosion and loss of the flying boat. Floating wreckage from the plane was later found about 14 miles northwest of Pago Pago by the U.S. naval seaplane tender [...] The bodies of the seven crewmen were not recovered.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{different}} survey on buddy diver fatality {{it was found}} that regardless of who was first to be low on air, the over-weighted diver was six times more likely to die. In spite of being heavily reliant on their buoyancy compensators, many divers also misused them. Examples of this include accidental inflation or over-inflation causing rapid uncontrolled ascents, confusion between the inflation and <b>dump</b> <b>valves,</b> and inadequate or slow inflation due to being deep or low on air. The drag caused by a buoyancy compensator inflated to offset the weight belt can contribute to exhaustion in divers attempting to swim to safety on the surface. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences reported in 1989 that half the cases of decompression sickness were related to loss of buoyancy control. When twin-bladder buoyancy compensators are used, confusion as to how much gas is in each bladder can lead to a delay in appropriate response, by which time control of the ascent may have already be lost.|$|R
50|$|An over {{pressure}} relief valve that automatically vents the bladder if the diver over inflates the BC by ascending or by injecting too much gas. This is usually a secondary function of the vent or <b>dump</b> <b>valve,</b> and is a necessary safety feature to prevent over-pressure damage.|$|E

5000|$|On January 20, 1933, the {{aircraft}} {{was moved to}} E.M. Laird workshops at 5321 W. 65th St. in the Clearing Industrial District, Chicago, where she was rebuilt and made suitable for the transatlantic flight. New elongated wings were built, with two additional gasoline tanks installed in the fuselage, having 220 and 185 US gallon capacity, each equipped with emergency <b>dump</b> <b>valves.</b> Beneath the pilot's seat a 25 US gallon oil tank was outfitted with 12 cooling tubes. A longer horizontal stabilizer was built. Aero-dynamic wheel pants were installed, and the fuselage received a new fabric covering.

5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the <b>dump</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
