500|$|In 2004, it was {{reported}} in The Yorkshire Post and subsequently the Daily Mail that Boycott was supporting the United Kingdom Independence Party in that year's election for the European Parliament. He stated that [...] "I am not a political animal. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> at the way governments of all colours have handed powers to Brussels without the British people having a say in the matter." ...|$|E
500|$|The Creek Turnpike {{was opposed}} by area {{residents}} from its conception. Forming {{a group called}} [...] "Tulsans Against Turnpikes", around 220 citizens gathered at a meeting on February 16, 1989, to discuss the proposed toll road. Opponents to the turnpike cited detrimental effects to their community and to the environment as their concerns. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> about is that it changes the complexion of south Tulsa. It {{would no longer be}} a residential area," [...] said Tom Taylor, an area resident. Some residents also complained that the proposed turnpike would mainly serve through traffic, despite OTA estimates that south Tulsa residents would make up 90% of the road's userbase.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{support in}} Montreal, and the {{response}} in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament's future. The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup. [...] He noted that Canada's loss in the final {{played a role in}} his decision: [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> personally, it's probably preferable that we lost. [...] I think if we had won, I'd have said, 'To hell with it'." ...|$|E

500|$|Historically, a few {{municipalities}} had ordinances against underage drinking {{on private}} property, but {{a class action}} lawsuit in 1998 against the town of Avalon nullified these laws. [...] In 2000, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill criminalizing underage consumption of alcoholic beverages on private property New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman pocket vetoed the bill over privacy concerns: [...] "While I completely support {{the intent of the}} bill, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> that the bill's prohibitions could be construed to apply to situations in which an underage person consumes even a small amount of alcohol {{under the watchful eye of}} an adult family member." [...] Later that year, Whitman signed a revised bill that allowed municipalities to pass ordinance prohibiting underage drinking on private property. Besides giving municipalities a choice on whether to implement such a policy, the revised bill imposed substantially lighter penalties on underage drinkers, and the new law made an exception for alcohol provided by any relative, not just a parent or guardian.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} the bombing, the {{relatives}} {{and friends of the}} dead and injured used Omagh Leisure Centre to post news. The Spanish Ambassador to Ireland personally visited some of the injured and churches across Northern Ireland called for a national day of mourning. Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh Robin Eames stated on BBC Radio that, [...] "From the Church's point of view, all <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> about are not political arguments, not political niceties. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> about the torment of ordinary people who don't deserve this." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{than three}} years after the crash, the British coroner cited the [...] "flagrant {{disregard}} for passenger safety" [...] by the airline and said [...] "the primary failure so far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> relates to the corporate culture which prevailed both One-Two-GO Airlines and Orient Thai Airlines prior to and following the air crash." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2012, both Lynott's {{mother and}} widow objected to Mitt Romney's use of [...] "The Boys Are Back in Town" [...] during his {{election}} campaign. In {{an interview with}} Irish rock magazine Hot Press, Philomena Lynott said, [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage and to civil unions for gays makes him anti-gay – which {{is not something that}} Philip would have supported." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, he explained that [...] "I don't believe in redistribution of wealth {{for the sake of}} redistributing wealth.

As Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, 'taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr King, {{a former}} head of {{molecular}} biology at the IAH, was quoted in The Times as saying [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> the authorities have failed to find any chink in the armoury of the establishment’s bio-security. What you are left with is human movement, {{which is not a}} matter for the institute, it’s a police matter. It’s very, very unlikely that it could be spread by accident.

2500|$|America needs Orthodoxy, without Orthodoxy {{becoming}} Americanized. Orthodoxy {{must continue}} to develop in spirituality and maturity, growing gradually and appropriately toward a developed polity. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> that aggressive attempts toward premature separation from the mother churches of the old lands will result in disarray and schism. [...] Instead, we are called by the Lord to continue in humble growth and obedience to our organic link with the Patriarchates.

2500|$|Since the war , Jews have {{occupied}} {{the villages of}} Maramureş and Bukovina, and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in Bessarabia. [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves {{in order to become}} a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, as far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{composed}} {{during a period}} of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to Richard Aldington, saying, [...] "As for The Waste Land, that is {{a thing of the past}} so far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> and I am now feeling toward a new form and style." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Dakota, the U.S. {{government}} and local traders, the Dakota representatives asked the representative of the government traders, Andrew Jackson Myrick, to sell them food on credit. His response was said to be, [...] "So far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> if they are hungry let them eat grass or their own dung." [...] But the context of Myrick's comment at the time, early August 1862, is historically unclear. Another version is that Myrick was referring to the Indian women who were already combing the floor of the fort's stables for any unprocessed oats to then feed to their starving children along with a little grass.|$|E
2500|$|Stood on his head: This {{is a term}} to {{describe}} an outstanding performance by an ice hockey goaltender {{in a short period}} of time. Often when a goalie lets out a rebound, the opposition returns the shot quickly, and the goalie has to make a quick save. A goalie often falls on his side and [...] "stacks the pads" [...] and appears to nearly stand on their head. The term may have been derived after NHL President Frank Calder, alluding to the 1918 rules change that permitted goalies to leave their feet to make a save, remarked, [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> they can stand on their head(s)." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2009, The Advocate interviewed Braun {{about her}} {{portrayal}} of Reese and the Reese and Bianca storyline. [...] "From {{my point of}} view, Reese is {{not in love with}} Zach and she never has been," [...] said Braun. [...] "As far as the kiss, any doubt she may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately after it happened. It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. As far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> Reese has always been in love with Bianca." ...|$|E

2500|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I guess I do see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned.</b> That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steiner {{and his men}} {{standing}} eyeball-to-eyeball with the 300 armed Italians, relayed to the Pentagon [...] "I am not worried about our situation. We have the firepower to prevail. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> about the immaturity of the Italian troops. ...A backfire from a motorbike or a construction cart could precipitate a shooting incident {{that could lead to}} a lot of Italian casualties. And I don't believe that our beef is with our ally, the Italians, but rather with the terrorists." [...] The American leadership in Washington concluded that while Steiner and his men could take the terrorists it was unlikely they would be able to get them out of Italy. By 4:00a.m. CET the next day, orders arrived for Steiner and his men to stand down.|$|E
2500|$|While Denis O'Brien {{is often}} newsworthy, the Sunday Independent has paid {{particular}} attention to him when his business activities conflicted with Independent News Media. Denis O'Brien has perceived bias in the Independent Group's coverage and in a 2003 letter to Gavin O'Reilly wrote [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> Independent News and Media {{have spent the last}} seven years trying to destroy my reputation. Some of the coverage of my affairs, both business and personal, in the Sunday Tribune, Sunday Independent, Irish Independent and Evening Herald have caused hurt and enormous damage to my reputation, not to mention the emotional distress suffered by my wife, Catherine and my family. I very much doubt whether you or your family could have survived a similar onslaught." ...|$|E
