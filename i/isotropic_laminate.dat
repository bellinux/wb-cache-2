The benchmark configurations include fully uncoupled Extensionally Isotropic Laminates and Fully Isotropic Laminates, together with a special class of uncoupled laminate, possessing matching elastic properties in both extension and bending; more {{commonly referred to as}} a Quasi-Homogeneous Orthotropic Laminate. The concept of an Equivalent <b>Isotropic</b> <b>Laminate</b> is also introduced as a universally applicable datum; useful for characterization of ply number groupings for which no benchmark configurations exist. The vast majority of the benchmark configurations are found to possess non-symmetric stacking sequences, which also serves to demonstrate that stacking sequence symmetry is neither sufficient nor necessary for fully uncoupled laminate designs. Finally, dimensionless parameters are provided for each stacking sequence, from which the ABD matrix is shown to be readily derived...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{developed}} mathematical {{tools for}} the modelling of contact problems on thin film structures are adapted {{to allow the}} investigation of arbitrarily mixed purely isotropic and transversally <b>isotropic</b> <b>laminate</b> structures. The new tool is applied to model a variety of load problems resulting in the failure of windsurfing boards consisting of a relatively thin laminate shell and a soft polymer foam core. It is shown that local impact and distributed bending loads due to “bad landing” after high jumps or contact with parts of the sailing gear (the so called rig) especially the front part of the boom are leading to the most critical stress distributions resulting in failure. So most of the investigated boards were damaged because the rider (windsurfer) landed flat and thus produced a sudden impact force under his feet (impact defect). Other overloading occurred due to overturning of so called loop movements or the landing of the board exactly on respectively between two waves and this way producing high bending moments. Some of those typical loads are analysed in detail and the stresses occurring in the complex structure of the windsurfing boards are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{pertains}} {{to the development of}} the fully <b>isotropic</b> <b>laminates</b> (FIL) and the quasi-homogeneous anisotropic laminates (QHAL). An FIL exhibits con-comitant isotropy in the extensional and bending stiffnesses; its macromechanical be-havior matches that of a homogeneous isotropic plate. A QHAL is a multidirectional lami-nate with identical anisotropy in the extensional and bending stiffnesses, which matches that of a homogeneous anisotropic plate. Because of these characteristics, classical theo-ries of homogeneous (isotropic and anisotropic) thin plates are applicable to the macro-mechanical analysis of FIL and QHAL, which significantly reduces the laminate design effort...|$|R

The predicted delamination threshold loads and velocities are in very good agreement with the finite element simulations. Good agreement is also shown in a comparison with published experimental results. In contrast to quasi-static impacts, delamination growth occurs under a rapidly decreasing load. Inclusion of finite thickness effects and a proper description of the contact stiffness are found to be vital for accurate prediction of the delamination threshold velocity...|$|R

The effects of the detached base length on natural frequencies, modal shapes and nodal lines of these types of structures are investigated. Although the expected decrease in frequency with increase in the detached base length is observed almost for all modes it is seen that this behavior is very pronounced for higher modes in both plates and shells.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{application}} of Finite Element Update Method (FEUM) is {{proposed for the}} inverse identification of material constitutive parameters in transversely <b>isotropic</b> <b>laminates.</b> Two-dimensional Digital Image Correlation (2 D–DIC) is used for full-field measurements which {{is required for the}} identification process. Instead of measuring the in-plane displacements, which is a well-known {{application of}} 2 D–DIC, we seek to measure the pseudo-displacements resulting from out-of-plane (towards camera) deflection of plate under a point load. These pseudo-displacements are basically the perspective projection of the three dimensional displacement fields on the image-plane of the image acquisition system. The cost function in this method is defined in terms of these projections instead of the true displacements – and hence the name Projected Finite Element Update Method (PFEUM). In this article, identification of in-plane elastic moduli of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) plate has been performed using plate bending experiments which show pre-dominantly out-of-plane deflection with little contribution from the in-plane displacements. Identification results are validated by direct experimental measurements of the unknown elastic constants as well as theoretical estimates based on volume ratio of constituents. The results show good conformance between estimated and target values for at least three material parameters namely E 1, E 2 and G 12. Effects of experimental noise on parameter estimates has also been evaluated to explain the observed deviation in estimated parameters with current test configuration...|$|R
