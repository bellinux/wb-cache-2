25|$|In {{addition}} to its use in spark-gap radio transmitters and <b>electrotherapy</b> described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.|$|E
25|$|Vibrational therapy {{by way of}} {{sinusoidal}} (high-frequency oscillating) {{electric current}} was discovered by Kellogg in 1884 to have medical use for increasing blood circulation and passive exercise. In particular, Kellogg invented a vibrating chair used to stimulate vital organs in the lower abdomen. Even today one can visit the Kellogg Discovery Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, and sit on Kellogg's vibrating chair, which is equipped to mechanically oscillate 20 times per second. Furthermore, Kellogg devised an <b>electrotherapy</b> exercise bed in which a sinusoidal current that produced muscular contraction but no pain could be delivered for twenty minutes and reportedly achieve the stimulation of a brisk four-mile walk.|$|E
25|$|The first {{alternator}} {{to produce}} alternating current was a dynamo electric generator based on Michael Faraday's principles {{constructed by the}} French instrument maker Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. Pixii later added a commutator to his device to produce the (then) more commonly used direct current. The earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by Guillaume Duchenne, inventor and developer of <b>electrotherapy.</b> In 1855, he announced that AC was superior to direct current for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions. Alternating current technology had first developed in Europe due {{to the work of}} Guillaume Duchenne (1850s), the Hungarian Ganz Works company (1870s), and in the 1880s: Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, Lucien Gaulard, and Galileo Ferraris.|$|E
25|$|In 1866 Burckhardt {{returned}} to Basel and resolved {{to study the}} diseases {{of the nervous system}} and their treatment with the new electrotherapies. His interest in this field had been fostered by Karl Ewald Hasse, a noted physician and friend of the Burckhardt family. In 1873 {{he was elected to the}} presidency of the Basel Medical Society. Two years later, in 1875, he received a post as a physician to the Waldau Psychiatric University Clinic in Berne; later that year he also published Die physiologische Diagnostik der Nervenkrankheiten (Physiological Diagnostics of Nervous Diseases), a 284-page monograph which detailed the results of his research on the use of <b>electrotherapy</b> for nervous disorders and the conductivity of the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received <b>electrotherapy</b> treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E

500|$|Several 18th-century {{electric}} {{terms were}} derived from his name.

500|$|In his <b>electrotherapy,</b> Bird {{used both}} {{electrochemical}} and electrostatic machines (and later also electromagnetic induction machines) {{to treat a}} very wide range of conditions, such as some forms of chorea. [...] Treatments included peripheral nerve stimulation, electrical muscle stimulation and electric shock therapy. [...] Bird also used his invention, the electric moxa, to heal skin ulcers.|$|E
500|$|In 1836, Bird was put {{in charge}} of the newly formed {{department}} of electricity and galvanism under the supervision of Addison. [...] While {{this was not the first}} hospital to employ <b>electrotherapy,</b> it was still considered very experimental. [...] Previous hospital uses had either been short-lived or based on the whim of a single surgeon, such as John Birch at St Thomas' Hospital. [...] At Guy's, the treatment was part of the hospital system and became well-known to the public, so much so that Guy's was parodied for its use of electricity in the New Frankenstein satirical magazine.Morus, p. 235 ...|$|E
500|$|The Pulvermacher chain, or in full as it {{was sold}} the Pulvermacher hydro-electric chain, was a type of voltaic battery sold {{in the second half}} of the 19th century for medical applications. [...] Its chief market was amongst the {{numerous}} quack practitioners who were taking advantage of the popularity of the relatively new treatment of <b>electrotherapy,</b> or [...] "electrification" [...] {{as it was}} then known. [...] Its unique selling point was its construction of numerous linked cells, rendering it mechanically flexible. [...] A variant intended to be worn wrapped on part of the body for long periods was known as Pulvermacher's galvanic chain or electric belt.|$|E
500|$|At first, {{there was}} a very {{positive}} reaction to Pulvermacher. [...] Early in 1851 Pulvermacher gave Golding Bird, a well known London physician with an interest in <b>electrotherapy,</b> a sample of the machine with which to experiment. [...] Bird was impressed enough with it that he later gave a representative of the Pulvermacher Company a testimonial as a letter of introduction to physicians in Edinburgh. [...] Bird thought that the battery would make a useful source of portable electricity and could be used for treating patients with some forms of paralysis in their homes. [...] Contemporary equipment was not very portable, {{and in the case of}} friction machines required skilled operators to keep going. [...] By October 1851 Bird felt that he had tested the device sufficiently to give it a glowing article in The Lancet. [...] But even at this early stage there were signs of disquiet. [...] Even as he wrote the favourable report in The Lancet Bird felt the need to level criticism at the Pulvermacher Company's London agent, one C. Meinig, for promoting the device as a [...] "universal panacea" [...] for almost any imaginable complaint in the company's advertisements. [...] Bird was a tireless opponent of quack practitioners, and was particular quick to criticise medically unqualified electrical treatment, as he felt this was a reason professional acceptance of his own work in <b>electrotherapy</b> was being held back. [...] The quack practitioner market was the very sector that the Pulvermacher Company's unrestrained claims were aimed at. Nevertheless, Bird was gracious enough to specifically exclude Pulvermacher himself from responsibility for these [...] "injudiciously puffed" [...] claims.|$|E
500|$|Bird, who was {{a member}} of the London Electrical Society, was {{innovative}} in the field of the medical use of electricity, designing much of his own equipment. [...] In his time, electrical treatment had acquired a bad name in the medical profession through its widespread use by quack practitioners. [...] Bird made efforts to oppose this quackery, and was instrumental in bringing medical <b>electrotherapy</b> into the mainstream. [...] He was quick to adopt new instruments of all kinds; he invented a new variant of the Daniell cell in 1837 and made important discoveries in electrometallurgy with it. [...] He was not only innovative in the electrical field, but he also designed a flexible stethoscope, and in 1840 published the first description of such an instrument.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{became the}} first head of the {{electricity}} and galvanism department at Guy's in 1836, {{under the supervision of}} Addison, since Bird did not graduate until 1838. [...] In 1843, he was appointed assistant physician at Guy's, a position for which he had lobbied hard, and in October that year he was put in charge of the children's outpatients ward. [...] Like his <b>electrotherapy</b> patients, the children were largely poor relief cases who could not afford to pay for medical treatment and were much used for the training of medical students. [...] It was generally accepted at this time that poor relief cases could be used for experimental treatment, and their permission was not required. [...] Bird published in the hospital journal a series of reports on childhood diseases, based on case studies from this work.Coley, p. 366Payne and McConnellMorus, pp. 236–237Steel, p. 207 ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{classes of}} <b>electrotherapy</b> were in use. [...] One was the {{electric}} bath, {{which consisted of}} sitting the patient on an insulated stool with glass legs and connecting the patient to one electrode, usually the positive one, of an electrostatic machine. [...] The patient's skin became charged as {{if he or she}} were in a [...] "bath of electricity". [...] The second class of treatment could be performed while the patient was in the electric bath. [...] This consisted of bringing a negative electrode close to the patient, usually near the spine, causing sparks to be produced between the electrode and the patient. [...] Electrodes of various shapes were available for different medical purposes and places of application on the body. [...] Treatment was applied in several sessions of around five minutes, often blistering the skin. [...] The third class of treatment was electric shock therapy, in which an electric shock was delivered from a galvanic battery (later electromagnetic generators) via an induction coil to greatly increase the voltage. [...] It was also possible to deliver electric shocks from the charge stored in a Leyden jar, but this was a much weaker shock.Simpson, pp. 7–8Morus, pp. 235–236 ...|$|E
500|$|By April 1853 the {{situation}} had become very acrimonuous. [...] Meinig had been using extracts from the testimonial provided by Bird without permission in order to bolster the Company's, medically largely unsupported, quack advertising claims. Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity. [...] A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the Association Medical Journal. [...] Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those {{that were supposed to}} produce instant results (a typical course of <b>electrotherapy</b> at the time could last several months). [...] He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering [...] "too feeble" [...] a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte). [...] This resulted in the Journal removing the Pulvermacher advertisements from its pages. [...] The Association Medical Journal was quickly followed by the Medical Times and with growing pressure on The Lancet to do the same this pretty much ended professional medical support for the device, {{at least for the time}} being.|$|E

2500|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>electrotherapy</b> peaked after World War 1, {{but by the}} 1920s authorities began {{to crack down on}} fraudulent medical treatments, and <b>electrotherapy</b> largely became obsolete. A part of the field that survived was diathermy, the application of high frequency current to heat body tissue, pioneered by German physician Karl Nagelschmidt in 1907. [...] During the 1920s [...] "long wave" [...] (0.5~2MHz) Tesla coil spark diathermy machines were used, in which the current was applied to the body by electrodes. [...] By the 1930s these were being replaced by [...] "short wave" [...] (10~100MHz) vacuum tube diathermy machines, which had less danger of causing burns, but Tesla coils continued to be used in both diathermy and quack medical devices like violet ray until World War 2.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1916 {{epidemics}} {{and having}} experienced little success in treating polio patients, researchers {{set out to}} find new and better treatments for the disease.

2500|$|Though Kellogg {{stated that}} [...] "electricity is {{not capable of}} {{accomplishing}} half the marvels that are claimed for it by many enthusiastic electrotherapists," [...] he still believed electric currents to be [...] "an extremely valuable therapeutic agent, especially when utilized in connection with hydrotherapy, thermotherapy, and other physiologic methods." [...] As a result, <b>electrotherapy</b> coils {{were used in the}} Static Electrical Department of the Battle Creek Sanitarium especially for cases of paresthesias of neurasthenia, insomnia, and certain forms of neuralgia.
