5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific <b>explanation</b> is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific <b>explanation</b> must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an <b>explanation</b> when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific <b>explanation</b> must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good <b>explanation</b> is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Teleological <b>explanations</b> – <b>explanations</b> {{in terms}} of functions, purposes, or goals – are {{pervasive}} in religion and feature prominently in intuitive theories about the world, such as theory of mind and folk biology. Previous findings suggest that such <b>explanations</b> reflect a deep, explanatory preference. Here we explore the mechanisms underlying the prevalence and persistence of such <b>explanations,</b> following a method developed by Boyer and Ramble (2001) to examine which religious concepts are likely to survive processes of cultural transmission. Specifically, we test the prediction that novel teleological <b>explanations</b> are remembered better than mechanistic <b>explanations,</b> even when effects of an explanation’s quality are taken into account. Two experiments support this prediction for artifact and biological trait <b>explanations,</b> but find the opposite pattern for <b>explanations</b> of non-living natural entities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{different}} types and characteristics of preschool children's <b>explanations</b> of plant growth and rain formation. The children's <b>explanations</b> were categorized as naturalistic, non-naturalistic, or synthetic, i. e., <b>explanations</b> containing both naturalistic and non-naturalistic parts. In regards to plant growth the children tended to rely on synthetic or on naturalistic <b>explanations,</b> which involved direct and indirect agents (such as water, a person, fertilizers, roots) enabling the plant to grow. Non-naturalistic <b>explanations</b> of plant growth, or the non-naturalistic parts of synthetic <b>explanations,</b> were mainly animistic (anthropomorphic). In the case of rain formation the children most frequently used non-naturalistic <b>explanations,</b> which were mainly teleological or metaphysical. The naturalistic <b>explanations</b> recorded on rain formation, {{as well as the}} naturalistic parts of synthetic <b>explanations</b> tended to have a non-agentive character, i. e., children considered rainwater as preexisting in containers such as the clouds. Overall, the <b>explanations</b> recorded about plant growth tended to be more complex than the ones for rain formation. It is suggested that science activities designed for preschool children should take into account the types and characteristics of their <b>explanations</b> in order to select which phenomena are appropriate for this age group, and aim at fostering the children's ability at formulating naturalistic <b>explanations...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely <b>explanation</b> is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible <b>explanation</b> is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} defend mental <b>explanations</b> dualists may appeal to dispositions (powers).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} interpretive research {{study was to examine}} high school biology students’ written scientific <b>explanations</b> that were provided during six biology laboratory investigations. The research study specifically aimed to identify the understandings that the students attached to scientific <b>explanations,</b> characteristics of students’ scientific <b>explanations,</b> the nature of students’ epistemologies related to scientific <b>explanations,</b> and some genre characteristics of students’ <b>explanations.</b> The findings suggested students did not have a clear definition of scientific explanations; however, students attached meanings such as exactness, truth and reality to scientific <b>explanations.</b> The students held an empiricist view of scientific <b>explanations.</b> Student <b>explanations</b> were primarily based on first-hand knowledge gained in the science laboratories. Most students did not give <b>explanations</b> based on a theory or principle and did not use deductive reasoning in their <b>explanations.</b> Students’ <b>explanations</b> often included inferences from observations, evidence, and factual information. Students had difficulties in making causal <b>explanations</b> of biological phenomena particularly at molecular level. The language of students’ <b>explanations</b> represented more of procedural accounts rather than theoretical and abstract accounts. Students’ writings showed some of the genre characteristics defined in literature, such as use of logico-semantic relationships. The lexical density values indicated that students’ level of language is more complex than everyday speech, however, well below the level of scientists’ language. The results of this research implied that school science curricula should emphasize <b>explanations</b> tasks that require students to use scientific theories and make causal connections. Science curricula should also explicitly address the different types of scientific discourses giving more emphasis to the discourses that have theoretical/abstract language...|$|R
40|$|ABox {{abduction}} is {{an important}} reasoning mechanism for description logic ontologies. It computes all minimal <b>explanations</b> (sets of ABox assertions) whose appending to a consistent ontology enforces the entailment of an observation while keeps the ontology consistent.

40|$|Abstract — Data fusion aims at resolving {{conflicts}} between different sources when integrating their data.

Providing <b>explanations</b> for such decisions is important, but can be extremely challenging because {{of the complexity of}} the analysis during decision making. This paper proposes two types of <b>explanations</b> for datafusion results: snapshot <b>explanations</b> target casual users, taking the provided data and any other decision inferred from the data as evidence; comprehensive <b>explanations</b> target advanced users, taking only the provided data as evidence. We propose techniques that can efficiently generate correct and compact <b>explanations.</b> Experimental results show that (1) we generate correct <b>explanations,</b> (2) our techniques can significantly reduce the sizes of the <b>explanations,</b> and (3) we can generate the <b>explanations</b> efficiently.
