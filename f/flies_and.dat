5|$|Four super {{radiations}} {{of insects}} have occurred: beetles (evolved about 300 million years ago), flies (evolved about 250 million years ago), and moths and wasps (evolved about 150 million years ago). These four groups {{account for the}} majority of described species. The <b>flies</b> <b>and</b> moths along with the fleas evolved from the Mecoptera.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers have a {{wide range}} of predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; hoppers and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber <b>flies</b> <b>and</b> sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bees are}} aposematically coloured, {{typically}} orange and black, warning {{of their ability}} to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber <b>flies</b> <b>and</b> hoverflies, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area {{for a while before}} moving on to the next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane <b>flies,</b> <b>and</b> spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{cladogram}} {{of external}} relationships, {{based on a}} 2008 DNA and protein analysis, shows the order as a clade, sister to the Lepidoptera, and more distantly related to the Diptera (true <b>flies)</b> <b>and</b> Mecoptera (scorpionflies).|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs and}} nymphs are {{under attack by}} parasitoids {{including}} blow flies, flesh <b>flies,</b> <b>and</b> tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites. Female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer eggs and thus have fewer offspring than unaffected individuals.|$|E

5|$|Wild equines {{may spend}} seven {{hours a day}} sleeping. During the day, they sleep {{standing}} up while at night they lie down.

Except the mountain zebra, wild equines can roll over completely.|$|E
5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on {{decaying}} vegetation {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture <b>flies</b> <b>and</b> moths with their specially modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees, {{despite their}} ability to sting, are eaten by certain predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole, {{including}} any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber <b>flies</b> <b>and</b> beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees, while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.|$|E
