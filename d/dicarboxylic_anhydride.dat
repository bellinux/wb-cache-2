A range of water-soluble hyperbranched poly(ester amide) s has been synthesized with a view to studying their thermoresponsive behavior in water. Poly(ester amide) s with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) values around physiological temperatures are of interest for biological and medical applications, whereas poly(ester amide) s with high LCST values may be useful as kinetic hydrate inhibitors for high salinity produced fluids in the oil and gas industry. The LCST of these polymers was measured as the optical cloud point. The LCST can be tuned in various ways for these applications, for example, by varying the hydrophobicity of the groups on the cyclic anhydride monomer or by adjusting the hydrophilicity of the imine used to make the peripheral groups of the polymer...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of alkyd resins, drying (including semi drying) and nondrying. Both types are {{typically}} produced from <b>dicarboxylic</b> acids or <b>anhydrides,</b> such as phthalic anhydride or maleic anhydride, and polyols, such as trimethylolpropane, glycerine, or pentaerythritol. Alkyds are also used in items such as resins and paints.For the [...] "drying" [...] resins, triglycerides are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (often derived from plant and vegetable oils, e.g. linseed oil). These drying alkyds are cured in air. The drying speed {{and the nature of the}} coatings depends on the amount and type of drying oil employed (more polyunsaturated oil means faster reaction in air) and use of metal salts, the so-called oil drying agents. These are metal complexes that catalyze crosslinking of the unsaturated sites.|$|R
40|$|Unsaturated polyesters {{based on}} {{ethylene}} glycol have been synthesized {{using a variety}} of anhydride, saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and various catalysts. The structure of the polyesters and the effect of the different compositions on the colour of cured polyesters are studied by FTIR, DSC and colorimetry. The structure of cured polyesters greatly depends on the isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid during polyesterification. The colour of unsaturated polyesters cured with the most common curing system (MEKP as initiator and CoNp as accelerator) is firstly influenced by the curing accelerator CoNp via the d-d transitions of the transition metal cobalt. Secondly, the composition of the <b>dicarboxylic</b> acids and <b>anhydride</b> used in the polyesterification influences the colour of the polyesters which depends especially on the isomerization of maleic acid. The cured maleate polyesters have more unreacted double bonds and more polar structure {{because of the presence of}} carbonyl groups, compared to the corresponding fumarate polyesters, and this structure affects the colour. The residual catalysts from the polyesterification have minor influence on the colour of cured polyesters. Copyright (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A {{series of}} {{identical}} twin esters 3 a-e of metronidazole was synthesized and evaluated as potential prodrugs with improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The {{synthesis of the}} twin esters 3 a-e was achieved by interaction of metronidazole with the respective <b>dicarboxylic</b> acid <b>anhydride</b> or their dichloride. Their structures were verified by elemental and spectroscopic analyses. The lipophilicity of metronidazole and the prodrugs 3 a-e, expressed as R, values, were determined using reversed-phase TLC and revealed enhanced lipophilic properties compared with metronidazole. Reversion kinetics of the parent drug from its twin esters was investigated in aqueous buffer solutions (pH I. 2 and 7. 4) {{as well as in}} biological media (80 % human plasma and 20 % rat liver homogenate) at 37 “C using HPLC. In all cases, the hydrolysis followed pseudo-first-order kinetics in a two-step reaction (k, and k,) via the intermediate formation of the respective metronidazole hemiester. All the synthesized twin ester prodrugs 3 a-e were proved to be chemically stable at acidic pH (t,,,- 25 - 72 h) and also at the physiological pH (t,,,- 1340 h). Meanwhile, the release of the first molecule of metronidazole from its twin esters 3 a-d ensued rapidly in 80 % human plasma (t,,,- IO- 150 min) and in rat liver homogenate (t,,,- 4 - 55 min). The resulting hemiesters 2 a-d showed a sustained release of the second molecule in the same biological fluids (t,, 2 - 3 - 9 h and l- 1 1 h respectively). In vivo evaluation studies of metronidazole and its twin esters 3 a-d in mice and 3 b in rabbits revealed that the prodrugs have been absorbed almost unhydrolyzed with considerable higher plasma level. Antiparasitic activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated in mice against Giardia muris, the prodrug 3 b showed improved antigiardial activity compared to the parent drug. These results suggest that the synthesized identical twin ester...|$|R
