5|$|Cleveland pursued former Steelers {{coach and}} Browns linebacker Bill Cowher and former Browns scout Scott Pioli {{for the head}} {{coaching}} <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> team, however, hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini in January 2009.

The Browns showed little sign of improvement in Mangini's first year, finishing 5–11 in 2009. While Cleveland lost 11 of its first 12 games, the team won the final four games of the season, including a 13–6 victory over the rival Steelers.|$|E

Tolliver made his first start in a game against the Raiders, but played inconsistently over seven starts and was replaced by Richardson in the season finale against the New York Jets.

This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> Cochise County sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid.|$|E

Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the <b>job</b> <b>the</b> men were willing to give them their due.

5|$|Despite the Finnhorse's {{image as}} a working farm horse, the breed {{was used as a}} cavalry mount from the 17thcentury until the end of World War II. After the {{mechanisation}} of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a riding horse, even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the <b>job.</b> <b>The</b> Finnhorse had a strong {{image as a}} harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time.|$|E

5|$|Following MacArthur's {{directive}} {{to secure}} the airfields at Lae and Finschhafen, the Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces, South West Pacific Area, General Thomas Blamey, an Australian, ordered the capture of the Huon Peninsula.

From Nadzab, the 7th Division would advance on Lae from the south to support the 9th Division's drive towards Lae. At the same time, the Australian 3rd Division and the US 162nd Infantry Regiment would fight a diversionary action around Salamaua.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse {{too small for}} their {{agricultural}} needs, {{and came to the}} conclusion that the population would benefit from crossbreeding.

Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1782 the Bourbon allies {{launched}} their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard {{ten of the}} newly engineered 'floating batteries' with 138 heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels {{with a total of}} 30,000 sailors and marines.
