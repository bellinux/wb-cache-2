25|$|In his two-page paper Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül (1932) Gödel refuted the finite-valuedness of <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic.</b> In the proof, he implicitly used {{what has}} later {{become known as}} Gödel–Dummett {{intermediate}} logic (or Gödel fuzzy logic).|$|E

25|$|In 1925, Kolmogorov {{graduated}} from the Moscow State University and began to study {{under the supervision of}} Nikolai Luzin. He formed a lifelong close friendship with Pavel Alexandrov, a fellow student of Luzin; indeed several authors have claimed that the two friends were involved in a homosexual relationship. Kolmogorov (together with Aleksandr Khinchin) became interested in probability theory. Also in 1925, he published his work in <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic</b> — On the principle of the excluded middle, in which he proved that under a certain interpretation, all statements of classical formal logic can be formulated as those of <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic.</b> In 1929, Kolmogorov earned his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree, from Moscow State University.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{semantics}} of programming languages {{is related to}} model theory, as is program verification (in particular, model checking). The CurryHoward isomorphism between proofs and programs relates to proof theory, especially <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic.</b> Formal calculi such as the lambda calculus and combinatory logic are now studied as idealized programming languages.|$|E
25|$|The Curry–Howard {{isomorphism}} {{implies a}} connection between logic and programming: every proof of a theorem of <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic</b> corresponds to a reduction of a typed lambda term, and conversely. Moreover, theorems can be identified with function type signatures. Specifically, a typed combinatory logic corresponds to a Hilbert system in proof theory.|$|E
40|$|In 1992 Dyckhoff {{developed}} a sequent calculus for <b>intuitionistic</b> propositional <b>logic</b> in which proof search is terminating. In this paper {{this result is}} extended to several <b>intuitionistic</b> modal <b>logics,</b> including <b>intuitionistic</b> versions of the modal logics K and KD. Cut-free sequent calculi that are extensions of Dyckhoff's calculus are developed for these logics and are shown, by proof-theoretic means, to be equal to the more common sequent calculi for the <b>intuitionistic</b> modal <b>logics</b> considered here...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} focused inverse method for proof search {{in a variety}} of <b>intuitionistic</b> modal <b>logics</b> such as K, D, T, S 4 and S 5. Unification of worldpaths for such logics is non-unitary and {{therefore}} handled by adding constraints to sequents. We sketch proofs of soundness and completeness with respect to intuitionistic modal natural deduction and describe our implementation. Potential applications lie in multi-modal <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logics</b> that have recently been proposed to reason about authorization and information flow security. ...|$|R

25|$|He {{also showed}} that neither the axiom of choice nor the {{continuum}} hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory, assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result {{opened the door for}} mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic,</b> and modal logic.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} sheaves {{had become a}} {{mainstream}} part of mathematics, with use by no means restricted to algebraic topology. It was later discovered that the logic in categories of sheaves is <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic</b> (this observation is now {{often referred to as}} Kripkendash&Joyal semantics, but probably should be attributed to a number of authors). This shows that some of the facets of sheaf theory can also be traced back as far as Leibniz.|$|E
25|$|Logic is {{the study}} of the {{principles}} of valid reasoning and inference, as well as of consistency, soundness, and completeness. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic)</b> Peirce's law (((P→Q)→P)→P) is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a truth table. The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic, and has applications to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.|$|E

25|$|A {{major force}} behind {{intuitionism}} was L.E.J. Brouwer, who rejected {{the usefulness of}} formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic,</b> different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain {{the law of the}} excluded middle and therefore frowns upon proofs by contradiction. The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted. Important work was later done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis within this framework.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Kolmogorov went on {{his first}} long trip abroad, {{traveling}} to Göttingen and Munich, and then to Paris. He had various scientific contacts in Göttingen. First of all with Courant and his students working on limit theorems, where diffusion processes {{turned out to be}} the limits of discrete random processes, then with Hermann Weyl in <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic,</b> and lastly with Edmund Landau in function theory. His pioneering work, About the Analytical Methods of Probability Theory, was published (in German) in 1931. Also in 1931, he became a professor at the Moscow State University.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} if a formula is {{deducible}} from the laws of <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic,</b> being derived from its axioms {{by way of the}} rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to P and 0 to Q, then the value of Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See CurryHoward isomorphism for the general context of what this implies in type theory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} simple logic that combines, in a {{conservative}} way, the implicative fragments of both classical and <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logics,</b> thus settling a problem posed by Dov Gabbay in [5].

25|$|Gentzen {{asserted}} a sharp {{distinction between}} his single-output natural deduction systems (NK and NJ) and his multiple-output sequent calculus systems (LK and LJ). He {{wrote that the}} intuitionistic natural deduction system NJ was somewhat ugly. He said that the special role of the excluded middle in the classical natural deduction system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK. He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than natural deduction NJ {{in the case of}} <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic,</b> as also in the case of classical logic (LK versus NK). Then he said that in addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem ("Hauptsatz").|$|E
2500|$|<b>Intuitionistic</b> <b>logic</b> allows A ∨ ¬A {{not to be}} {{equivalent}} to true, while paraconsistent logic allows A ∧ ¬A not to be {{equivalent to}} false. Thus it seems natural to regard paraconsistent logic as the [...] "dual" [...] of <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic.</b> However, <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic</b> is a specific logical system whereas paraconsistent logic encompasses a large class of systems. Accordingly, the dual notion to paraconsistency is called paracompleteness, and the [...] "dual" [...] of <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic</b> (a specific paracomplete logic) is a specific paraconsistent system called anti-intuitionistic or dual-intuitionistic logic (sometimes referred to as Brazilian logic, for historical reasons).

[...] Kleene's work with the proof theory of <b>intuitionistic</b> <b>logic</b> showed that constructive information can be recovered from intuitionistic proofs.
