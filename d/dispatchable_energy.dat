Using a global firm-level electricity patent database from 1978 to 2011, we find that the impact of fossil fuel taxes on renewable energy innovation varies with the type of fossil fuel. Specifically, a tax on coal reduces innovation in both fossil fuel and renewable energy technologies while a tax on natural gas has no statistically significant impact on renewable energy innovation. The reason is that easily <b>dispatchable</b> <b>energy</b> sources like coal-fired power plants need to complement renewable energy technologies in the grid because renewables generate electricity intermittently.

40|$|This report {{addresses}} the increasingly important interactions of variable renewables and <b>dispatchable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies, such as nuclear power, {{in terms of}} their effects on electricity systems.

Analysing data from six OECD/NEA countries, the study finds that including the system costs of variable renewables {{at the level of the}} electricity grid increases the total costs of electricity supply by up to one-third, depending on technology, country and penetration levels. In addition, it concludes that, unless the current market subsidies for renewables are altered, dispatchable technologies will increasingly not be replaced as they reach their end of life and consequently security of supply will suffer. This implies that significant changes in management and cost allocation will be needed to generate the flexibility required for an economically viable coexistence of nuclear energy and renewables in increasingly decarbonised electricity systems...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a distributed demand-side management (DSM) method intended for smart grid users with load prediction capabilities, who possibly employ <b>dispatchable</b> <b>energy</b> generation and storage devices. These users participate in the day-ahead market and are interested in deriving the bidding, production, and storage strategies that jointly minimize their expected monetary expense. The resulting day-ahead grid optimization is formulated as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP), which includes global constraints that couple the users ’ strategies. Building on the theory of variational inequalities, we study the main properties of the GNEP and devise a distributed, iterative algorithm converging to the variational solutions of the GNEP. Additionally, users can exploit the reduced uncertainty about their energy consumption and renewable generation at the time of dispatch. We thus present a complementary DSM procedure that allows them to perform some unilateral adjustments on their generation and storage strategies so as to reduce the impact of their real-time deviations with respect to the amount of energy negotiated in the day-ahead. Finally, numerical results in realistic scenarios are reported to corroborate the proposed DSM technique...|$|E

The long-term {{implications of the}} variability and relative unpredictability of these non <b>dispatchable</b> <b>energy</b> sources need to be assessed, for example with energy scenarios. Indeed, electricity is not a homogeneous good: its value depends on the time, space and how variable a production is. Long-term energy models are used, VREs integration challenges being a hot topic in energy modelling. An assessment of long-term energy models is necessary to understand how they represent the specific constraints of VREs {{on the rest of}} the power system. Therefore a new typology is proposed for comparing both long-term energy models and power sector models. This comparison shows that – despite all the recent modelling efforts – no long-term energy model represents in detail all the impacts of VREs on the power sector. For example, the sequential representation of the electricity storage operation is too precise for many long-term models.

While everyone agrees that energy storage is the key component to enable widespread adoption of renewable energy sources, the development of a viable scalable technology has been missing. The Department of Energy has focused on expanded battery research and improved forecasting, and the utilities have deployed renewable energy resources only to the extent of satisfying Renewable Portfolio Standards. The lack of dispatchability of solar and wind-based electricity generation has drastically increased the cost of operation with these components. It is now clear that energy storage coupled with accurate solar and wind forecasting make up the only combination that can succeed in <b>dispatchable</b> renewable <b>energy</b> resources. Conventional batteries scale linearly in size, so the price becomes a barrier for large systems. Flow batteries scale sub-linearly and promise to be useful if their performance can be shown to provide sufficient support for solar and wind-base electricity generation resources. Compressed air energy storage provides the most desirable answer in terms of scalability and performance in all areas except efficiency. With the support of the DOE, Tucson Electric Power and Science Foundation Arizona, the Arizona Research Institute for Solar Energy (AzRISE) at the University of Arizona has had the opportunity to investigate CAES as a potential energy storage resource...|$|R
