The main {{objective is to}} demonstrate that {{small-scale irrigation}} farming is the best suited solution <b>for</b> <b>Mauritania's</b> agriculture. To reach this objective different steps are taken in this study. The first step highlights the different aspects affecting the development of agriculture in the Senegal River basin such as climatic, environmental, and socio-economic constraints. The next step is {{the design of a}} small-scale irrigation system for a small region in the middle valley of the Senegal River called the Dirol plain. Finally, analysis and discussion of the design is made. This discussion centers on the problems faced during the design and the different assumptions made to implement it. The conclusion section addresses the feasibility of the design and gives recommendations that will help improve the design process for future work in the Senegal River basin...|$|R

50|$|A {{major reason}} <b>for</b> <b>Mauritania's</b> {{economic}} stagnation {{since the mid-1970s}} has been the decline of its rural sector. Government planners neglected both herding and farming until the 1980s, concentrating instead on development in the modern sector. The rural sector was severely affected by droughts from 1968 through 1973 and from 1983 through 1985, and it has suffered from sporadic dry spells in other years. In the 1960s, livestock and crop production together provided 35 to 45 percent of GDP (at constant 1982 prices). From 1970 to 1986, their contribution to GDP (at constant 1982 prices) averaged 28 percent, with herding accounting for about 20 percent of this figure and with crop production falling to as low as 3 to 5 percent in the worst drought years. Millet and sorghum production reached 10,000 and 75,000 tons, respectively, in 1999. Other crop production in 1999 included paddy rice, 102,000 tons; and corn, 8,000 tons. Date production was 22,000 tons in 1999.|$|R
