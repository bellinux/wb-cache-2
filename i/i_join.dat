25|$|We {{abuse the}} Holocaust {{when it becomes}} a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should <b>I</b> <b>join</b> a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E

2500|$|I {{therefore}} {{can understand the}} imposition of a 25-year time limit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays to the Law School's educational judgments and refusal to change its admissions policies will itself expire. At that point these policies will clearly have failed to [...] "'eliminate the [...] need for any racial or ethnic'" [...] discrimination because the academic credentials gap will still be there. [...] The Court defines this time limit in terms of narrow tailoring, [...] but I believe this arises from its refusal to define rigorously the broad state interest vindicated today[...] With these observations, <b>I</b> <b>join</b> the last sentence of Part III of the opinion of the Court.|$|E
2500|$|In two {{accounts}}, Smith {{said that}} the Lord told him his sins were forgiven, that he should obey the commandments, {{that the world was}} corrupt, and that the Second Coming was approaching. Later accounts say that when the personages appeared, Smith asked them [...] "O Lord, what church shall I join?" [...] or [...] "Must <b>I</b> <b>join</b> the Methodist Church?" [...] In answer, he was told that [...] "all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom." [...] All churches and their professors were [...] "corrupt", and [...] "all their creeds were an abomination in his sight." [...] Smith was told not to join any of the churches, but that the [...] "fulness of the gospel" [...] would be made known to him at a later time. After the vision withdrew, Smith said he [...] "came to myself" [...] and found himself sprawled on his back.|$|E

2500|$|US Senator Leland Yee {{expressed}} similar sentiments: [...] "Parents can't trust {{a rating}} system that doesn't even disclose how {{they come to}} a particular rating. The ESRB and Rockstar should end this game of secrecy by immediately unveiling what content has been changed to grant the new rating and what correspondence occurred between the ESRB and Rockstar {{to come to this}} conclusion. Unfortunately, history shows that we must be quite skeptical of these two entities. [...] Clearly the ESRB has a conflict of interest in rating these games. It is time to bring transparency to this rating system and for the industry to be held accountable. <b>I</b> <b>join</b> the CCFC in urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the process by which Manhunt 2s rating was downgraded from AO to M."

His life and work will remain a source of eternal inspiration for generations to come. <b>I</b> <b>join</b> all those who are praying for his soul." [...] Vice President Hamid Ansari said [...] "While his courage, determination and sacrifice inspired millions of people during the anti-apartheid movement, his message of peace, forgiveness and reconciliation thereafter, united them and led the rainbow nation {{on the path to}} peace and progress. In his death, South Africans have lost the father of their nation and the world a statesman, whose life and message of courage and goodness would continue to inspire and guide all of us around the world in the years ahead." [...] India will observe a five-day State Mourning as a mark of respect for Mandela. A decision to this effect was taken at a special meeting of the Union Cabinet, which condoled the death of the anti-apartheid icon.|$|E
