25|$|The {{concepts}} of ergodicity and the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{are central to}} applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties {{is equal to the}} average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).|$|E

We show that for a class of billiard tables Q ae R n; n ? 2, with focusing and flat boundary components the corresponding billiards system is ergodic. This class of regions thus provides a natural generalization of the Bunimovich stadium. 1 Introduction Systems of a billiard type play a special role in the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. On the one hand, billiards correspond to the first models that inspired Boltzmann's and Gibbs' creation of the ergodic theory itself. Indeed, the celebrated Boltzmann <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypotheses</b> deals with the gas of hard spheres, i. e. with a billiard. On the other hand, billiards provide the most visible models of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. It is well known that chaotic properties of dynamical systems of physical origin are generated by hyperbolicity. Sometimes hyp [...] ...|$|R

We determine characteristic fingerprints of the well-known <b>ergodic</b> (Floquet-Eigenstate thermalization <b>hypothesis</b> for slow driving/weak disorder) and many-body localized (Floquet-many-body localization for fast driving/strong disorder) phases.

50|$|Assumption of the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> allows {{proof that}} {{certain types of}} {{perpetual}} motion machines of the second kind are impossible. The figure above displays situations where the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> does and does not hold for a simplistic model of an ideal gas. If the walls are perfectly smooth and circular, the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> does not hold. If {{it was possible to}} construct a sort of tunnel whereby specular reflections cause atoms to move from a less populated container to an identical one with greater density, this would allow the direct conversion of random thermal energy into useful work {{in a way that does}} not require a heat bath. But, by Liouville's theorem, if all regions of phase space are equally populated at time, t=0, then they are equally probable for all time. No reflective 'trap' or Maxwell's demon (such as depicted in the figure) will 'unmix' a gas that has randomly filled both containers with equal density and pressure.|$|E

50|$|In {{macroscopic}} systems, the timescales {{over which}} a system can truly explore {{the entirety of}} its own phase space can be sufficiently large that the thermodynamic equilibrium state exhibits some form of ergodicity breaking. A common example is that of spontaneous magnetisation in ferromagnetic systems, whereby below the Curie temperature the system preferentially adopts a non-zero magnetisation even though the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> would imply that no net magnetisation should exist {{by virtue of the}} system exploring all states whose time-averaged magnetisation should be zero. The fact that macroscopic systems often violate the literal form of the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1963, Sinai {{announced}} a {{proof of the}} <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for a gas consisting of n hard spheres confined to a box. The complete proof, however, was never published, and the problem remains open to this day.|$|E

50|$|In {{probability}} theory, an ergodic dynamical {{system is}} one that, broadly speaking, {{has the same}} behavior averaged over time as averaged over the space of all the system's states in its phase space.

50|$|In 1947 Norbert Wiener {{claimed that}} the Lebesgue {{integral}} had unexpected but important implications in establishing the validity of Willard Gibbs' work on the foundations of statistical mechanics.

50|$|In {{physics and}} thermodynamics, the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> says that, {{over long periods}} of time, the time spent by a system in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is {{proportional}} to the volume of this region, i.e., that all accessible microstates are equiprobable {{over a long period of}} time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{probabilistic}} model of LSA {{does not match}} observed data: LSA assumes that words and documents form a joint Gaussian model (<b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis),</b> while a Poisson distribution has been observed.

50|$|The Gibbsian {{ensemble}} idealises {{the notion}} of repeating an experiment again and again on different systems, not again and again on the same system. So long-term time averages and the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> despite the intense interest in {{them in the first}} part of the twentieth century, strictly speaking are not relevant to the probability assignment for the state one might find the system in.|$|E
50|$|Liouville's Theorem states that, for Hamiltonian systems, {{the local}} density of microstates {{following}} a particle path through phase space is constant as viewed by an observer {{moving with the}} ensemble (i.e., the convective time derivative is zero). Thus, if the microstates are uniformly distributed in phase space initially, they will remain so at all times. But Liouville's theorem {{does not imply that}} the <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> holds for all Hamiltonian systems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ergodic</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is also {{important}} for the Boltzmann approach. It says that, {{over long periods of}} time, the time spent in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e. that all accessible microstates are equally probable {{over a long period of}} time. Equivalently, it says that time average and average over the statistical ensemble are the same.|$|E

50|$|The main use of {{molecular}} mechanics {{is in the}} field {{of molecular}} dynamics.
