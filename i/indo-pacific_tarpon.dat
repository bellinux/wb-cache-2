50|$|The <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>tarpon,</b> Megalops cyprinoides, {{also known}} as the oxeye herring or simply herring, is a {{relatively}} medium-sized species of tarpon.|$|E
50|$|Crabs and shell-dwelling {{molluscs}} {{also share}} the beaches, and can been seen moving about the sand at low tide. On the water {{the number of}} fish decreases {{from year to year}} because of pollution and overfishing. Despite this, there are still fish species such as the milkfish, the barramundi, and the <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>tarpon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>tarpon</b> migrates {{between the}} open sea and inland rivers. As with all Elopiformes, it spawns mainly offshore. Juveniles of the species stay inshore and migrate to coastal areas while {{maturing}} to spawn. Typically, they spawn twice a year. At sea, the larvae migrate inland and are leptocephalic (flattened, transparent and eel-like). Unlike the barramundi, {{they are able to}} breed in fresh and salt water.|$|E
50|$|This exhibit hall {{features}} {{aquatic animals}} native to Taiwan, from waters {{as small as}} rivers to as vast as the open sea. The exhibits are themed after the water systems of Taiwan, starting from {{the river and the}} reservoir to the intertidal zone and finally to the open sea. There is also a touch pool featuring marine invertebrates in the intertidal exhibit area. Animals on display include tilapia, Japanese eel, trout, cuttlefish, nurse sharks, <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>tarpon,</b> yellowfin tuna, spotted eagle rays, and a whale shark. The main ocean tanks contains 1500000 gal L of sea water, has a 16.5 x 4.85 m acrylic viewing window and an 80 m shark tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The {{stream is}} an {{important}} seasonal freshwater artisanal fishery producing an annual catch, as of 2016, of about US$500,000 from an average weekly catch of 5 to 15kg by each fisherman. In the lower reaches of the stream, this low catch of smaller immature fish is evidence of lack of management of the fishery. Less than 1% {{to as much as}} 10% of the local population may be engaged at least part-time as fishermen, most are men. Full-time fishermen earn about US$1,000 to 2,000 per year, which is below the poverty line. Gill nets, cast nets, long lines, fish hooks and line sets, spears, traps and traditional fishing boats are used. The catch includes Snapper (Aha-an), Flagtail (Aligaman), Crab (Alimango), Red-tailed goby (Anga), Squaretail mullet (Balanak), Goby (Batinga), Silver perch (Bugaong), Otomebora Mullet (Bunak), <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>Tarpon</b> (Buwan-buwan), Loach goby (Dalapakan), Mountain bass (Damagan), Indian pellona (Ibis), Flathead grey mullet (Gisaw), Gourami (Gurami), Mudfish (Halu-an), Shrimp (Hipon, Goby (Iswil), Carp (Karpa), Eel (Kasili), Spotted Scat (Kikilo), Mullet (Muli), Cyprinidae (Pait), Catfish (Pantat), Rock goby (Pigok), Mangrove red snapper (Tadlungan), Tilapia. The fishing season is the dry season, November to May, in the mid and upper ranges of the stream and flood season, June to October, in its lower reaches when large fish are being washed down.|$|E
50|$|A 1955 {{study by}} Mary John {{identified}} fifteen species of grey mullets. She reports that most species of grey millets {{migrate to the}} lake during the months when Kayal {{is connected to the}} sea. The Kayal is rich in prawns. An environment impact assessment by National Thermal Power Corporation in association with the Fisheries department lists about 70 species of fishes in the Kayal. There are about 40 commercially important fish species which includes flathead mullet, greenback mullet, longarm mullet, largescale mullet, gold-spot mullet, bluespot mullet, tade grey mullet, bluetail mullet, Commerson's glassy perchlet, bald glassy perchlet, greasy grouper, tiger perch, spotted catfish, milkfish, longfin snake-eel, largetooth flounder, Solea indica, roughscale tonguesole, speckled tonguesole, barracuda, pearlspot, orange chromide, sulphur goatfish, spotted scat, whipfin silver-biddy, slender silver-biddy, small Bengal silver-biddy, common ponyfish, splendid ponyfish, shortnose ponyfish, <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>tarpon,</b> tenpounder, fringescale sardinella, Indian anchovy, Commerson's anchovy, Malabar thryssa and walking catfish. Besides the commercially important species there are about 30 other species of fish including northern whiting, bigeye trevally, black-tailed trevally, congaturi halfbeak, long-billed halfbeak, Quoy's garfish, chacunda gizzard shad, milkspotted puffer, diodon, Indian halibut, chorinemus, dusky sleeper, tank goby, mangrove red snapper, dory snapper, sleepy goby, sharptail goby, spotfin snouted goby Indian short-finned eel, Macrognathus guentheri, long whiskers catfish, yellow catfish, striped dwarf catfish, scarlet-banded barb, greenstripe barb, climbing perch, Indian carplet and spotted snakehead.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two species}} of tarpon are Megalops atlanticus (Atlantic tarpon) and the Megalops cyprinoides (<b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>tarpon).</b> M. atlanticus is found on the western Atlantic coast from Virginia to Brazil, {{throughout}} {{the coast of the}} Gulf of Mexico, and throughout the Caribbean. Tarpon are also found along the eastern Atlantic coast from Senegal to South Angola. M. cyprinoides is found along the eastern African coast, throughout southeast Asia, Japan, Tahiti, and Australia. Both species are found in both saltwater and freshwater habitats, usually ascending rivers to access freshwater marshes. [...] They are able to survive in brackish water, waters of varying pH, and habitats with low dissolved [...] content due to their swim bladders, which they use primarily to breathe. They are also able to rise to the surface and take gulps of air, which gives them a short burst of energy. The habitats of tarpon vary greatly with their developmental stages. Stage-one larvae are usually found in clear, warm, oceanic waters, relatively close to the surface. Stage-two and -three larvae are found in salt marshes, tidal pools, creeks, and rivers. The habitats are characteristically warm, shallow, dark bodies of water with sandy mud bottoms. Tarpon commonly ascend rivers into freshwater. As they progress from the juvenile stage to adulthood, they move back to the open waters of the ocean, though many remain in freshwater habitats.|$|E

This was locally called as “Kulanchan” or “Valaya kulanchan”. It is also called as Poomeen or Mooran kendai or Manna {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu.

40|$|Abstract Background Myxosporeans {{are known}} from aquatic annelids but {{parasitism}} of platyhelminths by myxosporeans {{has not been}} widely reported. Hyperparasitism of gill monogeneans by Myxidium giardi has been reported from the European eel and Myxidium -like hyperparasites have also been observed during studies of gill monogeneans from Malaysia and Japan. The present study aimed to collect new hyperparasite material from Malaysia for morphological and molecular descriptions. In addition, PCR screening of host fish was undertaken {{to determine whether they}} are also hosts for the myxosporean. Results Heavy myxosporean infections were observed in monogeneans from two out of 14 fish and were detected from a further five fish using specific PCRs and pooled monogenean DNA. Positive DNA isolates were sequenced and were from a single species of myxosporean. Myxospore morphology was consistent with Myxidium with histozoic development in the parenchymal tissues of the monogenean. Simultaneous infections in the fish could not be confirmed microscopically; however, identical myxosporean DNA could be amplified from kidney, spleen and intestinal tract tissues using the specific PCR. Small subunit (SSU) rDNA for the myxosporean was amplified and was found to be most similar (92 %) to that of another hyperparasitic myxosporean from a gill monogenean from Japan and to numerous multivalvulidan myxosporeans from the genus Kudoa (89 - 91 %). Phylogenetic analyses placed the hyperparasite sequence basally to clades containing Kudoa, Unicapsula and Sphaerospora. Conclusions The myxosporean infecting the gill monogenean, Diplectanocotyla gracilis, from the <b>Indo-Pacific</b> <b>tarpon,</b> Megalops cyprinoides, is described as a new species, Myxidium incomptavermi, based on a histozoic development in the monogenean host and its phylogenetic placement. We have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} a myxosporean hyperparasite of gill monogeneans is detectable in the fish host. However, myxospores could not be isolated from the fish and confirmation was by PCR alone. The relationship between the myxosporean infection in gill monogeneans and the presence of parasitic DNA in fish is not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, myxospores with a Myxidium -like morphology, two of which we have shown to be phylogenetically related, have now been reported to develop in three different gill monogeneans, indicating that myxosporeans are true parasites of monogeneans. </p...|$|E
