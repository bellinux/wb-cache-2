40|$|A {{variety of}} paint {{products}} {{are used for}} their aesthetic and anti-corrosive properties. Isocyanates are consistently found in automobile paint products, particularly in <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> polyurethane products. <b>Clear</b> <b>coat</b> is typically sprayed via pressurized air {{by means of an}} auto-spray robot. In <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> repair situations, manual, air-powered spray guns are used, and manual spray Operators administer the <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> material. The isocyanates are a primary anti-corrosive agent in polyurethane products. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not established a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have set Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) and Threshold Limit Value (TLV), respectively. NIOSH recommends a 0. 005 parts per million (ppm), 10 -hour Time Weighted Average (TWA), and a ceiling exposure of 0. 020 ppm in a 10 minute period. Similarly, ACGIH recommends a 0. 005 ppm, 8 hour TWA. Automobile manufacturers use <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> in a variety of ways. Some may use <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> with blocked isocyanates, or isocyanates that are completely reacted, and others may use <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> products that allow isocyanates to be liberated during an application, baking, and curing process. The research objective {{of this study was to}} characterize exposure, focusing on a single manufacturer’s use of isocyanate-containing <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> in their Paint Department. A newly evaluated medium (ISO 17734) using di-n-butylamine as a derivative agent, in a denuder tube, was selected instead of NIOSH methods 5521, 5522, and 5525. The ISO evaluated medium was selected to reduce secondary hazard exposure to toluene in impingers. Second, a medium developed by SKC, Inc., called ISO-CHEK®, was not selected because of the short collection time, sensitivity of the medium after collection, and storage and shipping requirements for analysis. Sampling took place over two days, one day for manual spray operations with 2 personal samples from Operators, and 4 area samples collected, and the second day for auto-sprayer Inspectors with 4 personal samples collected. The samples were then analyzed for hexamethylene diisocyanates (HDI) monomer and homopolymer species. The 0. 005 ppm, 10 hour TWA; the 0. 020 ppm ceiling limit (10 minutes); and the 0. 005 ppm 8 -hour TWA TLV were not exceeded on either day of sampling. Neither the area nor the personal samples exceeded the 10 hour TWA, ceiling limit, or TLV. In fact, the results had to be recalculated in to parts per billion (ppb). The average exposure for manual spray Operators was 0. 052 ppb for the homopolymer, and 0. 024 ppb for the monomer species. For auto-spray Inspectors, the average was 0. 053 ppb for the homopolymer component and 0. 021 ppb for the monomer species. Though the average isocyanate concentration was similar for both Operators and Inspectors, the averages are still below REL and TLV recommendations. These data provided preliminary information regarding the exposure to isocyanates from <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> use, and also provide context for future evaluation of isocyanate use at this automobile manufacturer. The low concentration of isocyanates could indicate working ventilation systems, liberation of isocyanate species to non-hazardous forms, or low volatilization of isocyanates from the <b>clear</b> <b>coat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Automotive paints {{have used}} an {{ultraviolet}} (UV) absorbing <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> system for nearly thirty years. These <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> have become of forensic interest when comparing paint transfers and paint samples from suspect vehicles. <b>Clear</b> <b>coat</b> samples and their ultraviolet absorbers are not typically examined or characterized using Raman spectroscopy or microspectrophotometry (MSP), however some past {{research has been}} done using MSP. Chemometric methods are also not typically used for this characterization. In this study, Raman and MSP spectra were collected from the <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> of 245 American and Australian automobiles. Chemometric analysis was subsequently performed on the measurements. Sample preparation was simple and involved peeling the <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> layer and placing the peel on a foil-covered microscope slide for Raman or a quartz slide with no cover slip for MSP. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering suggested three classes of spectra, and principal component analysis confirmed this. Factor loadings for the Raman data illustrated that much of the variance between spectra came from specific regions (400 – 465 cm- 1, 600 – 660 cm- 1, 820 – 885 cm- 1, 950 – 1050 cm- 1, 1740 – 1780 cm- 1, and 1865 – 1900 cm- 1). For MSP, the regions of highest variance were between 230 – 270 nm and 290 – 370 nm. Discriminant analysis showed that the three classes were well-differentiated with a cross-validation accuracy of 92. 92 % for Raman and 91. 98 % for MSP. Analysis of variance attributed differentiability of the classes to the regions between 400 – 430 cm- 1, 615 – 640 cm- 1, 825 – 880 cm- 1, 1760 – 1780 cm- 1, and 1860 – 1900 cm- 1 for Raman spectroscopy. For MSP, these regions were between 240 – 285 nm and 300 – 370 nm. External validation results were poor due to excessively noisy spectra, with a prediction accuracy of 51. 72 % for Raman and 50. 00 % for MSP. No correlation was found between the make, model, and year of the vehicles using either method of analysis...|$|R
40|$|A testing {{protocol}} was established {{for measuring the}} flexure properties of thin-walled tubes constructed of a composite mixture of glass and carbon fibers and epoxy resin for use in Fly Fishing rods. Standard three point bend tests were conducted in accordance with ASTM standard D 7329 - 13 with a span length of six inches. All samples were of the sample length and diameter, allowing direct comparison of the maximum loads reached before failure, which are directly indicative of the Modulus of Rupture (MOR). Two constructions were tested both containing the same unidirectional fiber but with different support structure. These tubes were tested identically for both as delivered samples and for the samples having undergone ultraviolet, humidity, and elevated temperature exposure. Construction 1 reached higher maximum stresses than Construction 2 and displayed similar amounts of flexure. When coated and exposed, the strength of Construction 1 and 2 both increased when compared to uncoated and unexposed samples. In Construction 1, maximum loads achieved in samples painted, <b>clear</b> <b>coated</b> and exposed averaged loads at failure of 45. 33 lb, solely <b>clear</b> <b>coated</b> and exposed samples averaged 42. 9 lb at failure, uncoated and exposed averaged 38. 1 lb, and uncoated and unexposed averaged 40. 9 lb.

Testing of three samples exposed to environmental conditions found the model to be robust to weathering over at least an eight-month period. However, analysis of 12 samples of unknown prior history found that extreme degradation over at least a 10 -year period, or the presence of a post-manufacture (respray) coating, could result in misclassification when relying solely on analysis of the <b>clear</b> <b>coat.</b> It is therefore important that cross-sections comprising the full layer sequence of the paint system are obtained wherever possible, as analysis of the underlying layers may give more comprehensive characterisation...|$|R

The cured nanocomposite <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> showed improved scratch and abrasion resistance. However, oxide modifications accomplished by silanes having polymerization-inactive methyl, n-propyl, and isobutyl functionalities yield coatings with similar scratch and abrasion resistance. To explain these findings, infrared and multinuclear MAS NMR experiments, MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS n mass spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results were used to reveal the structure of surface-anchored organosilanes and their interaction with the acrylate matrix. Ladder-like polysiloxane chains chemically grafted onto the filler particles have been proposed. These ladder-like structures build a short range interpenetrating network with the polyacrylates. This results in a durable link between the organic and inorganic phase...|$|R
