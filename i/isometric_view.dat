5|$|Players {{control the}} player {{character}} Kid Klown as {{he attempts to}} rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an <b>isometric</b> <b>view</b> as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans of blowing up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown {{does not make it}} to the bomb in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At the end of each stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending could be of use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player gets all 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage.|$|E
25|$|Gameplay {{switches}} to the tactical combat phase whenever X-COM ground forces {{come in contact}} with aliens. In the Battlescape screen, the player commands a small group of selected soldiers (at least one) against the aliens in an <b>isometric</b> <b>view</b> and turn-based battle taking place on a semi-randomly generated map. There are nine different terrain types in the game (farmland, desert, forest, ice, mountain, jungle, urban, alien base, XCOM base), each of which pose advantages and disadvantages to the player.|$|E

Adams has acknowledged {{the role of the}} community in supporting development and endorsed third-party tools, visualizers and interface code; [...] Indeed, he has said that he admires third-party developers who create tools for Dwarf Fortress {{in spite of the fact}} that the game is closed-source.|$|E

500|$|In Monument Valley, player-character princess Ida {{journeys}} through mazes {{of optical}} illusions and impossible objects, which {{are referred to}} as [...] "sacred geometry" [...] in-game, as she journeys to be forgiven for something. The game is presented in <b>isometric</b> <b>view,</b> and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as Ida progresses to the map's exit. Each of the ten levels has a different central mechanic. Interactions include moving platforms and pillars, and creating bridges. The player is indirectly cued through the game by design elements like color, and directly cued by crow people, who block Ida's path. Critics compared the game's visual style to a vibrant M. C. Escher drawing and Echochrome. The game includes a camera mode where the player can roam the level to compose screenshots. It includes filters similar to those of Instagram.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{graphical}} {{versions of}} Lunar Lander {{have been produced}} for several other systems. Although some, such as a version by Stoneware for the Apple II, were named Lunar Lander, many were not; regardless, {{the name of the}} type of game continued to be [...] "lunar landers". Bill Budge developed Tranquility Base for the Apple II in 1980, HAL Laboratory developed Jupiter Lander, a raster version of the game, in 1982 for the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64, and IBM released Rocket Lander for the IBM Personal Computer in 1982. Ahoy! magazine published a Commodore BASIC type-in program version of the game for the Commodore 64 in April 1984. Tom Hudson wrote Retrofire, a more elaborate version of the lander concept for Atari 8-bit computers in 1983; it uses an 3D <b>isometric</b> <b>view,</b> so there are three velocities to control (along the X, Y, and Z axes). Other games include Apollo 11 (1983) for the ZX Spectrum, Marslander (1983) for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro, and versions of Lunar Lander for the Commodore PET and TRS-80. George Moromisato developed Lander for Windows 3.1x in 1990, Nintendo released a version of Lunar Lander for the Game Boy that same year, and Psygnosis released a 3D, commercial version for Microsoft Windows in 1999 titled Lander. Other modern versions and remakes have been made for iOS, Android, mobile phones, and browsers.|$|E

50|$|Dungeon Magic, {{also known}} as Light Bringer (ライトブリンガー), is a 1994 arcade game by Taito Corporation Japan and it also {{included}} in Taito Legends 2. Unlike most medieval/fantasy beat 'em ups, it featured an <b>isometric</b> <b>viewing</b> angle, some platforming (usually involving players stacking rocks or crates to climb on and jump to treasure chests), unusually large stylised sprites, and variable blood/gore settings.|$|R
5000|$|Isometric {{graph paper}} or 3D graph paper is a {{triangular}} graph paper {{which uses a}} series of three guidelines forming a 60° grid of small triangles. The triangles are arranged in groups of six to make hexagons. The name suggests the use for <b>isometric</b> <b>views</b> or pseudo-three-dimensional views. Among other functions, they can be used in the design of trianglepoint embroidery. It can be used to draw angles accurately.|$|R

Nethergate offers the feature {{of being able to}} play {{on either side of the}} story, as Celts or Romans. The game has a plot which allows for several endings and many side quests, which flow alongside the main story. Spiderweb Software released a remake called Nethergate Resurrection in May 2007.|$|R

The 'Real' tab contains the Six Flags parks preconstructed, while the 'Other' tab contains their empty versions. When creating a scenario, the player can save {{to any of the}} tabs. As with the previous game, players could upload their saved track designs onto the now-defunct 'Ride Exchange.'

40|$|Results {{are given}} of pressure-distribution {{measurements}} made over two different horizontal tail surfaces {{and the right}} wing cellule, including the slipstream area, of an observation-type biplane. Measurements were also taken of air speed, control-surface positions, control-stick forces, angular velocities, and accelerations during various abrupt maneuvers. These maneuvers consisted of push-downs and pull-ups from level flight, dive pull-outs, and aileron rolls with various thrust conditions. The results from the pressure-distribution measurements over the wing cellule are given on charts showing the variation of individual rib coefficients with wing coefficients; {{the data from the}} tail-surface pressure-distribution measurements are given mainly as total loads and moments. These data are supplemented by time histories of the measured quantities and <b>isometric</b> <b>views</b> of the rib pressure distributions occurring in abrupt maneuvers...|$|R
