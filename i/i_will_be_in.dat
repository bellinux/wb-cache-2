500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to you about that, I promise you <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E
500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier {{to live in a}} world that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the one where that inevitably stops." [...] Similarly to Sepinwall, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "I got a few laughs and that's all I ever look for in The Simpsons these days. I just like knowing it's still there. [...] It doesn't have the spring in the legs quite like it used to. It's not going to dazzle at the same spectacular rate. But even after 500 episodes, it still has a little something left." [...] Goodman described the couch gag as [...] "lovely".|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and {{attended}} rodeos. He made Custer State Park his [...] "summer White House." [...] While on vacation, Coolidge surprisingly issued a terse statement {{that he would not}} seek a second full term as president: [...] "I do not choose to run for President in 1928." [...] After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. [...] "If I take another term, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the White House till 1933… Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it—too long!" [...] In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: [...] "The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish." [...] After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that [...] "for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad." [...] Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.|$|E

Furtwängler quietly replied: [...] "In that case, Herr Reichskanzler, at least <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> very good company." [...] Hitler couldn't even answer, and vanished from the room.|$|E

Forrest angrily told Wheeler [...] "Tell [...] that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> my coffin before I will fight again under your command." [...] Bragg dealt with this rivalry in the Tullahoma Campaign by assigning Wheeler to guard the army's right flank while Forrest guarded the left. A Union cavalry advance on Shelbyville on June 27 trapped Wheeler and 50 of his men {{on the north side}} of the Duck River, forcing Wheeler to plunge his horse over a 15-foot embankment and escape through the rain-swollen river.|$|E
2500|$|After the Battle of Kápolna in 26–27 February 1849, the {{commander}} of the Austrian imperial forces Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, taught that he destroyed the Hungarian revolutionary forces once and for all. He wrote on 3 March in his report sent to the imperial court in Olmütz, that: [...] "I smashed the rebel hordes, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a few days in Debrecen (the temporary capital of Hungary)". Despite of this he did not attacked the Hungarian forces, because he did not got any reliable informations about the number of the Hungarian forces in the case if he would cross the Tisza river. But because of his alertness he lost the opportunity to win the war. While he was thinking of attacking or not, the Hungarian commanders who were discontented with the disappointing performance of Lieutenant General Henryk Dembiński as high commander of the Hungarian forces, accusing him because the loss of the Battle of Kápolna, started a [...] "rebellion", making a meeting in Tiszafüred, which forced the Government Commissioner Bertalan Szemere to depose the Polish general and put Artúr Görgei instead. This infuriated Lajos Kossuth, the President of the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), wanting to execute Görgei for rebellion. Finally he was forced by the support of the Hungarian generals for Görgei, to renounce to his plan, and accept the deposition of Dembiński. But Kossuth's antipathy towards Görgei prevented him to accept the decision of Szemere, but he named Lieutenant General Antal Vetter as high commander instead. But Vetter got ill on 28 March, so after two days Kossuth was forced to name Görgei as temporary high commander of the Hungarian main forces. These days and weeks of unrest, uncertainty and changes, could be an excellent opportunity for Windisch-Grätz to cross the Tisza river and defeat the Hungarian army once and for all. But the Austrian field-marshall, paralyzed by an increasing fear of a Hungarian attack, instead of attacking, tried to inform himself about the numbers and strength of the Hungarian armies which were on the Eastern bank of the Tisza river, but his spies were unsuccessful in obtaining any information. Because of this he scattered his troops to prevent a bypass attack from the north, which he feared, will relieve the imperial siege against the fortress of Komárom, which could cut his support lines.|$|E
