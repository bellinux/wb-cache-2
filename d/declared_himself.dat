5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{became a}} {{follower}} of the Báb in Persia in 1845.

5|$|Edward was crowned at age {{fourteen}} {{after his}} father was deposed by his mother, Isabella of France, and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he <b>declared</b> <b>himself</b> rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied. This started {{what became known as}} the Hundred Years' War. Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.|$|E
