25|$|<b>Hydrazine</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{also has}} a variety of uses in {{industrial}} chemistry, including as a chemical intermediate, as a catalyst in making fibers out of acetate, as a fungicide, antiseptic, in the analysis and synthesis of minerals and testing for arsenic in metals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrazine</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{is also a}} {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and is incompatible with alcohol, tranquilizers and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines and barbiturates), and other psycho-active drugs, with pethidine (meperidine, Demerol), and with foods containing significant amounts of the amino acid breakdown product tyramine, such as aged cheeses, raisins, avocados, processed and cured fish and meats, fermented products, and others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrazine</b> <b>sulfate</b> was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer cachexia). This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia. In this model, <b>hydrazine</b> <b>sulfate</b> is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.|$|E
40|$|The prophage-inducing {{capability}} of hydroxylamine sulfate and 36 of its derivatives, and of hydrazine dihydrochloride and dihydrazine sulfate and 43 of their derivatives, was determined in Escherichia coli W 1709 (λ). Maximal nontoxic concentrations up to 1 mg/ml were tested. Hydroxylamine sulfate was active at 2. 5 μg/ml {{and the following}} 17 derivatives were active at concentrations ranging up to 500 μg/ml: α-naphthylhydroxylamine, N-hydroxy- 2 -aminofluorene, oxamyl hydroxamic acid, O-carbamoyl hydroxylamine (isohydroxyurea), N-hydroxyurethane, N-methylhydroxylamine HCl, salicylhydroxamic acid, oxalohydroxamic acid, methoxyamine HCl, ethoxyamine HCl, N, N-diethylhydroxylamine oxalate, formaldoxime, formamidoxime, acetohydroxamic acid, acetaldoxime, acetone oxime, and hydroxyguanidine <b>sulfate.</b> <b>Hydrazine</b> dihydrochloride and dihydrazine sulfate were effective inducers at 5. 0 and 2. 5 μg/ml, respectively, and the following nine derivatives of them were active at concentrations ranging up to 500 μg/ml: phthalic acid hydrazide, phenylhydrazine HCl, p-nitrophenylhydrazine, p-chlorophenylhydrazine HCl, formylhydrazine, carbohydrazide, semicarbazide HCl, 1 -methyl- 1 -phenyl-hydrazine sulfate, and acetic acid hydrazide. Nineteen hydroxylamine and 34 hydrazine derivatives were ineffective as inducers.

25|$|PEPCK-C is enhanced, both {{in terms}} of its {{production}} and activation, by many factors. Transcription of the PEPCK-C gene is stimulated by glucagon, glucocorticoids, retinoic acid, and adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cAMP), while it is inhibited by insulin. Of these factors, insulin, a hormone that is deficient in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus, is considered dominant, as it inhibits the transcription of many of the stimulatory elements. PEPCK activity is also inhibited by <b>hydrazine</b> <b>sulfate,</b> and the inhibition therefore decreases the rate of gluconeogenesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrazine</b> <b>sulfate</b> is toxic and {{potentially}} carcinogenic. Nevertheless, the short-term side effects reported in various clinical trials are relatively mild: minor nausea and vomiting, dizziness and excitement, polyneuritis (inflammation of the nerves) and difficulties in fine muscle control (such as writing). However, more serious, even fatal side effects {{have been reported}} in rare cases: one patient developed fatal liver and kidney failure, and another developed serious symptoms of neurotoxicity. These side effects and other reports of hydrazine toxicity are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrazine {{may play a role in}} the toxicity of the antibiotic isoniazid, which is thought to be metabolized to hydrazine in the body.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete tumor regression in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis of this trial notes that interpretation of these data is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had made them feel any better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from <b>hydrazine</b> <b>sulfate</b> treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a post-hoc analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation of this trial, and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.|$|E
