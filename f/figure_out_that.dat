25|$|Sorey and {{his friends}} then confront Heldalf again, but <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} is amiss as he does not show any intention to kill them immediately, as after failing to provoke Sorey, Heldalf attempts to convince him to join his side: this prompts the party to retreat {{and look for the}} true reason behind his motives before their final confrontation. It is revealed that the Era of Chaos was initiated when the previous Shepherd turned Heldalf, a Rolance military general at a time, into a cursed immortal being by infusing him with the fallen Seraph Maotelus when he refused to provide aid to his village when it was invaded: this filled his life with hatred and turned him into the Lord of Calamity. It was also revealed that two infants from the village, Sorey and Mikleo, were saved and taken in to be raised with the Seraphim. With the truth revealed and understood, the Shepherd and his comrades take on Heldalf once again and defeat him once and for all, turning Heldalf back into his human self and Sorey finally ending his life, giving him the peace he craved. Sorey then merges with Maotelus to expel the malevolence from the world and usher in a new era, where both the Seraphim and humans finally live together peacefully. In a post-credits sequence, a future Mikleo is shown exploring some ruins, and is saved from a fall by a reawakened Sorey.|$|E

Snow and David {{are ready to}} console Regina and even Zelena is ready to reach out {{each other in the}} wake of her loss to Hades. Violet also pays respects to Robin as she tells Henry she was worried about him {{while he was in the}} Underworld. At the Clock tower, Gold is looking for another way to wake up Belle, and begins to look at the Olympian Crystal, which he'll use to tether all the magic from Storybrooke. Gold holds the crystal and it glows. Back at the Diner, Emma wants to talk to Regina but suddenly they hear a noise, and witnesses a series of beams shooting outside from the Olympian Crystal. All of a sudden Hook shows up as Emma tells Regina about his return. Realizing that Gold is behind it, everyone traces the disturbance to the tower; Emma and Regina <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Gold couldn't wake Belle with True Love's kiss since she doesn't love him anymore, so he stole Storybrooke's magic as part of a plan to wake her. Emma tells Regina to let her and the others handle this one, leading to the two bickering until Henry stops them, but after Regina disappears, Emma tells Henry to leave as well, only to meet up with Violet at the Pawn Shop. Henry is upset over how magic has destroyed his family and sees it as bad, so he comes up with a solution by creating a plan called “Operation Mixtape.” Utilizing his role as the Author, Henry uses the quill to writes himself as the possessor of the crystal, and suddenly, it appears in his hand. He sends both mothers a text, detailing his plans.|$|E

500|$|According to the singer, she {{had written}} several songs prior {{to the release of}} Truth Serum. She confessed that both the writing and {{recording}} process of the EP was very emotional, and that the vocals of the songs were taken from her demos. Truth Serum is a concept record that details Lo's [...] "most intense" [...] relationship from beginning to end. That approach was unintentional, as Lo realized that the tracks talked about the relationship after she had picked them for the EP. She explained; [...] "I didn't plan to write it that way, but when I looked at the songs that I had when I was picking ones for the EP, I was like, 'Oh my god, here it is'. I didn't really <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{it was going to be}} the full story right there until I looked and listened". Concerning the title of the EP, the singer decided to call it Truth Serum after she had picked the songs for it; she said in an interview that [...] "when you look at the songs, it's all about honesty and I'm really giving up a lot of myself in these songs; I'm not filtering anything. I felt that kind of speaks a lot for how truthful the EP is".|$|E
500|$|Fierstein and Lauper {{had both}} gained {{previous}} critical acclaim and honors {{in their respective}} fields. Fierstein had won four Tonys: acting and writing awards for Torch Song Trilogy, an acting Tony for Hairspray, and one for writing the book of La Cage; Lauper is a chart-topping singer-songwriter and actress who had won Grammy, Emmy and many other awards for her songs and performances. Fierstein noted a change in focus between the film [...] "about the saving of a factory" [...] and the musical, which include [...] "drag queens singing as they pass along the assembly line." [...] He said the main {{difference is that the}} musical is, [...] "at its core, about two young men who come from seemingly opposite worlds who <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> they have a lot in common, beginning with the need to stand up to their dads." [...] Lauper's inspirations ranged from listening as a child to her parents' recordings of South Pacific and West Side Story, as well as musical inspirations as diverse as Aaron Copland's [...] "Appalachian Spring" [...] and pop singer Lana Del Rey. In a broadcast interview with Patrick Healy of The New York Times, Lauper and Fierstein said that, in adapting the film, they stressed themes of community and the universality of the father-son bond as vehicles to explore the issues of tolerance and self-acceptance.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{agreed to}} meet with Schwarzenegger about the film and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role. Upon meeting him, however, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger who would {{talk about how the}} villain should be played. Cameron began {{sketching}} his face on a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still. After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that [...] "he'd make a hell of a Terminator". Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Destroyer, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, [...] "Oh some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks." [...] He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. He also wrote that [...] "it took [...] awhile to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Jim [...] was the real deal." [...] In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons {{to be able to use}} them and feel comfortable around them. Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. James Cameron said that [...] "Somehow, even his [...] accent worked... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out." ...|$|E

At the Greenwoods', she witnesses a group of young white men smash down the door, drag out Alice’s father, who is a slave, and whip him brutally for being there without papers. One of the men punches Alice's mother when she refuses his advances.
