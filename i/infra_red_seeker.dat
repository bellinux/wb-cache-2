40|$|Continuous {{measurement}} of oxygen {{level and pulse}} rate {{is very important for}} aged people, pregnant women and in many other critical situations. This is commonly monitored by a pulse oxymeter. This paper presents a low-cost and a miniaturized pulse oxymeter to continuously measure patient‟s blood-oxygen saturation level (SpO 2) and pulse rate. Change in intensity of light transmitted through tissue due to arterial blood pulse can be measured as a voltage signal called the photoplethysmographm (PPG). Oxygenated blood has different light absorption characteristics than deoxygenated blood under <b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> wavelengths. So the hardware implementation is included placing of two LEDs (<b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red)</b> on the patient‟s finger and a photo detector on opposite side of the LEDs to get the corresponding PPG signals which are used to estimate the SpO 2 by comparing the absorption characteristics of the two different colored light (<b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red).</b> As the PPG signal is mostly corrupted by patient‟s hand movement, it is given to LabView window by DAQ card for further signal processing. In this paper a low pass filter is used for removing motion artifacts and a moving average algorithm is applied to remove high frequency noise content. The SpO 2 is calculated by computing the AC and DC components of both the <b>red</b> and <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> LEDs corresponding PPG signals.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the theoretical and esqjerimental aspects of low temperature <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> spectroscopic studies of ionic solvation. Isotopically dilute methanolic and aqueous solutions were investigated in the fundamental <b>infra</b> <b>red</b> region, particularly in the 0 -H stretching region of the spectrum. Systematic room temperature investigations were undertaken for aqueous and methanolic electrolyte solutions as a fimction of the salt concentrations. These results provided certain trends regarding solvent- solute interactions which the low temperature experiments on the same solutions confirmed so that cation and anion solvation models could be put forward. ParticiiLar attention was given to the study of methanolic and aqueous polyatomic ion solutions to provide further evidence as to whether these anions cause the formation of free or weakly bonded 0 -H groups. <b>Infra</b> <b>red</b> studies of the tetrahydroborate anion in various pure solvents and binary mixtures suggested an interaction between BH.;and water protons which had spectroscopic characteristics of hydrogenbonding.
