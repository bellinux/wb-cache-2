40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1991 An {{argument}} has been developed, {{based on the}} scientific literature, to demonstrate a need for <b>eye</b> health <b>care</b> in specific community groups. Those targetted in this thesis are those with physical or intellectual disability, the ageing population, and those suffering head injury. The reason that these groups have been isolated {{is because they are}} known to have a high incidence of vision and ocular problems. It is proposed that the appropriate group of eye health professionals to fulfil the role would be orthoptists. The argument is developed in a binary fashion, that is, through the history and development of <b>eye</b> health <b>care,</b> and specifically orthoptics in Australia, and linking this argument to the development of <b>eye</b> health <b>care</b> services. This demonstrates the sometimes inappropriate health care systems that result from the absence of policy and professional rivalry. The background to <b>eye</b> health <b>care</b> services leads into an argument of need for a policy and further examines the scientific literature in support of the perceived need. A possible policy direction is proposed and rationalised. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|R

25|$|Among {{countries}} with significant public funding of healthcare {{there are many}} different approaches to the funding and provision of medical services. Systems may be funded from general government revenues (as in Canada) or through a government social security system (as in Australia, France, Belgium, Japan and Germany) with a separate budget and hypothecated taxes or contributions. The proportion of the cost of care covered also differs: in Canada, all hospital care is paid for by the government, while in Japan, patients must pay 10 to 30% of the cost of a hospital stay. Services provided by public systems vary. For example, the Belgian government pays the bulk of the fees for dental and <b>eye</b> <b>care,</b> while the Australian government covers <b>eye</b> <b>care</b> but not dental care.|$|E

25|$|However, U.S. {{government}} spending covers {{less than half}} of all healthcare costs. Private spending is also far greater in the U.S. than in Canada. In Canada, an average of $917 was spent annually by individuals or private insurance companies for health care, including dental, <b>eye</b> <b>care,</b> and drugs. In the U.S., this sum is $3,372. In 2006, healthcare consumed 15.3% of U.S. annual GDP. In Canada, only 10% of GDP was spent on healthcare. This difference is a relatively recent development. In 1971 the nations were much closer, with Canada spending 7.1% of GDP while the U.S. spent 7.6%.|$|E
