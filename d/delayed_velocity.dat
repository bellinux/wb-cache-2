The control system uses velocity feedback to obtain an effective cantilever Q factor to achieve optimal scan speed and image resolution for the imaging environment and sample type. Time delay of the cantilever displacement signal is the most common method of cantilever velocity estimation. Spill-over effects from unmodeled dynamics may degrade the closed loop system performance, possibly resulting in system instability, when time <b>delay</b> <b>velocity</b> estimation is used.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} detecting and tracking a target at very low SNR via track-before-detect. Since in this framework targets are undetectable on one single time step, coherent integration must be performed over time to gather sufficient energy and obtain good detection performance. As this integration must be done along a given target trajectory, we propose to apply a particle filter to perform the estimation over time. This particle filter samples the target <b>delay,</b> <b>velocity</b> and amplitude to perform a coherent processing. Two detection tests based on the particles are then proposed to solve the detection problem. Finally we propose also a new particle filter inspired by a GLRT strategy that {{does not need to}} sample the amplitude.

40|$|The primary {{resonance}} of van der Pol oscillator under fractional-order delayed negative feedback and forced excitation is studied. Firstly, the approximate analytical solution is obtained {{based on the}} averaging method, {{and it could be}} found that the fractional-order delayed feedback has not only the property of <b>delayed</b> <b>velocity</b> feedback but also that of delayed displacement feedback. Moreover, the amplitude-frequency equation for the steady-state solution is established, and its stability conditions are also obtained. Then, the results of the approximate analytical solution and numerical integration are compared and analyzed. The agreement between the two methods is very high, so that the correctness and accuracy of the approximate analytical solution are verified. Finally, the effects of all the parameters in the fractional-order delayed feedback on the amplitude-frequency curves are analyzed. It could be concluded that fractional-order delayed feedback has important influences on the dynamical behavior of van der Pol oscillator, which is very significant to the optimization and control of a similar system...|$|E

Our proposed method consists of a delayed observer coupled with a dynamic predictor. The delayed observer uses delayed measurements and provides estimates of <b>delayed</b> attitude and <b>velocity</b> states that are in turn used in the predictor to generate estimates of the current attitude and velocity. A key contribution of the paper is effective use of the underlying symmetries of the system in order to design a generic predictor that can be coupled to different observers.

40|$|GPS/INS {{navigation}} system {{is necessary for}} realizing the accurate and autonomous control of the rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicles (RUAVs).

40|$|Abstract—We derive Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) {{expressions}} for {{the range}} (time <b>delay),</b> <b>velocity</b> (Doppler shift), {{and direction of}} a point target using an active radar or sonar array. First, general CRB expressions are derived for a narrowband signal and array model and a space-time separable noise model that allows both spa-tial and temporal correlation. We discuss {{the relationship between the}} CRB and ambiguity function for this model. Then, we spe-cialize our CRB results to the case of temporally white noise and the practically important signal shape of a linear frequency modulated (chirp) pulse sequence. We compute the CRB for a three-dimen-sional (3 -D) array with isotropic sensors in spatially white noise and show that it {{is a function of the}} array geometry only through the “moments of inertia ” of the array. The volume of the confi-dence region for the target’s location is proposed as a measure of accuracy. For this measure, we show that the highest (and lowest) target location accuracy is achieved if the target lies along one of the principal axes of inertia of the array. Finally, we compare the location accuracies of several array geometries. Index Terms—Cramér–Rao bound, radar array processing, sonar array processing...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{perform a}} {{stability}} {{analysis of a}} pair of van der Pol oscillators with delayed self-connection, position and velocity couplings. Bifurcation diagram of the damping, position and velocity coupling strengths is constructed, which gives insight into how stability boundary curves come into existence and how these curves evolve from small closed loops into open-ended curves. The van der Pol oscillator has been considered by many researchers as the nodes for various networks. It is inherently unstable at the zero equilibrium. Stability control of a network is always an important problem. Currently, the stabilization of the zero equilibrium {{of a pair of}} van der Pol oscillators can be achieved only for small damping strength by using <b>delayed</b> <b>velocity</b> coupling. An interesting question arises naturally: can the zero equilibrium be stabilized for an arbitrarily large value of the damping strength? We prove that it can be. In addition, a simple condition is given on how to choose the feedback parameters to achieve such goal. We further investigate how the in-phase mode or the out-of-phase mode of a periodic solution is related to the stability boundary curve that it emerges from a Hopf bifurcation. Analytical expression of a periodic solution is derived using an integration method. Some illustrative examples show that the theoretical prediction and numerical simulation are in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} bifurcations due to time {{delay in the}} {{feedback}} control system with excitation. Based on an self-sustained oscillator, the <b>delayed</b> <b>velocity</b> feedback control system is proposed. For the case without excitation, {{the stability of the}} trivial equilibrium is discussed and the condition under which the equilibrium loses its stability is obtained. This leads to a critical stability boundary where Hopf bifurcation or periodic solutions may occur. For the case with excitation, the main attention is focused on the effect of time delay on the obtained periodic solution when primary resonance occurs in the system under consideration. To this end, the control system is changed to be a functional differential equation. Functional analysis is carried out to obtain the center manifold and then a perturbation approach is used to find periodic solutions in a closed form. Moreover, the unstable regions for the limit cycles are also obtained, predicting the occurrence of some complex behaviors. Numerical simulations are employed to find the routes leading to quasi-periodic motions as the time delay is varied. It has been found that: (i) Time delay can be used to control bifurcations; and (ii) time delay can be applied to generate bifurcations. This indicates that time delay may be used as a “switch ” to control or create complexity for different applications...|$|E

40|$|Background: Our {{knowledge}} about the neural code in the auditory nerve is based {{to a large extent}} on experiments on cats. Several anatomical differences between auditory neurons in human and cat are expected to lead to functional differences in speed and safety of spike conduction. Methodology/Principal Findings: Confocal microscopy was used to systematically evaluate peripheral and central process diameters, commonness of myelination and morphology of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) along the cochlea of three human and three cats. Based on these morphometric data, model analysis reveales that spike conduction in SGNs is characterized by four phases: a postsynaptic <b>delay,</b> constant <b>velocity</b> in the peripheral process, a presomatic <b>delay</b> and constant <b>velocity</b> in the central process. The majority of SGNs are type I, connecting the inner hair cells with the brainstem. In contrast to those of humans, type I neurons of the cat are entirely myelinated. Biophysical model evaluation showed delayed and weak spikes in the human soma region as a consequence of a lack of myelin. The simulated spike conduction times are in accordance with normal interwave latencies from auditory brainstem response recordings from man and cat. Simulated 400 pA postsynaptic currents from inner hair cell ribbon synapses were 15 times above threshold. They enforced quick and synchronous spiking. Both of these properties were not present in type II cells as they receive fewer and much weaker (, 26 pA) synaptic stimuli...|$|R
50|$|The book reconstructs {{theoretical}} frameworks originally used {{in building}} up {{the concept of a}} field. It shows that the field of Faraday's electricity and the field of Einstein's relativity are distinct; although both make different assumptions about physical reality, Berkson suggests that the assumptions of either conception of the field still remain as plausible today as when first conceived. These separate field theories share at least one significant and testable difference in comparison with Newtonian physics: whereas Newton's action-at-a-distance occurs instantaneously, the field theories predict a propagation delay. Berkson explains that Faraday's prediction of a physically measurable propagation <b>delay</b> (finite <b>velocity)</b> from his own conception of a physical field permeating space is one important difference separating this idea from that of Newton's (infinite velocity).|$|R
40|$|Abstract We exploit 55 repeating {{microearthquake}} sequences on the San Andreas Fault, {{just south}} of the rupture zone of the 1989 MW 6. 9 Loma Prieta Earthquake, to search for time-dependent properties of the Earth’s crust. Using moving window waveform cross correlation, we identify clear and systematic delays as large as 20 msec for the direct S wave and exceeding 50 msec in the early S-wave coda following the Loma Prieta mainshock. Others have also identified phase <b>delays</b> (<b>velocity</b> re-ductions) associated with damaging earthquakes and they have suggested a myriad of possible causal mechanisms. Here, we present new evidence for a mechanism to produce velocity reductions correlated in time and space with an earthquake. A strong correlation between the spatial patterns of S delays and the intensity of strong ground motion in the Loma Prieta Earthquake suggests that physical damage, the formation or growth of cracks during strong ground motion, to the Earth’s shallow crust is responsible for the observed velocity reductions. The strong spatial variability in S delays over short distances and the strong correlation of the magnitude of delays with surface geology indicate that the phase delays accumulate primarily near the receiver. The effect is stronger at stations on young, soft rocks than at stations on old, hard rock. Disproportionately larger S coda delays than P coda delays suggest that the cracks formed by the strong shaking are fluid filled. In the 10 years after Loma Prieta, the initial increase in travel times reduces logarithmically with respect to time, often back to the premainshock levels. We attribute this behavior to the same “slow dynamic ” healing observed in laboratory studies of the recovery of materials from transient nonlinear strain...|$|R
