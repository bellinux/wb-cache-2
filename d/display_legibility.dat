40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of displays legibility within an aircraft cockpit in presence of typical external lighting condition occurring during flights: these range from clear sky with sun in different critical positions, to cloudy and nightlight sky. Existing procedures to assess the <b>display</b> <b>legibility</b> proposed in literature were analyzed and an operative methodology, based on both objective measurements and subjective evaluations, was proposed. The application of the methodology {{is intended to be}} supported by the use of the Sky Light Simulator (SLS), an innovative ambient lighting facility capable to reproduce the sun and the sky dome, hence generating lighting environments closely matching the real ambient lighting conditions, and to host real aircrafts. The paper presents the state-of-the-art relative to existing standardized procedure for assessing <b>display</b> <b>legibility,</b> the operative procedure which is proposed, based on the use of an Imaging Luminance Measurement Device (ILMD), and the results of a first series of the on-going experimental field measurement...|$|E

In a separate user study we measure the range of display brightness settings that provide good legibility and are not distracting under low ambient lighting. Our results can serve as a guidelines for designing the displays that change their color scheme at low ambient light levels...|$|E

40|$|Various {{studies of}} visual display {{terminal}} (VDT) work have shown the need of investigating causal relationshipsb etween characteristicosf VDT work and health effects. in this study, the possible causal factors for modeling the above relationships were examined based on the data from a questionnaire survey at a travel agency. The questionnaire included various items related to VDT job type (e. g., travel reservation, data entry, word processing), VDT work time, <b>display</b> <b>legibility,</b> workstation dimensions, work environment, usability of VDT, job characteristics (e. g., monotony, cooperation, autonomy), eye fatigue and musculoskeletal symptoms. Principal component factor analysis was performed to construct indices of eye fatigue and musculoskeletal symptoms as health effects and other indicesf or VDT work conditions. Two distinct factors recognized for eye fatigue symptoms were “impaired accommodaion” and “eye pain” and two factors for musculoskeletal symptoms were “neckshoulder areas” and “finger-arm areas”. Data analysis for 656 VDT workers showed that the VDT work time of travel reservation and professional (computer programming) workers was longer than that of data entry and word processing workers. Professional workers reported intensively the impaired accommodation symptoms, and data entry workers frequently reported the finger-arm symptoms. Multiple regression analysis based on the four different indices of health effects as dependent variables was performed for male workers of two VDT job types. This analysis gave a better picture {{of the relationships between}} various conditions of VDT work and the health effects. It was shown that the different VDT job types had different significant contributors to each indicator of health effects. For example, the limitation of computer hardware such as response delay was one of the significantc ontributors to the impaired accommodation, and the eye pain and the neck-shoulder symptoms for travel reservation workers. These findings suggested {{that it was important to}} separate VDT job types in identifying a causal structure modeling of health effects by VDT work...|$|E

40|$|Legibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} salient factors of the {{ergonomic}} design of computer-controlled <b>displays.</b> For good <b>legibility,</b> luminance contrast must be high. But visual performance can be further improved by adding colour contrast: it can be used for emphasis. To do emphasis correctly, i. e. not to over-colour the VDU screen, results from equiluminance legibility (ELL) experiments might be applied. The results of such ELL experiments have been compared with the Ware and Cowan Conversion Factor (WCCF) formula. Keywords: brightness, luminance, colour contrast, visual ergonomics 1. INTRODUCTION It is well known for the designer of colour displays that high luminance contrast must be ensured for good legibility. The minimum luminance contrast ratio (CR) value required by the standard is three[1]. But the quality of visual display units (VDUs) depends not only on luminance contrast but also on chromaticity contrast or colour contrast, and on many other variables[2, 3]. In this work, colo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} programme {{described in this}} thesis examines the theoretical and practical aspects of visual degradation caused by vibration. Initially, the published literature was reviewed in two areas: the effects of vibration on visual performance {{and the influence of}} display parameters on legibility under normal and vibration-degraded viewing conditions. A series of eight experiments were then conducted to assess visual performance and <b>display</b> <b>legibility</b> with reading and threshold detection tasks presented on cathode ray tube displays. The first experiment compared the visual degradation caused by sinusoidal and narrow-band random vibration in the frequency range 2. 5 to 31. 5 Hz. Random vibration produced a significantly smaller reading performance decrement than sinusoidal vibration. This finding was attributed to the greater probability of low image velocity with the random vibration stimuli and, in a follow-up experiment, velocity-based predictions accounted for the visual performance decrements due to laboratory-simulated aircraft vibration. A comparison of the effects of whole-body, display and simultaneous whole-body and display vibration showed that at frequencies below 4 Hz, vibration of the display resulted in the largest performance decrement and simultaneous vibration of observer and display, the least. In a second series of experiments, display parameters (horizontal and vertical character separation, contrast, font and symbol definition) were manipulated during static and vibration-degraded viewing conditions. Vertical separation was found to be a more significant variable than horizontal separation and tentative guidelines for character separation were stated. The relationship between contrast and legibility was shown to be quadratic during static and vibration-degraded viewing conditions. Optimum legibility occurred in the contrast range 60 to 88 %. The determination of font and symbol definition requirements showed that for characters of equal subtense, 7 x 9 dot-matrix characters were significantly more legible than 5 x 7 characters during whole-body vibration. Differences between two frequently recommended fonts, the Huddleston and Lincoln Mitre, were not apparent at 7 x 9 definition although at 5 x 7 definition the Huddleston font was responsible for significantly fewer reading errors. In the final experiment, the spatial filtering characteristics of vibration were examined. In addition to an alphanumeric reading task, contrast thresholds for sinusoidally modulated grating patterns were determined during whole-body vibration. It was shown that the effects of vibration could be conceived as low-pass spatial filtering and the implications of this finding for simulating the effects of vibration were discussed. The overall findings of the experimental programme have been summarised and areas for future research discussed...|$|E
40|$|Helicopter {{operations}} in degraded visual environment (DVE), especially brownout/whiteout landings often result in severe {{incidents and accidents}} in the civil and military field. In fact, landing in desert environment {{is the most dangerous}} aspect of flying in combat helicopters according to the USAF. The integration of a helmet-mounted display (HMD) can help the pilot to maintain situation awareness, avoid spatial disorientation and reduce workload. Nevertheless, if not integrated properly, drawbacks (e. g. clutter, field-of-view, <b>display</b> latency, symbology <b>legibility</b> etc.) may lead to perceptual problems, attentional tunneling and wearing discomfort. In a simulator study, DLR compared three different brownout symbology sets and three display formats (HMD monocular, HMD binocular, head-down) during a DVE approach and a whiteout landing. Flight performance, situation awareness and pilot workload and were assessed. Furthermore, a detailed debriefing covered visual, perceptual and somatic aspects of helmet-mounted display use and an evaluation of the symbology sets. The paper will first discuss general human factors aspects associated with helmet-mounted displays in helicopter operations, provide an overview on symbology design considerations and finally present selected results of the conducted study...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal {{displays}} {{are emerging}} as a standard platform for engaging participants in collaborative tasks. Little is known about how groups of people view visualizations in these collaborative settings. Several techniques have been pro-posed to assist, such as duplicating or reorienting the visual displays. However, when visualizations compete for pixels on the display, prior solutions do not work effectively. We first ran an experiment to identify whether orientation on horizontal <b>displays</b> impacts the <b>legibility</b> of simple visuali-zations such as charts. The results reveal that users are best at reading a chart when {{it is the right}} side up, taking them 20 % less time to read than when it is upside down. This insight led us to develop the Orientation Agnostic Graph (OA-Graph), making use of a radial layout designed to be legible regardless of orientation. In a second experiment we found that users can read OA-Graphs better than when the graphs are upside down but less well than traditional graphs in the right side up. The design of our novel visualization, informed by radial visualization methods will assist design-ers in developing charts that are not easily affected by user orientation, an issue that is prevalent in collaborative table-top systems. Certain tasks such as observing relative differ-ences can benefit from OA-Graphs. ACM Classification: H 5. 2 [Information interfaces an...|$|R
40|$|Much of what {{is known}} about how humans process {{displays}} of multiple familiar items comes from visual search tasks. However, the appropriateness of such tasks to illuminate processes underlying identification has been called into question by numerous investigators (e. g. Rabbit 1978; Eriksen and Collins, 1969; Townsend and Ashby, 1984). The experiments reported here use a much less studied speeded whole-report task to investigate the structure of processes involved in identification. Unlike search tasks an important aspect of this procedure is that it requires the identification of all display elements. In experiment 1 both the number of items in the <b>display</b> and their <b>legibilities</b> were manipulated. Combining these two experimental variations provides a powerful tool for distinguishing serial from certain limited-capacity parallel processes. Two distinct reaction-time effects were found as a function of legibility, which indicates that identification depends on at least two distinct mechanisms. A pattern mask superimposed on each item influenced a parallel component of the encoding process (call it α). Disorientation of each item influenced a serial component (call it β). In experiment 2 both manipulations were applied to the same item. Consistent with the hypothesis that α and β operate sequentially within an item, additivity of the mask and disorientation effects on mean RT was found. However, the observed additivity was not invariant over changes in digit identity, weakening the conclusions. In experiment 3 the two legibility manipulations were applied independently to different digits in the same display. The results suggest that although the β processes for different items cannot overlap, the β process for one item can start before the α processes for other items have finished. Methodological and theoretical consequences of this overlap property are considered. ...|$|R
