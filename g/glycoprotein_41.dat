Gp 41 has an unusual cytoplasmic tail, the endodomain, containing highly helicoidal segments with large hydrophobic moments, the so called lentivirus lytic peptides or LLPs. According to our previous work, {{one of the most}} membranotropic regions along the whole gp <b>41</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> was located in the LLP 3 region of the gp 41.

Our results demonstrate that this peptide interacts with phospholipid-containing model membranes, affects the phase-behavior of membrane phospholipids and induces leakage and aggregation of liposomes.

Because the epitope recognized by CL 3 has two cysteine residues that could potentially produce a disulfide loop in gp 41, we analyzed binding of our monoclonal antibody to the cyclic and linear motif of the peptide sequence IWGCSGKLICTTAVP (residues 600 – 614).

40|$|Virus-cell fusion is {{the primary}} {{means by which the}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus- 1 (HIV) delivers its genetic material into the human T-cell host. Fusion is mediated in large part by the viral <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>41</b> (gp 41) which advances through four distinct conformational states: (i) native, (ii) pre-hairpin intermediate, (iii) fusion active (fusogenic), and (iv) post-fusion.

Earlier site-directed mutagenesis has shown that key amino acid changes in this gp 41 domain inhibit viral infection and syncytia formation. Here, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N terminus of gp 41 (FP; 23 residues, 519 – 541), and also FP analogs (FP 520 V/E with Val→Glu at residue 520; FP 527 L/R with Leu→Arg at 527; FP 529 F/Y with Phe→Tyr at 529; and FPCLP 1 with FP truncated at 525) incorporating these modifications were prepared. When added to human erythrocytes at physiologic pH, the lytic and aggregating activities of the FP analogs were much reduced over those with the wild-type FP. With resealed human erythrocyte ghosts, the lipid-mixing activities of the FP analogs were also substantially depressed over that with the wild-type FP. Combined with results from earlier studies, theoretical calculations using hydrophobic moment plot analysis and physical experiments using circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that the diminished lysis and fusion noted for FP analogs {{may be due to}} altered peptide-membrane lipid interactions.

40|$|AbstractElectron {{microscopy}} structural determinations {{suggest that}} the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>41</b> (gp 41) may associate with the HIV- 1 membrane interface. It is further proposed that MPER-induced disruption and/or deformation of the lipid bilayer ensue during viral fusion. However, it is predicted that the cholesterol content of this membrane (∼ 45  mol %) will act against MPER binding and restructuring activity, in agreement with alternative structural models proposing that the MPER constitutes a gp 41 ectodomain component that does not insert into the viral membrane. Here, using MPER-based peptides, we test the hypothesis that cholesterol impedes the membrane association and destabilizing activities of this gp 41 domain. To that end, partitioning and leakage assays carried out in lipid vesicles were combined with x-ray reflectivity and grazing-incidence diffraction studies of monolayers. CpreTM, a peptide combining the carboxyterminal MPER sequence with aminoterminal residues of the transmembrane domain, bound and destabilized effectively cholesterol-enriched membranes. Accordingly, virion incubation with this peptide inhibited cell infection potently but nonspecifically. Thus, CpreTM seems to mimic the envelope-perturbing function of the MPER domain and displays antiviral activity. As such, we infer that CpreTM bound to cholesterol-enriched membranes would represent a relevant target for anti-HIV- 1 immunogen and inhibitor development...|$|E

We found that the cytoplasmic domain of TMgp 41 binds to TIP 47, a protein required for the transport of mannose- 6 -phosphate receptors from endosomes to the TGN. Overexpression of a mutant of TIP 47 affected the transport of Env from endosomes to the TGN. Retrograde transport of Env to the TGN requires a Y 802 W 803 diaromatic motif present in the TMgp 41 cytoplasmic domain.

Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown an important role for the N-terminal gp 41 domain in HIV-fusion, in which replacement of hydrophobic amino acids with polar residues inhibits viral infection and syncytia formation. Here, a synthetic peptide (FP; 23 amino acid residues 519 – 541) corresponding to the N-terminus of HIV- 1 gp 41, and also a FP analog (FP 526 L/R) with Arg replacing Leu- 526, were prepared with solid phase techniques. The lipid mixing and leakage of resealed ghosts triggered by these peptides were examined with fluorescence quenching techniques. Peptide-induced aggregation of human erythrocytes was studied using Coulter counter sizing and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using resealed erythrocyte ghosts at physiologic pH, FP induces rapid lipid mixing between red cell membranes at doses previously shown to hemolyze intact cells. FP also causes leakage from resealed ghosts, and promotes the formation of multicelled aggregates with whole erythrocytes. Contrarily, similar FP 526 L/R concentrations did not induce red cell lysis, lipid mixing, leakage or aggregation.

However, direct evidence for an interaction between gp 41 and Pr 55 Gag in HIV- 1 particles has not been reported. To determine whether gp 41 is associated with Pr 55 Gag in HIV- 1 particles, viral cores were isolated from immature HIV- 1 virions by sedimentation through detergent. The cores contained a major fraction of the gp 41 that was present on untreated virions. Association of gp 41 with cores required the presence of the gp 41 cytoplasmic tail. In HIV- 1 particles containing a functional protease, a mutation that prevents cleavage of Pr 55 Gag at the matrix-capsid junction was sufficient for the detergent-resistant association of gp 41 with the isolated cores. In addition to gp 41, a major fraction of virion-associated gp 120 was also detected on immature HIV- 1 cores. Isolation of cores under conditions known to disrupt lipid rafts resulted in the removal of a raft-associated protein incorporated into virions but not the HIV- 1 envelope proteins. These results provide biochemical evidence for a stable interaction between Pr 55 Gag and the cytoplasmic tail of gp 41 in immature HIV- 1 particles.

Pentafuside and AMD 3100 have now proceeded to phase II clinical trials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the fight}} against the human HIV, new targets are being explored, such as the {{proteins}} involved in the process of fusion of the virus with the host cell. Recently, the first generation of fusion inhibitors (enfuvirtide), targeting gp 41 (virus envelope <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>41),</b> has become commercially available. However, this promising class of drugs has to be improved in respect of their efficacy and bioavailability. Considering the strong homologies between HIV and FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus), as well as the highly conserved structure of the transmembrane envelope protein among species, FIV represents a relevant model of pre-screening studies for HIV. Taking into account (i) sequence homologies between the ectodomain of HIV gp 41 and FIV gp 36 (envelope glycoprotein 36), (ii) structural data available for gp 41 and (iii) the fact that synthetic peptides derived from gp 36 are effective inhibitors of FIV infection, we designed several peptides derived from gp 36 sequence. We checked that these peptides had the same structural features as the corresponding peptides from gp 41 HIV by CD, analytical ultracentrifugation and 1 H– 2 H (hydrogen–deuterium) exchange combined with MS. By combining this latter technique with surface-plasmon-resonance assays, we identified the amino acid residues of the C-terminal region of the ectodomain of gp 36 that are critical for interaction with the N-terminal region. This gave clues for therapy and vaccines against FIV, thus providing helpful data for treatments against HIV...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the 665 - 683 {{fragment}} of the HIV fusion <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>41,</b> corresponding to the MPER domain of the protein and named gp 41 MPER, on the microscopic structure and mesoscopic arrangement of palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and POPC/sphingomyelin (SM) /cholesterol (CHOL) lipid bilayers is analyzed. The microscopic structuring of the bilayers has been studied by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, using glycerophosphocholines spin-labelled in different positions along the acyl chain. Transitions of the bilayer liquid crystalline state have been also monitored by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Changes of the bilayers morphology have been studied by determining the dimension of the liposomes through Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurements. The results converge in showing that the sample preparation procedure, the bilayer composition and the peptide/lipid ratio critically tune the lipid response to the peptide/membrane interaction. When gp 41 MPER is added to preformed liposomes, it positions at the bilayer interface and the lipid perturbation {{is limited to the}} more external segments. In contrast, if the peptide is mixed with the lipids during the liposome preparation, it assumes a trans-membrane topology. This happens at all peptide/lipid ratios for fluid POPC bilayers, while in the case of rigid POPC/SM/CHOL membranes a minimum ratio has to be reached, thus suggesting peptide self-aggregation to occur. Peptide insertion results in a dramatic increase of the lipid ordering and bilayer stiffening, which reflect in significant changes in liposome average dimension and distribution. The biological implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>glycoprotein</b> gp <b>41</b> {{from the}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV- 1) has an amino acid {{sequence}} enriched in tryptophan residues, the so-called gp 41 W peptide (i. e., KWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK) and {{plays a crucial role}} in HIV- 1 host cell infection. Using the coupling of Second Harmonic Generation targeting the tryptophan residues with lateral surface tension measurements, we investigate the interaction of gp 41 W with a neat air/water and a lipid/water interfaces. At the air/water interface, gp 41 W presents a well-defined orientation and this orientation is strongly modified at the lipid/water interface, depending on the surface pressure. These results show that this strategy is well suited to monitor tryptophan containing α-helices orientation at lipid/water interfaces. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} of membrane-active {{regions of the}} ectodomain of the HIV- 1 envelope <b>glycoprotein</b> gp <b>41</b> has been made by determining the effect on membrane integrity of a 15 -mer gp 41 -derived peptide library. By monitoring {{the effect of this}} peptide library on membrane leakage, we have identified three regions on the gp 41 ectodomain with membrane-interacting capabilities: Region 1, which would roughly correspond to the polar sequence which follows the fusion domain and extends to the N-terminal heptad repeat region; Region 2, which would correspond to the immunodominant loop; and Region 3, which would correspond to the pre-transmembrane region of gp 41. The {{identification of}} these three regions supports their direct role in membrane fusion as well as facilitating the future development of HIV- 1 entry inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{association}} of giant platelets {{and an increase in}} platelet volume in a 19 -month-old black female with de novo del 11 q 24 -qter. The deletion, which was visible on karyotype, was further confirmed and more precisely localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization studies (FISH) that showed the deletion to lie distal to the MLL gene region (11 q 23). Clinically, the case presented less severe symptoms than Jacobsen syndrome-the well known partial deletion of the distal end of chromosome 11. Platelet <b>glycoproteins</b> CD <b>41,</b> CD 42 a, C 42 b, CD 61, and PAC- 1 were also assayed and found to be normally expressed. To our knowledge, giant platelets are described {{for the first time in}} the relevant deleted region. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
