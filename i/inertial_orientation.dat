40|$|The need to {{characterize}} normal and pathological human movement has consistently driven researchers {{to develop new}} tracking devices and to improve movement analysis systems. Movement has traditionally been captured by either optical, magnetic, mechanical, structured light, or acoustic systems. All of these systems have inherent limitations. Optical systems are costly, require fixed cameras in a controlled environment, and suffer from problems of occlusion. Similarly, acoustic and structured light systems suffer from the occlusion problem. Magnetic and radio frequency systems suffer from electromagnetic disturbances, noise and multipath problems. Mechanical systems have physical constraints that limit the natural body movement. Recently, the availability of low-cost wearable inertial sensors containing accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers has provided an alternative means to overcome the limitations of other motion capture systems. Inertial sensors {{can be used to}} track human movement in and outside of a laboratory, cannot be occluded, and are low cost. To calculate changes in orientation, researchers often integrate the angular velocity. However, a relatively small error or drift in the measured angular velocity leads to large integration errors. This restricts the time of accurate measurement and tracking to a few seconds. To compensate that drift, complementary data from accelerometers and magnetometers are normally integrated in tracking systems that utilize the Kalman filter (KF) or the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to fuse the nonlinear <b>inertial</b> data. <b>Orientation</b> estimates are only accurate for brief moments when the body is not moving and acceleration is only due to gravity. Moreover, success of using magnetometers to compensate drift about the vertical axis is limited by magnetic field disturbance. We combine kinematic models designed for control of robotic arms with state space methods to estimate angles of the human shoulder and elbow using two wireless wearable inertial measurement units. The same method can be used to track movement of other joints using a minimal sensor configuration with one sensor on each segment. Each limb is modeled as one kinematic chain. Velocity and acceleration are recursively tracked and propagated from one limb segment to another using Newton-Euler equations implemented in state space form. To mitigate the effect of sensor drift on the tracking accuracy, our system incorporates natural physical constraints on the range of motion for each joint, models gyroscope and accelerometer random drift, and uses zero-velocity updates. The combined effect of imposing physical constraints on state estimates and modeling the sensor random drift results in superior joint angles estimates. The tracker utilizes the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which is an improvement to the EKF. This removes the need for linearization of the system equations which introduces tracking errors. We validate the performance of the inertial tracking system over long durations of slow, normal, and fast movements. Joint angles obtained from our inertial tracker are compared to those obtained from an optical tracking system and a high-precision industrial robot arm. Results show an excellent agreement between joint angles estimated by the inertial tracker and those obtained from the two reference systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of {{mineral raw materials}} is an essential factor for sustainable modern societies. Therefore the access to natural resources is strategically essential for the European economy. Sustainable, ecological and efficient mining methods are consequently indispensable for the raw material industry, although demanding challenges arise therefrom. In this present thesis the four latest large research projects concerning automation in future mining have been presented (Rio Tinto – Mine of the future, Smart Mine of the future, Sandvik’s AutoMine System and the I²Mine Project). The aim of the corresponding automation attempts is the autonomous mine. In this vision the condition of completely autonomously acting mining machines is described. Herein machines utilize miscellaneous sensor techniques as for instance distance detection, material recognition and position detection. Consequently mining operations can be conducted without manual control which results in decreased manpower requirement and therefore increased safety. In order to achieve an autonomous mining process without human support underground, {{it is necessary to}} accurately and contactless detect and track the spatial position of the mining machine. The major problem hereby arises from the fact that underground environments belong to the „GPS denied environments“. Accordingly alternative techniques need to be utilized in order to retain the required positioning and orientation information. The present thesis presents the potential of inertial navigation systems applied underground in the raw material industry in order to achieve accurate position and location detection of mining machines. Inertial navigation systems based on orthogonally aligned accelerometers and rate-gyroscopes allow for the detection of objects in a special area, while being independent from signals from the surrounding environment. Inertial navigation systems are very flexible since they detect the acceleration and gyro-rate of a frame. Due to integration the velocity, position and spatial orientation can be determined. By reasons of inevitable sensor errors and drifts increasing positioning errors arise over the analyzed time sequences. These errors can only be corrected by applying support algorithms delivering additional distance and velocity information to the navigation system. For the position and orientation of underground mining machinery three different relative localization methods have been used in this work. These are, based on• incremental encoders information based odometry,• merged incremental encoders- and inertial measurements based odometry and• the point cloud based on odometry. The fusion of incremental encoders- and inertial measurement data has been implemented by an extended Kalman filter which estimates the position and orientation based on the odometry data entered. A fundamental aspect hereby is the sensor data fusion in which the Kalman filter, a tool for different sensor data fusion, plays an important role. As a result, a,,fusion-architecture" is developed which allows underground mobile mining equipment to perform their positioning, even under harsh conditions. For the fusion of the measurement data, which are delivered by the individual sensors, it was ensured that the respective time bases to which the readings relate, are synchronized with one another. For this reason, all sensors were connected through a network and equipped with special synchronization units, ensuring the synchronization of all different system times. As part of this thesis it was investigated how the cost/accuracy ratio can be optimized for an <b>inertial</b> position and <b>orientation</b> determination system by appropriate support algorithms. For this purpose, it was determined how large the real drift of the offset of the inertial measurement unit employed is using laboratory tests. Subsequently, the development and validation was conducted in situ in practical mining environments. Due to the high costs of equipment in the mining industry and the enormous proportions of underground mining equipment, a driverless demonstrator for the implementation and validation of the developed concept has been designed and implemented for position and orientation detection of underground mining equipment in the first step. This demonstrator is a mobile vehicle that is equipped with sensors for detecting surroundings and an inertial measurement unit for position and orientation detection. Initially, the system was validated with the unmanned demonstrator in a mining shaft. During the final validation on a real mining machine, a Bolter Miner, the applicability of the system for position and orientation detection for underground mining machinery was demonstrated. The trajectories were determined with the presented inertial measurement system in combination with the support algorithm to improve the accuracy requirements of the particular application in the mining industry. This was shown by the test measurements in the mining shaft and the Bolter Miner. In conclusion it can be stated that the investigated inertial measurement unit achieves the requirements arising from the harsh environments with extreme dust, moisture, vibration and temperature effects in principle. Until today, no reliable and economical navigation system for underground mining applications is known. However, the success of automation efforts depends to a large extent on this technology. Thus, the development of such a system is an important step towards a fully automated, unmanned mine. In addition to increased safety for the miners production costs are lowered due to a fully automated extraction. This results in reduced downtimes {{on the one hand and}} in generally increased velocities of the machines on the other hand. By combining a robust inertial measurement unit and innovative support algorithms for the mining industry a powerful system is available, which can be expanded by being linked with other sensors to a multi-sensor system. Thus, the automated position and orientation detection of underground mining machinery can be realized in a medium term...|$|R
