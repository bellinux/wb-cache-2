40|$|This paper {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} balance sheet classification of a compound <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> on the analyst’s judgment on estimates in target prices using an experimental settings. The experimental design involves both buy and sales-side analysts grouped into three subsamples with limited information set about the company used in the experiment and different information regarding the accounting for the compound <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> (IAS 32 model, SOA model and NEA model) after the following event: a private placement of a mandatorily convertible debenture to finance the acquisition of another company abroad. We apply nonparametric means and bootstrap test. Our result show that regardless of balance sheet classification of the compound <b>financial</b> <b>instrument,</b> analysts are likely to treat it conservatively as a liability. Moreover, if the compound <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> is wholly classified as a liability {{and the company is}} highly leveraged, they tend to discount firm’s share price...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} pattern of <b>Financial</b> <b>Instrument</b> Disclosures (FIDs) within the annual reports of Australian listed {{extractive}} resource companies (mining and petroleum) over a four year longitudinal period encompassing the 2003 to 2006 financial years. This is an important period to investigate FID patterns as it encompasses those {{years leading up to}} and immediately following formal adoption of the Australian equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Using an index (FIDI) comprising 120 items of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> information to measure the extent of FIDs, there is a statistically significant increase in disclosures over the four year period with the greatest percentage increase occurring on transition to IFRS. Under IFRS, direct comparability with firms internationally can be made. Although the <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure requirements are the same pre- and post- IFRS adoption, the introduction of a new form of regulation makes a difference to managements’ financial reporting disclosure incentives. Total <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures, as measured by FIDI, increased from 34 % in Yr 1 (year ending 31 December 2002 or year ending 30 June 2003) to 52 % in Yr 4 (year ending 31 December 2005 or 30 June 2006), the latter representing the first full year annual reporting period under IFRS. Similar trends are observed for mandatory <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures (comprising 57 items) and discretionary <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures (comprising 63 items). The results of the main model regression analysis demonstrate that the independent variables of corporate governance, capital management, overseas listing and income tax characteristics of firms are factors which are variably significantly associated with FID patterns for panel data. Statistically significant associations are achieved for pooled regression results. Control variables comprising firm size, leverage, top 20 shareholder concentration, sub-industry and return on assets are statistically significant predictor variables of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures. In contrast, overseas stock exchange listing of firms and additional income tax characteristics that are related to financial reporting transparency are found to be significantly negatively associated with FID patterns. Discrete items that comprise FIDI are individually statistically significantly associated with the independent and control variables. Similarly, discrete items that comprise the independent variable scores are individually statistically significant predictor variables of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures. This thesis contributes {{to an understanding of the}} extent, trends and rationale behind resource firms’ <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure practices in Australia. Further, this thesis examines the association of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures with corporate governance, capital management, overseas listing and income tax characteristics of firms leading up to and immediately following IFRS adoption in Australia...|$|R
