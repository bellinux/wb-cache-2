5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E

50|$|Days {{after the}} verdict, the U.S. Justice Department {{said it would}} seek <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> policemen for federal civil rights violations. On July 28, 1980, {{a federal grand jury}} indicted Charles Veverka, despite his having {{received}} immunity from the original charges filed by the state during the first trial.|$|R
40|$|As {{the professions}} {{experience}} increased sexual diversity, comparisons of workplace outcomes {{of men and}} women often result in <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professions and the society in which they operate. For example, most comparisons reveal that women do not attain the highest professional positions in proportion to their numbers and that they earn substantially less than men. In turn, these shortfalls are commonly attributed to discrimination, inadequate state support of child rearing, and other constraints imposed upon women from without...|$|R
2500|$|Historically, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most incriminating <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labor spy {{business}} {{may have}} been <b>the</b> testimony <b>of</b> Albert Balanow (some sources list the name as Ballin or Blanow) during an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detective agencies' roles during the Red Scare. Albert Balanow had worked with both the Burns Detective Agency and the Thiel Detective Agency. Balanow testified that the Red Scare was all about shaking down businessmen for protection money. [...] "If there is no conspiracy, you've {{got to make a}} conspiracy in order to hold your job." ...|$|R
25|$|Upon the <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Libyan {{suspects}} in November 1991, the Libyan government was {{called upon to}} extradite them for trial in either the United Kingdom or the United States. Since no bilateral extradition treaty was in force between {{any of the three}} countries, Libya refused to hand the men over but did offer to detain them for trial in Libya, as long as all the incriminating evidence was provided. The offer was unacceptable to the US and UK, and there was an impasse for the next three years.|$|E
25|$|Mark Lane (February 24, 1927 – May 10, 2016) was an American attorney, New York state legislator, {{civil rights}} activist, and Vietnam war-crimes investigator. He {{is best known}} as a leading researcher, author, and {{conspiracy}} theorist on the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. From his 1966 number-one bestselling critique of the Warren Commission, Rush to Judgment, to Last Word: My <b>Indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CIA in the Murder of JFK, published in 2011, Lane wrote at least four major works on the JFK assassination and no fewer than ten books overall.|$|E
25|$|Five {{different}} Lords Advocate were in post {{from the}} 1991 <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two accused Libyans until their trial in 2000 – three Conservative: Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, and two Labour: Lord Hardie and Lord Boyd of Duncansby. Lord Boyd led the prosecution {{on behalf of}} the Crown Office. Assisting him were Advocate Deputes Alastair Campbell QC and Alan Turnbull QC. Alongside the prosecution were seated U.S. Department of Justice representatives Brian Murtagh, who had helped draw up the indictment against the two accused, and Dana Biehl.|$|E
50|$|African Cry and My Faith as an African, Ela's {{two most}} famous works, {{serve as an}} <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church for holding to a model of faith that ignores <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> African people, {{especially}} those in poor and rural communities. Through an analysis of selected sacraments, missionary structures, and biblical hermeneutics, Ela identified {{ways in which the}} Catholic tradition subordinates Africans to a position of dependence vis-a-vis White Europeans. He countered these instances of oppression with opportunities for liberation based on the argument that the Gospel advocates for <b>the</b> restoration <b>of</b> dignity to marginalised people.|$|R
2500|$|Together, Gheorghiu-Dej and his {{minister}} {{produced the}} so-called [...] "Meges Case", a purge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romanian Roman Catholic community. Gheorghiu-Dej recommended his minister {{to come up}} with <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic leaders as agents of [...] "foreign, hostile, circles"; Drăghici's order to his police forces, written in ungrammatical Romanian, was to try the Catholics behind closed doors, and then publicize the verdict. The repression resulted in the torture and death of missionary Vladimir Ghika. Also then, Drăghici was involved in <b>the</b> persecution <b>of</b> anti-communist Romanian Jews, especially Zionists. He approved <b>the</b> arrest <b>of</b> barrister Vișinescu, an ethnic Romanian, probably as retribution for his defense of a Jewish woman.|$|R
50|$|Cossa's {{successful}} {{adaptation of}} La nona into film {{encouraged him to}} provide screenplays for his play El arreglo ("The Deal") and No habrá más penas ni olvido ("Dirty Little War") in 1983. Both became well-known Argentine films memorable for their bold <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> corruption and revenge in Argentine society. His theatre works became more prolific following democratic elections in 1983 and included Ya nadie recuerda a Frederic Chopin ("No One Remembers F.C."), a study in frustrating exile, De pies y manos ("On Hands and Feet"), a realist look into <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dictatorship on one family, and Los compadritos ("The Poseurs"), a controversial review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events surrounding <b>the</b> 1939 sinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Graf Spee.|$|R
25|$|Lane {{published}} an <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Warren Commission, entitled Rush to Judgment, using these interviews {{as well as}} evidence from the 26 volumes of the Commission's report. Despite {{the fact that the}} majority of Mark Lane's material for his book came from the Warren Report itself, as well as from interviews with those who were at the scene, sixteen publishers canceled contracts before Rush to Judgment was published. The book became a number one best seller and spent 29 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. The book criticizes in detail the work and conclusions of the Warren Commission and {{remains one of the most}} remarkable books about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It was adapted into a documentary film in 1966.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2009, Jon Schillaci {{was sentenced}} to 20 to 50 years in state prison after {{pleading}} guilty to one count of aggravated felonious sexual assault and 23 counts of possession of child pornography. According to prosecutors, they agreed to make a plea agreement because Schillaci's victim (now aged 15) was unwilling to testify and wanted to maintain his anonymity. After Schillaci was apprehended, his computer, which had reams of child pornography on its hard drive, led the FBI into an expansive probe of seeking child victims in the United States. As {{a part of his}} plea bargain, Schillaci cooperated with federal authorities by offering to give a name of one person. The information has led to federal <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person in question and rescue of one sexually abused child.|$|E
25|$|Under the rules, {{investors who}} do not sue Madoff or other parties will be allowed a theft-loss {{deduction}} for the 2008 tax year, equal to 95 percent of their total investment, including all fictitious earnings credited to their accounts on which they were taxed, but less any withdrawals, or actual or potential recoveries from SIPC or their own insurance. Victims who decide to sue Madoff or third parties, believing they might have the possibility of some recovery, may still deduct 75 percent of their investment. The deduction will {{not be subject to}} the limitations on deduction of itemized deductions. Any loss exceeding current income may result in a net operating loss, which can be carried back, at the taxpayer's election, 3, 4, or 5 years, with any loss still remaining carrying forward 20 years. These rules apply to all Ponzi schemes where there has been a federal or state <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead promoter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> {{occupation}} <b>of</b> Lovas and <b>the</b> {{killing and}} expulsion of its civilian population {{was included in}} the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President <b>of</b> Serbia, Slobodan Milošević, and Goran Hadžić, a high-ranking official <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Serb-declared wartime breakaway region of SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. Both Milošević and Hadžić died before their trials could be completed. Serbian authorities tried and convicted a group <b>of</b> four for <b>the</b> killings, but a retrial was ordered following an appeal in 2014. Croatia indicted 17 persons in connection with the killings, although only two were available to <b>the</b> authorities. One <b>of</b> them was acquitted and the other declared unfit to stand trial.|$|R
40|$|Almost {{a decade}} ago {{it was said that}} {{international}} relations and postcolonialism “pass like ships in the night”. 1 Each knowledge formation steered its own course and neither acknowledged the other. Despite occasional attempts by a few scholars to promote dialogue, the two discourses continued on their separate ways, to all intents and purposes each unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other. Suddenly the position is changing. Over <b>the</b> past couple <b>of</b> years, there have been calls at <b>the</b> margin <b>of</b> international relations for an engagement with postcolonialism. These have been coupled with <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discipline for its complicity in <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> a neo-imperial order, for its racism, and for its erasure of colonial violence and dispossession. It can thus be said that a postcolonial international relations is now on the agenda...|$|R
2500|$|Garrison charged nine policemen with brutality, but {{dropped the}} charges two weeks later. [...] At {{a press conference}} he accused the state parole board of {{accepting}} bribes, but could obtain no <b>indictments.</b> Critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state legislature, Garrison was unanimously censured by it for [...] "deliberately maligning all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members".|$|R
25|$|The Gambinos {{had a close}} {{relationship}} with the Italian banker Michele Sindona. When Sindona got in trouble and was indicted for the bankruptcy of the Franklin National Bank, John Gambino procured a false passport and helped to stage a bogus kidnap in August 1979, to conceal a mysterious 11-week trip to Sicily before his scheduled fraud trial. However, Sindona also had put the Mafia's heroin money at risk, due to his financial malpractice. The real purpose of the kidnapping was to issue sparsely disguised blackmail notes to Sindona's past political allies – among them Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti – to engineer the rescue of his banks and recuperate Cosa Nostra's money. The Gambinos accompanied Sindona's attempt to recover the money, but the plans failed and Sindona was arrested, leading to the <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inzerillo-Spatola-Gambino network. It remains unclear if any of the Mafia money Sindona had lost was recovered. Rosario met Sindona and John Gambino upon his return at JFK Airport.|$|E
500|$|In Tom Hanks' words, [...] "The film is non-political {{and thus}} non-judgmental." [...] Nevertheless, in 1994, CNN's Crossfire debated whether the film {{promoted}} conservative values or was an <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counterculture {{movement of the}} 1960s. Thomas Byers, in a Modern Fiction Studies article, called the film [...] "an aggressively conservative film".|$|E
500|$|Dewar, though found {{partially}} guilty, survived with {{a severe}} reprimand. His executive officer was found guilty and resigned, while Collard was compelled to resign his commission for provoking the situation. [...] Having then commanded successively the two oldest capital ships in the fleet, Dewar retired on promotion to Rear-Admiral. [...] His memoirs, published as The Navy from Within in 1939, were a vitriolic <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy's practices.|$|E
50|$|Collier devotes nearly 300 {{pages to}} decry what he {{perceived}} as profanity and moral degeneration in <b>the</b> stage productions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era. This ranged from general attacks on <b>the</b> morality <b>of</b> Restoration theatre to very specific <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> playwrights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. Collier {{argued that a}} venue as influential as the theatre—it was believed then that the theatre should be providing moral instruction—should not have content that is morally detrimental. These pamphlets began a pamphlet war (see:Pamphlet wars) between Collier and some playwrights like Vanbrugh. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playwrights responded with equally vehement attacks, but some were so deeply affected, they withdrew from theatre permanently or substantially changed their approach to writing comedies, William Congreve amongst them.|$|R
40|$|Americans {{continue}} to fault news organizations {{for a number}} of perceived failures. Solid majorities criticize the news media for political bias, inaccuracy and failing to acknowledge mistakes. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harshest <b>indictments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> press come from the growing segment that relies on the internet as its main news source. The internet news audience ? roughly a quarter of all Americans ? tends to be younger and better educated than the public as a whole. People who rely on the internet as their main news source express relatively unfavorable opinions of mainstream news sources and are among <b>the</b> most critical <b>of</b> press performance. As many as 38 % of those who rely mostly on the internet for news say they have an unfavorable opinion of cable news networks such as CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC, compared with 25 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public overall, and just 17 % of television news viewers...|$|R

500|$|In 1977 David {{was badly}} {{injured in a}} car accident, from which she {{took a long time}} to recover. While she was in hospital, English Bread and Yeast Cookery was published. Its {{scholarship}} won high praise, and Jane Grigson, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, suggested that a copy of the book should be given to every marrying couple, while Hilary Spurling, reviewing for The Observer, thought that not only was it [...] "a scathing <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British bread industry", but one done with [...] "orderliness, authority, phenomenal scope and fastidious attention to detail".|$|E
500|$|The book {{reviewer}} for the Wilkes-Barre Record opined that, [...] "Lundberg bends {{so far to}} {{the left}} that his spine threatens to snap at times" [...] but nonetheless concluded that [...] "Lundberg really should be read". Writing in Science & Society, Harvey O'Connor also gave the book a mixed appraisal, observing that while the book constituted a [...] "comprehensive <b>indictment</b> ... <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of great fortunes" [...] based on [...] "encyclopedic research", Lundberg suffered from [...] "the New York myopia" [...] in describing the situation he presents as essentially beyond correction.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, David Brooks of The New York Times {{opined that}} Avatar creates [...] "a sort of two-edged {{cultural}} imperialism", an offensive cultural stereotype that {{white people are}} rationalist and technocratic while colonial victims are spiritual and athletic and that illiteracy is the path to grace. [...] A review in the Irish Independent found the film to contrast a [...] "mix of New Age environmentalism and {{the myth of the}} Noble Savage" [...] with the corruption of the [...] "civilized" [...] white man. [...] Reihan Salam, writing in Forbes, viewed it as ironic that [...] "Cameron has made a dazzling, gorgeous <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind of society that produces James Camerons." ...|$|E
25|$|U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales {{announced}} a Detroit grand jury <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> 16 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Outlaws National Club's members. The Detroit grand jury indictment included various charges, including assault and drug distribution.

25|$|The {{grand jury}} <b>indictment</b> clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Amendment {{has not been}} {{incorporated}} under the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states do employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right {{to a grand jury}} for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with preliminary hearing.|$|R
500|$|The book {{received}} {{praise from}} news media. The Wall Street Journal wrote {{that it was}} the [...] "first comprehensive examination of the destruction of this Chinese imperial city", and that Chang [...] "skillfully excavated from oblivion the terrible events that took place". The Atlantic Monthly described the book as [...] "a crushing <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese army's behavior". The Chicago Tribune called it [...] "a powerful new work of history and moral inquiry" [...] and stated that [...] "Chang takes great care to establish an accurate accounting of the dimensions of the violence." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that it was a [...] "compelling account of a horrendous episode that, until recently, has been largely forgotten".|$|E
500|$|In The Observer, Hilary Spurling {{called the}} book [...] "a scathing <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British bread industry" [...] and also [...] "a history of {{virtually}} every development since Stone Age crops and querns". Spurling rejoiced {{in the range}} of David's [...] recipes: [...] "It contains directions for baking anything from the common cob and Coburg to Peggy-tub or Flowerpot bread, Sussex Plum Heavies, Scotch bun and Selkirk bannock, not forgetting splits, baps, muffins, crumpets, wiggs and chudleighs." [...] The Times said, [...] "This is probably Mrs. David's most academic work yet. However, not one ounce of the familiar charm, good sense, asperity (reserved for modern commercial white bread), clarity or warmth is missing." ...|$|E
500|$|Andre Wright {{wrote for}} The Stranger, [...] " [...] starts strong, with an ingratiatingly anarchic vibe, but quickly devolves into a dust-dry, hectoring socialist lecture: a {{cinematic}} version of Kenner's My First Revolution playset." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent said that Weingartner [...] "presents his <b>indictment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> System in crudely stacked terms that make The Edukators {{very much a}} teen movie rather than a plausible political statement." [...] In The Times, Wendy Ide wrote: [...] "What {{could have been an}} effective piece of drama, a dialogue to cause both sides to question the very foundations of their belief systems, is just a two-hour rant from a wispy bearded idealist whose idea of brotherhood is to sleep with his best friend's girlfriend." ...|$|E
50|$|For two years, Drexel {{insisted that}} nothing illegal occurred, {{even when the}} SEC {{formally}} sued Drexel in 1988.
