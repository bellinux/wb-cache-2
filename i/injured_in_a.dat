5|$|The first campaign, in 492 BC, {{was led by}} Darius's {{son-in-law}} Mardonius, who re-subjugated Thrace, {{which had}} nominally {{been part of the}} Persian empire since 513 BC.

However, further progress in this campaign was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. Mardonius himself was then <b>injured</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> raid on his camp by a Thracian tribe, and after this he returned {{with the rest of the}} expedition to Asia.|$|E
