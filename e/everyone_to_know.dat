5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor would know their paupers they were considered able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was {{performing}} at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing [...] "Basket Case", {{because he believed}} the group's time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen {{in the rear of}} the audience was labeled [...] "1 Minutes Left", saying [...] "You're not gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a [...] "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that [...] "Green Day would like <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas" [...] also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills. However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} been much less forgiving; common critiques have derided the princess as a spoiled, shallow, bland and overly sexualized character. Common Sense Media criticized Jasmine for lacking an {{original}} predicament and premise, while Creative Loafing's Matt Brunson described the character as a [...] "liberated" [...] but [...] "stiff" [...] heroine. Janet Maslin of The New York Times panned Jasmine: [...] "the sloe-eyed Princess Jasmine... a nymph in harem pants, use words like 'fabulous' and 'amazing' to express unremarkable thoughts", concluding, [...] "Luckily, [...] surrounded by an overpowering array of secondary characters who make the film's sidelines much more interesting than its supposed center." [...] Time Out called the character disappointing, and TV Guide described her as [...] "bland". Film critic Roger Ebert cited Jasmine among the film's weaknesses, dismissing the relationship between her and Aladdin as [...] "pale and routine" [...] in comparison to Belle and the Beast's. Additionally, Ebert wrote that the characters [...] "look unformed, as if even the filmmakers didn't see them as real individuals." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine derided the character as [...] "another 'free-spirited' type in the Barbie-doll tradition, a faux feminist who wants <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that she can do everything the boys can". Orange Coasts Henry A. Giroux dismissed Jasmine {{as little more than}} [...] "an object of 's immediate desire" [...] and [...] "stepping stone to social mobility." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the '68 Special project, a nervous Presley had said to the executive producer Bob Finkel: [...] "I want <b>everyone</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what I can really do." [...] Critics generally agree that had happened – in addition to making profitable, but generally uninspired movies and soundtracks. The '68 Special is widely credited with revitalizing his career: chart statistics for the summer of 1968 suggest that Presley's recording career was becoming all but non-existent and irrelevant. After the special, he began his stint in Las Vegas and toured, achieving a string of record-breaking sell-out performances across America. Chart successes returned, including a U.S. number one in 1969 ("Suspicious Minds") and a U.K. number one ("The Wonder of You", (1970)) – his first since 1965.|$|E
