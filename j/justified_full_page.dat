500|$|The verso of the folio {{containing}} the Arrest of Christ contains a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of decorated text which begins [...] "". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of decorated text (folio 203r [...] "Iesus autem plenus"). In {{addition to this}} <b>page,</b> five other <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew, {{there is one other}} full-page treatment ( [...] , [...] "Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones"). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text ( [...] , [...] "Erat autem hora tercia", and folio 187v, [...] " [...] quidem [...] postquam"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, [...] "Fuit in diebus Herodis [...] ", and , [...] "Una autem sabbati valde"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. There is no surviving <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> of decorated text that have been lost.|$|R
