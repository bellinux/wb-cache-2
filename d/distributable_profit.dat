40|$|On 9 July 2009, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{issued the}} International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium Sized Entities ("IFRS for SMEs") {{which aims to}} provide a {{financial}} reporting framework for SMEs falling within its scope. It {{is a matter for}} authorities in each jurisdiction to decide which entities are permitted or required to apply IFRS for SMEs. Because of the connection between accounting and taxation certain european countries had a reluctant position related to the application of IFRS for SMEs. Opponents focused on the incompatibility between IFRS for SMEs framework and the principles commonly accepted for tax purposes. As the individual financial statements drown up in compliance with IFRS for SMEs will serve for profit distribution under the 2 nd European Directive the question arises weather the profits determined under these accounting rules can be considered as realized for distribution purposes. In order to mitigate the mismatch between accounting and distributable profits, Member States will need to reconsider the circumstances in which gains and losses arising from re-measurement at fair value through profit and loss should be considered as realized. In this scenario, two important questions arise: What are the potential tax effects of the application of IFRS for SMEs? Is the profit determined under IFRS for SMEs available for distribution or some adjustments are necessary? The paper addresses these issues {{in the context of the}} Romanian accounting and taxation systems. Romania represents a relevant case study, as it is one of the European countries with a close linkage between financial and tax, where the fiscal profit is dependent on the accounting profit (currently determined under domestic regulations). The methodology consists in a comparative analysis of the recognition and measurement rules between national accounting regulations and IFRS for SMEs in order to identify the differences with possible consequences on taxable and <b>distributable</b> <b>profit.</b> The comparative analysis identified tensions between accounting and taxation that should be solved and new accounting policies with impact on taxable and <b>distributable</b> <b>profit.</b> Under these circumstances regulators should analyse if new policies proposed by IFRS for SMEs are acceptable considering the purpose of specific regulations and modify the legal framework.

40|$|The European {{accounting}} directive does not specify the users of financial statements, nor weights the single objectives of financial accounting. Thus deducting EU accounting standards consistently and systematically from predefined objectives is nearly impossible. As an example, accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ {{can be justified}} neither by financial statements’ informational and stewardship function nor by the objective of measuring distributable profits for tax dividend payment purposes, or by capital maintenance requirements. Accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ simply allows preparers of financial statements to shift ex post profit distribution decisions to ex ante profit determination, for a specific ‘apparent’ purpose i. e. the maintenance of assets or repairs thereof. Accordingly the ‘true and fair’ profit actually realized by the entity is not disclosed to external users. Thus accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ is in contradiction with the informational and stewardship function of the annual accounts, {{as well as with}} the determination of a fair measurement of distributable profits. More specifically, shareholders find themselves deprived of part of the profits actually realized by the entity and dispose of fewer financial resources to cover for their own expenses. Besides, by shifting the profit distribution decisions to the level of profit determination, a circular reference is introduced in the question of determining the <b>distributable</b> <b>profit,</b> residing in the fact that in the function of the <b>distributable</b> <b>profit</b> is included a variable that needs to be determined by the financial statements, i. e. the variable ‘profit to be distributed’. The usefulness of the balance sheet as a basis for the profit determination is taken ad absurdum, if management’s profit distribution decisions are already reflected at the level of profit determination. In this case, determination of <b>distributable</b> <b>profit</b> is based on the question of how much profit the entity’s governing body intend to distribute and not based on the ‘true and fair’ profit actually realized. Accounting for ‘provision for future charges’ is neither the expression of protection of creditors. In substance, accounting for provisions is required by the prudence principle but this is only true for provisions accounted for future expected losses (future charges not compensated by future revenues). Provisions for charges cover expenses not linked to ‘expected’ future losses. Thus, provisions for charges reflect compensated future charges. Accordingly accounting for ‘provisions for future charges’ distorts the financial position and performance of an entity, misinterprets the prudence principle and violates the accrual principle of accounting...|$|E

Previously, we already deleted 6047 firms with missing prior year observations, of which 2158 observations are attributable to 2005 and which were only used to scale the variables by lagged total assets as well as to test the predictability and persistence of earnings.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relation between}} financing system and earnings management {{and changes in the}} patterns of earnings management activities over time. Prior research suggests that managers are more likely to manage earnings in a credit financing system because the purpose of the financial reporting in this credit environment is to protect creditors by prudently calculating <b>distributable</b> <b>profit.</b> In addition, multinational enterprises financial reporting tends to be anchored in their home countrys practices and responsive to their national requirements. Using 121 firm-year observations of non-U. S. firms reporting under IFRS, we find some evidence that firms from credit financing systems manage earnings more than firms from equity financing systems. We find that firms in a credit financing environment report 1. 6 % higher in absolute discretionary accruals than equity firms. However, we did not find evidence that overall earnings management activities have decreased as the IASBs Comparability/Improvements Project went into effect after 1995. This finding suggests that the IASB has not been effective in narrowing down the international differences in accounting practices and providing comparable financial statements to the public...|$|E

Depreciation is a complex, intricate and confusing {{term in the}} fields of engineering, social and management sciences. As a result, it has been over used, over stressed, and over worked by the accountants and professional valuers. Interna-tional Accounting Standard (IAS) 4, qualifies assets for depreciation when assets are used for more than one accounting period, i. e. assets held by an enterprise for production or service, and has economic useful life. Whereas, under Standard Statement of Accounting Practice (SSAP) 12, depreciation is viewed as wearing out, consumption or other loss of value of fixed asset, whether arising from use, affluxion of time or obsolescence through technology and market changes. Complexity may arise when it is viewed as a fall in price, physical deterioration, allocation of cost, fall in value, valua-tion technique and asset replacement. Intricate and confusion are inevitable when accountants employ various methods of providing for depreciation on the same or similar assets of different life span. These methods may include straight line, reducing balance, sum of the year’s digit, revaluation, annuity, output, sinking fund etc which will definitely give different values in the financial statement.

40|$|The {{issue of}} central bank profit {{distribution}} is both complex and often politically controversial. Based on the replies of 57 central banks worldwide to an ECB questionnaire, this paper analyses how profit distribution rules {{can affect the}} amounts distributed and the financial strength of central banks. The paper also investigates the link between profit distribution, accounting rules and financial strength. Research shows that central banks apply divergent rules as regards profit distribution and loss coverage. While {{they are not a}} measure of central bank performance, in the long run profits strengthen the credibility of central banks and contribute to their financial independence, whereas profit distribution rules that do not allow central banks to set up adequate reserves might have the opposite effect. The interaction of profit distribution rules and accounting rules also {{plays an important role in}} central banks achieving financial strength.

Finally, the paper examines the role of stakeholders in influencing the profit distribution regimes of central banks, and develops a non-exhaustive set of general principles that could be considered in relation to profit distribution frameworks, with the aim of strengthening the financial, and therefore institutional, independence of central banks...|$|E
40|$|Repurchase {{of shares}} {{for the purpose}} of their {{redemption}} is one of the exemptions to the general rule that forbids companies to buy their own shares back. Thus, the Polish code of commercial partnerships and companies sets out a series of restrictions for the re-acquisition of shares {{for the purpose of}} their redemption. These limitations aim at protecting the creditors and minority shareholders of a given company. If the buy-back is financed with <b>distributable</b> <b>profits</b> of the company, the precondition for the repurchase of shares is to devote the profits to this end. If the company has no <b>distributable</b> <b>profits,</b> the repurchase must follow the decision of the general meeting to reduce the legal capital. The conditions for the share buy-back are infringed by the company’s duty to return the shares to the seller. On the other hand, the shareholder who sold the shares is obliged to pay-back the price. A company repurchasing its own shares ought to comply with the rule of equal treatment of shareholders. According to the rule any unequal treatment o f shareholders is only allowed if it is clearly in the interest o f the company as a whole.

Drawing from a hand-collected sample {{of more than}} 10, 000 firm-year observations of Japanese listed firms, we extend the literature by focusing on dividend policy as a motive to manage earnings. If reported earnings are central to determining dividends, managers have incentives to manage earnings upward to avoid dividend cuts. Therefore, we test whether and how firms exercise discretion in valuation allowance account for deferred tax assets in order to manage earnings. We find that discretionary changes in the valuation allowance are related to dividends, particularly among firms that favor increased and stable dividends. We also find that firms likely establish lower valuation allowance when pre-managed earnings and <b>distributable</b> <b>profits</b> fall short of levels needed to maintain dividends.

40|$|The {{distribution}} by {{a company}} of its assets to its shareholders, whether they be {{in the form of}} cash or otherwise, ought to be carefully regulated by any legal system intent on protecting the interests of creditors and minority shareholders of the company. Until 1999 such protection was largely provided for by the maintenance of capital principle. This principle manifested itself in various ways, the most significant being that it was unlawful for a company to acquire its own shares or shares in its holding company, and the distribution of funds to shareholders other than those representing legally <b>distributable</b> <b>profits</b> usually required a court order. In 1999 this all changed with far-reaching amendments to the Companies Act 61 of 1973 (see the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999). The maintenance of capital principle was effectively abolished; companies were permitted to acquire their own shares and shares in their holding companies; and the distinction between profits and other funds of a company was removed. The distribution of funds entailed was allowed provided, inter alia, the company's solvency and liquidity was not placed in jeopardy and, {{in the case of a}} buy-back or a purchase of shares in the holding company, a special resolution had been adopted to approve the transaction...|$|R
2500|$|Legal capital must be {{maintained}} (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed [...] "in disguise") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and {{will be able to}} pay its debts. If this {{turns out to be a}} negligent statement, the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to claw back any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel preferential shares before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from <b>distributable</b> <b>profits.</b> Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of <b>distributable</b> <b>profits.</b> Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution. Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back pro rata. How many shares are retained by the company as treasury shares or cancelled must be reported to Companies House. From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they [...] "dodge" [...] the Exchequer.|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is the {{threshold}} beyond which compensation is payable for breach of a stabilisation clause. The discussion {{is based on the}} tax stability clauses contained in the mining development agreements unilaterally cancelled by the Government of the Republic of Zambia in early 2008. The outstanding characteristic feature of the tax stability clauses was government’s undertaking that it shall not, for the stability periods ranging between 10 to 20 years, introduce new fiscal measures resulting in a “material adverse effect” on the <b>distributable</b> <b>profits</b> of the mining companies or the dividends received by the shareholders of the companies. Government further undertook to ‘fully’ and ‘fairly’ compensate mining companies should such measures be introduced during the stability periods. The question investigated by the thesis is whether the fiscal measures introduced by government in early 2008, as amended in 2009, have resulted in a “material adverse effect” on the <b>distributable</b> <b>profits</b> of mining companies or the dividends received by the shareholders of the companies and, therefore, entitle mining companies to compensation from government. The main findings of the thesis, among others, are that: The threshold beyond which the obligation to pay compensation is triggered varies considerably depending on the specific contractual formulation of the stabilisation clause involved. However, it is significantly lower than the threshold beyond which host States must pay compensation in regulatory taking cases. Although there are several international arbitral awards in which payment of compensation has been ordered for breach of a freezing stabilisation clause, there is no known similar award in cases involving breach of an economic equilibrium stabilisation clause. Even in cases in which compensation has been ordered for breach of a stabilisation clause, {{there is no evidence of}} how much the presence of a stabilisation clause contributes to the total quantum of the compensation awarded. The tribunals either take a "contractual perspective" or an "expropriation perspective" to arrive at their respective decisions on the quantum of compensation. International arbitral tribunals take into account any ‘excessive’ or ‘windfall profits’ made by investors in deciding the quantum of compensation payable to the investor for breach of a stabilisation clause. The tax stability clauses contained in the mining development agreements cancelled by the Zambian government are typical economic equilibrium stabilisation clauses. Based on these findings, among others, the thesis has concluded that there are equal chances that the Zambian government may or may not be ordered to pay compensation to the aggrieved mining companies. Notwithstanding this conclusion, however, the thesis has noted that government’s unilateral cancellation of the mining development agreements has potential to negate the country’s investment image. Against this background, the recommendation of the thesis is that government and the aggrieved mining companies must engage in discussions with a view to reaching at an amicable solution to their standoff. The rationale behind the recommendation is that an amicable solution presents a perfect opportunity for both parties to come up with a decision that is mutually beneficial to their interests. Also it is less costly than international arbitration. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Centre for Human Rightsunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|This article evaluates Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) {{accounting}} {{practice and the}} related financial accounting and reporting requirements. Governments across the world are seeking to access private finance to improve public infrastructure. Accounting for PPPs has encountered many difficulties, {{one of which is}} the practice by which PPPs are not accounted for as fixed assets on the balance sheet of either the public sector client or the private sector operator. Accounting for PPPs has grown in importance at a time of transition from national Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Under UK GAAP, both client and operator accounting adopt the reasoning – familiar from leasing standards – of the allocation of risks and rewards between the parties to determine the party which should recognize the fixed asset on its balance sheet. The gap in IFRS with regard to operator accounting has been filled by the interpretation IFRIC 12 on service concession agreements: this moves the reasoning from risks and rewards to control, familiar from consolidation standards. The UK Treasury and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) have required/proposed the adoption of the mirror-image treatment of IFRIC 12. In most, but not all, cases, control will be assessed to rest with the client, which will recognize property, plant and equipment, and not with the operator, which will recognize either a financial asset or an intangible asset on the basis of an assessment of which party bears the majority of risks and rewards. Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, accounting policy choices are strongly influenced by, for the client, governmental control frameworks, and for the operator, by the implications for the profile of <b>distributable</b> <b>profits</b> and for taxation. An important public policy issue is that the national accounts, which for European Union member states must comply with European System of Accounts 1995, will remain on a risks and rewards basis. It is these numbers that will be used in assessments of macro-fiscal policy and fiscal risks, notwithstanding that the Eurostat version of risks and rewards is even more open to manipulation than were the national financial reporting standards...|$|R
