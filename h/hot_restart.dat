Results show an unlimited <b>hot</b> <b>restart</b> capability {{in the range of}} feed pressures from 400 psi to 80 psi. Effects of vacuum on <b>hot</b> <b>restart</b> were not addressed, and only beginning-of-life bed conditions were tested. No starts with bubbles were performed.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 - 8 Rotor bow during <b>hot</b> <b>restart</b> is {{a common}} cause of high {{vibrations}} in turbomachinery. It may occur after the shutdown of a machine operating under load, if the rotor is left cooling in standstill condition (no turning gear) with a subsequent restart of the machine performed {{before the end of}} the thermal transient. A complete model of the phenomenon was developed, in order to predict the amplitude of rotor vibrations during <b>hot</b> <b>restart.</b> The thermal distribution across the rotor is calculated basing on fluid-dynamic theory, and is used as boundary condition for a finite element analysis (FEA) that returns the deformed shape of the rotor. Vibration amplitude during compressor restart is then calculated with the traditional tools used for rotordynamic analysis, by unbalancing the rotor according to FEA results. The developed model has been used to simulate a real case for which experimental data were available. Calculation results showed very good agreement with experimental measures, confirming the expected features of the phenomenon, its trend with time and the effectiveness of slow roll in straightening the rotor and reducing vibration amplitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{canonical}} tensor rank approximation problem (TAP) {{consists of}} approximating a real-valued tensor {{by one of}} low canonical rank, which is a challenging non-linear, non-convex, constrained optimization problem, where the constraint set forms a non-smooth semi-algebraic set. We introduce a Riemannian Gauss-Newton method with trust region for solving small-scale, dense TAPs. The novelty of our approach is threefold. First, we parametrize the constraint set as the Cartesian product of Segre manifolds, hereby formulating the TAP as a Riemannian optimization problem, and we argue why this parametrization is among the theoretically best possible. Second, an original ST-HOSVD-based retraction operator is proposed. Third, we introduce a <b>hot</b> <b>restart</b> mechanism that efficiently detects when the optimization process is tending to an ill-conditioned tensor rank decomposition and which often yields a quick escape path from such spurious decompositions. Numerical experiments show improvements of up to three orders of magnitude {{in terms of the}} expected time to compute a successful solution over existing state-of-the-art methods...|$|E
40|$|The present work aims at an efficient, portable, {{and robust}} {{design of a}} data-distributed massively {{parallel}} DIRECT, the deterministic global optimization algorithm widely used in multidisciplinary engineering design, biological science, and physical science applications. The original algorithm is modified to adapt to different problem scales and optimization (exploration vs. exploitation) goals. Enhanced with a memory reduction technique, dy-namic data structures are used to organize local data, handle unpredictable memory re-quirements, reduce the memory usage, and share the data across multiple processors. The parallel scheme employs a multilevel functional and data parallelism to boost concurrency and mitigate the data dependency, thus improving the load balancing and scalability. In addition, checkpointing features are integrated to provide fault tolerance and <b>hot</b> <b>restarts.</b> Important algorithm modifications and design considerations are discussed regarding data structures, parallel schemes, error handling, and portability. Using several benchmark functions and real-world applications, the present work is evaluated in terms of optimization effectiveness, data structure efficiency, memory usage, parallel performance, and checkpointing overhead.

The Lewis facility provides an accurate simulation of temperatures, high vacuum and solar flux as encountered in low-Earth orbit. The solar dynamic system includes a Brayton power conversion unit integrated with a solar receiver {{which is designed to}} store energy for continuous power operation during the eclipse phase of the orbit. This paper reviews the goals and status of the Solar Dynamic Ground Test Demonstration project and describes the initial testing, including both operational and performance data. System testing to date has accumulated over 365 hours of power operation (ranging from 400 watts to 2. 0 -W(sub e)), including 187 simulated orbits, 16 ambient starts and 2 <b>hot</b> <b>restarts.</b> Data are shown for an orbital startup, transient and steady-state orbital operation and shutdown.

40|$|In recent years, tensors {{have found}} {{application}} {{in a growing}} number of applications, and tensor decompositions are now increasingly employed for revealing practical multi-linear structures underlying multidimensional data. A signature application of the tensor CP decomposition (CPD) was devised by Appellof and Davidson (1981) who showed that fluorophores in a collection of diluted chemical mixtures can be identified naturally from this decomposition of the multidimensional data array that is sampled in fluorescence spectroscopy experiments. Unfortunately, in applications, we are not usually dealing with tensors that admit a mathematically exact CPD with few summands, because of the usual representation, roundoff, measurement, and model errors. Therefore, one is usually interested in finding a closest low-rank CPD near a given tensor. This tensor canonical rank approximation (TAP) problem is naturally formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem where the constraint set forms a non-smooth semi-algebraic set. In this talk, we consider a Riemannian Gauss-Newton (RGN) method with trust region for solving TAPs. First, we show how the constraint set can be parameterized as the Cartesian product of Segre manifolds, hereby formulating the TAP as a Riemannian optimization problem. It is argued theoretically from geometrical considerations why this parametrization is among the best possible. Second, it is shown that the radius and rate of local convergence of this RGN method are intimately related to the TAP's condition number. We also show that the local convergence of current state-of-the-art optimization methods for the TAP are governed by a different condition number. Our analysis shows specifically that problems with large differences in scaling of the terms in the CPD should best be treated with the proposed RGN method as it is insensitive to this. Third, an analysis shows that some types of ill-conditioned CPDs are particularly troublesome for any RGN process. We introduce a <b>hot</b> <b>restart</b> mechanism that efficiently detects when the optimization process is tending to an ill-conditioned CPD and which often yields a quick escape path from such spurious decompositions. Numerical experiments show improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in terms of the execution time over existing state-of-the-art methods. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{modelling}} {{of mercury}} free HID lamps is challenging {{due to the}} complexity of gas mixtures and sensitivity of breakdown characteristics to the initial physical conditions. In this paper we report on results from a computational investigation of breakdown characteristics and the plasma properties of mercury-free HID lamps having metal halide fills. We discuss breakdown time as a function of voltage rise times, polarities and plasma composition (e. g., <b>hot</b> and cold <b>restart).</b> We also discuss the thermodynamic properties for doses containing Xe/NaI/ScI 3 /ZnI 2 [...] The simulator used in this work, nonPDPSIM, is a plasma hydrodynamics model in which continuity, momentum and energy equations are solved for charged species with solution of Poisson's equation. The model is coupled with a thermodynamics module providing local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) properties.
