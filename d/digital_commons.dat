40|$|Part 3 : E-government Services and GovernanceInternational audienceThe {{electronic}} identification and trust service regulation (eIDAS) was adopted in 2014 {{to create a}} <b>digital</b> <b>common</b> market in the European Union (EU). As the world {{is becoming more and}} more digital, countries need to develop ways to integrate digital migrants. While the EU does not currently have a <b>digital</b> <b>common</b> market, several EU countries already have working systems for cross-border digital cooperation. The principal focus of this article was to address whether eIDAS can be implemented in these countries, without challenging the local initiatives. The Estonian e-government system (EES) was chosen as an exemplary case. Here we analyzed whether the eIDAS complements or challenges the national e-government initiatives, such as Estonia’s e-residency project, and whether it is in the interest of member states to contribute to the fast implementation of the eIDAS as the most effective measure for achieving cross-border use of e-services. To address these questions, a content, context and process (CCP) analysis framework was used. Based on our findings, we concluded that, although the eIDAS creates some additional obligations, the regulation supports national e-government goals and domestic cross-border initiatives. Also, without supranational interference, it is highly unlikely that digital open borders could be created among 28 member states. Thus, it is in the interest of the member states to contribute to a fast implementation of the eIDAS...|$|R
