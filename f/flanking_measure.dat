40|$|As a {{means to}} promote the {{development}} of innovative energy- and resource-efficient production technologies, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched a programme 1 funding over 31 joint research projects with more than 65 m Euros in 2009. Each of the funded projects aims to develop new, holistic solutions for industrial production which can substantially improve energy efficiency. The purpose of these solutions is to ensure and foster the competitiveness {{as well as the}} technological top position of German industry. However, in order to reap the fruits of these efficient solutions, it is necessary that they are spread and adopted by industry. As a <b>flanking</b> <b>measure</b> to the 31 research projects, the BMBF and the German Engineering Federation (VDMA) therefore launched a joint initiative called the Effizienzfabrik, the Innovation Platform for Resource Efficiency in Production. The initiative has three objectives: (1) to disseminate information about recent trends and developments in research on energy- and resource-efficient production technologies, (2) to facilitate the dissemination of the project results by publications, events and web-based tools and finally, (3) to create a living network of stakeholders from industry, academia and the public. In this paper, we discuss the approaches developed for and implemented in the Effizienzfabrik. This includes a presentation of the methodological background, a review of the various tools and services provided to the public and a discussion of lessons learned during the Effizienzfabrik initiative. This information may serve as a basis for launching similar programmes in other countries or contexts...|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{implications}} of the financial crisis for the relationship between monetary integration and democratic government in the European Union (EU). As the crisis has exposed the original balance that economic and monetary union (EMU) sought to maintain between monetary integration and policy diversity to be unsustainable, the eurozone is put before the choice of one of three governance models: executive federalism, democratic federalization or EMU dissolution. Notably, these three governance models perfectly illustrate Dani Rodrik's 'trilemma of the world economy', which maintains that of the three goods - economic (and monetary) integration, the nation-state and democratic politics - one will always have to give. In light of this, the article concludes that the present course towards executive federalism can be justified for preventing euro dissolution and recognizing the value of national self-government. Nevertheless, it threatens to come at a democratic price. Hence, it is imperative to consider possible <b>flanking</b> <b>measures</b> that can mitigate this effect.

40|$|Objective: Tobacco {{companies}} have made extensive {{efforts to build}} alliances against comprehensive smoke-free legislation. This article analyses the interaction between actors who opposed {{the development of the}} European Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments. Methods: Drawing on data from 200 policy documents and 32 semistructured interviews and using qualitative textual analysis and organisational network analysis, opponentsâ positions on, and responses to, the policy initiative, strategies to oppose the policy, and efforts to build alliances were investigated. Results: The non-binding nature of the policy, scientific evidence and clear political will to adopt EU-wide measures combined to limit the intensity of commercial sector opposition to the comprehensive EU smoke-free policy. Most tobacco companies, led by the Confederation of European Community Cigarette Manufacturers (CECCM), voiced reservations against the proposal, criticised the policy process and fought <b>flanking</b> <b>measures</b> on product regulation. However, some companies focused on instigating harm reduction debates. These divergent approaches and the reluctance of other commercial actors to demonstrate solidarity with the tobacco sector prevented the establishment of a cohesive commercial sector alliance. Conclusions: The comparatively limited opposition to EU smoke-free policy contrasts with previous accounts of tobacco industry resistance to tobacco control. While context-specific factors can partially explain these differences, the paper indicates that the sector's diminished credibility and lack of unity hampered political engagement and alliance building. Industry efforts to emphasise the benefits of smokeless tobacco during smoke-free policy debates highlight the potential of harm reduction as a gateway for tobacco companies to re-enter the political arena...|$|R

40|$|Energy used in {{buildings}} {{is responsible for}} more than 40 % of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the EU and their share in cost-efficient GHG mitigation potentials {{is estimated to be}} even higher. In spite of its huge savings potential of up to 80 %, achievements are very slow in the building sector and much stronger political action seems to be needed. One important step in this direction has been the recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in autumn 2009. However, strong national implementation including powerful packages of <b>flanking</b> <b>measures</b> seems to be crucial to really make significant progress in this important field. In order to directly improve political action, we provide a differentiated country-by-country bottom up simulation of residential buildings for the whole EU, Norway, Iceland, Croatia and Liechtenstein.

It includes a simulation of the thermal quality and costs of the components of the building shell for new buildings as well as the refurbishment of the existing building stock. Based on this differentiated analysis, we show in detail what would be needed to accelerate energy savings in the building sector and provide a more precise estimate of the potentials to be targeted by particular policies. We demonstrate, e. g. that the potential of building codes set via the EPBD would be located mainly in those countries that already have quite stringent codes in place. We show as well the high relevance of accelerating refurbishments and re-investment cycles of buildings. By providing a clear estimate of the full costs related to such a strategy, we highlight a major obstacle to accelerated energy-efficient building renovation and construction...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extraction}} of some results achieved {{in a comprehensive}} study of Russia's transition in its regional as well as sectoral dimension. Thereby, the transition process between 1993 - 2000 has been approximated by aggregated developments of productivity, technical change, and technical efficiency which all have been calculated by a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). The obtained results have been analyzed with respect to any institutional circumstances in a second analytical step. Based on that, in a third step, some political call for actions have been specified as well as addressed according to regional/federal responsibility. The study has shown a notable heterogeneity within the considered regional as well as sectoral transition paths. Occasionally, the individual trends even diverge and provide, however, a growing economic polarization among Russia's regions. Background of these trends are, above all, spatial divergent institutional conditions caused by various reform implementations and/or reform strictness. Hence, the crucial call for political action had to be addressed regionally. At federal level, just coordinating and <b>flanking</b> <b>measures</b> have been mentioned. Altogether it can be summarized: The necessary pre-conditions for a successful transition in Russia seem to be given. But there is apparently a need in some regions for an adequate individual adjustment as well as, sometimes, for a sustainable stimulus in order to trigger a change. Hence, the particular embodiment of the regional transition path, the political initiative, and, therefore, any success on Russia's way from a 'planned towards a market economy' are incumbent on the regions. Admittedly, those {{have to be aware}} of own potentials. The regions should develop their individual chances actively and, however, try to turn specialties into benefits. Since this will be successful, it can be a source of substantial growth at regional as well as at federal level.

40|$|The EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which {{entered into}} force in 1997 {{foresees}} the possible {{establishment of a}} free trade area (FTA) between the parties. The aim of our study is to evaluate the possible economic, social and environmental impact of such {{a free trade agreement}} between the European Union and Russia. The results of the analysis indicate that an EU-Russia FTA will be beneficial to the Russian Federation and the EU 27. Some sectors are expected to contract in the medium term, but their importance in total output is small. Over the long run, the majority of sectors in Russia are expected to expand, while only a few sectors in the EU 27 are expected to register negligible decreases in output. We estimate that welfare losses from the environmental damages would be very small for Russia (possibly even smaller due to the implementation of greener technologies), and negligible for the EU. Despite some significant negative medium-term social implications in selected sectors in Russia, the overall increase in economic activity and wages, coupled with likely domestic policies aiming at easing the impact of transitional unemployment, are expected to allow for the overall reduction in poverty rates. Overall, the results show that significant welfare gains (2. 24 % of GDP for Russia) would accrue from the deep FTA scenario involving a significant reduction of NTBs along with additional <b>flanking</b> <b>measures,</b> particularly on competition, IPR protection and corruption, which would help re-branding of Russia as a safe and attractive investment location.

The wear widths of major <b>flank</b> were <b>measured,</b> and the wear characteristic of twist was analyzed during drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics. Drilling experiments were carried to consider influence factors of drill bit wear, such as tool materials, cooling condition, spindle speed and tool angles. Tool materials and cooling conditions are the major factors to affect wear of drill bits. High-speed steel drill bits are not suitable for drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics. Cooling condition affects wear remarkably. With the rising of spindle speed, the wear widths of major flank grows. But apex angle has little affects on the tool wear rate. Research results indicate that low tool wear can be obtain through optimizing tool material and machining parameters in drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics...|$|R

40|$|Interactive media plays {{a central}} role in children's lives, however limited {{research}} has examined the impact of interactive media on children's cognitive development. Past research has suggested that exercise and video game play can improve executive functioning (EF) skills in both the short and long term. EF is a cluster of higher order cognitive skills, including selective attention and inhibition, which work together to coordinate higher order functioning. Interventions that improve EF are of interest based on the relationship between these skills and academic outcomes. Acute EF change in 155 7 - to 12 -year-olds was assessed after participation in a 20 -minute activity session. The between-subjects design had four conditions: an exergame, sedentary video game, exercise and non-playing control. The varied level of physical activity and cognitive engagement were used to examine if it was the nature of the activity, such as physical movement, or cognitive engagement in an enjoyable activity that drove changes in EF. An accelerometer and heart rate monitor were used to measure the intensity of energy expenditure, an expected mediator. 	Three age-appropriate tasks (i. e. stroop, go/no-go and <b>flanker)</b> <b>measured</b> EF pre- and post-activity, however children had ceiling effects on both the stroop and go/no-go task. Children in all conditions improved from pre- to posttest on the flanker task as well as many of the sub trials on the flanker task; however, the exergame group improved more than the other three conditions from pre- to posttest on the two sub trials that required the highest level of inhibition skills. In addition, both the exergame and the sedentary video game groups had the largest changes from pre- to posttest on the block of the flanker task that required switching between rules. The findings revealed different patterns between accuracy and reaction times, which reflects differences in inhibitory processes. Energy expenditure was not a mediator of EF outcomes. Prior video game experience was related to EF change in that those with more video game experience were faster, but not necessarily more accurate. Gender differences reflected the same pattern where boys became faster, but not more accurate. Girls were more accurate, but not faster. Findings are discussed in terms implications for the relationship between exergame play and cognitive benefits for children...|$|R
