25|$|About 1pm, as Drake moved sluggishly {{out across}} Belfast Lough, {{a small boat}} came out to her, {{carrying}} another volunteer, Royal Navy Lieutenant William Dobbs, a local man who had just gotten married. According to Drake pilot {{he brought with him}} a copy of an express letter from Whitehaven, explaining the full details of the mystery ship (Jones states in his official report that the news from Whitehaven had arrived the previous evening and was known to his morning captives). With the wind and tide more favourable in the afternoon, Ranger moved slowly back out of the Lough into the North Channel, making sure never to <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> ahead of Drake. Finally, about 6pm, the two enemies were within hailing distance. Jones had the American naval colours flying, and Lieut. Dobbs' formal inquiry as to the ship's identity was answered with absolute truth.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles was {{loath to}} <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> from Masséna and hovered near Donaueschingen for a while. However, the Austrian general {{began to move}} north when Philippsburg was attacked. On 5 September reports came in from Hautpoul's cavalry and {{infantry}} brigadier Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen that Charles was coming closer. Though Philippsburg had only been under siege for a few days, the French inflicted 94 casualties on the garrison of Philippsburg and caused serious damage to its defenses. Nevertheless, Muller abandoned the siege and began falling back on Mannheim. By 13 September, most of the Army of the Rhine was safely {{on the west bank}} of the Rhine. Leval's division covered the northern stretch between Worms and Koblenz, Colaud was south near Speyer and Ney defended the river between them with a newly formed division composed of six elite companies, one infantry regiment and three cavalry regiments.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} Astral Weeks, Morrison {{moved with}} his wife to a home on a mountain top in the Catskills near Woodstock, a hamlet in upstate New York with an artistic community. Because of the album's poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a third record {{that would be more}} accessible and appealing to listeners: [...] "I make albums primarily to sell them and if I <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> out a lot of people can't relate to it. I had to forget about the artistic thing because it didn't make sense on a practical level. One has to live." [...] He began writing songs for Moondance in July 1969. The musicians who went on to record the album with Morrison were recruited from Woodstock and would continue working with him for several years, including guitarist John Platania, saxophonist Jack Schroer, and keyboardist Jef Labes. The singer left after the Woodstock music festival in August attracted an influx of people to the area.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to {{cooperate}} with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins. [...] Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds. [...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would not, if I were you, <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> from the original, as the President likes it.

His maternal grandmother was a Pequot, and he was also of Basque and Irish descent. As he put it, [...] "A little of this and a little of that; a real street dog." [...] DeVille said about Stamford, [...] "It was post-industrial. Everybody worked in factories, you know. Not me. I wouldn't have that. People from Stamford don't <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b> That's a place where you die." [...] DeVille said about his youthful musical tastes, [...] "I still remember listening to groups like the Drifters. It was like magic, there was drama, and it would hypnotise me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gators faced #1 ranked Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl for the Bowl Alliance {{national}} championship. Florida {{received the}} opening kickoff {{and drove to}} the Nebraska 5, before settling for a 23-yard Bart Edmiston field goal. Aided by good field position, the Huskers countered on their opening series with a 53-yard scoring drive, capped by a 16-yard cross-field throwback pass from Tommie Frazier to Lawrence Phillips. The Gators blocked the Huskers' extra point, and Nebraska led 6–3. Late in the period, Florida went back ahead on a short 1-yard sneak from Wuerffel and led 10–6. [...] As the Gators scored, CBS' Terry Donahue stated, [...] "Nebraska better not <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> behind." [...] The Huskers then put the game out of reach with a 29-point explosion in the second quarter, making it 35–10 at the half.|$|E

2500|$|... 19 September 1903 Scientific American {{reported}} Whitehead made {{powered glider}} flights in a triplane machine towed by an assistant pulling a rope: [...] "By {{running with the}} machine against the wind after the motor had been started, the aeroplane was made to skim along above the ground at heights of from 3 to 16 feet for a distance, without the operator touching, of about 350 yards. It was possible to have traveled a much longer distance, without the operator touching terra firma, but for the operator's desire not to <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> above it. Although the motor was not developing its full power, owing to the speed not exceeding 1,000 R.P.M., it developed sufficient to move the machine against the wind." [...] The article said a [...] two-cycle motor powered a two-bladed [...] diameter tractor propeller. The engine shown in the article was exhibited by Whitehead at the Second Annual Exhibit of the Aero Club of America in December 1906.|$|E
2500|$|The {{team was}} {{returning}} from a European Cup match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, having eliminated Red Star Belgrade {{to advance to the}} semi-finals of the competition. The flight stopped to refuel in Munich because a non-stop flight from Belgrade to Manchester was beyond the [...] "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador's range. After refuelling, pilots James Thain and Kenneth Rayment twice abandoned take-off because of boost surging in the left engine. Fearing they would <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> behind schedule, Captain Thain rejected an overnight stay in Munich in favour of a third take-off attempt. By then, snow was falling, causing a layer of slush to form {{at the end of the}} runway. After the aircraft hit the slush, it ploughed through a fence beyond the end of the runway and the left wing was torn off after hitting a house. Fearing the aircraft might explode, Thain began evacuating passengers while Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg helped pull survivors from the wreckage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack was}} finally {{launched}} on 10 May. By 14 May, Guderian and Hoth {{had crossed the}} Meuse and had broken open the Allied front. As planned, the British and French had advanced into Belgium to meet Bock's offensive, and {{were in danger of}} being cut off there by a German thrust to the sea. Both Hitler and Rundstedt had doubts about the safety of allowing the armoured corps to <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> ahead of their infantry support, however. Hitler sent the {{chief of staff of the}} Armed Forces Supreme Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, OKW), General Wilhelm Keitel, to Rundstedt's headquarters, to urge caution. In Halder's words, Hitler was [...] "frightened by his own success... afraid to take any chance." [...] Guderian objected vehemently to being ordered to halt, and Rundstedt was forced to mediate between Hitler and his impetuous armoured commanders, who were backed by Halder. By 20 May, Guderian's tanks had reached the sea at Abbeville and closed the trap on the British and French, who were already in retreat to the English Channel ports.|$|E
