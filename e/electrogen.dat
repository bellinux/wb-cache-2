40|$|Palm {{oil mill}} {{effluent}} (POME) is an organic waste material produced at the oil palm mills. In its raw form, POME is highly polluting {{due to its}} high content of biological (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). In this context, treatment of wastewater using MFC (Microbial fuel cell) seems to be promising technology because it reduces operation energy requirement and shows efficient treatment too. In the present work, MFC with POME were used to study the effect of different electrode materials and to harvest high power density (PD) using controlled inoculum. Three different electrode materials such as PACF (Polyacrylonitrile carbon felt), SFCC (Single forward carbon cloth) and GR (Graphite rod) were used as anode and cathode materials for the MFC experiments. Among the raw POME and different concentrations of POME used, the PACF, SFCC with raw POME (60600 mg/L) showed the maximum power density (PD) of about 45 mW/m 2 and 102. 50 mW/m 2 respectively but both PACF and SFCC showed low coulombic efficiency (CE) of about 0. 8 % and 2. 2 % respectively as well as low COD removal efficiency of about 45 % and 54. 45 % respectively. The PACF and SFCC MFC with 1 : 50 dilution (964 mg/L) showed higher COD removal efficiency of about 70 % and 78 % respectively and also CE of about 24 % and 51 % respectively but showed low PD of about 22 mW/rn 2 and 28. 48 mW/m 2 respectively. While, GR with raw POME showed very low PD, CE and COD removal efficiency of about 11. 238 MW/M 2, 0. 2 % and 28 % respectively. Predominant microbes from anaerobic sludge (AS) were successfully isolated and identified as Pseudomonas aeroginousa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas viridiivida, Acetinobacter schindleri, Actinobacillus capsulatus and Brevibacterium paucivoransusing BIOLOG gene III analysis. Biofilm formation on electrode surface was analyzed using Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis. Biofilm was characterized using PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction - denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis and sequencing and identified the predominant microbes in biofllm which includes Azospiraoryzae, Acetobacterperoxydans and Solimonasvariicoloris. The electrochemical activities have been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the final experiment, MFCs inoculated with controlled inoculum (CI) and POME as substrate. The CI was made using the microorganisms which are adapted and grown in palm oil mill effluent. CI was the mixture of fermentative and electrogenic microorganisms. It consists of <b>electrogen</b> (Pseudomonas aeroginousa) from AS and - fermentative microorganisms (Azospiraoryzae, Acetobacterperoxydans, Solimonasvariicoloris) from biofilm since no <b>electrogen</b> found in biofllm. The MFC operated with CI reached the maximum power density of 107. 35 mW/rn 2, which was two times higher as compared to MFC operated with AS as inoculum. The maximum CE of 74 % was achieved from the MFC with CI, which was 50 % higher than the CE with AS. But, it showed lower COD removal efficiency of about 32 %, which {{might be due to}} the absence of required fermentative microorganisms in CI to utilize POME. EIS and the simulated results showed the reduction of charge transfer resistance (Rct) by 19. 5 % during the operation of the cell with CI. These results demonstrate that the power output of MFCs can be increased using CI...|$|E
40|$|A crucial aspect for the {{application}} of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) as a wastewater treatment technology is the efficient oxidation of complex substrates by the bioanode, which is reflected in high Coulombic efficiency (CE). To achieve high CE, it is essential to give a competitive advantage to <b>electrogens</b> over methanogens. Factors that affect CE in bioanodes are, amongst others, the type of wastewater, anode potential, substrate concentration and pH. In this paper, we focus on acetate as a substrate and analyze the competition between methanogens and <b>electrogens</b> from a thermodynamic and kinetic point of view. We reviewed experimental data from earlier studies and propose that low substrate loading in combination with a sufficiently high anode overpotential plays a key-role in achieving high CE. Low substrate loading is a proven strategy against methanogenic activity in large-scale reactors for sulfate reduction. The combination of low substrate loading with sufficiently high overpotential is essential because it results in favorable growth kinetics of <b>electrogens</b> compared to methanogens. To achieve high current density in combination with low substrate concentrations, it is essential to have a high specific anode surface area. New reactor designs with these features are essential for BESs to be successful in wastewater treatment in the future. View Full-Text Keywords: Coulombic efficiency; BES; MET; methanogen...|$|R
40|$|To {{create an}} {{efficient}} bioelectrochemical system, a high Coulombic efficiency is required. This efficiency {{is a direct}} measure for the competition between <b>electrogens</b> and methanogens when acetate is used as substrate. In this study the Coulombic efficiency in a microbial electrolysis cell was investigated. As {{a result of an}} increase in substrate concentration from 1 to 35 mM, the current density increased to 21. 1 A/m(2), while the Coulombic efficiency decreased to 52 %. As a result of an increase in anode potential from - 450 to - 0. 250 mV, the current density increased to 20. 9 A/m(2), while the Coulombic efficiency increased 21 %. Knowledge about the substrate affinity and growth kinetics is crucial to control the Coulombic efficiency. Further research is required to optimize strategies to find a balance between the Coulombic efficiency, current density and removal rate of organic material...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} of cellulosic wastes make them attractive {{source of energy}} for producing electricity in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, electricity production from cellulose requires obligate anaerobes that can degrade cellulose and transfer electrons to the electrode (exoelectrogens), and thus most previous MFC {{studies have been conducted}} using two-chamber systems to avoid oxygen contamination of the anode. Single-chamber, air-cathode MFCs typically produce higher power densities than aqueous catholyte MFCs and avoid energy input for the cathodic reaction. To better understand the bacterial communities that evolve in single-chamber air-cathode MFCs fed cellulose, we examined the changes in the bacterial consortium in an MFC fed cellulose over time. The most predominant bacteria shown to be capable electron generation was Firmicutes, with the fermenters decomposing cellulose Bacteroidetes. The main genera developed after extended operation of the cellulose-fed MFC were cellulolytic strains, fermenters and <b>electrogens</b> that included: Parabacteroides, Proteiniphilum, Catonella and Clostridium. These results demonstrate that different communities evolve in air-cathode MFCs fed cellulose than the previous two-chamber reactors...|$|R
40|$|The globe {{is facing}} various {{challenges}} {{arising from the}} increase of population and change of consumer habits. Electricity and pure water are essential for modern societies, and technologies to ensure their availability must be developed. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are devices {{which can be used}} to generate electricity from wastes and wastewaters using microbial metabolism. In this study two different application fields of MFCs were experimented: 1) the degradation of tetrathionate to yield electricity and 2) the optimal MFC start-up strategies when using forest industry wastewaters as substrate. The capabilities of extreme acidophiles Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Ferroplasma acidiphilum to degrade tetrathionate and generate electricity from simulated mining industry wastewater were studied in aerobic batch cultivations and in anaerobic two-chamber MFCs. Tetrathionate was readily degraded in aerobic cultivations by A. ferrooxidans, whereas no degradation by F. acidiphilum was observed. Tetrathionate was not degraded and electricity generation was minimal in MFCs inoculated with {{one or both of the}} cultures, most likely due to insufficient mixing and low biomass in the MFCs. Different MFC start-up strategies were evaluated with air-cathode MFCs using simulated forest industry wastewater as substrate. Four strategies were compared: gradually decreasing external resistance from 5000 Ω to 50 Ω on weekly basis, stable low external resistance (50 Ω), controlled high anode potential (0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl), and controlled low anode potential (- 450 mV vs. Ag/AgCl). Controlled high anode potential started MFC produced the highest maximal and average current densities during the start-up (38 days), 72 A/m 3 and 14 A/m 3, respectively. Controlled low anode potential was the least successful method with 0. 17 A/m 3 average current density during the start-up. Chemical oxygen demand increased during the start-up, likely due to solubilisation of organic matter from the inoculum, but started to decrease in all MFCs as they were subjected to 47 Ω external resistance. This study suggests that A. ferrooxidans was the observed tetrathionate degrading microorganism but its role as an <b>electrogen</b> in the MFC experiments needs further verification. Controlled high anode potential was found the most recommendable MFC start-up method, considering the current and power production, when using forest industry wastewater as the substrate...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are {{promising}} for generating bioenergy and treating organic waste simultaneously. However, low extracellular electron transfer (EET) efficiency between <b>electrogens</b> and anodes {{remains one of}} the major bottlenecks in practical applications of MFCs. In this paper, pyocyanin (PYO) synthesis pathway was manipulated to improve the EET efficiency in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-inoculated MFCs. By overexpression of phzM (methyltransferase encoding gene), the maximum power density of P. aeruginosa-phzM-inoculated MFC was enhanced to 166. 68 mu W/cm(2), which was four folds of the original strain. In addition, the phzM overexpression strain exhibited an increase of 1. 6 folds in PYO production and about a onefold decrease in the total internal resistance than the original strain, which should underlie the enhancement of the EET efficiency and the electricity power output (EPT). On the basis of these results, the manipulation of electron shuttles synthesis pathways could be an efficient approach to improve the EPT of MFCs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{hydrogen}} are produced worldwide, which are nearly all from fossil origin. Use of biomass instead {{of fossil fuels}} to produce hydrogen can contribute to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the hydrogen has to be produced at high yield and efficiency. A Microbial Electrolysis Cell is a new technology that is able to produce hydrogen at high yield and efficiency in one step from biomass by addition of {{only a small amount}} of energy. The energy that needs to be added to produce hydrogen is determined by the internal resistance of the system, which can be divided into the different components of the system and presented as an equivalent circuit. These partial internal resistances were used to explain the difference in performance of Microbial Electrolysis Cells equipped with cation and anion exchange membranes. The better performance of the anion exchange membrane configuration was caused mainly by the much lower internal resistance due to the transport resistance of ions. The hydrogen production rate is determined by conversion rate of substrate and the coulombic efficiency of this conversion. The current density and coulombic efficiency was influenced by chancing the mass and charge transport in porous electrodes. Increase of a forced flow speed through the porous electrodes led to an increase in current density when the flow was directed away from the membrane caused by a decrease in anode resistance. Furthermore, the increase in flow speed led to an increase of the coulombic efficiency. The coulombic efficiency can also be influenced by changing the substrate concentration and the anode potential. It was shown that a higher anode potential increased the energy available for these <b>electrogens</b> and in that way they could outcompete the methanogens. Furthermore, also a lower substrate concentration made it possible for the <b>electrogens</b> to outcompete the methanogens. Finally, a system was developed that makes it possible to recycle alkalinity from waste streams in an extra recovery compartment and to produce the same current without addition of expensive buffer. In the future, improvement of the following three key characteristics can make Microbial Electrolysis Cells a competing technology for the production of hydrogen gas from biomass. Firstly, the coulombic efficiency needs to be controlled and improved to reach values close to 100 % for all possible organic substrates. Secondly, the use of materials and the design should be such that the total internal resistance does not exceed values of 30 mΩ m 2. Thirdly, the use of added chemicals like buffers should be limited, as the relative productivity does not increase with increasing use of chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are an {{evolving}} technology {{built around the}} idea of treating waste water while simultaneously generating a sustained power output. A large focus {{has been placed on}} known <b>electrogens</b> such as Shewanella oneidensis and Geobacter sulfurreducens, while very little is understood about how species interact together in a microbial community. While inoculating MFCs with naturally occurring communities is one method of studying fuel cells, this work took a different approach and attempted to build a synthetic community based upon a naturally occurring community. This will be important in the future of MFCs since being able to tailor a community to the influent feed will theoretically allow a more efficient use of the substrates and a higher level of treatment to be achieved. The synthetic community was made up of 5 different species, modelled on a naturally occurring microbial community. This was carried out through a number of single species, dual-species and 5 -species MFC experiments. This will allow the electrogenic ability and the community’s ability to treat wastewater to be compared between single species and communities. The single-species MFCs demonstrated the electrogenic potential of three previously unstudied species. It was also observed that the single species MFCs produced higher power than the dual-species and 5 -species communities. This contradicts the commonly held view that as biodiversity increases, power output increases. In the dual-community MFCs, a trend emerged where the species which produced the highest power outputs were associated with MFCs containing a fermentative species and an anaerobic respirator, while the lowest powers were observed in dual-cultures made up of two fermentative species. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the studied species did not produce extracellular mediators and the electrogenic activity occurred in the biofilm. It was also shown that as the biodiversity of the community increased, so did the level of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, with the 5 -species community achieving the highest COD removal of 90...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are {{electrochemical}} devices that exploit {{the ability of}} certain microorganisms to anaerobically respire using an insoluble terminal electron acceptor and therefore generate an electrical current. These bacteria are called <b>electrogens</b> or electrogenic bacteria. Two species of Arcobacter, Arcobacter butzleri ED- 1 and Arcobacter L were isolated from the anodic chamber of an acetate fed MFC, and A. butzleri ED- 1 {{was found to be}} the more electrogenic of the two bacteria. Arcobacter spp. are  proteobacteria and A. butzleri ED- 1 and Arcobacter L were the first example of electrogenically active e proteobacteria. It was decided to study their interactions with the anode by fluorescent microscopy and study their electrogenic mechanisms by comparative proteomics using the iTRAQ method as it would allow for simultaneous identification and quantification of peptides in multiple samples. Fluorescent imaging over a period of 120 h in a half MFC showed that both A. butzleri ED- 1 and Arcobacter L formed a thin anodic biofilm of a few cells thick and that A. butzleri ED- 1 maintained a more stable anodic biofilm than Arcobacter L. iTRAQ analysis showed that the flagellin FlaA was up-regulated 2. 4 fold at the anode but no other electron transport proteins or adhesins were upregulated. These results were distinct from those observed for other electrogenic bacteria (Geobacter sulfurreducens and Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1) in previous studies which exhibited up-regulated electron transport proteins at the anode as well as forming an anodic biofilm of 50 μm thick. Therefore based on these results it was concluded that FlaA was most likely playing an important role A. butzleri ED- 1 anode biofilm formation and that the mechanisms of electrogenesis in A. butzleri ED- 1 and Arcobacter L may be novel compared to those previously characterised. It was also concluded that one possible reason for A. butzleri ED- 1 being more electrogenic than Arcobacter L was its ability to form a more stable anodic biofilm. It must be noted that both of these conclusions are highly speculative and further study is needed to elucidate the electrogenic mechanisms of A. butzleri ED- 1 and to further compare biofilm formation between the two species...|$|R
