40|$|The nuclear {{industry}} {{is interested in}} automating the calibration of process instrumentation channels; this report provides key results {{of one of the}} sponsored projects to determine the validity of automated calibrations. Conclusion is that the normal outputs of instrument channels in nuclear plants can be monitored over a fuel cycle while the plant is operating to determine calibration drift in the field sensors and associated signal conversion and signal conditioning equipment. The procedure for on-line calibration tests involving calculating the deviation of each <b>instrument</b> <b>channel</b> from the best estimate of the process parameter that the instrument is measuring. Methods were evaluated for determining the best estimate. Deviation of each signal from the best estimate is updated frequently while the plant is operating and plotted vs time for entire fuel cycle, thereby providing time history plots that can reveal channel drift and other anomalies. Any <b>instrument</b> <b>channel</b> that exceeds allowable drift or channel accuracy band is then scheduled for calibration during a refueling outage or sooner. This provides calibration test results at the process operating point, {{one of the most critical}} points of the channel operation. This should suffice for most narrow-range instruments, although the calibration of some instruments can be verified at other points throughout their range.

40|$|The Venus Emission Mapper (VEM) {{instrument}} suite {{consists of}} two channels – VEM-M and VEM-H. VEM-M is a multispectral infrared imager with strong heritage from the MERTIS instrument on BepiColombo, while VEM-H is high-resolution, nadir-pointing, infrared spectrometer with strong heritage from SOIR on VenusExpress. VEM-M can provide global compositional data on rock types, weathering, and crustal evolution by mapping the Venus surface in five atmospheric windows. We use additional filters {{for the removal of}} clouds, water, and stray light. VEM-M leverages the approach pioneered by VIRTIS on Venus Express that used narrow-band atmospheric windows, but with an order of magnitude higher sensitivity and fuller spectral and spatial coverage. VEM-H will be dedicated to extremely high-resolution atmospheric measurements. The main objective of the VEM-H channel is to detect and quantify SO 2, H 2 O and HDO in the lower atmosphere, to enable characterisation of volcanic plumes released from the surface of Venus. VEM-H is observing through the 1 μm, 1. 7 μm, and 2 - 2. 3 μm atmospheric windows, where viewing the lower atmosphere is possible. VEM-H complements VEM-M by providing information one Venus' surface and near-surface activity. VEM follows a highly integrate payload concept. Both <b>instrument</b> <b>channels</b> will use a common MERTIS derived instrument controller and power supply unit and will be integrated in a common housing. Due to the different optical requirements the <b>instrument</b> <b>channels</b> use separate apertures and optics that allow maximizing the performance while giving only a marginal mass penalty. In the combination of both channels VEM will provide unprecedented insights into the current state and the evolution of Venus. VEM will perform a comprehensive search for volcanic activity by targeting atmospheric signatures, thermal signatures and compositional signatures. It will provide a map of the surface composition that will help us to understand the geology of Venus. This mapping will also enable a more informed landing site selection for future missions to Venus...|$|R
