30|$|In recent years, {{techniques}} for measuring gravitational potential fields have evolved from static to dynamic methods, and measurement instruments have also gradually advanced from ground measurement systems to aerial and satellite measurement systems. As the second derivative of the gravitational potential, the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> can satisfactorily reflect a high-frequency density change and help increase {{the resolution of}} the density structure. Full tensor of the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> can effectively help increase the amount of observation data. <b>Gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> data can reflect the shape and size of an underground anomalous body from various perspectives. While there are many components of the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient,</b> the inversion solution is non-unique. To constrain the non-unique problem of <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> data inversion, seismic data are introduced, which, together with the multiple components of the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient,</b> are subjected to a joint inversion to reduce the non-uniqueness of the inversion solution. In this study, based on a high-resolution P-wave velocity structure obtained from seismic tomography, a 3 D initial density model is constructed for the lithosphere in the NCC based on the empirical velocity–density conversion relation for North China. The GOCE satellite <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> data are processed. Considering that the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect is a comprehensive reflection of a myriad of factors and non-unique problem, the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect caused by the topographic relief at each underground layer interface is eliminated. In addition, by fully considering that the density distribution in the lithosphere is primarily collectively affected by its internal temperature and composition, the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect caused by the internal temperature of the lithosphere is also eliminated. Separation of the temperature effects from the residual <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> anomalies provides constraints of the density changes due to variations in lithosphere and mantle composition. Thus, the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> effect caused by the non-uniform matter density distribution is obtained. Based on the anomalous <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> components obtained, the preconditioned conjugate gradient inversion algorithm was adopted to calculate the horizontal density structure in the NCC. Because the Lagrange empirical parameter in the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) inversion algorithm exhibits uncertainty in data inversion, this algorithm is improved. The distribution of the density structure at various depths in the NCC is obtained through inversion and is analysed and interpreted based on the available geological and geophysical data.|$|R
30|$|The <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> tensors are not {{sensitive}} to the density variation vertically, and the lithospheric horizontal density variation is what we really concerned about. Therefore, we have to reduce the other known <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> anomalies that can {{be determined by the}} other reliable measures. As the layer interface undulation data can be determined by the seismic wave velocity data, the topographical data determined by the other methods can meet the higher resolution, which are more reliable. Therefore, we adopted these established interface models (CRUST 1.0, ETOPO 1) and reduced the corresponding <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> anomaly effect from the corrected <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> data.|$|R

50|$|Another {{method for}} {{achieving}} three-axis stabilization {{is to use}} electrically powered reaction wheels, also called momentum wheels, which are mounted on three orthogonal axes aboard the spacecraft. They provide a means to trade angular momentum {{back and forth between}} spacecraft and wheels. To rotate the vehicle on a given axis, the reaction wheel on that axis is accelerated in the opposite direction. To rotate the vehicle back, the wheel is slowed. Excess momentum that builds up in the system due to external torques from, for example, solar photon pressure or <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients,</b> must be occasionally removed from the system by applying controlled torque to the spacecraft to allowing the wheels to return to a desired speed under computer control. This is done during maneuvers called momentum desaturation or momentum unload maneuvers. Most spacecraft use a system of thrusters to apply the torque for desaturation maneuvers. A different approach was used by the Hubble Space Telescope, which had sensitive optics that could be contaminated by thruster exhaust, and instead used magnetic torquers for desaturation maneuvers.|$|E

40|$|The Gravity {{field and}} {{steady-state}} Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) is the European Space Agency's (ESA) satellite gravity mission {{to determine the}} Earth's mean gravity field. GOCE delivers <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients,</b> anew type of satellite data. We study how these data can improve modeling of the Earth's lithosphere. We discuss {{the use of the}} original GOCE <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> versus the use of <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> in grids at satellite altitude or close the Earth's surface and conclude that grids are easier to handle than the original data because one does not have to deal with very different error characteristics of the different gradients, given in a rotating frame at varying heights. The downward continuation to the surface enhances signaland better reflects the near-surface geology. But this does not outweigh the amplification of noise and omission errors, which is why we recommend using the field at mean satellite altitude for lithospheric modeling. The North-East Atlantic region is ideal to analyze the additional value of GOCE <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> because it is a well-studied region in terms of regional geophysics. We calculated the gradient sensitivity for crustal depth slices using a 3 D lithospheric model. This reveals that especially interfaces with large density contrasts have a distinct signal in the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients,</b> but that they are quite insensitive to intra-crustal density sources, which can have quite a large effect on surface gravity data. We also show thatthe satellite gradients have a depth sensitivity well suited to study the upper mantle density structure, making them complementary to gravity and seismic tomography. In the underexplored Rub'al-Khaliarea the GOCE vertical gradient was used to invert for crustal thickness. The updated Moho model givesa good fit to four of the six gradients and independent depths from seismic stations. The Moho modelwas used to update the heat flow model and source rock maturity maps, which are generally consistent with known source rock maturity trends in the surrounding regions. GOCE gradients are therefore usefulto map crustal thickness and deep regional structures for frontier areas. In combination with other data, heat flow can be modeled which is essential for basin maturity evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
