Methods for simulating the effect of impulse disturbances on a discrete multitone system are first presented, and actual measured noise bursts are then used for the simulations as if they were deterministic signals, in order to characterize their effects on ADSL systems. It is shown that while a combination of coding, interleaving, and 6 -dB margin is adequate in protecting ADSL systems from isolated impulses, an impulse train with long duration will cause a significant number of error bits in the system. In this case, a tradeoff among the number of error seconds, the maximum reach, and the coding delay must be made.

40|$|Abstract: The second {{generation}} of Very-High Speed <b>Digital</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Lines</b> (VDSL 2) represents a modern high-speed solution for present last-mile access networks. However, the transmission performance of VDSL 2 lines is heavily dependent on the real conditions of symmetrical pairs and quads in local metallic lines and cables. One of the frequent elements in metallic access networks, which can negatively influence the transmission performance of modern digital systems, is bridged taps. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} influence of bridged taps on transmission capacity of VDSL 2 lines by using ABCD matrices. Thanks to that, the simulations can be performed for various scenarios and amounts of bridged taps and their parameters by simply cascading necessary matrices.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the multiuser power control {{problem in a}} frequency-selective interference channel. The interference channel is modeled as a noncooperative game, and the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium are established for a two-player version of the game. An iterative water-filling algorithm is proposed to efficiently reach the Nash equilibrium. The iterative water-filling algorithm can be implemented distributively {{without the need for}} centralized control. It implicitly takes into account the loop transfer functions and cross couplings, and it reaches a competitively optimal power allocation by offering an opportunity for loops to negotiate the best use of power and frequency with each other. When applied to the upstream power backoff problem in very-high bit-rate <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> and the downstream spectral compatibility problem in asymmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines,</b> the new power control algorithm is found to give a significant performance improvement when compared with existing methods...|$|R
30|$|The {{discrete}} multitone (DMT) modulation/demodulation {{scheme is}} the standard transmission technique {{in the application of}} asymmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> (ADSL) and very-high-speed <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> (VDSL). Although the DMT can achieve higher data rate compared with other modulation/demodulation schemes, its computational complexity is too high for cost-efficient implementations. For example, it requires 512 -point IFFT/FFT as the modulation/demodulation kernel in the ADSL systems and even higher in the VDSL systems. The large block size results in heavy computational load in running programmable digital signal processors (DSPs). In this paper, we derive computationally efficient fast algorithm for the IFFT/FFT. The proposed algorithm can avoid complex-domain operations that are inevitable in conventional IFFT/FFT computation. The resulting software function requires less computational complexity. We show that it acquires only 17 % number of multiplications to compute the IFFT and FFT compared with the Cooly-Tukey algorithm. Hence, the proposed fast algorithm is very suitable for firmware development in reducing the MIPS count in programmable DSPs.|$|R
