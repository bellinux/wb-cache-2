40|$|Abstract — <b>Distribution</b> <b>factors</b> play a {{key role}} in many system {{security}} analysis and market applications. The injection shift factors (ISFs) are the basic factors that serve as building blocks of the other <b>distribution</b> <b>factors.</b> The line outage <b>distribution</b> <b>factors</b> (LODFs) may be computed using the ISFs and, in fact, may be iteratively evaluated when more than one line outage is considered. The prominent role of cascading outages in recent black-outs has created a need in security applications for evaluating LODFs under multiple-line outages. In this letter, we present an analytic, closed-form expression for and the computationally efficient evaluation of LODFs under multipleline outages.

The SH- 52 Bridge over the Snake River is located on the Idaho-Oregon border near Payette, Idaho. The bridge was built in the 1950 ’s and presently supports two lanes of traffic. A finite-element model of the bridge was calibrated with the results from a liveload test. For the live-load test, the bridge was instrumented at nine longitudinal cross section locations with 62 strain gauges attached on the girders, stringers, and intermediate diaphragms. The live-load was applied with two heavy trucks that were driven along three predetermined load paths. The calibrated finite-element model was used to quantify moment <b>distribution</b> <b>factors</b> and load ratings for the bridge. The finite-element <b>distribution</b> <b>factors</b> were compared to those calculated according to the AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Specifications.

5000|$|In power engineering, {{winding factor}} is a {{technique}} that is employed to improve the rms generated voltage or emf in a three-phase AC electrical machine so that the output voltage and hence torque {{does not have any}} harmonics in it which may reduce efficiency. This is because the armature winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the emf induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called <b>distribution</b> <b>factor</b> Kd. Another factor that can reduce the winding factor is when the slot pitch is smaller than the pole pitch, called pitch factor Kp. The winding factor can be calculated as Kw = Kd * Kp To calculate the winding factor, Kw=Kd X Kp [...] ----(1) Where Kd=~1 (point here {{to keep in mind is}} that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems.

40|$|Abstract—In the {{locational}} {{marginal price}} (LMP) -based congestion management scheme, transmission customers face {{uncertainty in the}} congestion charges they incur. In order to bring certainty to customers, congestion revenue rights (CRR) such as the fixed transmission rights (FTR) used in the PJM interconnection and flowgate rights (FGR) are introduced. These CRR are financial tools that provide the holder reimbursement of the congestion charges incurred in the day-ahead market. The implementation of CRR requires appropriate modeling of the transmission network in which the <b>distribution</b> <b>factors</b> are extensively used. These factors—the injection shift factors (ISFs) and the power transfer <b>distribution</b> <b>factors</b> (PTDFs) —are linear approximations of the sensitivities of the active power line flows with respect to various variables. The factors are computed for a specified network topology and parameter values. In practice, the PTDFs used for the CRR issuance may be different from those used in the day-ahead market due {{to changes in the}} forecasted network conditions. The PTDF errors may impact the FTR issuance quantities, the revenue adequacy of the FTR issuer and the hedging ability of the FGR. In this paper, we explore analytical characteristics of these <b>distribution</b> <b>factors</b> and investigate their role in CRR applications. We study the nature of the PTDF errors and examine their impacts in these applications, both analytically and experimentally. Our results indicate that the impacts of the PTDF errors in CRR applications stay in an acceptable range under a broad spectrum of conditions including contingencies used to establish 1 security.
