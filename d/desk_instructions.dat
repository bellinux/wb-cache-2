40|$|This design {{compliance}} matrix document provides specific design related functional characteristics, constraints, {{and requirements}} for the container filling system {{that is part of}} the nested, fixed-depth sampling system. This document addresses performance, external interfaces, ALARA, Authorization Basis, environmental and design code {{requirements for the}} container filling system. The container filling system will interface with the waste stream from the fluidic pumping channels of the nested, fixed-depth sampling system and will fill containers with waste that meet the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) criteria for waste that contains volatile and semi-volatile organic materials. The specifications for the nested, fixed-depth sampling system are described in a Level 2 Specification document (HNF- 3483, Rev. 1). The basis for this design compliance matrix document is the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) <b>desk</b> <b>instructions</b> for design Compliance matrix documents (PI-CP- 008 - 00, Rev. 0) ...|$|E
40|$|Routine {{engineering}} support is required during normal {{operation of the}} core sampler trucks and associated ancillary equipment. This {{engineering support}} consists of, but is not limited to, troubleshooting operation problems, correcting minor design problems, assistance with work package preparation, assistance with procurement, fabrication shop support, planning of engineering tasks and preparation of associated Engineering Task Plans (ETP) and Engineering Service Requests (ESR). This ETP is the management plan document for implementing routine engineering support. Any additional changes to {{the scope of this}} ETP shall require a Letter of Instruction from Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp (LMHC). This document will also be the Work Planning Document for Development Control (HNF 1999 a). The scope of this task will be to provide routine engineering support for Characterization equipment as required to support Characterization Operations. A task by task decision will be made by management to determine which tasks will be done per this ETP and if additional ETPs and/or ESRs are required. Due to the unique nature of this task, the only identifiable deliverable is to provide support as requested. Deliverables will be recorded in a task logbook as activities are identified. ESRs will be generated for tasks that require more than 40 person hours to complete, per Characterization Engineering <b>Desk</b> <b>Instructions</b> (DI 1999 a) ...|$|E

40|$|The lesson event ‘Kikan-Shido’ (Between <b>Desks</b> <b>Instruction)</b> is used {{to compare}} {{different}} forms of guidance provided by teachers in mathematics classrooms across six cities. While Kikan-Shido had a recognizable structural form in all the mathematic classrooms in the data set, there was variation in both {{the amount of time}} devoted to Kikan-Shido and in the way individual mathematics teachers’ ‘Guided Student Activity’. In this paper, examples of individual teacher guidance are examined to draw out the subtleties of practice in three ‘Asian’ and three ‘Western’ classrooms. It is posited that differences in activity are related to specific pedagogical principles that appear to underlie the teachers’ practice. The occurrence of similarities in practice across apparent cultural categories problematises simplistic East-West comparative cultural analyses...|$|R
40|$|By {{examining}} classroom practice over {{sequences of}} ten lessons, the Learner’s Perspective Study provides {{data on the}} teacher’s and learners’ participation in the co-construction of the possible forms of participation through which classroom practice is constituted. The use of post-lesson video-stimulated interviews offers additional insight into participants’ intentions, actions and interpretations. This paper first postulates the existence of co-constructed whole class patterns of participation and then documents one such pattern of participation: Kikan-Shido (between <b>desks</b> <b>instruction),</b> both as it is enacted and as it is perceived by the classroom participants. In this case, the documented pattern of participation is also associated with a recognizable Lesson Event: Having a form that recurs in the mathematics classrooms of many countries, but serving {{a variety of different}} functions across those classrooms. This paper details the use of Kikan-Shido in three Australian classrooms, and makes comparison with it...|$|R

5000|$|The job's name {{is derived}} {{from the fact that the}} hotel's front desk clerk rang a bell to summon an employee, who would [...] "" [...] (jump) to {{attention}} at the <b>desk</b> to receive <b>instructions.</b> The term [...] "porter" [...] is used in the United Kingdom and much of the English-speaking world. [...] "Bellboy" [...] or [...] "bellhop" [...] is an American English term. This employee traditionally was a boy or adolescent male, hence the term bellboy. Today's bellhops must be quick-witted, good with people, and outgoing. Bellhops will meet a variety of different people each day and must have the social skills to deal with them. Duties often include opening the front door, moving luggage, valeting cars, calling cabs, transporting guests, giving directions, performing basic concierge work, and responding to the guest's needs. They must be able to escort guests into their rooms while carrying luggage, or help move any baggage a customer needs.|$|R

Katherine Watmough is the Access and Borrower Services Librarian at Thompson Rivers University in sunny Kamloops BC, Canada. She is a MLIS {{graduate}} of 2012 with a concentration in IT Management. Inside interests are institutional repositories and outside interests are motorcycles and tattoos!Ongoing training for staff in Access Services is difficult, {{especially when you}} have seasonal, part-time workers, 2 libraries and shift work hours {{in an environment where}} service points must be covered during operational hours. Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops BC, Canada has come up with an innovative way to have ongoing training for staff without sacrificing service or incurring extra cost with ‘all-staff’ workshops, which are impossible to arrange. Our pilot project on training Access Services staff for ready reference involves three modes of training: one on one training at the service <b>desk,</b> power point <b>instruction</b> that includes quizzes and quick tips; and lastly, instructional videos that can also be viewed during working shifts. By having three types of instructional methods we are able to reach a wide range of learning styles and have opportunities for practice and retention, with surveys to receive feedback. Staff will be measured before and after on knowledge, speed and skill...|$|R

Pereira, PhD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 33 pages, appendix p. 31 - 33. Background: Over the last century, physical activity has been systematically removed from {{our daily lives}} through automation, a trend that continues today, and {{this has led to}} Americans spending a majority of the waking hours in a sedentary state (very low energy expenditure state, such as sitting). This phenomenon is thought to have detrimental health effects such as excess weight gain, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. A new field has emerged that has started to focus on reducing inactive time during the waking hours by building in more light activity, known as non-exercise activity, throughout the day. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a non-exercise activity could be increased during workday by installing a sit-stand desk at work. Method: A randomized cross-over study was conducted in a Minneapolis office with 28 sedentary office workers who participated in a four week intervention period (used a sit-stand desk to replace 50 % of sitting time at work with standing) and a control period (usual sitting work environment), in random order, with a two week wash-out period (usual sitting, no measurement) in between. The intervention involved the installation of sit-stand work desks at each worker’s <b>desk</b> and ergonomic <b>instruction</b> for its use (Ergotron, Inc., St. Paul, MN). Results: Sedentary, computer-based, office workers replaced about 50 % of their sitting time with standing (p-value <. 0001). This intervention significantly increased activity during work hours (p-value <. 0001). It appears that the intervention resulted in about 35 minutes of sedentary time being replaced with non-sedentary time on a workday. Moreover, this intervention significantly decreased caloric intake (211 kilocalorie/day, p-value = 0. 01), despite the fact that instruction was given to maintain the same life-style during both periods of the study. Furthermore, this intervention significantly increased relaxation, calmness, energy, overall sense of well-being and Background: Over the last century, physical activity has been systematically removed from our daily lives through automation, a trend that continues today, and this has led to Americans spending a majority of the waking hours in a sedentary state (very low energy expenditure state, such as sitting).

Furthermore, this intervention significantly increased relaxation, calmness, energy, overall sense of well-being and decreased fatigue. The intervention turned out to be highly popular with over 96 % of the subjects enjoying the use of the sit-stand work station and 89 % choosing to have a sit-stand desk permanently installed at their work at the end of the study with the goal of standing a large portion of their workday. Discussion: Overall, a sit-stand desk appears to be a promising tool to reduce sedentary time at work. Given the proportion of waking hours spent at work, sit-stand desks may mitigate the health burden associated with sedentary lifestyles...|$|R
