25|$|Authorities in {{the witch}} trials {{routinely}} stripped an accused witch {{of clothing and}} shaved all body <b>hair</b> <b>so</b> that no potential mark could be hidden. Pins were driven into scars, calluses and thickened areas of skin: the practice of “pricking a witch”. Customarily, this routine was performed {{in front of a}} large crowd. Medieval inquisitors also believed that the Devil left invisible marks upon his followers. If after stripping and shaving, the accused witch was found to have no likely blemishes, pins were simply driven into her body until an insensitive area was found. The search for witches' marks had disappeared by 1700.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Christie {{worked in}} the {{pharmacy}} at University College Hospital, London, where she acquired a knowledge of poisons that she {{put to good use}} in her post-war crime novels. For example, the use of thallium as a poison was suggested to her by UCH Chief Pharmacist Harold Davis (later appointed Chief Pharmacist at the UK Ministry of Health), and in The Pale Horse, published in 1961, she employed it to dispatch a series of victims, the first clue to the murder method coming from the victims' loss of <b>hair.</b> <b>So</b> accurate was her description of thallium poisoning that on at least one occasion it helped solve a case that was baffling doctors.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Verona, Julia {{decides to}} join her lover in Milan. She convinces Lucetta to dress her in boy's clothes and help her fix her <b>hair</b> <b>so</b> {{she will not be}} harmed on the journey. Once in Milan, Julia quickly discovers Proteus' love for Silvia, {{watching}} him attempt to serenade her. She contrives to become his page boy – Sebastian – until she can decide upon a course of action. Proteus sends Sebastian to Silvia with a gift of the same ring that Julia gave to him before he left Verona, but Julia learns that Silvia scorns Proteus' affections and is disgusted that he would forget about his love back home, i.e. Julia herself. Silvia deeply mourns the loss of Valentine, who Proteus has told her is rumoured dead.|$|E
50|$|Melaleuca lasiandra {{is a large}} shrub {{or small}} tree growing to 8 m high with white or grey papery bark. The leaves have a narrow oval shape, a small pointed end and are 10-50 mm long and 1.5-10 mm wide. They are also very densely covered with fine <b>hairs</b> <b>so</b> that they appear silvery-grey.|$|R

50|$|Hieracium scabrum is an herb up to 60 cm {{tall with}} many <b>hairs</b> <b>so</b> that it feels rough to the touch. L leaves {{mostly on the}} stem {{with only a few}} at the bottom. Leaves are up to 120 mm long. One stalk can produce 5-50 flower heads in a conical or flat-topped array. Each head has 30-60 yellow ray flowers but no disc flowers.|$|R
25|$|Asterion, king of Crete, {{adopted the}} three sons of Zeus and Europa, Minos, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthus. According to the Odyssey {{he spoke with}} Zeus every nine years or for nine years. He got his laws {{straight}} from Zeus himself. When Minos' son Androgeos had won the Panathenaic Games the king, Aegeus, sent him to Marathon to fight a bull, resulting {{in the death of}} Androgeos. Outraged, Minos went to Athens to avenge his son, and on the way he camped at Megara where Nisos lived. Learning that Nisos' strength came from his hair, Minos gained the love of Scylla and her aid in cutting off her father's <b>hair</b> <b>so</b> that he could conquer the city. After his triumph, he punished Scylla for her treachery against her father by tying her to a boat and dragging her until she drowned. On arriving in Attica, he asked Zeus to punish the city, and the god struck it with plague and hunger. An oracle told the Athenians to meet any of Minos' demands if they wanted to escape the punishment. Minos then asked Athens to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every nine years to be sacrificed to the Minotaur, the offspring from the zoophilic encounter of Minos' wife Pasiphaë with a certain bull that the king refused to sacrifice to Poseidon, which he had placed within a labyrinth he commanded his architect Daedalus to build. The Minotaur was defeated by the hero Theseus with the help of Minos' daughter Ariadne.|$|E
500|$|The game uses {{graphics}} and animation as vehicles of characterization. Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario's demise. Pauline has a pink dress and long hair, and a speech balloon crying [...] "HELP!" [...] appears frequently beside her. Mario, depicted in red overalls {{and a red}} cap, is an everyman character, a type common in Japan. Graphical limitations and the low pixel resolution of the small sprites prompted his design: drawing a mouth was infeasible, so the character was given a mustache; the programmers could not animate <b>hair,</b> <b>so</b> he got a cap; and to make his arm movements visible, he needed colored overalls. The artwork used for the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon-like character designs even more explicit. Pauline, for example, is depicted to be disheveled (like King Kong Fay Wray) in a torn dress and stiletto heels.|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the three}} Presley singles {{released}} {{in the first half}} of 1957 went to number one: [...] "Too Much", [...] "All Shook Up", and [...] "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released. Under the headline [...] "Presley Records a Craze in Soviet", The New York Times reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad. Between film shoots and recording sessions, the singer also found time to purchase an 18-room mansion eight miles (13km) south of downtown Memphis for himself and his parents: Graceland. When he reported to the film studio for his second film, the Technicolor Loving You, released in July, [...] "The makeup man said that with his eyes he should photograph well with black <b>hair,</b> <b>so</b> they dyed it." [...] Loving You, the accompanying soundtrack, was Presley's third straight number one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the Jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his [...] "good-luck charm".|$|E

500|$|Early in the {{development}} of XIII, Serah {{was meant to be a}} playable character, but was eventually delegated to a supporting character because of technical issues. Tetsuya Nomura, in an interview, said that he designed Serah's <b>hair</b> <b>so</b> that her silhouette would mirror Lightning's. For XIII-2, the developers decided to change Serah and Lightning's roles, with Serah becoming the game's main protagonist, while Lightning was the object of her quest. Yusuke Naora was told to design Serah's new costume like the [...] "plug suit" [...] outfits from Neon Genesis Evangelion and was asked to give her a necklace for plot reasons. Part of the challenge for the game was making Serah more active, but maintaining her femininity, which is the reason she was given a bow as her weapon. Another reason behind the design of her weapon was the fact that the developers wanted to give the characters means to attack both up close and at long range. Aside from Naora's design, Yuko Oshima of AKB48 was asked to design two potential DLC outfits for Serah: a black combat outfit titled [...] "Exposure and Defense" [...] (later retitled [...] "Style and Steel"), and a second red-and-white outfit titled [...] "Little Red Riding Hood", meant to be indicative of Serah's change into an adult. After a popular vote, the former costume was chosen and released in April 2012. Serah is voiced by Laura Bailey in English and by Minako Kotobuki in Japanese.|$|E
2500|$|Scott {{also asked}} {{everyone}} {{not to touch}} their <b>hair</b> <b>so</b> that he could give everyone a different look. [...] Prior to Scott's arrival, series producers sent him a reel showing the actors' hair styles from the previous three seasons. [...] He commented and made suggestions about the actors' hair.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 1951, by {{the power}} of the now-abolished law of contravention, police {{officers}} could grab men with long hairdo and use scissors to cut the men's long <b>hair.</b> <b>So</b> applied to mini-skirts, Hawaii shirts, [...] flared trousers, or other clothes of the men or women with irregular dressing. On 5 February 1972, Taipei City Police Department even launched a mass-detainment against people who dressed like hippies.|$|E

50|$|The corpse was {{partially}} unwrapped by Gaston Maspero on 27 June 1886; twenty years later, G. Elliot Smith removed {{the remainder of}} the wrappings. Neskhons did not have any gray <b>hairs,</b> <b>so</b> it is likely that she died young; according to Smith, she was either pregnant or giving birth at her death. The gold decoration of her coffin has been stolen in antiquity; her heart scarab was stolen by the Abd-el-Rassul family of grave robbers, but has been recovered and taken to the British Museum.|$|R
2500|$|They begin {{seeing each}} other, but Scottie remains obsessed with [...] "Madeleine", and asks Judy {{to change her}} clothes and <b>hair</b> <b>so</b> that she resembles Madeleine. After Judy complies, hoping that they may finally find {{happiness}} together, he notices her wearing the necklace portrayed in the painting of Carlotta, and realizes the truth, and that Judy had been Elster's mistress, before being cast aside just as Carlotta was. Scottie insists on driving Judy to the Mission.|$|E
2500|$|Many men in Western {{cultures}} shave their facial <b>hair,</b> <b>so</b> only {{a minority}} of men have a beard, even though fast-growing facial hair must be shaved daily to achieve a clean-shaven or hairless look. Some men shave because they cannot grow a [...] "full" [...] beard (generally defined as an even density from cheeks to neck), because their beard color is different from their scalp hair color, or because their facial hair grows in many directions, making a groomed look difficult. Some men shave because their beards are very coarse, causing itchiness and irritation. Some men grow a beard or moustache {{from time to time to}} change their appearance.|$|E
2500|$|... {{reports that}} the Reubenite On son of Peleth joined Korah's conspiracy, but the text does not mention On again. Rav {{explained}} that On's wife saved him, arguing to him that no matter whether Moses or Korah prevailed, On would remain just a disciple. On replied that he had sworn to participate. So On's wife got him drunk with wine, and laid him down in their tent. Then {{she sat at the}} entrance of their tent and loosened her <b>hair,</b> <b>so</b> that whoever came to summon him saw her and retreated {{at the sight of her}} immodestly loosened hair. The Gemara taught that [...] refers to On's wife when it says: [...] "Every wise woman builds her house."–10a1.|$|E
5000|$|Iresine heterophylla is a {{perennial}} herb up to 100 cm tall. Leaves are opposite, ovate, up to 6 cm long. Flowers {{are arranged in}} a rather large, branching panicle up to 40 cm long. Flowers are small, white to straw-colored, up to 4 cm across, covered in dense woolly hairs. Fruits are green, egg-shaped, usually less than 1 mm across, enclosed inside the persistent flower parts which are in turn enclosed in woolly <b>hairs,</b> <b>so</b> that the infructescence as a whole appears white and woolly.|$|R

2500|$|Konishi {{designed}} all the characters, {{making sure}} each main character had a distinctive silhouette for players to identify. Based on input from Atlus staff, Konishing made his character designs more refined. Both Stocke and Eruca were initially {{designed to be}} supporting characters, as {{at the time the}} protagonist was still to be a sword. After consulting with Atlus, the characters were made the main protagonists. Stocke was originally a plain-looking assassin dressed completely in black, described by Konishi as an amalgamation of typical [...] "cool" [...] character traits. When he became the main character, Konishi changed his color to red, reworked his <b>hair</b> <b>so</b> it did not cover his eyes, and made his uniform more militaristic. While it was considered to allow the player to rename Stocke, after multiple readthroughs of the script the team decided against it.|$|E
2500|$|Bryce {{signed his}} then-girlfriend, 20-year-old {{newcomer}} Linda Thorson, {{as the new}} female co-star and chose the name [...] "Tara King" [...] for her character. Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart; and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy and Emma, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and King. King also differed from Steed's previous partners in {{that she was a}} fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Thorson's brown hair was bleached. However the process badly damaged Thorson's <b>hair,</b> <b>so</b> she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode [...] "All Done with Mirrors".|$|E

50|$|A {{middle-aged man}} had two mistresses, {{one of whom}} was older than him, and one younger. Under the pretence of {{dressing}} his hair, the younger plucked out his grey <b>hairs</b> <b>so</b> that he would look closer in age to her, while the older plucked out the dark hairs with the same motive. Between the two, he was left bald. Some later versions of the fable have translated the title as if the women were wives or even fiancées. However, Greek texts call them courtesans (ἑταίρας) or lovers (ἐρωμένας) and the Neo-Latin poet Pantaleon Candidus refers to them as concubines in his version.|$|R
5000|$|Buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) {{perennials}} include lady's thumb (Bistorta bistortoides), {{a perennial}} growing from a contorted rhizome (underground stem). Butterballs, or oval-leaved buckwheat (Eriogonum ovalifolium), has leaves that cluster very tightly forming almost impenetrable mats or cushions on sandy or gravelly flats and in rocky soils, and grows to 12 in or 13000 ft elevation. Frosted wild buckwheat (E. incanum) is densely covered with white <b>hairs</b> <b>so</b> as to appear [...] "frosted", and grows to 13000 ft elevation. Lobb's wild buckwheat (E. lobbii), growing to 12000 ft, is sprawling and grows from a thick, woody stem, with flower stalks {{lying on the}} ground.|$|R
