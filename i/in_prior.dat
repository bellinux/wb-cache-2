The prediction {{was based}} on Vancouver's team depth, the offense provided by Daniel and Henrik Sedin, the two-way play of Kesler and Alexandre Burrows, plus the versatility of the Canuck's top four defenceman. The Hockey News predicted that the Canucks would win the Northwest Division and finish as the second place team in the Western Conference.|$|E

50|$|The good raw {{material}} supply ensured high capacity utilisation {{of the production}} plants during the entire fiscal year. Overall, a total of 2,057,000 t of concentrates (2,063,000 t <b>in</b> the <b>prior</b> year) were processed at the Hamburg and Pirdop sites. The sulphuric acid output decreased to 2,002,000 t (2,071,000 t <b>in</b> the <b>prior</b> year) due to the concentrate throughput. At 934,000 t (932,000 t <b>in</b> the <b>prior</b> year), the cathode output increased again. The operating EBT of Business Unit (BU) Primary Copper rose significantly to €169.5 million (€65.4 million <b>in</b> the <b>prior</b> year). This increase in earnings is especially attributed to the favourable market trend for copper and copper {{raw material}}s as well as sulphuric acid.|$|R

Estimates made by the government <b>in</b> <b>prior</b> decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 and gave a figure of 7,000,700 in 1854.

5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included <b>in</b> <b>prior</b> bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
5|$|Decay {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and timeframe as Half-Life. Half-Life takes place at a laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility, situated in a remote desert in New Mexico. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. Like the previous expansions, Decay shows the story of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different set of protagonists. In Decay, players assume the roles of Colette Green and Gina Cross, two doctors who work in the same labs as Freeman, analyzing anomalous materials and specimens retrieved from Xen <b>in</b> <b>prior</b> teleportation experiments. After the experiment that causes the alien invasion takes place, Green and Cross must work with two ranking members of the science team, Dr. Richard Keller and Dr. Rosenberg, to contain and stabilize the deteriorating situation in Black Mesa.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than <b>in</b> <b>prior</b> novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E

The new production methods resulting from the KRS-Plus unit commissioned in June were already apparent. The good supply of precious metal-bearing input materials allowed us to increase the quantity of recovered silver to 1,367 t (1,339 t <b>in</b> the <b>prior</b> year). The gold output decreased to 35 t (38 t <b>in</b> the <b>prior</b> year) due to the feed but was still at a high level.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>prior</b> cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E

A full voice version was released for Windows on September 24, 2004. Then on September 29, 2006, Snow: Plus Edition was released for Windows, sporting added parts from the console versions and introducing a new heroine. Snow is playable on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA cell phones. A PlayStation Portable version of the game called Snow: Portable was released by Prototype on August 16, 2007. The standard edition for Windows was released on July 25, 2008, containing two fan discs, and the content from the portable edition of Snow.

5|$|The combat that peasant men {{had engaged}} <b>in</b> <b>prior</b> to the revolt was {{restricted}} to the vicinity in which they lived. During armed conflicts, they would often fight for {{a short amount of}} days before returning to cultivate their lands, which remained their main preoccupation. When their service was needed, they were commanded by a local chief who in turn was subordinate to a regional leader. Most armed conflict revolved around the chiefs' bids for local influence and control or protection of villages from Bedouin plundering. There were also instances where peasant fighters would be assembled to back Ottoman authority in the face of local or external challengers, such as during the 1799 Napoleonic invasion, or against Ottoman authority when it interfered in the unofficial local autonomy that was enjoyed in the mountain regions. In most of the conflicts in which the peasant fighters participated, they fought alongside their kinsmen or neighbors.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aristocracy}} was becoming extremely rich. Several Italian towns had sided with Hannibal during the Second Punic War, and these towns were ultimately punished for their disloyalty, which opened {{up even more}} cheap farmland for the aristocrats. With the destruction of Rome's great commercial rival of Carthage, even more opportunities for profit became available. With so many new territories, tax collection (which had always been outsourced to private individuals) also became extremely profitable. While the aristocrats spent their time exploiting new opportunities for profit, Rome was conquering new civilizations in the east. These civilizations were often highly developed, and as such they opened up a world of luxury to the Romans. Up until this point, most Romans had only known a simple life, but as both wealth and eastern luxuries became available at the same time, an era of ruinous decadence followed. The sums that were spent on these luxuries had no precedent <b>in</b> <b>prior</b> Roman history. Several laws were enacted to stem this tide of decadence, but these laws had no effect, and attempts by the Censors to mitigate this decadence were equally futile.|$|E
