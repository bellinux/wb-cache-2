5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; the Republican <b>Guard</b> <b>is</b> the only {{component}} he trusts.

5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include two-factor authentication through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam <b>Guard</b> <b>is</b> enabled, the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|E
50|$|The Grenadier <b>Guards</b> <b>are</b> officially {{recognized}} as the most senior regiment of foot <b>guards,</b> although this <b>is</b> not recognized by the Coldstream <b>Guards,</b> who <b>are</b> an older regiment founded six years earlier. The older age of the Coldstream <b>Guards</b> <b>is</b> not {{recognized as}} seniority because they were formed to serve the Commonwealth and only served the English (later British) monarchy after the Stuart Restoration. On the other hand, the Grenadier <b>Guards</b> <b>were</b> formed {{a few years before}} the Restoration by Charles II while still in exile in the Spanish Netherlands (modern-day Belgium), so the Grenadier Guards have a longer service to the crown.|$|R
