5|$|The PlayStation project, SCEI's first {{official}} project, was finally given {{the green light}} by Sony <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> 1993 {{after a few years}} of development. Also in 1993, Phil Harrison, who would later become President of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, was recruited into SCEI to attract developers and publishers to produce games for their new PlayStation platform.|$|E
5|$|After Parker {{was hired}} to direct the film, Gerolmo had {{completed}} two drafts. Parker met with Gerolmo at Orion's offices in Century City, Los Angeles, where they began work on a third draft script. Both the writer and director however had repeated disagreements over {{the focus of the}} story. To resolve the issue, Orion <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> New York gave Parker one month to make uncredited rewrites before green-lighting the project.|$|E
5|$|Management Development Programmes (MDP) are {{tailor made}} {{programs}} to train <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> specific industry, government, and non-governmental organisations. These programs, which typically last {{three to five}} days, are customised by subject or target group. Around 50 to 60 programs are conducted every year. A one-year General Management program is offered through virtual classroom. As a combined initiative with the Ministry of Defence, a six-month General Management Programme is conducted for Defence officers to assist their career transition to the corporate sector.|$|E

5000|$|The Executive Council {{exists to}} [...] "advise" [...] the Chief <b>Executive</b> <b>in</b> {{policy-making}} {{and the administration}} of the government. The Chief Executive acting after consultation with the Executive Council is known as the Chief <b>Executive</b> <b>in</b> Council. The Chief <b>Executive</b> <b>in</b> Council introduces bills to the Legislative Council and issue instruments known as Orders in Council, which amongst other things are used to make delegated legislation, and regulate certain public institutions. The Chief <b>Executive</b> <b>in</b> Council also hears appeals and objections under certain Ordinances.|$|R
50|$|Brock {{began his}} Scouting career in 1972 as a {{district}} <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> New Bern, North Carolina, then {{served on the}} staff in Knoxville, Tennessee. He also served as Scout <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> Athens, Georgia and Atlanta, GA; Scout <b>executive</b> <b>in</b> Orlando, Florida; regional director of the Southern Region in Atlanta, GA and then as assistant Chief Scout Executive. As Deputy Chief Scout Executive, Brock was the BSA's chief operating officer.|$|R
5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use. This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national <b>executives,</b> <b>in</b> part due to the Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Playtex {{split into}} two companies, Playtex Apparel and Playtex Family Products, {{in a series of}} {{financial}} transactions totaling $1.3 billion. The transactions allowed Smilow to buy out other Playtex shareholders and put ownership of the brand into two separate investment groups that were owned by Smilow and other Playtex <b>executives.</b> <b>In</b> 1990 Playtex Products acquired cosmetics brand Maybelline for $300 million.($ in modern dollars). The next year Smilow sold Playtex Apparel to the Sara Lee Corporation, transferring the Bali, Hanes, and Cross Your Heart brands for $571 million, ($ in modern dollars) but keeping the Playtex Family Products Corporation.|$|E
5|$|The bids {{from private}} {{companies}} were {{heavily influenced by}} the legislation of the New Deal. The Vinson-Trammell Act limited profit from a ship's construction to 10percent, while the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act specified a minimum wage and required working conditions for workers. The latter act greatly affected {{the ability of the}} navy to acquire steel, as the text of the law caused friction between <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> the industry, who greatly disliked the forty-hour work week and minimum wage requirements, and their workers—who themselves were embroiled in a separate dispute pitting the union of the skilled workers, the American Federation of Labor, against the union of the unskilled, the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Amid the unrest, the navy ran into difficulties trying to acquire 18million pounds of steel to build six destroyers and three submarines; many more pounds than this would be needed for the new battleships.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season City {{failed to}} capitalise on the gains {{made in the}} first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. While City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic. Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season, but BBC Sports Editor David Bond reported he had been sacked for his poor communication and relationships with players and <b>executives.</b> <b>In</b> his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini. In Pellegrini's first season, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title {{on the last day of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Through the mid-2000s, Lexus {{experienced}} sales {{successes in}} South Korea and Taiwan, becoming the top-selling import make in both markets in 2005; the marque also sold {{well in the}} Middle East, where it ranked first or second among rivals in multiple countries, and in Australia, where Lexus reached third in luxury car sales in 2006. Division <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> 2006 announced an expansion goal from 68 countries to 76 worldwide by 2010. By {{the end of the}} decade, this expansion resulted in official launches in Malaysia and South Africa in 2006, Indonesia in 2007, Chile in 2008, and the Philippines in 2009.|$|E
5|$|After Isaacs left, {{there was}} a period of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who moved into the job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on the management of the opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|As 1938 began, {{there was}} much {{speculation}} as to where Briskin would go next. He {{was considered one of}} the top film <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> the industry. In mid-May, it was reported that Briskin was in negotiations with Sam Cohn to return to his former studio, Columbia, in the role of general manager. However, his name was still being discussed for other major positions throughout the industry, such as the production head at Universal Pictures. On May 26 it was announced that Briskin and Columbia had reached a 7-year agreement for him to take over {{as the head of the}} production at the studio, where he resumed his former position of general manager on May 30. As part of the agreement, Briskin was issued stock options on 10,000 shares of Columbia stock, with a value of $13.875 per share. Briskin's return to Columbia would also reunite him with his brother, Irving, who had been a producer at Columbia for several years. Samuel Briskin's would be one of the top money earners in Hollywood in 1938, his earnings topping $106,000, putting him in the top 10 at Columbia.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most state}} chief <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> the United States, the Governor is {{elected by the}} {{citizens}} of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. The Wrath of Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> the legislative process.|$|E
5|$|The bank's {{expansion}} strategy hit {{trouble with}} {{the stock market crash}} of 1987 and involvement in the financial scandal surrounding the collapse of Blue Arrow. The Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair was critical of the bank's management and resulted in the resignation of several members of the board, including then chairman Lord Boardman. Later, the bank would divest its overseas subsidiaries. The North American operations were sold to Fleet Bank and Hong Kong Bank of Canada, and the Australian and New Zealand branches were sold to Salomon Smith Barney and the National Australia Bank. Thereafter the bank concentrated on its core domestic business as the restyled NatWest Group, reflecting its modern positioning as a portfolio of businesses. In 1993, the NatWest Tower was devastated by a Provisional IRA bomb and the bank vacated the building and later sold it. Then, in 1997, NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm formed in 1992, revealed that a £50m loss had been discovered, revised to £90.5m after further investigations. Investor and shareholder confidence was so badly shaken that the Bank of England had to instruct the board of directors to resist calls for the resignation of its most senior <b>executives</b> <b>in</b> an effort to draw a line under the affair. The bank's internal controls and risk management were severely criticised in 2000 and its aggressive push into investment banking questioned, after a lengthy investigation by the Securities and Futures Authority. The bank's move into complicated derivative products that it did not fully understand seemed to indicate poor management. By the end of 1997 parts of NatWest Markets had been sold, others becoming Greenwich NatWest in 1998.|$|E
