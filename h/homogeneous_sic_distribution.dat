This paper studies the spatial characteristics of soil inorganic carbon (<b>SIC)</b> <b>distribution</b> in urbanized territories of main cities in Jiangsu Province, China, based on the data of regional geochemical survey. Urbanization process in study area has been quickened greatly since the 1980 s.

Multi modal <b>SiC</b> particle size <b>distributions</b> which included <b>SiC</b> nanoparticles were produced after the milling process, leading to the incorporation of a size range of SiC particle sizes from about 50 nm to larger than 10 μm, into the molten A 356 aluminum alloy. The particle size of the milled powders and the amount of released heat from the reaction between the carrier agent and molten aluminum are inferred as two crucial factors that affect the resultant part tensile properties and microhardness...|$|R
40|$|Lightweight, {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular {{structures of}} graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) showing very low densities (< 1. 6 g cm(- 3)) {{as compared to}} the dense skeleton (< 3. 2 g cm(- 3)) have been fabricated by a filament-based printing technique known as Robocasting. These scaffolds have been assembled from pseudoplastic inks containing <b>homogeneous</b> mixtures of <b>SiC</b> ceramic powders and up to 20 vol. % of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and densified by pressureless spark plasma sintering. The electrical conductivity (sigma) of the scaffolds shows certain anisotropy with the structure orientation and increases with the GNPs volume fraction. In this way, sigma values of up to 611 S m(- 1) for the longitudinal and 273 S m(- 1) for the transverse orientations of the structures relative to the extruded rods are achieved. First attempts to model the electrical behavior of robocast scaffolds using both analytical and finite-element methods are described. The models provide a correct description of general trends in the conductivity and anisotropy, and are expected to be useful as a first approach to anticipate the trends of other properties, as the thermal conductivity, of such complex multifunctional cellular materials, thus narrowing the experimental workload. Scaffolds tested under compression show crushing strengths in the range of 10 - 50 MPa, which increase with the relative density of the skeletons. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
