40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to reconstruct the}} history of Zambia s role in Zimbabwe s liberation struggle from 1964 to {{the latter part of}} 1979. In doing so, it examines key aspects of Zambia s contribution to the liberation struggle by analysing the broad range of assistance accorded to the Zimbabwe African <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Union</b> (ZAPU) and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), the two liberation movements which waged armed struggle against the Rhodesian government. The study argues that the Zambian authorities employed a two-pronged approach war and diplomacy in supporting Zimbabwe s liberation struggle. However, for mainly economic reasons, they were more inclined to pursue diplomatic approaches rather than exclusively relying on armed struggle in resolving the Rhodesian crisis. They backed the armed struggle only to an extent that it was a necessary instrument to coerce the Rhodesian government to the negotiating table, but this strategy had limited success and created numerous tensions and contradictions. Some sections of Zimbabwe nationalists accused Zambian President, Kenneth Kaunda, of undermining the liberation struggle and supporting a particular nationalist leader. Thus, Zambia s role in support of Zimbabwe s liberation struggle was shaped by the ideological, strategic and economic interests of Zambia s ruling elites which, in turn, shaped the attitudes, perceptions and relationships among the nationalist leaders competing for power within the liberation movements. Despite the numerous tensions and contradictions, and the enormous economic risks associated with Zambia s commitment to Zimbabwe s liberation struggle, the study concludes that it played a major role and contributed significantly to the liberation war.

50|$|The German population's {{psychological}} {{acceptance of}} extermination-for-Lebensraum was achieved with propaganda; {{the leaders of}} the Hitler Youth were issued pamphlets (e.g. On the <b>German</b> <b>People</b> and its Territory) meant to influence the rank-and-file Hitler Youth about the necessity of Nazi racist practices in obtaining Lebensraum for the <b>German</b> <b>people.</b> Likewise, in the Reich proper, schoolchildren were given propaganda pamphlets (e.g. You and Your People) explaining the importance of Lebensraum for the future of Germany and the <b>German</b> <b>people.</b>|$|R

The increasing hardship of the war for the <b>German</b> <b>people</b> also called forth more propaganda that the war had been forced on the <b>German</b> <b>people</b> by the refusal of foreign powers to accept their strength and independence.
