The complexity of IETD especially regarding the huge mass of data elements, their linkage and the version management issuing and release process must be controlled via a special document management system.To handle these complex structures of ASD S1000D IETDs, the Common Source Data Base is necessary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a scoping study that investigated the possible transfer of techniques for creation of <b>electronic</b> <b>technical</b> support documentation from {{the aerospace industry}} to the machine tool industry. Electronic maintenance manuals have been supplied by aircraft manufacturers over the past 20 years with demonstrated benefits. Despite research that indicates the likelihood of similar benefits for machine tool users, the supply of <b>electronic</b> <b>technical</b> support documentation (TSD) by machine tool manufacturers is rare, and the techniques {{for the creation of}} TSD are inefficient. This paper describes the relevant trends affecting the machine tool industry and the background of the use of electronic TSD in aerospace. Data was collected via interviews with technical authors, document users and software suppliers from both industry sectors, as well as a questionnaire and a workshop. The results were analysed to form a view of the potential for technology transfer over the next 5 years...|$|R
