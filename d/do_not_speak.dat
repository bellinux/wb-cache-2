5|$|The Nation Alliance Party {{was a minor}} {{political}} party in British Columbia, Canada. While the party was registered with Elections BC as a provincial party, it also participated in the 2008 federal election, the 2008 municipal election, {{as well as the}} 2009 provincial election. The party sought to promote multiculturalism, advocate for rights of ethnic minorities and recent immigrants focusing on employment access, security, health care, education and overall rights and status. It was an advocacy party that sought to politically empower and enable those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> English as a first language to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{localization}} of {{the game}} was done by Aksys Games; Chunsoft was introduced to them by Spike when looking {{for a company that}} could publish the game in North America. When Aksys evaluated the game, many at the company did not believe in it and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. In the end they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 {{people living in the}} two Russian settlements. The population in the communities <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made it difficult for the Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were further complicated by erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E

He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> {{with any of the}} children. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with the children's parents, some of whom regularly visited the Civic Crèche [...] He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with the children's evidential interviewers. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with any of the crèche workers. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with Ellis's mother. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with Peter Ellis. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> with the oldest complainant, one of seven children upon whose evidence Ellis was convicted. Several months after the trial had ended, the child stated that she had not been sexually abused. Eichelbaum <b>did</b> <b>not</b> seek advice from academics within New Zealand universities when appointing experts for his inquiry. The only people with whom Eichelbaum discussed the matter of the selection of the experts were Justice Ministry officials and Thomas Lyon, a USA law professor. In 1999 Lyon criticised the direction and relevance of research undertaken by experts nominated by Ellis's counsel. Lyon's critique was cited approvingly in the Crown's submission to the ministerial inquiry.|$|R

On the announcement of Eden's resignation, Heath submitted a report on the opinions of the Conservative MPs regarding Eden's possible successors. This report favoured Harold Macmillan and helped to secure Macmillan the premiership in January 1957. Macmillan later appointed Heath Minister of Labour, a Cabinet Minister—as Chief Whip Heath had attended Cabinet, but had not been formally a member—after winning the October 1959 election.|$|E
25|$|Some {{alternatives}} to dissection may present educational advantages {{over the use}} of animal cadavers, while eliminating the problematic ethical issues. These alternatives include computer programs, lectures, three dimensional models, films, and other forms of technology. Concern for animal welfare is often at the root of objections to animal dissection. Studies show that some students reluctantly participate in animal dissection out of fear of real or perceived punishment or ostracism from their teachers and peers, and many <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> up about their ethical objections.|$|E
