40|$|The {{incidence}} of tuberculosis in pregnancy ranges between 1 - 2 % amongst hospital deliveries in the trop-ics. Tuberculosis of {{central nervous system}} accounts for about 5 % of extra pulmonary cases and manifests as meningitis or uncommonly as tuberculoma. The management of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>tuberculoma</b> diagnosed during pregnancy should be same as that in non-pregnant subjects with antituberculous treatment. Emergency caesar-ean section in a patient with <b>intracerebral</b> <b>tuberculoma</b> poses unique challenges to the anaesthesiologist. There are no published reports on anaesthetic management of pregnancy with tuberculoma. We report {{the case of a}} woman with <b>intracerebral</b> <b>tuberculoma</b> presenting for emergency caesarean section. The anaesthetic goals in this patient were combined to that of principles of obstetrical anaesthesia to ensure a favourable maternal and fetal outcome. The anaesthetic technique chosen should prevent aspiration, avoid fluctuations in intracranial pressure, maintain stable haemodynamics, provide a sufficient depth of anaesthesia and good postoperative analgesia. We believe that general anaesthesia is the safest approach in such patients. We suggest general anaesthesia to be preferred over regional anaesthesia technique...|$|E
40|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{tuberculosis}} remains a clinical diagnostic challenge. The ex vivo Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) {{is a novel}} assay for the rapid detection of M. tuberculosis-specific T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. However, when performed on peripheral blood, this assay cannot distinguish between active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection. On the assumption that M. tuberculosis-specific T-lymphocytes migrate to sites of infection, {{we were able to}} demonstrate high levels of M. tuberculosis-specific cells by ELISPOT in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with tuberculous meningitis and <b>intracerebral</b> <b>tuberculoma</b> four weeks before cerebrospinal fluid culture became positive for M. tuberculosis by culture...|$|E
40|$|Brain tuberculoma has {{previously}} accounted {{for up to}} a third of new intracranial lesions in areas endemic with tuberculosis, but is unexpected in the United States and other Western countries with improved disease control. Here we show the importance of considering this diagnosis in at-risk patients, even with no definitive pulmonary involvement. We describe a young man who presented with partial seizures and underwent craniotomy for resection of a frontoparietal tuberculoma. He subsequently completed six months of antituberculosis therapy and was doing well without neurological sequelae or evidence of recurrence five months after completion of therapy. With resurgence of tuberculosis cases in the United States and other Western countries, <b>intracerebral</b> <b>tuberculoma</b> should remain a diagnostic consideration in at-risk patients with new space occupying lesions. Mass lesions causing neurological sequelae can be safely addressed surgically and followed with antituberculosis therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>tuberculomas</b> includes tumors and other infections of central nervous system. In {{this study we}} present a patient misdiagnosed and treated as toxoplasmosis. She was evaluated again because of the poor response to treatment and got the diagnosis of intracranial tuberculoma. She responded well to antituberculosis treatment. In countries where central nervous system tuberculosis is frequently seen as ours, early suspicion and early treatment is so important in preventing the sequela in cases with features suggestive of tuberculoma in radiological examinations...|$|R
