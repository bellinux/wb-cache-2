5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to improve a firm’s image. Furthermore, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, sponsoring the natural environment is also very important. And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.|$|E

5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} Electoral College by constitutional amendment have been introduced in Congress over the decades.

5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then {{it may be that the}} marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E

5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, an Australian Division of the East Indies Station was {{established}}, and in 1859 the British Admiralty {{established an}} independent command, the Australia Station, {{under the command}} of a Commodore who was assigned as Commander-in-Chief, Australia Station. The Australian Squadron was created to which British naval ships serving on the Australia Station were assigned. The changes were partially in recognition of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large part of the East Indies Station had been detached to Australian waters, and also reflecting growing concern for the strategic situation in the western Pacific in general, and in Tahiti and New Zealand in particular. In 1884, the commander of the Australia Station was upgraded to the rank of Rear Admiral.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E

5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue {{is attached to the}} solid support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> nucleosidic solid support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lechaeum (391 BC) was an Athenian {{victory in}} the Corinthian War. In the battle, the Athenian general Iphicrates took {{advantage}} of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Spartan hoplite regiment operating near Corinth was moving in the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers, or peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which a force of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites (heavy infantry).|$|E
5|$|The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person {{prepares a}} weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E

5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
5|$|The scheme did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} enthusiasm, and from the beginning, there were some who doubted the true intentions of the promoters. Although many of the sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient {{where there was no}} leeway (most observers being oblivious to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> straighter shorter line would have made the gradient even steeper), several were due to resistance by local landowners along the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It {{is for this reason}} that plans to relocate the airport are so important in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E
