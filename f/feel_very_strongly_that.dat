500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E

[...] "I did look at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|R

5000|$|Richard Thomas Condon (March 18, 1915 in New York City - April 9, 1996 in Dallas, Texas) was a {{prolific}} and popular American political novelist whose satiric works were generally {{presented in the}} form of thrillers or semi-thrillers. More than being particularly clever genre works, however, all 26 books were written in a style nearly always instantly recognizable as Condon's, while their focus was almost always obsessively directed at monetary greed and political corruption. Fast-moving and easily accessible, they generally combined elements of political satire, bare-knuckled outrage at the greed and corruption of those in power, and were written with extravagant characterizations and a uniquely sparkling and frequently humorous style. Condon himself once said: [...] "Every book I've ever written has been about abuse of power. I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> about <b>that.</b> I'd like people to know how deeply their politicians wrong them." [...] Condon occasionally achieved bestseller status, and many of his books were made into films, but today he is primarily remembered for two of his works: an early book, The Manchurian Candidate of 1959, and, many years later, for four novels about a family of New York gangsters named Prizzi.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith a {{background}} of some 50 {{years of experience in}} the immersed tunnel industry, most recently having been in charge of inspection during the construction of the Bosporus Rail Tunnel, and having the privilege of working with engineers in Norway on various aspects of their SFT projects for a basis, the author presents some concepts for the design and construction of a long submerged floating tunnel in deep water. These concepts are presented as sketchy ideas only supported by rudimentary calculations and assumptions. It is hoped however, that some of these ideas might at be useful in the future development of viable, long crossings in deep water. Such crossings are the challenges often faced by engineers in a country like Norway with its deep, wide fjords. An SFT design premise that has been written about by the author over the years (most recently at the Fifth Strait Crossing Symposium 2009 held in Trondheim, Norway [1]) is that an SFT should be designed to float and remain stable even if its roadway or track ducts were to be completely flooded. There is no doubt this requirement would be considerably more costly than the SFTs presently being considered. The author <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> however, <b>that</b> an owner, either governmental or private (as in a toll road), would never finance a water crossing that could be completely destroyed {{in the event of a}} single flood. If a flood were to occur that would slacken the tethers of an SFT as presently conceived, the whole tunnel crossing would quickly become unstable and collapse in ruin at the bottom of the waterway. Floods have occurred in many tunnels as a result of carelessness, water mains breaking, or even the failure of a bulkhead. Such floods, ranging from minor to major, would have destroyed an SFT. This paper touches on methods to provide stability against flooding, construction methods and equipment that could be used to cast and install anchor blocks attached to braced “tether towers”, a sequence of construction with methods to lower, join and align, modular tunnel elements, how to attach the tether towers and equalize the tensile loadings, and a method to stabilize the completed SFT laterally while providing for elongation or contraction due to temperature changes. The methods described are felt to incorporate doable construction techniques...|$|R

Three years later, Robb was the only senator from a Southern state to oppose the Defense of Marriage Act. In stating his opposition to the bill, which his friends and supporters urged him to support, he said the following, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> this legislation is wrong. Despite its name, the Defense of Marriage Act does not defend marriage against some imminent, crippling effect. Although we have made huge strides in the struggle against discrimination based on gender, race, and religion, it is more difficult to see beyond our differences regarding sexual orientation. The fact that our hearts don't speak in the same way is not cause or justification to discriminate." [...] Some have speculated that his position on gay rights, along with his positions on other hot-button issues like abortion, alienated the generally conservative voters of Virginia and contributed to his eventual defeat.|$|E

60|$|But I believe {{no cause}} {{to have been}} more active in the {{degradation}} of our natural feeling for beauty, than the constant use of cast iron ornaments. The common iron work {{of the middle ages}} was as simple as it was effective, composed of leafage cut flat out of sheet iron, and twisted at the workman's will. No ornaments, on the contrary, are so cold, clumsy, and vulgar, so essentially incapable of a fine line, or shadow, as those of cast iron; and while, on the score of truth, we can hardly allege anything against them, since they are always distinguishable, at a glance, from wrought and hammered work, and stand only for what they are, yet I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> there is no hope of the progress of the arts of any nation which indulges in these vulgar and cheap substitutes for real decoration. Their inefficiency and paltriness I shall endeavor to show more conclusively in another place, enforcing only, at present, the general conclusion that, if even honest or allowable, they are things in which we can never take just pride or pleasure, and must never be employed in any place wherein they might either themselves obtain the credit of being other and better than they are, or be associated with the downright work to which it would be a disgrace to be found in their company.|$|E
60|$|But I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> much of {{that which}} is evil in the {{structure}} of American politics is owing to the absence of any national religion, and that something also of social evil has sprung from the same cause. It is not that men do not say their prayers. For aught I know, they may do so as frequently and as fervently, or more frequently and more fervently, than we do; but there is a rowdiness, if I may be allowed to use such a word, in their manner of doing so which robs religion of that reverence which is, if not its essence, at any rate its chief protection. It is a part of their system that religion shall be perfectly free, and that no man shall be in any way constrained in that matter. Consequently, the question of a man's religion is regarded in a free-and-easy way. It is well, for instance, that a young lad should go somewhere on a Sunday; but a sermon is a sermon, and it does not much concern the lad's father whether his son hear the discourse of a freethinker in the music-hall, or the eloquent but lengthy outpouring of a preacher in a Methodist chapel. Everybody is bound to have a religion, but it does not much matter what it is.|$|E

'In {{about a month}} I {{suppose we}} shall be off again {{for three or four}} months, and we long to get hold of pupils from the Banks Archipelago, Santa Cruz, Espiritu Santo, in which no ground is broken at present. We visited them last year, but did not get any pupils; lovely islands, very populous, and the natives very bright, intelligent- looking. But how I long to see again some of my own dear boys, I do so think of them! It may be that two or three of them may come again to us, and then we may perhaps hope that they may learn enough to be really useful to their own people.... Dear uncle, I should indeed rejoice much to see my dear, dear father and sisters and Jem and all of you if it came in the way of one's business, but I think, so long as I am well, that the {{peculiar}} nature of this work must require the constant presence of one personally known to, and not only officially connected with, the natives. While I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>that</b> in many ways intercourse occasionally resumed with the home clergy must be very useful to us, yet if you can understand that there is no one to take one's place, you see how very unlikely it must be that I can move from this hemisphere.

Of course I should be most thankful, most happy if, during his lifetime, I once more found myself at home, but I don't think much nor speculate about it, and I am very happy, as I am well and hearty. You won't suspect me of any lessening of strong affection for all that savours of home. I think that I know every face in Alfington and in Feniton, and very many in Ottery as of old; I believe I think of all with increasing affection, but while I wonder at it, I must also confess that I can and do live happy day after day without enjoying the sight of those dear faces.|$|E

The whole life of an artist is a lottery, and a very wild lottery, and the best artist is liable to be warped away from what he knows is right by the chance of at once making a vast fortune by catching the public eye, the public eye being only to be caught by bright colors and certain conditions of art not always desirable. If, therefore, connected with the Academy schools there could be the means of giving a fixed amount of income to certain men, who would as a consideration for that income furnish a certain number of works that might be agreed upon, or undertake any national work that might be agreed upon, that I believe would be the healthiest way in which a good painter could be paid. To give him his bread and cheese, and so much a day, and say, Here are such and such things we want you to do, is, I believe, the healthiest, simplest, and happiest way in which great work can be produced. But whether it is compatible with our present system I cannot say, nor whether every man would not run away as soon as he found he could get two or three thousand pounds by painting a catching picture. I think your best men would not.|$|E
