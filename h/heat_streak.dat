40|$|Oil-in-water (O/W) {{emulsions}} {{are widely}} used in metal rolling and cutting and also as fire-resistant hydraulic fluids. For both of these applications they require a reasonable degree of lubricating ability—in metal rolling to protect the surfaces against wear and seizure {{and to provide a}} controlled value of friction, and in hydraulics to limit the extent of wear, scuffing and fatigue of rubbing pump components. The lubricating properties of O/W emulsions are significantly poorer than those of most water-free oils and this deficiency can create service problems, such as excessive wear or rolling contact fatigue of hydraulic pumps or the uneven rolling or <b>heat</b> <b>streaking</b> of metal strip. Considerable work has gone into the design of O/W emulsions which have acceptable lubricating properties combined with satisfactory emulsion stability and corrosion resistance. Much of this work has been empirical, although there have also been a number of more fundamental studies of the film-forming and friction properties of emulsions. The latter have shown that the ability of O/W emulsions to form films in rubbing contacts is very dependent on the rolling speed of the contact and also the composition of the emulsion. This paper describes a study {{of the relationship between the}} composition and properties of O/W emulsions and the extent to which they form elastohydrodynamic films in contacts over a range of speeds. By applying surface chemical principles to maximize the tendency of the oil in O/W emulsions to wet the surfaces, it is shown how the composition of an O/W emulsion can be optimized to yield satisfactory film formation and, thus, low friction and wear over a wide range of speed conditions <br/...|$|R

25|$|The rivalry would {{continue}} into the 2013 NBA Playoffs when the Heat would play the Bulls {{in the second}} round. The Bulls ended another Miami <b>Heat</b> winning <b>streak</b> by beating the Heat 93–87 in game 1. The Heat came back in game 2 and set a record for the largest margin of victory in franchise playoff history with a 115–78 win. The Bulls also set a record for the worst playoff defeat in franchise history. The 51 personal fouls were the most in a playoff game since 1995. In Game 3, Nazr Mohammed was ejected for shoving LeBron James {{early in the second}} quarter. Norris Cole had his jersey ripped by Taj Gibson while driving to the basket for a layup. Joakim Noah was seen applauding and cheering on the image of Chris Bosh arguing with Mario Chalmers. Noah received a technical foul for shoving Chris Andersen after he fell on Nate Robinson. Chalmers received a flagrant foul for ringing his arm around Noah's neck. Taj Gibson and Noah were both ejected in the same game for yelling at the referees.|$|R
50|$|The Heat evened {{the series}} again, {{pulling away from}} San Antonio {{in the second half}} after an even contest at halftime, 49-49. The <b>Heat</b> {{continued}} their <b>streak</b> of not losing consecutive games that the team started in January. The Big Three (the trio of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh) for Miami finally came together in a big way. James led the Heat with 33 points, while Wade had 32 and Bosh added 20. Tim Duncan led the Spurs with 20 points. Tony Parker started strong with 15 points in the first half, but could not provide the Spurs with any offensive production in the second half.|$|R

Enhancement also occurred in D. rosarium, but only in media containing peptone. Strains of D. mucoroides gave varied responses, and these could be divided into those which required mutrients for spore germination and those which did not. The spores of Polysphondylium pallidum were resistant to mild heat (45 C), but were not activated; peptone was required for germination.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for oil flow and phase change paint heat transfer tests conducted on a 0. 006 scale {{model of a}} proposed single stage to orbit control configured vehicle. The data were taken at angles of attack up to 40 deg at a free stream Mach number of 10 for Reynolds numbers based on model length of 0. 5 x 10 to the 6 th power, 1. 0 x 10 to the 6 th power and 2. 0 x 10 to the 6 th power. The magnitude and distribution of heating are characterized in terms of angle of attack and Reynolds number aided by {{an analysis of the}} flow data which are used to suggest the presence of various three dimensional flow structures that produce the observed heating patterns. Of particular interest are <b>streak</b> <b>heating</b> patterns that result in high localized heat transfer rates on the wing windward surface at low to moderate angles of attack. These streaks are caused by the bow-shock/wing-shock interaction and formation of the wing-shock. Embedded vorticity was found to be associated with these interactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of printing or coating processes for paper products the velocity of the web and the roller width can be increased. However, these measures cause deformations of the rollers, <b>heating</b> effects and <b>streak</b> print defects due to undesirable oscillations. The vibration characteristic is significant for the quality and efficiency of the printing or coating processes. Approved methods like balancing of the rollers and maximizing the bending stiffness have come to technical limits. This paper describes a new promising technology for further optimization of printing and coating machines. Piezoelectric actuators are integrated in the bearings of a roller of a flexographic printing machine and generate counterforces to compensate undesired bending vibrations. Strain gauges applied on the roller measure the vibrations. A simulation model of the mechatronic overall-system has been developed to design the control strategy. The oscillations of roller systems in printing machines and other industrial applications are mainly stimulated by disturbances that occur periodically with each rotation. A feedback control strategy combined with a feed forward compensation of predictable disturbances has shown promising results in simulation and experiments. Due {{to the fact that}} the excitations of the oscillations are periodically with the rotation of rollers, another approach for vibration reduction has been developed. The forces for vibration reduction are not generated by an active mechatronic system but by passive profile rings...|$|R
5000|$|On the {{personal}} side, Bob and Kaye {{had been married}} for over 25 years; Kaye was loyal and sensible, and a busy career woman herself (although she nearly quit her job in the pilot, especially after seeing the estimated figure Bob would pull in yearly from the revival of Mad-Dog). Also creating havoc in Bob's life was his grown daughter Trisha (Cynthia Stevenson), who bemoaned her perpetually single state. Other members of the comics staff included Albie Lutz (Andrew Bilgore), a klutzy gofer with low self-esteem; Chad Pfefferle (Timothy Fall), a spaced-out cartoon inker; and curmudgeonly Iris Frankel (Ruth Kobart), an old-timer artist at the office who worked with Bob in his early days (she still called him [...] "Bobby McKay"). Seen occasionally in the beginning, but receiving increased screen time as the series progressed were Trisha's best friend, Kathy Fleisher (Lisa Kudrow); Kathy's parents Patty (Dorothy Lyman) and Jerry (Tom Poston), a fellow comic book writer alumnus who created [...] "The Silencer"; Shayla (Christine Dunford), Harlan's on-and-off girlfriend; and Buzz Loudermilk, as played by Dick Martin (a regular director on the series), a friend of Bob's, creator of [...] "Katie Carter, Army Nurse," [...] and a mature ladies' man. Other Ace Comics titles included Blue <b>Streak,</b> <b>Heat</b> the She-Wolf, Lady Minerva, Mazza the She-Devil, Oyster Boy, Sex Cats, Tiny Silver Hands, Z-Man and Boing-Boing, and The New Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Ace's best-selling title, much to Harlan's chagrin.|$|R
40|$|Axial turbomachines have {{inherently}} {{unstable flow}} fields {{due to the}} interaction between rotating and nonrotating blade rows. In addition, combustor instabilities add considerable stress on the blading via the introduction of localized radial and/or circumferential temperature discontinuities known as hot streaks. To alleviate the losses due to nonconformities within the turbine a computational effort has been undertaken investigating the effects of clocking an imbedded stage in a multi- stage axial turbine and a separate study considering the effects of an imposed temporally oscillating hot streak within a 1 1 / 2 stage turbine. Time-dependent hot streak results show little relation of rotor surface <b>heating</b> to hot <b>streak</b> frequency (non-dimensional) for hot streak frequencies less than unity. The general trend for stator 2 is observed to be as hot streak frequency increases stator 2 observes a decreasing trend in surface heating for frequencies less than unity. At unity rotor surface heating is minimized and stator 2 surface heating is maximized, if the rotor is properly phased (180 °) with the hot streak. When the hot streak is in phase with the rotor a rotor maximum surface temperature is observed and the stator 2 is at a minimum. Multi-stage clocking shows a periodic effect on loss and efficiency for the clocked airfoils and the rotor between. Loss and effeciency {{in the current study}} are observed to vary inversely to one another with high vane loss corresponding to higher efficiency in the vane rows, while high loss in the vane corresponds to low losses of greater magnitude in the rotor row...|$|R
5000|$|In the offseason, the Heat {{focused on}} {{retaining}} their team outside the Big 3. Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis opted into their contracts {{for an extra}} year. Mario Chalmers picked up the team option for another year with the team. James Jones stayed on the team after mulling over retirement. During the 2013 NBA draft, the Heat traded a second round pick for forward-guard James Ennis, the 50th pick. Udonis Haslem is to have surgery on his knee after tearing his meniscus during the regular season. Chris Andersen was re-signed to a one-year deal with the Heat. Mike Miller was released via the amnesty clause, which would save the Heat upwards to $40 million in the luxury tax. Greg Oden, the first pick in the 2007 NBA draft, signed to a one-year deal at the league minimum. Michael Beasley, who was formerly drafted by the Heat with the 2nd overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft, was signed to a 1-year contract. The Heat began with a 22-6 record, the best start in franchise history. However, the 2013-14 season was full of struggle for the Heat. Their struggles against other top teams continued {{in a similar fashion}} as the 2010-11 season. They suffered an 0-4 regular season sweep against the Brooklyn Nets, three of them by one point and one went into overtime in Brooklyn. They also went 0-2 when playing against the Chicago Bulls on the road at the United Center in Chicago and 0-2 against the Indiana Pacers when playing against them in Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Addressing the Heat's struggles, many Heat players admitted that the team had lacked the necessary motivation and energy. Fourth quarter woes were also to blame (as in the past), with the Heat often failing to keep the lead for four quarters. Much was also talked about Mario Chalmers' poor play, often becoming the target of berating from LeBron, Wade and Bosh dubbed the [...] "little brother" [...] of the Heat. During a home game against the Indiana Pacers on December 18, 2013, LeBron and Mario Chalmers got into a near-altercation after exchanging words during a timeout in the third quarter. Chalmers gave LeBron some words, in turn LeBron made a leap as if to phsyically do something, until he was restrained by Udonis Haslem. James later apologized court side to Chalmers as well as on Twitter stating it was [...] "wrong" [...] of him. LeBron also suffered a nose injury during a game against Oklahoma City on February 20. He returned with an unusual black nose mask on February 27 during a home game against the New York Knicks, he retained a high performance and Miami won 108-82. During a home game against the Charlotte Bobcats, LeBron James had a career-high 61 points. His 61-points was also a franchise high, breaking Glen Rice's 56-point franchise record, set in 1995 against the Orlando Magic. The Heat concluded the season with a 54-28 regular season record, the second seed in the much weakened-Eastern Conference, the lowest record in the big three era. In the playoffs, they swept over the 7th-seed Charlotte Bobcats in the first round. It became the second consecutive sweep of the Big 3 era. In the Conference Semifinals. The Heat found themselves against a rival that swept them during the regular season: Brooklyn Nets. As the Heat won the first two games at home, Brooklyn won Game 3, ending the <b>Heat's</b> six-game winning <b>streak</b> of the postseason. Fortunately, James had a career-high 49 points to lead the Heat to victory in Game 4 on the road. Back at home, the Heat avenged their regular season sweep loss over the Nets in Game 5. Moving on, the Heat faced another rematch against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals and their third consecutive playoff encounter. Pacer head coach Frank Vogel made it plain that the Pacers felt, if Game 7 was at Indiana, they would have beaten Miami, so they strove to get the number one seed in the east. The Pacers blew out the Heat in Game 1, but lost down the stretch in Game 2, 3, and 4. They avoided elimination in Game 5, with James facing foul trouble and career lows in points and minutes played. Much was made about Lance Stephenson's antics throughout the series, from blowing on James' ear to slamming his hand at Norris Cole's face. In Game 6, despite taking a 9-2 lead early in the first quarter, the Pacers were subsequently blown out {{for the rest of the}} way; Miami would reach the Finals for the fourth straight year, joining the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers as only the third franchise to achieve such a feat. In the Finals the Miami Heat would face the San Antonio Spurs in another much-expected rematch. However the Miami Heat would fail to achieve their goal of a three-peat, and like their 2011 loss to the Mavericks, would end up falling in the rematch against the Spurs, although in a brutal five-game sweep in which the Heat lost by 15 points or more in each loss. During Game 1, the Heat players suffered dehydration due to an air conditioning failure at the AT&T Center in San Antonio and in particular LeBron was unable to stay in the game because of cramping leading to the internet/Twitter meme referring to him as [...] "LeCramp" [...] and the oxymoron slogan [...] "too hot for the Heat". After winning Game 2 in San Antonio, Miami would lose the next threfe games including two straight home losses in Game 3 and Game 4. It would be the Heat's first postseason loss ever since their loss to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. On July 11, 2014 LeBron James announced he had decided to return to Cleveland leaving Wade and Bosh to continue on without him.|$|R
