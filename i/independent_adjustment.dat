Central to the framework presented is the partitioning of the urban housing market into submarkets that are segmented by quality. Within each submarket there is latitude for <b>independent</b> <b>adjustments</b> of demand and supply, and submarkets are interconnected by the actions of households, converters of new dwellings, and builders of new dwellings. Forces impinging on one submarket create signals there that eventually lead to systematic, but nonuniform repercussions, potentially throughout the submarket array.

5000|$|Where {{gridiron}} valves {{are used}} as secondary valves, they were commonly mounted on the inlet side of the valve chamber for the primary slide valve. They were driven by a separate valve gear, usually a separate eccentric set {{in advance of the}} main eccentric. When operating, the additional advance moves the gridiron valve to apply cut-off ahead of the main valve. To vary the expansion they provide, the stroke of the eccentric drive can be varied by an adjustable linkage. When this is adjusted to zero throw, the expansion valve remains fully open and the engine works without expansion. [...] Although the use of a secondary gridiron valve was an early technique, it also remained in service with increasingly sophisticated valves and actuation, throughout the history of stationary engines. McIntosh and Seymour engines used one driven by a cam and toggle arrangement that moved intermittently and stood still when open, giving precise timing, and <b>independent</b> <b>adjustment</b> of each valve movement.|$|E

40|$|Alignment {{mechanism}} for optical components, such as mirrors for manipulating laser beams, frequently require four degrees of freedom: two translations and two rotations, i. e. a four axis system. When the adjustment of one axis influences the others, as often {{will be the}} case, alignment procedures can be rather cumbersome. The mechanism, described in this paper, has four mutually <b>independent</b> <b>adjustments,</b> each controlling just one axis.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is drawn}} to a composition of matter comprising high viscosity sodium alginate, cellulose sulfate and a multi-component polycation. Additionally, the present invention provides methods for making capsules, measuring capsule permeability to immunologically-relevant proteins and treating disease in an animal using encapsulated cells. Over one thousand combinations of polyanions and polycations were examined as polymer candidates suitable for encapsulation of living cells and thirty-three pairs were effective. The combination of sodium alginate, cellulose sulfate, poly(methylene-co-guanidine) hydrochloride, calcium chloride, and sodium chloride produced the most desirable results. Pancreatic islets encapsulated in this multicomponent capsule demonstrated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro and reversed diabetes without stimulating immune reaction in mice.

40|$|The main {{result is}} to show that under the {{conditions}} imposed by the Maloney-Wandell color constancy algorithm, color constancy can be expressed in terms of a simple <b>independent</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the sensor responses, so long as the sensor space is first transformed to a new basis. The overall goal is to present a theoretical analysis connecting many established theories of color constancy. For the case where surface reflectances are two-dimensional and illuminants are three-dimensional, it is proved that perfect color constancy can always be solved for by an <b>independent</b> <b>adjustment</b> of sensor responses, which means that the color constancy transform can be expressed as a diagonal matrix. In addition to purely theoretical arguments, results from simulations of diagonal-matrix-based color constancy, in which the spectra of real illuminants and reflectances along with the human cone sensitivity functions were used, are presented. The simulations demonstrate that when the cone sensor space is transformed to its new basis in the appropriate manner, a diagonal matrix supports close to optimal color constanc...|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the personalized APRV (P-APRV) used to set time-controlled PEEP [109, 110] and inverse inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio are not at all the same mechanical breath. Although there are many differences between P-APRV and inverse I:E, I will focus on the large difference in the time at expiration between these two ventilation strategies. It was shown by Neumann et al. that the ARDS lung collapses very rapidly, their data showing collapse in 0.6  s after the initiation of expiration [17]. Our work using direct observation of alveoli during mechanical ventilation has also shown a very rapid alveolar collapse in the ARDS lung [40, 111 – 113]. Unlike APRV, inverse ratio ventilation does not allow direct and <b>independent</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the expiratory and inspiratory times. Thus, if the expiratory duration with inverse I:E is not less than 0.4 – 0.6  s, which is most often the case, alveoli would have sufficient time to collapse with each breath and inverse I:E would not be defined as time controlled PEEP, since the lung was allowed time to empty.|$|R

40|$|Balance control during upright {{standing}} {{is accompanied}} by an increased amplitude of motor potentials evoked (MEP) by transcranial magnetic stimulation and a decreased amplitude of the Hoffmann (H) reflex in soleus muscle. Nonetheless, whether these observations reflect reciprocal adjustments between corticospinal and group I afferents pathways during upright standing remains unknown. To further investigate this question, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) applied over the motor cortex and vibration of Achilles tendons were used to modify the excitability of corticospinal and group I afferents pathways, respectively. MEPs and H reflexes were recorded in the soleus muscle during upright standing with or without bilateral Achilles tendon vibration, these recordings being performed before and after 20 min of c-tDCS (1. 5 mA) or sham stimulation applied over the sensorimotor cortex. The results indicate that tendon vibration increased MEP amplitude (+ 28 %) and decrease (- 68 %) the H-reflex amplitude (p< 0. 05). After c-tDCS, MEP amplitude was reduced by 13 % and 26 % without and with tendon vibration (p< 0. 05), respectively. In contrast, no significant change occurred in H-reflex amplitude after c-tDCS. Regardless of the conditions (c-tDCS and tendon vibration), no significant correlation was observed between changes in MEP and H-reflex amplitudes. The results failed to demonstrate close reciprocal changes in soleus MEP and H-reflex amplitudes during upright standing. These original findings suggest <b>independent</b> <b>adjustments</b> in corticospinal and group I afferents pathways during upright standing.
