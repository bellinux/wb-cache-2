500|$|After Clarke's nonfiction science book The Exploration of Space (1951) was {{successfully}} received, {{he began to}} focus on his writing career. In February 1952, Clarke started working on the novelization of [...] "Guardian Angel"; he completed a first draft of the novel Childhood's End in December, and a final revision in January 1953. Clarke travelled to New York in April 1953 with the novel and several of his other works. Literary agent Bernard Shir-Cliff convinced Ballantine Books to buy everything Clarke had, including Childhood's End, [...] "Encounter in the Dawn" [...] (1953), (which Ballantine retitled Expedition to Earth), and Prelude to Space (1951). However, Clarke had composed two different endings for the novel, and the last chapter of Childhood's End was still not finished. Clarke proceeded to Tampa Bay, Florida, [...] to go scuba diving with George Grisinger, and on his way there visited his friend Frederick C. Durant - President of the <b>International</b> <b>Astronautical</b> <b>Federation</b> from 1953 to 1956 - and his family in the Washington Metropolitan Area, whilst he continued working on the last chapter. He then travelled to Atlanta, Georgia, where he visited Ian Macauley, a friend who was active in the anti-segregation movement. Clarke finished the final chapter in Atlanta while Clarke and Macauley discussed racial issues; these conversations may have influenced the development of the last chapter, particularly Clarke's choice to make the character of Jan Rodricks – the last surviving member of the human species – a black man.|$|E

2500|$|In 1952, {{during the}} third congressional session of the <b>International</b> <b>Astronautical</b> <b>Federation</b> (IAF) in Stuttgart, Germany, Burkhard Heim {{presented}} his theory for interplanetary propulsion under the title of “Die dynamische Kontrabarie als Lösung des astronautischen Problems” (The Dynamic Kontrabarie as solution of the Astronautical Problem). [...] It {{was the first time}} the idea of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces were treated as distortions of their proper Euclidean metrics in a higher-dimensional space. [...] A brief description of Heim’s lecture was recorded in the proceedings of the Society for Space Research.|$|E
2500|$|His essay, [...] "A Case Study in Challenge and Response: Danish Rocketry in the 19th Century," [...] was {{published}} in the 1966 July issue of the Aerospace Historian, the quarterly of the Air Force Historical Foundation. He won a second Goddard essay award later, in 1970. After separating from the service, he continued his formal education at the University of Maryland, earning a BA in history, cum laude. Winter joined the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in 1968 as a temporary part-time employee. In 1970 he became a full-time employee as a historical research clerk. From 1971 he has presented scholarly papers on the history of rocketry at <b>International</b> <b>Astronautical</b> <b>Federation</b> congresses, at International Congresses of the History of Science, and at other similar gatherings.|$|E
