5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the B-series trains were {{delivered}} for trial runs on 7 March 2001. In May, NSB stated {{that they would never}} be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could, and that at least for the next year, the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains. On 17 September 2001, the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen. During the following winter, the trains had problems running through snowdrift unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed. Because part of the Bergen Line had <b>frost</b> <b>heave,</b> trains were forced to drive extra slowly, causing trains to get stuck. NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16, which had previously been the main locomotive on the line, although Class 73 did not do as well as the modern El 18. In January 2002, NSB started rebuilding the A-series trains with a larger baggage compartment. This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Research on <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> of {{high speed}} railway {{subgrade}} filling in seasonal frozen soil area is developed indoor. Through freezing and thawing strength and <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> amount test, the research analyzes factors affecting <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> of subgrade filling, {{points out that}} water content, fine stuff admixing amount and plasticity of fine-grained soil have relatively large influence on <b>frost</b> <b>heaving,</b> while freezing temperature and freezing and thawing cycle index have relatively small influence. Water content is main factor to have effect on <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> of subgrade filling. When the water content reaches to some certain value, even coarse-grained soil can produce considerable <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> amount. Therefore, taking effective waterproof and drainage measures is of great importance in subgrade <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> prevention and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{mechanism}} and influencing factors of subgrade <b>frost</b> <b>heaving,</b> subgrade with berms structure was proposed based on typical highway {{to prevent the}} <b>frost</b> <b>heaving.</b> The solid model of subgrade was established. Numerical calculation model of subgrade was established by applying the finite difference software FLAC 3 D, boundary conditions and parameters of numerical model were determined, models of subgrade with berms of different widths were analysed and calculated. The results show that subgrade with berms can effectively reduce the freezing depth of subgrade, and decrease the stress and deformation of subgrade <b>frost</b> <b>heaving,</b> berm that is 3 m wide in given simulation conditions has the most significant effects on preventing and controlling <b>frost</b> <b>heaving...</b>|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the above}} results, shale has strong {{anisotropic}} characteristics, and its mineral composition, complex bedding and natural micro-cracks play a decisive {{role in the}} seepage and bearing capacity. Moreover, when LN 2 and shale contact each other, the shale will undergo high-speed contraction and <b>frost</b> <b>heaving.</b> The thermal stress and <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> pressure have serious effects on the internal micro-structure and mechanical characteristics of shale. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} further discuss the damage mechanism of the shale caused by hydration stress, thermal stress, and <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> pressure.|$|R
2500|$|The {{environment}} {{put some}} constraints on a potential design. Inuvik is [...] {{north of the}} Arctic Circle; at that latitude in North America, permafrost is only 2 metres (6ft) below ground. Thus, most buildings in the area then and now are built on pilings anchored in the permafrost, elevating them slightly above ground. But that solution would not work for a conventional church due {{to the possibility of}} <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> should the underlying permafrost melt partially. [...] "If we build a church with a steeple and the pilings start to heave, it's going to fall down," [...] Adam told a newspaper later.|$|E
2500|$|Brother Maurice Larocque, a Catholic missionary to the Arctic who had {{previously}} been a carpenter, designed the church {{despite a lack of}} any formal architectural training, sketching it on two sheets of plywood that are prominently displayed in the building's upper storeys. The round shape, which is painted to mimic an igloo, was chosen to mitigate possible structural damage that might be caused by <b>frost</b> <b>heave.</b> Its unique structural system, [...] "a dome within a dome", further protects the church with a foundation consisting of a bowl-shaped concrete slab on a gravel bed atop the permafrost and, in the building itself, an intricate system of wooden arches to support the load.|$|E

Feedback from one year's <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> influences the effects in subsequent years. For example, a small increase in overburden {{will affect the}} depth of ice formation and heaving in the subsequent years.

40|$|PURPOSES:This {{study is}} to {{evaluate}} a ground water level effect on <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> in road pavements. METHODS: The effects of water table on <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> in pavement systems were evaluated from the mechanical analysis using FROST program. The input parameters and boundary conditions were determined by considering climates, pavement sections, and material properties specially subgrade soil types in Korea. RESULTS: When the water table located above the freezing depth, amount of <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> caused by freezing the water in pavement itself {{was big enough to}} damage in pavement system, although pavement system consists of fully non-frost-susceptible materials with sufficient thickness of anti-freezing layer. The amount of <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> was decreased rapidly with increasing the distance between the water table and freezing depth.

50|$|In {{addition}} to being manipulated for medical and energy applications, capillary pressure is the cause behind various natural phenomena as well. For example, needle ice, seen in cold soil, occurs via capillary action. The first major contributions {{to the study of}} needle ice, or simply, frost heaving were made by Stephen Taber (1929) and Gunnar Beskow (1935), who independently aimed to understand soil freezing. Taber’s initial work was related to understanding how the size of pores within the ground influenced the amount of <b>frost</b> <b>heave.</b> He also discovered that <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> is favorable for crystal growth and that a gradient of soil moisture tension drives water upward toward the freezing front {{near the top of the}} ground. In Beskow’s studies, he defined this soil moisture tension as “capillary pressure” (and soil water as “capillary water”). Beskow determined that the soil type and effective stress on the soil particles influenced <b>frost</b> <b>heave,</b> where effective stress is the sum of pressure from above ground and the capillary pressure.|$|E

50|$|Cold climates {{may present}} special challenges. Road salt {{contains}} chlorides that could migrate through the porous pavement into groundwater. Snow plow blades could catch block edges and damage surfaces. Sand {{cannot be used}} for snow and ice control on perveous asphalt or concrete because it will plug the pores and reduce permeability. Infiltrating runoff may freeze below the pavement, causing <b>frost</b> <b>heave,</b> though design modifications can reduce this risk. These potential problems do not mean that porous pavement cannot be used in cold climates. Porous pavement designed to reduce <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> has been used successfully in Norway. Furthermore, experience suggests that rapid drainage below porous surfaces increases the rate of snow melt above.|$|E
