However, <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> <b>materials</b> with different valences (i. e. III-V, II-VI and IV semiconductors) {{can be difficult to}} form with high quality. Using ZnSe/GaAs as a model system, we explore the use of UV illumination during heterovalent interface growth by molecular beam epitaxy as a way to modify the interface properties. We find that UV illumination alters the mixture of chemical bonds at the interface, permitting the formation of Ga-Se bonds that help to passivate the underlying GaAs layer. Illumination also helps to reduce defects in the ZnSe epilayer. These results suggest that moderate UV illumination during growth may be used as a way to improve the optical properties of both the GaAs and ZnSe layers {{on either side of the}} interface.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} Hamiltonians describing low frequency edge states at the <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> <b>materials</b> characterized by different topological phases. We consider general as well as (fermionic) time reversal symmetric (TRS) models. In the former case, Hamiltonians are classified as Fredholm operators with possibly non-trivial index, while in the latter case, the classification involves a Z_ 2 index. These indices {{are related to the}} number of topologically protected edge states and are by construction immune to a large class of random perturbations. We introduce one dimensional scattering problems along the edge and show that the scattering matrix, modeling transmission and reflection transport along the edge, is very sensitive to the topology of the Hamiltonians. In topologically protected cases, we show that transmission is always possible, and hence that localization cannot occur. We show that the absence of backscattering is also topologically protected for specific propagating signals. Asymptotic results are obtained within the diffusion approximation of field propagation.
