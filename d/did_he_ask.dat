2500|$|Xu Chu {{was known}} to be a {{cautious}} and serious person who did not talk much and was very mindful of rules and regulations. Once, Cao Cao's cousin Cao Ren came from Jing Province to meet Cao Cao – who had recently received the title of a vassal king, King of Wei (魏王), from Emperor Xian – in the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). Cao Cao was still in his personal chambers, with Xu Chu standing guard outside, when Cao Ren arrived. Cao Ren asked Xu Chu to join him in the side room for a chat. However, Xu Chu replied, [...] "The King is coming out soon." [...] He then entered Cao Cao's chambers. Cao Ren was very unhappy with Xu Chu. Later, someone told Xu Chu, [...] "The General (Cao Ren) is a close relative and important subject of the King. He lowered himself when he asked to chat with you. How could you reject him?" [...] Xu Chu responded, [...] "He may be a close relative and important subject of the King, but he's in charge of external defences at the borders. I, Xu Chu, am in charge of internal security. If he wanted to chat with me, we could do so in public. Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> to chat with me in private?" [...] Cao Cao was impressed and he favoured Xu Chu even more after he heard about the incident, so he promoted him to Central Resolute General (中堅將軍).|$|E
6000|$|McIlheny: [...] "Yessor! I can {{appreciate}} ahl that. But fwhy <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> {{her if she}} was the lady? Fwhy <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> {{her if she was}} a cuke? That's what I wannt to know!" ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{until their}} hunger was fully {{satisfied}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> {{them how they}} came to be cast away.|$|E
60|$|TOUCHIT.--So I did, so I <b>did!</b> <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> me fifteen shillings from Piccadilly, and I {{told him}} to go to--to {{somebody}} whose name begins with a D.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed to}} have heard the name before, but still <b>he</b> hesitated. 'Ah--what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> paint?' <b>he</b> <b>asked,</b> with growing caution.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> Gudrun as well?' {{she asked}} herself at once. 'Does he want to protect himself, or <b>does</b> <b>he</b> think I would not go alone?' She was tormented {{by the thought that}} he wanted to protect himself. But at the end of all, she only said to herself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] Andy {{uttered the}} exclamation {{before he had}} time to think. [...] "Did he--that is, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> about any land in particular?" ...|$|E
60|$|Three times within {{fifteen minutes}} <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> {{in vain for}} a shelter, and then his courage had oozed out at his fingers' ends.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is he {{thinking}} of?' {{she asked}} herself. Her thoughts flashed back. 'And why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> me so peculiarly {{whether he should}} wire them at home?' ...|$|E
60|$|This was <b>done,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> {{who volunteered}} for the first climb.|$|R
6000|$|The {{agitation}} of {{the preceding}} incidents had caused such an expenditure of the juices which had become necessary {{to the mouth of}} the peddler, that a new supply of the weed was required before he could turn his attention to business of lesser moment. This <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> abruptly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{toned down}} the news, {{so as not}} to excite him, and left out the {{occurrence}} in Hanover Street. He listened with his accustomed interest, but when I had <b>done</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> no questions, and lay for a long time silent. Then he begged me to bring my chair nearer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] she said, [...] "he doesn't {{promise to}} take the play, {{even if you do}} {{everything}} to a 't.' <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> you to lunch again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had spoken}} these callous words without even looking {{on the two}} unfortunate women; nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> them any further {{questions}} just then, but continued speaking to the sergeant: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said De Stancy, looking {{him in the}} face. 'And does it {{make you}} feel you had better be off? How about that telegram? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> you to send it, or did he not?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Wilson's dream-like {{manner is}} often mimicked by the platoon, mostly Privates Walker and Fraser, {{but the men}} like him, and some admire him (including Jones, Godfrey, {{and most of all}} Private Pike). Rather than bark orders as a {{sergeant}} would be expected to <b>do,</b> <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> [...] "Would you mind awfully falling in, please?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jude {{staggered}} {{under the}} news; could eat no breakfast; {{and kept on}} drinking tea because his mouth was so dry. Then presently {{he went back to}} his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so confronted. Everything seemed turning to satire. And yet, what could the poor girl <b>do?</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> himself: and felt worse than shedding tears.|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} <b>do</b> this <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> {{to speak in}} private with the king, {{saying that he had}} a most {{important}} communication to make.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{to begin}} then," [...] Harcutt said; [...] "you {{have been with}} him some time to-day. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> you any {{questions}} about the locality? Did he show any curiosity {{in any of the}} residents?" ...|$|E
60|$|No longer <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> why am I such a fool, {{but why are}} we {{all such}} fools? He became Man on the {{automobile}} of civilisation, crushing his thousands daily in his headlong and yet aimless career....|$|E
60|$|He {{wished the}} subject dropped, since, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> the obvious question--in what my Lady Ostermore {{could have been}} the cause of Hortensia's flight--he would provoke, he knew, a storm of censure from his wife. Therefore he fell silent.|$|E
60|$|She <b>did</b> as <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> her, and <b>he</b> {{was silent}} {{until the last}} note of the barcarolle died away in a softly murmured breath.|$|R
60|$|Still Ladd waited. He {{grew more}} silent, grimmer {{as the time}} of action approached. Gale {{wondered}} what the plan of attack would be. Yet <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>ask.</b> <b>He</b> waited ready for orders.|$|R
50|$|Sonea and Akkarin {{are able}} to pick off many of the Ichani one by one, while another is killed {{with the help of}} Regin, Sonea's old Novice enemy. One Ichani is then killed by the Thieves and another by the Guild. Eventually only three Ichani remain. But Lorlen is badly wounded, and tells Akkarin that he understands why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> what <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> if Sonea is ok, and then he dies and Akkarin takes his ring.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Richard smiled. 'The King sent {{no second}} summons to Pevensey, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> why De Aquila had not obeyed the first. Yes, that was Fulke's work. I know not {{how he did}} it, but it was well and swiftly done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These are two things," [...] she said, [...] "which I do not understand. The Baron Domiloff has repute as a cunning {{and very}} shrewd diplomatist. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> you for no pledge {{that you would}} not speak of these things to the King?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still," [...] said Lydia, {{when they}} were at leisure to resume the conversation, [...] "I do not quite {{understand}} why you have come to me. Personally you are quite welcome; but in what way did you expect to relieve Mr. Byron's mind by visiting me? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> you to come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'His {{father was}} major in the ---th dragoons, {{and was one}} of the Randolfs of ---shire. His mother was a Charlecote. His birth is as good as our own, and you saw that he is a gentleman. His {{character}} and talents have gained his present situation, and it is a profession that gives every opening for ability; nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> for me till his fortune is made.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{told them}} what you say, about the one hundred and forty {{thousand}} men in Scotland, <b>did</b> I!' <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> with evident delight. 'That was bold.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What are {{you going}} to <b>do</b> to-day?' <b>he</b> <b>asked,</b> on the last morning before he was to leave Hollywell. 'I must see you alone before I go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Braile limbered {{himself from}} his splint-bottom chair, and came forward {{to the edge of}} the porch, as if to be sure of {{spitting}} quite under the claybank's body. Not until he had folded himself down into his seat again and tilted it back <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask,</b> [...] "Goin' to order a suit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I did not indicate, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask,</b> what I {{should do}} if sent for. [...] He did not indicate, nor did I ask, {{what he should}} do if the Queen [...] {{continued}} to press him to go on, in spite of his advice to her to [...] move in another direction.—April 23, 1880.|$|E
60|$|On the way Arthur {{resumed his}} rapid recital and strove to post the young detective {{as well as}} he was able. Fogerty made no remarks, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>ask</b> a single {{question}} until Weldon had told him everything he could think of. Then he made a few pointed enquiries and presently they had arrived at the station.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} did. Poor old man! If you had <b>done</b> what <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> you I wonder whether his affection would have lasted {{as it has}} done." ...|$|R
60|$|Here the Captain chuckled, engulfed his fresh quid, and {{proceeded}} to explain {{the nature of their}} errand. Having <b>done</b> so, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> Coleman what <b>he</b> thought of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Torkingham {{has been}} here this afternoon,' said his grandmother; 'and {{he wants me to}} let him meet some of the choir here to-night for practice. They who live at this end of the parish won't go to his house to try over the tunes, because 'tis so far, they say, and so 'tis, poor men. So he's going to see what coming to them will <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> <b>asks</b> {{if you would like to}} join.' ...|$|R
