Duplicate systems were operated for 72 days at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 7. 5 gVS l? 1 d? 1. Early in the experiment most of the methane was produced in the 2 nd stage. This situation gradually reversed as methanogenesis became established in the 1 st stage digester, which eventually produced 86 – 87 % of the total system methane. The total methane production was 0. 2 l g? 1 VSadded with 60 – 62 % volatile solids destruction. No fouling was experienced during the experiment at a transmembrane flux rate of 3. 5 l m? 2 h? 1.

40|$|Bioprocess {{development}} and optimization that culminates into simple, cost-effective, efficient and affordable wastewater treatment technologies, {{has emerged as}} an effective tool in transcribing water and sanitation policy objectives into simple practical terms. Bioprocess research at the Rhodes Universitys Environmental Biotechnology Research Unit identified the Independent High Rate Algal Pond (I-HRAP) as one such technology for tertiary wastewater treatment. This paper describes {{the development of a}} denitrification unit, termed Algal Tertiary Treatment to complement and augment the nutrient removal capability of the I-HRAP on a pilot scale. It was designed as a 1000 litre drowned anaerobic trickle <b>filter</b> <b>bioreactor,</b> utilizing algal biomass as a carbon source for heterotrophic denitrification. Effluent from the I-HRAP was fed into the reactor under different loading regimes and analyzed for nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and phosphorus removal efficiencies. Nitrate and nitrite removal efficiencies exceeded 80 % and 95 % respectively.

High rate aerobic treatment processes like activated sludge plants, trickling filters, rotating discs, submerged aerated <b>filters</b> or membrane <b>bioreactor</b> plants require less space. The advantage of subsurface flow CWs compared to those technologies is their operational robustness which is particularly important in developing countries. The fact that CWs do not produce secondary sludge (sewage sludge) is another advantage {{as there is no}} need for sewage sludge treatment. However, primary sludge from primary settling tanks does get produced and needs to be removed and treated.|$|R

40|$|Filtration {{of ethanol}} {{fermentation}} medium and broth by using symmetric and asymmetric ceramic membranes {{has been studied}} in an internal <b>filter</b> <b>bioreactor.</b> Factors studied included membrane structure and pore size, medium sterilization, and concentrations of glucose, yeast extract in the medium, yeast cell and protein in broth. The aim {{was to determine the}} main factors responsible for the decline in filtration performance during ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Flux index (Fi) of a new concept has been developed to evaluate the degree of flux decline during the membrane fouling process. Fi was defined as the ratio of the membrane flux at certain filtration time (t = t) to the initial(t = - 0) flux of pure water, not the initial (t = + 0) flux of the test fluid. Flux with sterilized medium was approximately two-fold higher than that with unsterilized medium although the reason could not be explained clearly. Glucose, interaction between glucose and yeast extract, yeast cells, and proteins in fermentation broth were found to play an important part in membrane fouling. Fi of the symmetric membrane decreased to a less extent than that of the asymmetric membrane with increasing glucose concentration. But, the result with various yeast cell concentrations turned out to be contrary. Fouling was more serious for asymmetric membrane during the filtration of fermentation supernatant. This was thought to be due to different fouling mechanisms for the two types of membrane...|$|E

In this study, we investigated two biological wastewater treatment reactors designed to recover potable water for a spacefaring crew being tested at Johnson Space Center. The experiment (Lunar-Mars Life Support Test Project-Phase III) consisted of four crew members confined in a test chamber for 91 days. In order to recycle all water during the experiment, an immobilized cell bioreactor (ICB) was employed for organic carbon removal and a trickling <b>filter</b> <b>bioreactor</b> (TFB) was utilized for ammonia removal, followed by physical-chemical treatment. In this study, the spatial distribution of various microorganisms within each bioreactor was analyzed by using biofilm samples taken from four locations in the ICB and three locations in the TFB. Three target genes were used for characterization of bacteria: the 16 S rRNA gene for the total bacterial community, the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and the nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene for denitrifying bacteria. A combination of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), sequence, and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the microbial community composition in the ICB and the TFB consisted mainly of Proteobacteria, low-G+C gram-positive bacteria, and a Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group. Fifty-seven novel 16 S rRNA genes, 8 novel amoA genes, and 12 new nosZ genes were identified in this study. Temporal shifts in the species composition of total bacteria in both the ICB and the TFB and ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria in the TFB were also detected when the biofilms were compared with the inocula after 91 days. This result suggests that specific microbial populations were either brought in by the crew or enriched in the reactors during the course of operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project is to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility and practicality of operating a methanotrophic mobile trickle <b>filter</b> <b>bioreactor</b> (MMB) unit to effectively reduce or eliminate trichloroethylene (TCE) and associated hydrocarbons from contaminated groundwater. The two-column trickle filter system can process 1. 67 gallons per minute (gpm) of contaminated groundwater. During this project, the pilot system will evaluate, optimize, and demonstrate methanotrophic treatment technology (MTT). The mobile system will receive a 1 [...] 4 % methane to air mixture for stimulating the methanotrophic TCE degrading bacteria, thereby increasing the rates of degradation of these contaminants. This project will also evaluate the efficacy of different bacteria for degrading TCE {{for use in the}} system at the laboratory-scale sample groundwater monitoring wells at TNX and set up the system for continued operation. The trickle filter system may be used to inexpensively treat other small-scale organic waste streams at SRS after the initial start-up. The MTT was demonstrated as an effective and efficient method of degrading TCE in the laboratory and during a field-scale in situ demonstration for degrading TCE in a groundwater plume at SRS. The methanotrophic bacteria increase significantly in population numbers and in the production of methane monooxygenase (MMO), an extremely powerful oxidizer. MMO was demonstrated as effective in oxidizing TCE and other recalcitrant compounds in laboratory studies. In the presence of MMO, TCE is oxidized to TCE-epoxide, which breaks down spontaneously into simple, easily degraded, daughter compounds. The system will receive a 1 [...] 4 % methane to air mixture, which will effectively grow and maintain the methanotrophic bacteria that will degrade TCE. This demonstration will have broad applications to bioremediating contaminated groundwater systems where in situ bioremediation is not practical...|$|E

40|$|Biological {{processes}} {{that occur in}} MSW produce odorous gas emissions affecting health {{of the people and}} environment. Bio <b>filters</b> are <b>bioreactors</b> most commonly used for odour management. This study focused on evaluation of mature compost based bio filter {{that can be used in}} biological treatment facilities in Sri Lanka. The first experiment was with one layer of filter media, whereas the second with two layers having a 10 cm gap in between them. One wet and the other dry were maintained at 40 % (w/w) and 20 % (w/w) moisture contents, respectively. The odorous gases were obtained from an Inclined Step Grate (ISG) composting system. Ammonia was the reference gas. When one layer filter was used 90 % of incoming ammonia gas filtered. After modifications due to high moisture content of 40 %, high filtration efficiency of 95 % from wet bed and remaining 5 % from dry bed were achieved. The wet bed prevented cracking and air channelling effect. The temperatures between 22 – 270 C and pH 6 to 9 of both filter media and stability of volatile compounds were favourable for microbial growth and survival. Doubled or layered filters with smaller depths and gaps between them would be the best design to achieve higher odour filtration efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Future long {{duration}} human exploration missions {{away from}} Earth will require closed-loop regenerative {{life support systems}} to reduce launch mass, reduce dependency on resupply and increase the level of mission self sufficiency. Such systems may {{be based on the}} integration of biological and physiocochemical processes to produce potable water, breathable atmosphere and nutritious food from metabolic and other mission wastes. Over the period 1995 to 1998 a series of ground-based tests were conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Johnson Space Center, to evaluate the performance of advanced closed-loop life support technologies with real human metabolic and hygiene loads. Named the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test Project (LMLSTP), four integrated human tests were conducted with increasing duration, complexity and closure. The first test, LMLSTP Phase I, was designed to demonstrate the ability of higher plants to revitalize cabin atmosphere. A single crew member spent 15 days within an atmospherically closed chamber containing 11. 2 square meters of actively growing wheat. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen levels were maintained by control of the rate of photosynthesis through manipulation of light intensity or the availability of carbon dioxide and included integrated physicochemical systems. During the second and third tests, LMLSTP Phases II & IIa, four crew members spent 30 days and 60 days, respectively, in a larger sealed chamber. Advanced physicochemical life support hardware was used to regenerate the atmosphere and produce potable water from wastewater. Air revitalization was accomplished by using a molecular sieve and a Sabatier processor for carbon dioxide absorption and reduction, respectively, with oxygen generation performed by water hydrolysis. Production of potable water from wastewater included urine treatment (vapor compression distillation), primary treatment (ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis and multi-filtration) and post processing. For the Phase II test the water recovery rate ranged from 95 to 98 %, depending on the processor. LMLSTP Phase III, the fourth test of the series, had a duration of 91 days and included four crew members. The test demonstrated an integration of physicochemical and biological technologies for air revitalization, water recovery and waste processing. Wheat supplemented the physicochemical air revitalization systems by providing approximately 25 % of the oxygen required for the 4 -person crew. The water recovery system included immobilized cell and trickling <b>filter</b> <b>bioreactors</b> for primary water treatment, reverse osmosis and air evaporation systems for secondary water treatment, followed by post processing. The 8 day initial supply of water was recycled through the chamber and crew 10 times {{over the course of the}} test. Grain from the wheat together with fresh lettuce from a small growth chamber within the crew chamber provided supplementation to the stored food system, but at a level less than 5 % of the crew s caloric requirement. An incinerator was used to demonstrate mineralization of the crew s solid waste, with the combustion products (mainly carbon dioxide) returned to the wheat for conversion to oxygen...|$|R
40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the University of Stuttgart, Germany, we have developed an economic two-stage process for the biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes. The process consists of an anaerobic step for the partial reductive dehalogenation of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE). In a subsequent aerobic step the products of anaerobic dehalogenation cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) are completely dechlorinated by an ethene-utilizing culture. A 30 -liter loop reactor (anaerobic stage) was combined with a 30 -liter trickling <b>filter</b> <b>bioreactor</b> (aerobic stage). The anaerobic stage was inoculated with the strictly anaerobic bacterium Dehalospirillum multivorans. For the aerobic stage we used an ethene-utilizing mixed culture (K 20) which exhibits high cometabolic activity against cDCE and VC. Based on the structural analogy between ethene and the chlorinated ethenes the compounds are oxidized by the same initial enzymes. Ethene serves as source of carbon and energy, electron donor and thus maintains {{the viability of the}} cells. It also serves as an inducer of an initial monooxygenase which is responsible for the cooxidative activity of the cells. The mixed culture K 20 consists of at least five bacterial strains. All of them can cooxidize chloroethenes and show high tolerance against cDCE (up to 6 mM in the liquid phase). The dechlorination of cDCE (200 æM) was not perturbed by the presence of TCE (100 mu M) or PCE (100 mu M). The transformation yields [mol of chlorinated ethene/mol of ethene] exceeds comparative data in the literature (0. 51 and 0. 61 for cDCE and VC, respectively). The lab scale bioreactors have now been operated for more than one year under non-sterile conditions. During this continuous process the rates of reductive dechlorination were constant, being 2. 7 mu mol l(exp - 1) h(exp - 1) for PCE and 3. 6 mu mol l(exp - 1) h(exp - 1) for TCE. The cDCE degradation rate was 3. 9 æmol l(exp - 1) h(exp - 1) in the aerobic reactor. Basing on these results a pilot scale experiment with a reactor volume of 2 x 10 m 3 was started...|$|E

This study was focused on the performance of UASB-AF (R 1) and HUASB-AF (R 2) treatment systems and the granules development. Seed sludge was deposited into HUASB column up to a third of the height. Palm oil shells were then packed into the HUASB (above seed sludge) as well as AF reactors to promote growth of microorganisms. The R 1 and R 2 systems were operated simultaneously, fed with raw food manufacturing wastewater taken from Azhar Food Manufacturing Factory. Parameters measured to evaluate the performance of the process were pH, COD, NH 3 -N, oil and grease and total phosphorus. The highest average COD removal efficiency, at 99 %, were detected in R 1 and R 2 systems, both at OLR 10. 56 g COD/L. d. Moreover, the presence of aggregated bio particles with diameter ranges from 2. 934 to 5. 00 mm were observed in both UASB and HUASB reactors.

40|$|The {{currently}} applied {{paradigm for}} municipal wastewater {{treatment in the}} European Union does not meet basic sustainability criteria. Indeed, it runs counter to the stated goals of recent European Council policies regarding sustainable development. This disposal based linear system uses aerobic microbiology as the core technology. This results [...] {{in the case of}} activated sludge plants, for example [...] in a requirement for large capital investment, heavy usage of fossil fuels, high technology operational control and the generation of large quantities of sludge requiring treatment before safe reuse/recycle. A direct anaerobic treatment approach is proposed in this study would assist in meeting sustainability criteria and offer significant advantages to the conventional treatment approach. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has long been recognised as a sustainable waste/wastewater treatment strategy. The major application of high-rate AD has been for high-strength industrial wastewaters, e. g. food processing, brewing, etc., where mesophilic high-rate AD has been tremendously successful. There is great potential for expanding the application of anaerobic wastewater treatment. One area of particular interest is AD for the treatment of low-strength, high volume wastestreams which are discharged at sub-mesophilic ( 1 year), low-temperature (10 - 15 Â°C) anaerobic bioreactor operation, for the treatment of synthetic sewage, was investigated. The effect of temperature on the bioprocess was investigated {{through the use of a}} mesophilically (37 Â°C) operated control bioreactor. Three hybrid bioreactors (R 1 -R 3) were seeded with a mesophilic inoculum, and used to treat a synthetic sewage wastewater at 37, 15 and 10 Â°C respectively. Organic loading rates (OLRs) of 0. 5 - 6 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m- 3 d- 1 and hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 1. 5 - 12 h were applied during a 1. 5 -year trial. Despite transient disimprovements, mean total COD removal efficiency and methane biogas concentrations exceeded 70 % and 50 %, respectively, for all bioreactors. Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) testing indicated that a psychroactive biomass developed in the low-temperature bioreactors. The data obtained suggest that a mesophilic inoculum can physiologically adapt to sub-optimal temperature, and efficiently treat low-strength wastewater at temperatures as low as 10 Â°C. In the second phase of this study (chapter 3) two hybrid bioreactors (R 4 and R 5), were each seeded with a mesophilic biomass, and employed for the treatment of synthetic sewage at 12 Â°C and applied OLRs of 0. 5 - 6 kg COD m- 3 d- 1, and HRTs of 2 - 24 h. Based on the results obtained in chapter 2 the use of an alternative fixed-film matrix material; granulated pumice stone, to enhance process efficiency and stability was evaluated. In addition the reproducibility of LtAD for municipal wastewater treatment was investigated. Stable bioprocess performance was demonstrated with COD removal efficiencies of > 70 % obtained by both bioreactors. SMA and biodegradability assays demonstrated the development of a psychrotolerant, sewage-degrading consortium within the biomass of both bioreactors. Bacterial communities, as deduced from clone library analysis at the conclusion of the trial, were phylogenetically diverse, consisting of important fermentative and hydrolytic populations. Archaeal methanogenic dynamics indicated that acetoclastic methanogenic activity directly correlated to bioreactor performance. In the final phase of this study (chapter 4) the feasibility of direct anaerobic treatment of raw and settled sewage under temperate climatic conditions (12 Â°C) was investigated. Two expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) anaerobic <b>filter</b> (AF) hybrid <b>bioreactors,</b> R 6 and R 7, were employed to treat raw sewage and settled sewage (primary effluent; the liquid fraction following settlement of primary sludge), respectively, sourced from the city of Galway, Ireland. The bioreactors were operated at HRTs of 3 - 24 h in a trial of c. 140 days. Successful treatment of both influent types was achieved with consistent effluent quality of < 125 mg l- 1 COD being obtained at OLRs of 0. 2 - 2. 4 kg COD m- 3 d- 1, volumetric loading rates (VLRs) of 1 - 4 m 3 wastewater m- 3 bioreactor d- 1 and HRTs of 3 - 6 h. Bacterial clone libraries at the conclusion of the trial demonstrated communities that were phylogenetically diverse, similar to those observed in chapter 3, with the identification of key hydrolytic and fermentative populations being achieved. Archaeal clone library analysis indicated that acetoclastic methanogenesis was dominant in both R 6 and R 7 by the completion of the trial. In summary, LtAD was demonstrated as an effective and efficient wastewater treatment approach for municipal wastewater. Combining bioprocess monitoring with physiological and molecular analyses, provided valuable insights into the complex microbial communities underpinning the LtAD process...|$|R
