The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E
500|$|Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer {{that the}} rain was the biggest {{challenge}} of the night shoot, as it was [...] "beyond freezing". She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E
500|$|Several Americans {{died during}} and after the raid. A {{prisoner}} weakened by illness {{died of a heart attack}} as a Ranger carried him from the barracks to the main gate. The Ranger later recalled, [...] "The excitement had been too much for him, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> really sad. He was only a hundredfeet from the freedom he had not known for nearly threeyears." [...] Another prisoner died of illness just as the group had reached Talavera. Although Mucci had ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could evacuate Fisher to get medical attention, it was never dispatched, and he died the next day. His last words were [...] "Good luck on the way out." [...] The other Ranger killed during the raid was Sweezy, who was struck in the back by two rounds from friendly fire. Both Fisher and Sweezy are buried at Manila National Cemetery. Twenty of Pajota's guerrillas were injured, as were twoScouts and twoRangers.|$|E

5000|$|... {{the reporters}} comment: [...] "Just as <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a bit {{difficult}} for beginners, isnt it?" [...] (やはり初心者には取っつきにくいか？) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I am forgetting {{all about}} my brothers," [...] added Dick hastily. [...] "Let us leave this {{alone for the}} present. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> safe enough." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{working at}} the studio, Herren met Joshua Kay and Romulo del Castillo, two Miami-based {{producers}} who had founded Schematic Records, a label known for IDM. Herren recorded and composed music on his MPC and manipulated it to fit Schematic's aesthetic. While {{working at the}} recording studio, Herren felt that the hip hop musicians coming in had very trite lyrics, and felt he could use them for his own Prefuse 73 material. For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren sampled more famous hip hop records by artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Herren stated that he used some of his favorite MCs instead of the musicians he worked with, as he felt these artists were [...] "saying totally relevant stuff, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just my excitement to make it happen. But a vocal doesn't have to say anything. Why not challenge people's imagination and let it say whatever they want it to?" [...] For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren created the music using two turntables plugged into his MPC. To create the glitch sounds through the MPC, Herren switched between different sample sources by instantaneously silencing groups of audio channels at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Shermer, who {{considers}} himself {{an admirer of}} Rand, has tempered his judgment. Contrasting Leonard Peikoff's [...] "heavy-hammer approach" [...] with the [...] "big-tent approach" [...] of The Atlas Society, Shermer told Ed Hudgins: [...] "If we're close enough {{on the same page}} about many things, I think it's more useful to cut people some slack, rather than going after them on some smaller points. I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, if you were an Objectivist, you wouldn't have.' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> those sorts of judgments made by some Objectiv that I objected to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{sound of}} the {{original}} rave style is barely (if at all) discernible (save some typical analog synth lines) {{in the majority of}} bands referred to as new rave. Bands such as The Sunshine Underground, Cansei de Ser Sexy and Hot Chip are often labeled as new rave due to their large following by fans of the genre. M.I.A. has been described as [...] "a new raver before it was old." [...] Several have publicly declared they {{had nothing to do with}} the genre. Stylist Carri Mundane described it as funny, saying New Rave was [...] "Vacant in retro. It’s just a marketing machine.... <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a fun time but I’m more excited about what happens now. The next level - the next generation. There’s a mood of neo-spiritualism and futurism that excites me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Devine, dryly, [...] "as we'll {{probably}} be here {{a day or}} two, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I'll {{tell you about it}} when we get supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all {{straight}} enough. Aronson {{must know}} that he couldn't get any such money out of us unless everything was as straight as a string." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she replied, {{with a faint}} note of truculence in her tone. [...] "You know I'm not {{short of}} money, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> where <b>I</b> should find you." ...|$|R
2500|$|The lead single, [...] "Chains", {{was issued}} {{ahead of the}} album in September 1994 in Australia, which peaked at No.4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also reached No.6 in the UK, No.7 in New Zealand, No.9 in Ireland and No.20 in Canada. In 1995 she toured Europe, {{appearing}} on Top of the Pops, which broadcast {{to an audience of}} 60million people. In the European market Arena was an unknown and a fresh commodity, she opined: [...] "I loved every minute of that – of people not knowing who I was. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> tiring fighting the individual thing. It was good to not {{be a part of a}} past and being accepted as an artist. Not having to carry this Young Talent Time luggage which was constantly shoved in my face." [...] Five additional singles were released, [...] "Sorrento Moon (I Remember)" [...] (February 1995), [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] (May), [...] "Wasn't It Good" [...] (September), [...] "Show Me Heaven" [...] (November) and [...] "That's the Way a Woman Feels" [...] (March 1996).|$|E
2500|$|In May 1994 Steć, Pazik, Major Donny MacNeil of Canada and Colonel Clayton Yaache of Ghana {{along with}} four Tunisian UNAMIR peacekeepers {{attempted}} unsuccessfully an evacuation {{of some of}} those trapped in the Hotel des Mille Collines with MacNeil and Steć reading the names of those to be evacuated in the crowded hotel lobby. [...] "I had a 'Schindler's List' of the people we were allowed to save. The conditions were: they did need a visa guarantee and a financial guarantee that they would be received outside Rwanda (...). Although approved by the Rwandan Chief of Staff, the convoy was halted by military and militia and following a very dangerous stand off they managed to return the refuges safely to the Hotel des Milles Collines. A few blocks away from the Mille Collines, there was a church, l' Eglise St. Famille, with more than 5000 refugees. Every night militia were killing people there. We did nothing to evacuate them and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because they didn't have visas".|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I {{heard some}} one {{coming through the}} bushes," [...] replied Bob, as he began a {{vigorous}} attack on the food; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nothing but the wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{a hundred}} miles, as the crow flies," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> longer by the railroad, and we'll have some climbing to do--to {{get into the}} Rockies." ...|$|R
6000|$|Or <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the {{handkerchief}} of the Lord, [...] A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt, [...] Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, {{that we may}} see [...] and remark, and say Whose? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time {{to start}} on the return, if you young ladies {{have got to be}} in by ten," [...] said Dick, at last. [...] "Even as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> I haven't allowed any time for {{punctures}} or breakdowns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're safe enough, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{a mighty}} neat job, Cerise, taken altogether, {{although}} the fools {{have been watching}} me night and day. That's the reason I did not come sooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only one before," [...] {{said the}} boy. [...] "The last one, when his daughters went out. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> their coaxing got mother {{to let me}} go. My father {{was killed in the}} war." ...|$|E
6000|$|Torrance {{considered}} for a second, and then smiled significantly as {{he glanced at his}} daughter's face. [...] "Well, you would be 'most as safe down there--and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> born in you," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Come on {{down and}} let us see how the engine works. We can do that easily enough, for it's a good deal like the engine of an auto, or a motor boat," [...] went on Tom.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think <b>it's</b> funny,--don't you? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but what's {{going to}} become of me? That's what I want to know. I've been in trouble before, but never in any like this. And who got me into it? You!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just what I say," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "Mrs. Hummer sticks her bill {{right down}} their throats and then pumps {{up the food}} she has already swallowed. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a good thing that}} the babies have short bills." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of {{them are}} in the workings, some of them on the range, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for Vancouver the Fraser crowd started out. Seemed to me they meant to get there before they stopped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I seem to {{recollect}} that I was mighty sleepy once. It {{comes back}} to me that I {{wanted to say something}} to the driver and that I couldn't make him heed me. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the heat, but I felt swimmy for a moment. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was dumbfounded--this was {{my thanks}} for saving her from Jubal! I {{turned and looked}} at the corpse. [...] "May be that I saved you from a worse fate, old man," [...] I said, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> lost on Dian, for she never seemed to notice it at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{reminds me}} that I haven't thanked you," [...] said Dusky. [...] "I knew there was {{something}} wrong over here, but I didn't know what. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a hunter. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good thing that I heeded your warn-ing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{going to}} rain, so I {{shall have to}} go any way," [...] {{answered}} Bab, {{taking advantage of the}} black clouds rolling up the sky, for she scorned to own that she was afraid of any thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Snag! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a snag. <b>It</b> bids fair to {{make all}} our labor and {{millions}} of dollars--wasted.... But I'm {{not asking you to}} come back just to help us over this snag. I mean will you come back for good--and stick?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{strain of}} the journey on a played-out constitution, and, as I think I suggested, the effect of {{excitement}} on a diseased heart. The man was under a high tension the last day or two. It's a sure thing he had something on his mind. After all, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a delusion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes. Left my {{mechanic}} in charge. Why, I {{just kind}} of decided suddenly. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> what they call an inspiration. Always wanted a long trip, anyway, and I thought maybe in Seattle I could hook up with something a little peppier than Schoenstrom. Maybe something in Alaska. Always wished I were a mechanical or civil engineer so----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyway," [...] thought she, [...] "I {{have taught}} {{him a new}} trick and one he {{is n't likely to}} forget. He knows now that Granny still knows a few tricks that he doesn't, and next time he won't feel so sure he knows it all. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth while even if I didn't catch Quacker. My, but he would have tasted good!" [...] Granny smacked her lips and started for home.|$|E
6000|$|Or <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a uniform}} hieroglyphic, [...] And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, [...] Growing among black folks as among white, [...] Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I {{give them the}} same, I [...] receive them the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, gentlemen,' {{says the}} cigar man, 'I don't {{blame you for}} not wanting to play. I've {{forgotten}} the fine points of the game, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>it's</b> <b>been</b> so long since I indulged. Now, {{how long are you}} gentlemen {{going to be in the}} city?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{see that}} bit of black rock {{cropping}} out of the hill-side. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about {{two hundred and fifty}} yards away, and is about the size a red-skin's head would be if he were crawling through the grass towards us.
