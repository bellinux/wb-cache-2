50|$|Hammer and gong - The <b>hammer</b> <b>lever</b> (F) is {{actuated}} by pins or teeth (G) {{on one of}} the striking train wheels. As the wheel turns the pin lifts the <b>hammer</b> <b>lever,</b> until the lever slips off the pin, allowing the hammer to drop, hitting the gong (E). Early house clocks used traditional hemispherical shaped bells. Later house clocks used gongs made of long steel tubes or bars, which have a sound more like large church bells. Mantel and other small clocks use thick hardened steel wires, which are coiled into a spiral to save space.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: GTM have {{developed}} a primary torque standard which covers the range from 1 Nm to 1 kNm with a single load frame and only one weight stack per direction of operation. The design comprises a double-sided <b>lever,</b> <b>supported</b> on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a counter-torque drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the <b>lever</b> <b>support,</b> less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass shaped springs for the <b>lever</b> <b>support</b> can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of lever length falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides. Using the same principle of elastic hinges, the overall torque range can be increased to stretch from 0. 1 Nm to over 20 kNm, with only two separate load frames...|$|R

50|$|The non-reciprocating {{cocking handle}} is located above the {{handguard}} and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45° angle.

The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{the last}} decades, growing {{competitive}} pressures and increased customer expectations have pushed western manufacturers {{to extend their}} offerings through the provision of value-adding services.

The first one focuses on the knowledge management (KM) theory, and was aimed at defining a general framework about knowledge management. The second step consisted in applying the resulting framework to a set of papers focused on servitization and installed base information issues. Findings: Results identify the conceptual relevance and guidelines for knowledge management (KM) as a <b>lever</b> <b>supporting</b> the servitization process of manufacturers. Originality/value: This work identifies relationships between KM practices (both organizational and technological) and key aspects of the servitization strategies and processes.

The Remington Navy revolver is slightly smaller framed than the Army, and in [...]36 caliber with an 7.375 inch Navy 7.5 inch barrel length. There were three progressive models made; the Remington-Beals Army & Navy (1860-1862), the 1861 Army & Navy (1862-1863), and the New Model Army & Navy (1863-1875). The three models are nearly identical in size and appearance. Subtle but noticeable differences in <b>hammers,</b> loading <b>levers,</b> and cylinders help identify each model.

40|$|A {{new design}} of primary torque {{standard}} machines (TSM) with feedback-control of the <b>lever</b> <b>support</b> was described at IMEKO – XVI. World Congress in Vienna [1]. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present the performance of a hand operated option model in the wide range from 2 N·m up to 3000 N·m. Influences of hand operation are estimated as well as ambient influences like temperature changes and air flow. A protection chamber against the ambient influences was built and the improvement is shown. The TSM has three mass stacks to cover all transducer capacities from 20 N·m up to 3000 N·m in each ten steps. The masses are calibrated within 5 · 10 - 6 by German DKD. The lever arms were precisely adjusted and also DKD-calibrated within 5 · 10 - 6. The adjustment procedure is described. The measurement uncertainty is calculated by the design data according GUM. In addition the best measurement capability of the TSM and the relative deviations are calculated by the results of several torque transfer standards, former calibrated at PTB. Both calculations are compared. The next steps of the upgrade concept – from a hand-operated model to a full-automated model – are illuminated regarding the requirements in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Mechanistic {{reasoning}} is an epistemic practice central within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. Although {{there has been}} some work on mechanistic reasoning in the research literature and standards documents, much of this work targets domain-general characterizations of mechanistic reasoning; this study provides domain-specific illustrations of mechanistic reasoning. The data in this study comes from the Assessment of Mechanistic Reasoning Project (AMRP) (Weinberg, 2012), designed using item response theory modeling to diagnose individuals’ mechanistic reasoning about systems of levers. Such a characterization of mechanistic reasoning illuminates what is easy and difficult about this form of reasoning, within the subdomain of simple machines. Moreover, this work indicates how domain-general principles may be limited. The study participants included elementary, middle, and high school students as well as college undergraduates and adults without higher education. Although the majority of participants responded to the AMRP by diagnosing at least one mechanistic element (elements inherent to the working of systems of levers) as they predicted its motion, such reasoning was not trivial. In fact, the diverse reasoning by participants shows how systems of <b>levers</b> <b>support</b> elements of mechanistic reasoning. Moreover, this study provides evidence that the development of mechanistic {{reasoning is}} dependent on domain-specific experience...|$|R
40|$|For {{some types}} of visuo-motor transformations like large visuo-motor {{rotations}} or the complex transformation of a sliding first-order lever, distinct adaptive processes have been hypothesized that produce a rapid, discrete approximation of the transformation and a slow, graded fine tuning, respectively. Here we investigate whether part-task training of only the second of these processes, namely the fine tuning, transfers to the subsequent performance in a condition with the full transformation of the sliding first-order lever. Therefore, we compared performance of three groups with different practice conditions during transfer to the full transformation. While two groups only practiced the fine tuning without the right-left inversion of the lever prior to transfer, a third group practiced the full lever transformation. Our results show a positive, but less than perfect transfer of the isolated practice of the fine tuning on performance with the full transformation. For the fine tuning itself, transfer was not reliably different from being perfect. The observation that the fine tuning can be acquired separately and added to the later adaptation to the left-right inversion of the <b>lever</b> <b>supports</b> the notion that these slow and fast processes progress rather independently. The additional finding that the preceding acquisition of the fine tuning also facilitates the subsequent rapid process {{could be due to}} generalized learning-to-learn or to a more precise assignment of movement errors to the process from which they originate...|$|R
