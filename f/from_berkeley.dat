5|$|In 1921 his daughter, Elenore Stratton, {{graduated}} <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley.</b> That August {{she married}} Harvard graduate Edward Russell Dewey of New York at her father's house, {{and moved to}} the city, where she had done social settlement work following graduation. The same year his son attended Berkeley. The Berkeley department of psychology officially split from the department of philosophy, with Stratton as its first chair, on July 1, 1922. His second daughter, Florence, graduated <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley</b> with a B.A. in 1929.|$|E

5000|$|The station {{originally}} began broadcasting in 1962, as {{a carrier}} current station. By 1966, KALX (then known as Radio KAL, the call letters being derived <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> nickname [...] "Cal") had moved <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> dormitories to Dwinelle Hall on campus, and Berkeley administrators began investigating {{the possibility of}} applying for a broadcast frequency for the station. KALX received its broadcast license and made its first FM broadcast, with 10 watts of power, in 1967. The studio {{in the basement of}} Dwinelle was modest, a small chamber sequestered off from a sizable library of albums.|$|R
5|$|After resigning <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> Kaczynski {{moved to}} his parents' home in Lombard, Illinois, then {{two years later}} to a remote cabin he had built outside Lincoln, Montana. Here he lived a simple life on very little money, without {{electricity}} or running water, working odd jobs and receiving some financial support from his family.|$|E
5|$|The American team {{dismissed}} the report. In an open response, they proclaimed that the {{input from the}} Soviet team was overrated in the review. In addition, they claimed the Soviet team was able to undoubtedly demonstrate the synthesis of element 105 {{at least a year}} after they did. The Russian and the German teams endorsed the report. The scientists from the former JWP rejected the criticisms <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley.</b>|$|E
5|$|Howison {{obtained}} a fellowship from the University of California for his protege {{to study at}} the University of Leipzig. On May 17, 1894, Stratton married Alice Miller at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Berkeley, while being an instructor in the philosophy department. Immediately after, the couple left for the East {{on their way to}} Europe, with Stratton taking a leave of absence <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley.</b> He then spent two years at Wundt's Institute for Experimental Psychology at Leipzig, from where he received an M.A. and a PhD in 1896. He received his degree summa cum laude, with a thesis submitted to Wundt's publication, Philosophische Studien.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Dean applied to the US Military Academy, but was rejected. He then tried to enlist in the United States Army during World War I, {{but he was too}} young to do so without his parents' permission, and his mother refused. Dean instead {{attended}} University of California at Berkeley studying pre-law. During this time, he also took a variety of side jobs, including a stevedore at the San Francisco docks, a motorman, and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department, where he worked under police chief August Vollmer. Dean originally sought to attain a Doctor of Law degree but only completed a Bachelor of Arts degree <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley</b> in 1922 before joining the Army.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley</b> to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
5|$|Americium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T. Seaborg <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.|$|E

5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley</b> and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} on the discovery of copernicium and acknowledged {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation <b>from</b> <b>Berkeley</b> and the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004–2006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
