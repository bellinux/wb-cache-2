25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E

25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E

Like a shift in perception caused by a paradox or a pun, my work is a place to hold mystery and comedy. Each image or object contains a set of personal and cultural references, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> for a multiplication of associations within the spaces between...|$|R

The Vikings wanted a four-year deal, but Munnerlyn signed a three-year deal so he could receive his third contract before turning 30. Munnerlyn stated, [...] "I had other visits set up but the number that Minnesota offered me was the number <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for.

500|$|Qureshi was {{initially}} scheduled {{to make her}} film debut with Billa II, a Tamil gangster-thriller, directed and produced by Chakri Toleti, after surviving an audition out of 700 candidates. Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had any regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't. I am not someone who sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for".|$|E

[...] The evening before the season was posted, someone responsible for the @BarackObama Twitter account (which is run by Organizing for Action) tweeted a request that no spoilers be posted online. Since the season debuted on Valentine's Day, The New York Observer created themed cards in honor of the series with quotes such as [...] "A great man once said everything is about sex. Except sex. Sex is about power" [...] (an Oscar Wilde quote Underwood had stated during season 1).|$|E

500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me.

500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Marshall Chess formed Cadet Concept Records as a {{subsidiary}} of Chess Records. The label's first release was the self-titled debut album of the psychedelic band Rotary Connection, whose members Chess described as [...] "the hottest, most avant garde rock guys in Chicago". As {{a result of the}} album's success, Chess felt that he could revive the career of bluesmen Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf by recording two albums of experimental, psychedelic blues, producing the albums Electric Mud and The Howlin' Wolf Album. [...] Chess hoped the new albums would sell well among fans of psychedelic rock bands influenced by Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. According to Muddy Waters, [...] "Quite naturally, I like a good-selling record. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at it because I played for so many of these so-called hippies that I thought probably I could reach them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{unanimous}} {{winner of}} the NL Most Valuable Player Award, he became the fourth player in National League history to win by this distinction, and the first Astros player to win the award. [...] Bagwell also won his first Silver Slugger, Gold Glove, and Player of the Year Awards from The Sporting News, Associated Press, Baseball Digest, and USA Today Baseball Weekly. [...] "Crazy stuff happened that year", Bagwell recalled of his 1994 season. [...] "Every pitch that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for, I got. [...] And when I got it, I didn't miss it." [...] The Astros and Bagwell agreed to a four-year contract on November 23, 1994, worth $27.5 million (USD, $ million today) with the three option years. [...] The average annual value of $6.875 million ($ million today) made him the fifth-highest paid player in the majors.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} 300 writer Frank Miller said, [...] "The inaccuracies, {{almost all of}} them, are intentional. I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason. I wanted these guys to move and I wanted 'em to look good. I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, but I only gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best result I {{can hope for is}} that if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating." ...|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison {{says that}} [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] {{addresses}} [...] "the avalanche of thoughts {{that are so}} hard to write down or say or transmit". Authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc cite the song, along with [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Within You Without You", as an early example of the Beatles abandoning [...] "coy" [...] statements in their lyrics and instead [...] "adopt an urgent tone, intent on channeling some essential knowledge, the psychological and/or philosophical epiphanies of LSD experience" [...] to their listeners. Writing in The Beatles Anthology, Harrison likened the outlook inspired by his taking the drug to that of [...] "an astronaut on the moon, or in his spaceship, {{looking back at the}} Earth. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> back to the Earth from my awareness." ...|$|E
