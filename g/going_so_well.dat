"The filming {{process was}} an {{efficient}} one, {{and it was}} <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> {{that in the middle}} of the production Cukor asked Hepburn to talk to Judy Garland in an attempt to convince Garland of the need to sober up. In order to add realism to the production, Cukor consulted reporters from United Press for advice on how newspapermen would handle Forrest's funeral. Based on their critiques, Cukor changed the scene in the village hotel's bar so that instead of drinking and talking about the funeral, the reporters get to work drafting articles on their typewriters. The script, too, was changed to permit the bartender to make a quip about reporters working rather than drinking.|$|E
500|$|The unsafe {{homeless}} {{man with whom}} Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely {{to that of a}} {{homeless man}}. The idea of Stewie and Bertram laughing as they go down the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well.</b> During Peter and Lois' [...] "fat sex", Peter repeatedly states [...] "almost, almost"; originally, {{there was going to be}} approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and saying to the receptionist: [...] "I have an appointment to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin", to which she replies with [...] "This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo", and Peter concludes the conversation with [...] "Where do I splooge?".|$|E
500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds. It draws influence from the music genre of R and pop, while instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. In an interview with Peter Andre on The Paul O'Grady Show on 3 November 2009, Burke explained {{the meaning of the}} songs lyrics, saying [...] "I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where you are in a relationship, it might not be <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> and you kinda want your other half to speak out and say what is on their mind, and I've had relationships like that." [...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking? Why doesn't he let you know how he feels?," [...] and that [...] "The Silence" [...] was written as a result. The songs begins with the lyrics [...] "Oh, you lift me up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Outside the Cripple Creek District, however, {{things were}} not <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> for the unionizing effort. A {{difficult}} strike lost in Leadville caused the WFM to revisit its philosophy and tactics. In 1899 there was another disastrous confrontation at Coeur d'Alene. Surveying the situation, with hundreds of union miners locked up by the militia in vermin-infested bullpens {{for a year or}} more, WFM Secretary-Treasurer Bill Haywood concluded that the companies and their supporters in government were conducting class warfare against the working class.p.55 ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{teachers}} also had special needs. Upon arriving in England, the overriding concern {{was to make}} a good home for the children. At {{the end of the first}} year, the teachers had been available to the children without any time off or uninterrupted privacy for themselves. While they were elated that things were <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> they were exhausted. That changed with the establishment of [...] "off-duty" [...] time to refresh oneself. [...] "It became possible to read, to write a letter, to go away for a few hours or a weekend without being interrupted or missed" [...] wrote Hanna Bergas. She noted that the return to the community was always a joy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, he {{sold out}} the Pavilion Theatre {{in his home}} town. In 1975, the rapidity and extent of Connolly's {{breakthrough}} was used to secure him a booking on Britain's premier TV chat show, the BBC's Parkinson. Connolly {{made the most of}} the opportunity and, ignoring objections from his manager, told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he'd have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s, and his appearance made a great impact. He became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the record for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on fifteen occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: [...] "That programme changed my entire life." [...] Parkinson, in the documentary Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the 'bike joke' three decades after that TV appearance. When asked about the material, Connolly stated, [...] "Yes, it was incredibly edgy for its time. My manager, on the way over, warned me not to do it, but it was a great joke and the interview was <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> I thought, 'Oh, fuck that!!' I don't know where I got the courage in those days, but Michael did put confidence in me." [...] Connolly's UK success spread to other English-speaking countries: Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. [...] However, his broad Scottish accent and British cultural references made success in the US improbable.|$|E

60|$|It {{had been}} {{intended}} that Mrs. Lacy should rejoin her pupil at Bournemouth {{at the end}} of six weeks; but in her stead came a letter saying that she was unwell, and begging for a fortnight's grace.

60|$|Lady Arabella's woe {{was really}} piteous. It {{seemed to her}} as though cruel fate were heaping misery after misery upon the wretched house of Greshamsbury. A few weeks since things were <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> with her! Frank then was all but the {{accepted}} husband of almost untold wealth--so, at least, she was informed by her sister-in-law--whereas, Augusta, was the accepted wife of wealth, not indeed untold, but of dimensions quite sufficiently respectable to cause much joy in the telling. Where now were her golden hopes? Where now the splendid future of her poor duped children? Augusta was left to pine alone; and Frank, in a still worse plight, insisted on maintaining his love for a bastard and a pauper.|$|E
60|$|Such {{things are}} not serious, and they are such as no serious man need shrink from, {{but they have a}} bearing upon what I am trying to explain, and in a certain measure they account for a certain {{attitude}} in our literary men. No one likes to have stones, not to say mud, thrown at him, though they are not meant to hurt him badly and may be partly thrown in joke. But it is pretty certain that if a man not in politics takes them seriously, he will have more or less mud, not to say stones, thrown at him. He might burlesque or caricature them, or misrepresent them, with safety; but if he spoke of public questions with heart and conscience, he could not do it with impunity, unless he were authorized to do so by some practical relation to them. I do not mean that then he would escape; but in this country, where there were once supposed to be no classes, people are more strictly classified than in any other. Business to the business man, law to the lawyer, medicine to the physician, politics to the politician, and letters to the literary man; that is the rule. One is not expected to transcend his function, and commonly one does not. We keep each to his last, as if there were not human interests, civic interests, which had a higher claim than the last upon our thinking and feeling. The tendency has grown upon us severally and collectively through the long persistence of our prosperity; if public affairs were going ill, private affairs were <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that we did not mind the others; and we Americans are, I think, meridional in our improvidence. We are so essentially of to-day that we behave as if to- morrow no more concerned us than yesterday. We have taught ourselves to believe that it will all come out right in the end so long that we have come to act upon our belief; we are optimistic fatalists.|$|E
6000|$|The {{selection}} of Virginians {{to the very}} highest civil and military appointments {{of the new government}} bribed and flattered many of our leading people, who, otherwise, and but for the outrageous conduct of our government, might have remained faithful to the Crown, and made good head against the rising rebellion. But, although we Loyalists were gagged and muzzled, though the Capitol was {{in the hands of the}} Whigs, and our vaunted levies of loyal recruits so many Falstaff's regiments for the most part, the faithful still kept intelligences with one another in the colony, and with our neighbours; and though we did not rise, and though we ran away, and though, in examination before committees, justices, and so forth, some of our frightened people gave themselves Republican airs, and vowed perdition to kings and nobles; yet we knew each other pretty well, and--according as the chances were more or less favourable to us, the master more or less hard--we concealed our colours, showed our colours, half showed our colours, or downright apostatised for the nonce, and cried, [...] "Down with King George!" [...] Our negroes bore about, from house to house, all sorts of messages and tokens. Endless underhand plots and schemes were engaged in by those who could not afford the light. The battle over, the neutrals come and join the winning side, and shout as loudly as the patriots. The runaways are not counted. Will any man tell me that the signers and ardent well-wishers of the Declaration of Independence were not in a minority of the nation, and that the minority did not win? We knew that apart of the defeated army of Massachusetts was about to make an important expedition southward, upon the success of which the very greatest hopes were founded; and I, for one, being anxious to make a movement as soon as there was any chance of activity, had put myself in communication with the ex-Governor Martin, of North Carolina, whom I proposed to join, with three or four of our Virginian gentlemen, officers of that notable corps of which we only wanted privates. We made no particular mystery about our departure from Castlewood; the affairs of Congress were not <b>going</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> yet that the new government could afford to lay any particular stress or tyranny upon persons of a doubtful way of thinking. Gentlemen's houses were still open; and in our southern fashion we would visit our friends for months at a time. My wife and I, with our infant and a fitting suite of servants, took leave of Madam Esmond on a visit to a neighbouring plantation. We went thence to another friend's house, and then to another, till finally we reached Wilmington, in North Carolina, which was the point at which we expected to stretch a hand to the succours which were coming to meet us.|$|E

5000|$|Taking {{center stage}} in the {{discussion}} was the [...] "travel planning process", a complex analysis and decision-making procedure {{with the aim of}} designating appropriate roads and trails.

[...] "Likewise, the Forest Service has identified unmanaged recreation — including ORV use — {{as one of the top}} four threats to the management and health of the National Forest System. Despite these statements, it seems to me that neither agency has been able to successfully manage off-road use." ...|$|R

Janet had scarcely reached the end of her circumstantial narrative how the attack came on and what were her aunt's sensations--a narrative to which Mrs. Patten, in her neatly-plaited nightcap, seemed to listen with a contemptuous resignation to her niece's historical inaccuracy, contenting herself with occasionally confounding Janet by a shake of the head--when the clatter of a horse's hoofs on the yard pavement announced the arrival of Mr. Pilgrim, whose large, top-booted person presently made its appearance upstairs.
