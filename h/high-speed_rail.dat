5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more than conventional rail but are not high enough to be called <b>high-speed</b> <b>rail</b> services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the <b>high-speed</b> <b>rail</b> networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, these {{research}} cannot {{characterize the}} link quality of wireless networks already deployed along the <b>high-speed</b> <b>rails,</b> {{so they have}} limited use in helping improve the performance of existing HSR wireless networks. Also, the study on different HSR scenarios cannot provide insight to the global behavior of wireless network link quality of a complete railway line. Hence, modeling the link quality characteristics and its long term pattern of existing HSR wireless networks becomes an issue.|$|R
50|$|Further {{convergence}} of rail gauge use seems likely, as countries seek to build inter-operable networks, and international organisations seek to build macro-regional and continental networks. The European Union has {{set out to}} develop inter-operable freight and passenger rail networks across its area, and is seeking to standardise gauge, signalling and electrical power systems. As countries build <b>High-speed</b> <b>rails,</b> {{they also tend to}} converge these rails' gauge to standard gauge, with the exceptions of Uzbekistan and Russia.|$|R
5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new <b>high-speed</b> <b>rail</b> line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a <b>high-speed</b> <b>rail</b> line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a <b>high-speed</b> <b>rail</b> line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E

30|$|Wireless {{networks}} play a {{very important}} role in the operations of HSR. First, wireless communication is the basis of train operation control systems, which include European Train Control System (ETCS) and Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) [2]. Second, wireless networks provide great convenience to HSR passengers, such as enjoying multimedia services or online gaming. Emerging wireless technologies have been utilized in HSR. For example, the TD-LTE network of China Mobile had covered 23500  km of <b>high-speed</b> <b>rails</b> by August 2015 [3].|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we try {{to model}} the link quality for HSR {{wireless}} networks with PLR and RTT. We firstly conduct a series of field measurement campaigns for PLR and RTT along realistic <b>high-speed</b> <b>rails.</b> The investigation of measurement results reveals a cyclic phenomenon of PLR and RTT. Then we utilize a hidden Markov chain (HMC) reference model to describe the measured PLR and RTT. Based on the model, an improved link quality simulation algorithm is developed. The simulation results prove that the developed algorithm can reproduce the cyclical behavior of PLR and RTT with high accuracy.|$|R

50|$|It {{might be}} {{surprising}} that people preserve the Valencian agricultural traditions so near GRAM {{the city of}} Valencia and also EST the presence of traditional cabins for agricultural purposes, called barracas SEM, {{as well as the}} traditional paths along the Horta, even if the city has caused negative effects because of the building of many landfills, waste ground, and workshops. This situation, together with the construction of new <b>high-speed</b> <b>rails</b> and dual carriageways, has cut up the Horta into different parts. Also, it has left little areas of countryside surrounded by huge infrastructures. That is a problem that has an impact not only in farmers lives, but also in neighbours.|$|R
