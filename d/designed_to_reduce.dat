5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} attack on Ancona, the Austro-Hungarian battleships were {{confined}} to Pola {{for the duration of}} the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff-class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being. This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, and with a shortage of coal, Haus enacted a strategy based on mines and submarines <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the numerical superiority of the Allied navies.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

The design does have potential <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> bagasse moisture content but presents some engineering challenges to establish a reliable, low maintenance design alternative. ...|$|R

The AFCS, manufactured by Smiths Aerospace, is a dual-duplex system using two flight computers to provide redundancy and fault-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{repetitive}} {{actions and}} long-playing times, 4X games {{have been criticized}} for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.|$|E

5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E
