5000|$|While {{this gave}} him the {{autonomy}} <b>he</b> <b>craved,</b> <b>it</b> also removed the external discipline {{that may have been}} beneficial to a man who described himself as an [...] "obsessive perfectionist". Doherty, Elliot, and Adler all found the arrangement uncongenial, with Elliot later complaining to Rolling Stone (October 26, 1968): [...] "We spent one whole month on one song, just the vocals for 'The Love of Ivy' took one whole month. I did my solo album in three weeks, a total of ten days in the studio. Live with the band, not prerecorded tracks sitting there with earphones." [...] The recording sessions for the fourth album eventually stalled completely, and in September 1967 John Phillips called a press conference to announce that The Mamas and the Papas were taking a break, which they confirmed on the Ed Sullivan Show on the 24th of that month.|$|E
5000|$|... "Man of the World" [...] is a {{song about}} a man who has {{everything}} he wants, except the companion <b>he</b> <b>craves.</b> <b>It</b> is in the key of D major, and ends on a D major sixth chord.|$|R
6000|$|On his table, when {{he entered}} his rooms that night, lay the letter for which <b>he</b> had <b>craved.</b> <b>He</b> opened <b>it</b> almost fiercely. The few lines seemed like a message of hope: ...|$|R
60|$|He wore armor {{because his}} old {{guardian}} had {{urged him to}} do so, and not because <b>he</b> <b>craved</b> the protection <b>it</b> afforded. And, for the same cause, he rode always with lowered visor, though he could never prevail upon the old man to explain the reason which necessitated this precaution.|$|R
25|$|But in Matthew Arnold’s {{dramatic}} poem “The Strayed Reveller” (1849), {{in which}} Circe {{is one of}} the characters, the power of her potion is differently interpreted. The inner tendencies unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality, between divine clarity and the poet’s participatory and tragic vision of life. In the poem, Circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of her temple by a draught of her ivy-wreathed bowl. On awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy <b>it</b> has induced, <b>he</b> <b>craves</b> for <b>it</b> to be continued.|$|R
60|$|First he {{stripped}} {{the body of}} cartridge belt and such ornaments as <b>he</b> <b>craved,</b> wedging <b>it</b> into a convenient crotch while his nimble fingers ran over it {{in search of the}} loot he could not plainly see in the dark. When he had finished he took the gun that had belonged to the man, and walked far out upon a limb, from the end of which he could obtain a better view of the huts. Drawing a careful bead on the beehive structure in which he knew the chief Arabs to be, he pulled the trigger. Almost instantly there was an answering groan. Tarzan smiled. He had made another lucky hit.|$|R
6000|$|He {{discovered}} in himself, at this period, {{a passion for}} perfection, under the sway of which he rewrote and polished [...] "The Jostling Street," [...] "The Wine of Life," [...] "Joy," [...] the [...] "Sea Lyrics," [...] and others of his earlier work. As of old, nineteen hours of labor a day was all too little to suit him. He wrote prodigiously, and he read prodigiously, forgetting in his toil the pangs caused by giving up his tobacco. Ruth's promised cure for the habit, flamboyantly labelled, he stowed away in the most inaccessible corner of his bureau. Especially during his stretches of famine he suffered from lack of the weed; {{but no matter how}} often <b>he</b> mastered the <b>craving,</b> <b>it</b> remained with him as strong as ever. He regarded it as the biggest thing he had ever achieved. Ruth's point of view was that he was doing no more than was right. She brought him the anti-tobacco remedy, purchased out of her glove money, and in a few days forgot all about it.|$|R
60|$|In truth, he {{is never}} truly {{in his place}} in these learned and fashionable circles, which talk and live for display. It {{is not the kind}} of society <b>he</b> <b>craves.</b> His heart yearns for {{domestic}} life; <b>it</b> <b>craves</b> familiar, confiding intercourse, family firesides, the guileless and happy company of children; these bring out the heartiest and sweetest sympathies of his nature.|$|R
50|$|Jack is Lindsay's little brother. <b>He</b> <b>craves</b> to {{be famous}} and always tries to do {{something}} either to get money or fame.|$|R
60|$|He {{was moving}} off, but Jimmy stopped him. Parting from Ann {{had left a}} large gap in his life, and <b>he</b> <b>craved</b> human society.|$|R
60|$|The King's eyes flashed. He was a brave man, but {{the cloud}} of doubt had been stupefying. It was this {{knowledge}} for which <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, <b>he</b> <b>craved</b> {{another chance}} at {{international}} football, {{and so in}} 2006 he followed the chance of Champions League football to Polish League champions Wisla Krakow.|$|R

60|$|I steeled myself {{against his}} unexpressed but palpable desire. He should not coax, cajole, or wring from me the dollar <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b> I {{had had enough}} of that wild-goose chase.|$|R
50|$|Ahti was {{originally}} a peer and lover {{of the man}} who would become Dominus. They had a falling out when she ascended to the role of Kismet, which <b>he</b> <b>craved</b> bitterly.|$|R
60|$|And then Tripp {{joined in}} with a little grating laugh that he had, still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mr. Spaetzle - The {{principal}} of Bryson Elementary. <b>He</b> <b>craves</b> the adoration the students heap on Frazz, {{and wants to}} be just like him. He wore nerdy glasses all throughout high school.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Maddison {{turned away}} {{that the man}} might not see the sudden dread in his face. It was not a long respite <b>he</b> <b>craved</b> for--only one evening. Was even this to be denied him? ...|$|R
50|$|Giles Hussey (1710-1788) was {{a painter}} from Dorset, England. His portraits are well regarded, but his {{theories}} on art never received the attention <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b> <b>He</b> believed that each note of music represented a colour. He {{created the first}} portrait of Charles Edward Stuart, the pretender to the British throne. Hussey has works in the Tate Gallery.|$|R
60|$|In {{the brief}} instant that Billy's watchful gaze left {{the figure of}} the ranch foreman the latter saw the {{opportunity}} <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b> <b>He</b> was standing directly in the doorway--a single step would carry him out of range of Byrne's gun, placing a wall between it and him, and Grayson was not slow in taking that step.|$|R
60|$|It {{was one of}} his {{secretaries}} who, at Albemarle's bidding, gave Wilding {{the information}} that <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b> <b>He</b> listened gravely; then, before Albemarle had time to question him on the score of the name that might have been upon the enfolding wrapper of the letter, he begged that he might confer apart a moment with Mr. Trenchard.|$|R
50|$|Who am I? My name is FRATERNITY. And because I {{have given}} Man that which <b>he</b> <b>craves,</b> I shall endure. My sons shall neither falter nor fail. They shall add new lustre to my name.|$|R
25|$|Boehner never {{landed the}} really big deal <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b> Not the $4 {{trillion}} tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.|$|R
2500|$|Kolodin comments: [...] "It was, of course, the {{principle}} by which Verdi's later career was guided {{when he had}} the land and the position <b>he</b> <b>craved</b> and the security that went with them and a wise wife." ...|$|R

60|$|As he ceased {{speaking}} he awaited {{in silence}} evidently for some outbreak of rage upon my part--something {{that would have}} added to the spice of his revenge. But I did not give him the satisfaction that <b>he</b> <b>craved.</b>|$|R
60|$|At first Tarzan {{would eat}} nothing, but rolled and tossed {{in a wild}} {{delirium}} of fever. All <b>he</b> <b>craved</b> was water, and this she brought him in {{the only way she}} could, bearing it in her own mouth.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Pappenheim: {{an optimistic}} and {{eccentric}} impresario who visits Badenheim each summer {{to organize the}} annual music festival. <b>He</b> <b>craves</b> structure, constantly refers to schedules and timetables, but is always able to find positive explanations for the most ominous of actions.|$|R

5000|$|Spike tells Buffy {{that every}} slayer has a death wish {{and that she}} has it too, that she <b>craves</b> <b>it.</b> This foreshadows her choice to {{sacrifice}} her own life {{at the end of}} the season.|$|R
