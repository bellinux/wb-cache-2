Chapter 1 comprises an overview of published work relevant to our studies: an analysis of steroid biosynthesis and synthesis; {{a review of the}} use of azasteroids, their biological activity and current synthetic techniques in azasteroid formation. This initial chapter also includes an introduction to published work in the area of nitrogen heterocycle synthesis using radical reactions and finally the use of <b>acyl</b> <b>radicals</b> in synthesis, particularly cascade reactions. Chapter 2 starts by describing the requirements of a reaction system for use in <b>acyl</b> <b>radical</b> cascades and then discusses the relevance of this to the synthesis of ring junction azasteroids. Our attempts to synthesise ring junction azasteroids and the problems that we encountered are then discussed. Subsequent sections describe the disconnection of azasteroids where nitrogen is part of the body of the ring and the synthetic work that we performed in this area. Using cyclohexenyl enamides as the terminal electrophore in cascade reactions we were able to synthesise a 12 -aza-D-homosteroid in nine steps.

The mass spectrometer detects the corresponding carboxylate ions. PAN, peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN), peroxyisobutyryl nitrate (PiBN), peroxy-n-butyryl nitrate (PnBN), peroxyacryloyl nitrate (APAN), peroxycrotonyl nitrates (CPAN) and peroxymethacryloyl nitrate (MPAN) were cross-calibrated with both a dual channel GC/ECD and a total odd-nitrogen (NOy) instrument for the NCAR TD-CIMS' typical aircraft operation conditions. In addition, the instrument sensitivity {{to a number of}} more exotic PANs (peroxyhydroxyacetyl nitrate, methoxyformyl peroxynitrate, and peroxybenzoyl nitrate) was evaluated qualitatively by comparisons with a long-path FTIR instrument. The sensitivity for PPN is slightly higher than that of PAN. Larger aliphatic and olefinic PAN compounds generally showed lower sensitivities. We postulate that these differences are owing to secondary reactions in the thermal decomposition region, which either reduce the yield of peroxy <b>acyl</b> <b>radicals</b> or cause losses of these radicals through intramolecular decomposition. The relative importance of these secondary reactions varies considerably between different PAN species. Results also indicate that the reaction of the larger peroxy <b>acyl</b> <b>radicals</b> with the ion-water cluster, I&minus;(H 2 O) n proceeds about an order of magnitude faster than with I&minus; alone, as has been observed for peroxy acetyl radicals.

Neocarzinostatin (NCS or holo-NCS) is a 1 : 1 non-covalent complex of a very reactive nine-membered ring epoxydiyne chromophore (NCS-C) tightly bound to a protein, apo-NCS. Total syntheses of Myers and Hirama, and the work of Magnus and Caddick have shown the challenges involved in the synthesis of the Neocarzinostatin chromophore, and in particular its bicyclic epoxydiyne ring. This project thesis concerns evaluation of alternative approaches towards the synthesis of strained medium size rings, such as those in the Neocarzinostatin chromophore, using McMurry coupling and <b>acyl</b> <b>radical</b> chemistry. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the field including a discussion of the mode of action of Neocarzinostatin and a detailed evaluation of previous approaches to the Neocarzinostatin chromophore. McMurry coupling and <b>acyl</b> <b>radical</b> chemistry are also reviewed, particularly with reference to their use in strained medium ring synthesis. Chapter 2 describes studies into aerobic hydroacylations of vinyl sulfonates in view of its application to the synthesis of NCS-C core. A broader range of aldehydes can now be used for the synthesis of β-ketosulfonates. Pentafluorophenol has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on hydroacylations of vinyl sulfonates and new conditions were developed to minimise this inhibitory effect.
