In return, Philip would forgive Edward and restore his land after a grace period. In the matter of the marriage, Philip drove a hard bargain based partially on the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> between Edward and Blanche; it was agreed that the province of Gascony would be retained by Philip in return for agreeing to the marriage. The date of the wedding was also put off until the formality of sequestering and re-granting the French lands back to Edward was completed.|$|E

[...] The two men formed a very close relationship despite a quarter-century <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>age.</b> [...] Franklin's wish to keep Lafayette safe was frustrated by the young man's desire to be where battles raged, and he was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777. [...] France soon entered the war on the American side, and {{was instrumental in the}} victory. Lafayette helped lead the decisive Yorktown campaign, leading to the surrender of British Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis.|$|E
500|$|Ida {{originated}} in {{the breakup of the}} roughly [...] diameter Koronis parent body. The progenitor asteroid had partially differentiated, with heavier metals migrating to the core. Ida carried away insignificant amounts of this core material. It is uncertain how long ago the disruption event occurred. According to an analysis of Ida's cratering processes, its surface is more than a billion years old. However, this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the Ida–Dactyl system of less than 100 million years; it is unlikely that Dactyl, due to its small size, could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer. The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the Koronis parent body's destruction.|$|E

Comparison of the mean <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> of onset or year of onset {{is found to be}} inappropriate and potentially misleading. No significant results were found in linear regression of the age of onset or year of onset vs <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>ages,</b> although a trend towards onset at the same age is present. However, nontwin siblings show a significant intraclass correlation for age of onset (P less than 0. 01) as is seen in genetic disorders. A stronger intraclass correlation <b>in</b> <b>age</b> of onset <b>in</b> concordant monozygotic twins vs concordant sibling pairs further suggests that age of onset is partly under genetic control, assuming common exposure to an environmental agent. The results give little support for common exposure to an environmental trigger in concordant MS sibling pairs. They are consistent with a mixture of random independent exposures and common exposures leading {{to the development of the}} disease, with the former predominating...|$|R

Rommel did not remain with the division long, being transferred to command the Afrika Corps. He was replaced by Generalmajor Hans Freiherr von Funck, with whom Mickl had some difficulty working. Mickl remained in command of the 7th Rifle Regiment during occupation duties in southwestern France, redeployment to Germany, and during the division's preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union. In May 1941, through the intervention of Rommel's adjutant Major Hans-Joachim Schraepler, Mickl was posted to a new role in Germany, raising the headquarters of the 155th Rifle Regiment for service in North Africa. [...] Despite the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> and rank, Mickl, Schraepler and their wives had become firm friends.

Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult Parasaurolophus has been found yet, a partial braincase of about the right size is known. At 25% of the total adult size, the juvenile show that crest growth of Parasaurolophus began sooner than in related genera, such as Corythosaurus. It has been suggested that Parasaurolophus adults bore such large crests, especially when compared to the related Corythosaurus, because of this <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>age</b> between when their crests started developing. Its age also means that Parasaurolophus had a very fast growth rate, which took place in about a year. The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults, but low and hemispherical.|$|E

2500|$|The opera {{has four}} main characters: [...] the aristocratic Marschallin, her very young lover Count Octavian Rofrano, her coarse cousin Baron Ochs and Ochs' {{prospective}} fiancée Sophie von Faninal, daughter of a rich bourgeois.

Although a comic opera, Der Rosenkavalier also operates at a deeper level.
