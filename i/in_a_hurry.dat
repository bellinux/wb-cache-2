5|$|On {{the same}} or the {{following}} day, the pilgrims re-visit the Sacred Mosque in Mecca for another tawaf, known as Tawaf al-Ifadah, {{an essential part of}} Hajj. It symbolizes being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> to respond to God and show love for Him, an obligatory part of the Hajj. The night of the 10th is spent back at Mina.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers‚ÄîScouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry.</b> Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E

5|$|Around 1849 Wilkes went to California, {{either with}} or {{shortly after his}} friend David Colbreth Broderick. Wilkes was a {{political}} advisor of Broderick's, but they quarreled over water issues in 1853 and Wilkes left California. Wilkes then traveled to Europe, turning the experience into another book, this one entitled Europe <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hurry.</b> Returning to California after Europe, he reunited with Broderick in late 1853 but another quarrel in 1854 over Wilkes' appointment to a judicial post led to Wilkes' leaving California permanently. The two men reconciled in 1859 during a visit by Broderick to New York shortly before Broderick's death. Wilkes was the recipient of Broderick's estate, and Wilkes wrote a long eulogy to his friend {{that appeared in the}} Spirit in October 1859.|$|E
5|$|DiBiase and Schyster, {{managed by}} Hart, {{defeated}} LOD {{at a house}} show on February 7, 1992 in Denver, Colorado, to win the title. This title win was unusual for professional wrestling, as Money Inc. had not yet debuted as a team on WWF television programming. In addition, the decision to give the championship belts to Money Inc. was made <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry,</b> as LOD's Hawk had failed a drug test. The wrestlers were unaware until that night that the title would change hands, and Money Inc.'s win was not immediately acknowledged on television, as WWF programming was taped in advance. The Natural Disasters, upset by Hart's assistance to a rival tag team, fired Hart as their manager and turned face, beginning a feud with Money Inc. over the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E

5|$|The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, {{specifically}} requested Pflueger in 1920 {{after they}} received financing {{for a grand}} movie palace on Castro Street. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> to see the 2,000-seat project completed, the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed in the vestibule, ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the rolling HP meter began with pachinko balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for {{characters}} with high health. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter. The bicycle {{was one of the}} harder elements to implement‚Äîit used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked. Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> on his way off-screen. The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in oblique projection required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an overworld map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.|$|E
5|$|Social worker Elena Rosas (Charise Castro Smith) {{is found}} shot {{dead in a}} motel. When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) looks through her autopsy scan, she notices Elena had brain surgery and gets a shock when she realizes that Elena {{was one of her}} {{patients}} as she used to be a neurosurgeon, however she cannot remember her, just the procedure. Megan speaks with Elena's father Armando (Tony Plana), who remembers Megan from the surgery, and tells her that Elena saw Megan as a role model, due to Elena's mother early death. After speaking with Elena's boss Jeremy Nicholls (Edoardo Ballerini), he states that he cannot understand why Elena was in a motel, as she had no appointments near that location. Traces of breast milk are found on Elena's shirt, showing she was near a baby when she died, which leads them to Holly Bennett (Yaya DaCosta), one of Elena's clients. She reveals that her baby nearly got taken away due to her drug addicted boyfriend, and that whilst Elena was visiting her baby vomited on her, but left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> before she could clean it up. Megan and Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) visit Armando to ask if Elena was in a relationship; hence why she was in a motel. They find out that it is Jeremy, but he says that Elena ended their relationship hours before she died.|$|E

25|$|The {{butterfly}} is solitary and a fast flyer. It flies {{high above}} and forages {{on the trees}} (e.g., creeper blooms on bamboo).

25|$|In the meantime, the 82d Airborne Division {{arrived from}} the States on May 10 and camped near the 509th at Oujda. We were {{attached}} to them. The 82d would not buy our Scout Platoon idea, but they sure found out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> after Sicily that we really had something that was needed.|$|E
25|$|Very-low-value items shipped {{directly}} from China are sometimes shipped by surface mail (sea mail), which is inexpensive but takes {{one to two}} months. If the buyer is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry,</b> {{he or she might}} be able to pay an extra fee to upgrade to second-class Surface Air Lifted shipping or to first-class airmail shipping.|$|E
25|$|The {{police did}} not find or {{identify}} any suspect involved in the shooting. There were several people the police wanted to question based on erratic behavior, such as leaving the scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> as recorded by surveillance camera. A few people showed up after they recognized themselves on the broadcast footage, but these proved to be inconclusive.|$|E

25|$|The Protestant garrison, seeing such {{formidable}} army, forsook their defenses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry,</b> {{and soon}} surrendered without suffering {{more than a}} few killed by the assailants. According to the correspondence of Spinola, the Protestant garrison consisted of 800 strong musketeers recruited in the Palatinate. Oppenheim was captured and the Protestant soldiers were disarmed and released. Besides several flags, the Spanish seized the baggage of Protestant soldiers in the barracks of the town.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{remained}} {{with his new}} prizes overnight while ordering repairs to all ships. Constitution had suffered little damage in the battle, though it was later discovered she had twelve 32-pound British cannonballs embedded in her hull, none of which had penetrated through. The Americans took their prisoners to St. Jago (Santiago) in the Cape Verde Islands and landed them there, but left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> when British ships were reported. Cyane took one course and Levant took another.|$|E
