I remember there was lots of howling, and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> very sore and scarred. Parts of my anatomy were alarmingly chafed. They say it turned out well. I'm excited to see it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamilton was {{satisfied}} with his performance in the race, saying [...] "today was all about damage control: <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> with some points and kept my lead in the world Drivers' Championship." [...] Massa {{said that he had}} hoped to do better, but added [...] "I've managed to make up a point on my nearest rival so this is absolutely not a negative result." [...] Massa took threepoints from the race, compared to Hamilton's two, and narrowed the gap in the Drivers' Championship to onepoint with fourraces remaining. Kovalainen's second-placed finish closed the gap in the Constructors' Championship between Ferrari and McLaren from twelve to fivepoints.|$|E
500|$|Brundage's {{interest}} in Asian art {{stemmed from a}} visit he made to an exhibition of Chinese art at the Royal Academy in London in early 1936, after the Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Brundage stated of the experience, [...] "We [...] spent {{a week at the}} exhibition and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> so enamored with Chinese art that I've been broke ever since." [...] He did not begin active collecting until after the Brundages' two-week visit to Japan in April 1939, where they visited Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara and Nikko. They followed up Japan with visits to Shanghai and Hong Kong, but due to the war between Japan and China, were unable to explore further on Avery Brundage's only visit to mainland China—this disappointment bothered him his whole life.|$|E

500|$|In {{the scene}} in which Snow White is {{captured}} by The Queen's henchmen, Goodwin tweeted that the horse ran right into her, sending her flying and injuring her hand and face. Goodwin explained that [...] "we go on quite an adventure and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> with an actual, physical scar from it." [...] The incident required that the actress' face receive stitches in a hospital emergency room. Goodwin and Joshua Dallas {{said that it was}} their favorite episode up to that point, with Dallas saying it was [...] "lot of fun to shoot and it’s just great." [...] In another tweet, Goodwin commented that Jennifer Morrison taught her to perform CPR during a scene with Dallas, as Morrison learned the procedure while she was a regular on House M.D.|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

I had a long interview with him, found him of average intelligence, of rather lovable disposition, of mediocre spiritual intuitions, and heard him swear in good, round English! <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> feeling that if he is all we, as a race, {{have to look to}} in order {{to get out of the}} muddle we are in, then God pity us." ...|$|E

2500|$|The frigate “Canterbury” on its {{delivery}} voyage sailed up the Potomac River to Washington, {{said to be}} {{the first}} foreign warship to do so since the British raid in 1814. Memories were long. A barbecue was held on the ship to promote New Zealand lamb and as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> a man said to me, ‘What are these guys doing in this town?

2500|$|In May 2012, {{production}} {{returned to}} Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting. The following month, screenwriter Damon Lindelof {{was hired to}} rewrite the film's third act with reshoots scheduled to begin in September or October 2012. However, Lindelof, who also reworked Prometheus and co-wrote Star Trek Into Darkness, {{did not have time}} to script the new ending and in July 2012, Paramount hired Lindelof's Lost partner, Drew Goddard. Lindelof explained there were inefficiencies in the script in relation to the shooting, which started before the script was finalized thus making the ending [...] "abrupt and incoherent" [...] and was missing a large chunk of footage. Lindelof presented two options to executives, who ultimately chose to shoot 30 to 40 minutes of additional footage to make a coherent ending. Goddard later told Creative Screenwriting, [...] "To me the big lesson of World War Z was that Paramount, Plan B and Brad Pitt simply said, 'Let's take the time to make this movie the best version of the movie before we put it on the screen for audience.' That doesn't happen a lot. A lot of times they just throw the movie out there and say, 'We'll make all our money opening weekend and then the movie will go away.' <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>away</b> from it thinking, 'Why don't we do this on more movies?'" ...|$|E
