2500|$|Although William Hedley is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} [...] "design" [...] of the locomotives, there is strong evidence that these <b>issued</b> <b>from</b> the aforementioned <b>joint</b> collaboration in which Christopher Blackett was the driving force with Timothy Hackworth playing a preponderant engineering role. Furthermore, it subsequently fell to Hackworth to maintain the locomotives in running order and improve performance. As time went on, Blackett became increasingly occupied by other outside interests and was often absent, leaving Hedley {{in charge of the}} mine; Hackworth found himself in conflictual situations due his Methodist activities and his refusal to work on the Sabbath, until he felt obliged to leave Wylam in 1816.|$|R
40|$|The {{decreasing}} {{defense budget}} forces the Department of Defense (DoD) to continually find {{areas in which}} to reduce military spending. Traditionally, each service has requested munitions considering itself in isolation. This inevitably leads to excessive munitions acquisition for the DoD as a whole. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology developed the Capabilities-Based Munitions Requirement (CBMR) process {{to ensure that the}} DoD address the munitions acquisition <b>issue</b> <b>from</b> a <b>joint</b> perspective and thus reduce excess. The CBMR process requires each warfighting CinC to produce a phased threat distribution (PTD). The PTD specifies which friendly platform will be assigned to each enemy platform for a given scenario. This provides the services with estimates of the threats they must be prepared to overcome and the munitions they need. The purpose of this thesis is to help develop the PTD {{in such a way that}} the threats are assigned appropriately with limited overlap among the services. To achieve this purpose, the thesis develops a goal programming model that attempts to find an optimal allocation based on three objectives: (1) minimize friendly casualties, (2) maximize enemy casualties, and (3) maximize adherence to the guidance delineating a proper division of labor among the services.

These progress reports {{provide an opportunity}} for refl ection on the direction of academic inquiry and discourse in physical geography, and hopefully serve as an antidote to the everyday whirlwind of events and short-term deadlines that we are all caught up in. Since the last report (Tooth, 2007), arid geomorphological research output has remained strong, and it is only possible to cite a small selection of published work in the space available here. As ever, research approaches, topics, and themes are diverse, as exemplifi ed by special <b>issues</b> arising <b>from</b> the <b>joint</b> British Geomorphological Research Group/ British Sedimentological Research Group conference (London, 2005) entitled ?Drylands: Linking Landscape Processes to Sedimentary Environments?, which demonstrate the overlap between those studies concerned primarily with present-day arid processform relationships and those focusing on how these relationships are represented in Quaternary sedimentary successions and the sedimentary rock record (Bullard et al., 2007; Nash et al., 2007).

40|$|Following the United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration’s (UKCRC) (2007) {{recommendations}} on careers in clinical research, {{there has been}} growing anticipation in the United Kingdom about the real potential for establishing career pathways for nurses and allied health professionals that {{will enable them to}} combine a focus on both clinical and academic roles. However, it is recognized that the implementation of this initiative will require charting largely untested waters, with <b>issues</b> ranging <b>from</b> establishing <b>joint</b> University: health service employment contracts, to harmonizing clinical and research roles and ensuring sustainability of funding for clinical academic posts. This paper will outline the implementation of a pilot clinical academic career initiative, which has been modelled on the UKCRC framework. We will illuminate the processes and structures employed and reflect on the factors that appear critical to the successful establishment of a clinical academic career pathway. Additionally, our experience has enabled us to identify challenges that will need to be addressed by a range of stakeholders if clinical academic careers are to flourish and deliver their potential at a national level as a modern career option for nurses and allied health professionals...|$|R
40|$|The {{pavement}} joint- and crack-sealing industry faces several {{challenges as}} the new millennium approaches. These challenges cover {{a broad spectrum of}} <b>issues,</b> <b>from</b> materials to construction practices. It has been demonstrated and documented and is generally accepted that sealing the cracks in flexible pavements is a sound preventive maintenance procedure for extending pavement life. However, the fundamental question of whether sealing joints in rigid highway pavements is cost-effective was recently raised. The issues that face the joint- and crack-sealing industry can generally be divided into four categories (within each of which are several subcategories, including a research component) : · Value added (return on investment <b>from</b> <b>joint</b> and crack sealing), · Materials and specifications, · Application procedures and equipment, an...|$|R

The German income tax code contains provisions from which married couples stand to benefit relative to unmarried couples.

The gain <b>from</b> <b>joint</b> taxation for married couples accrues in every year. Couples also enjoy it in {{the year in which}} they marry, independent of the month of the marriage. I use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to the hypothesis that couples with larger gains <b>from</b> <b>joint</b> taxation are more likely to marry late in the current year instead of early in the subsequent year. The results provide strong support for the hypothesis that pecuniary gains <b>from</b> <b>joint</b> taxation incentivize couples to prepone their marriages to the current year...|$|R
