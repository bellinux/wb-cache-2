5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E
5|$|Shang Tsung (played by Philip Ahn, M.D.): {{the evil}} sorcerer who {{convinced}} Kahn to spare his life {{after losing the}} last tournament, with a new plan to appease his master, who in turn restores Tsung's youth. He {{also serves as a}} sub-boss of the game, appearing before Kintaro in the single player mode. As in the first game, he is able to morph <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playable characters, retaining their moves (in some versions only the character against whom he is currently fighting).|$|E

5|$|The Canadian monarch, {{seen as the}} fount of honour, is at {{the apex}} of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: Companion, Officer, and Member, each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three grades may be made by the governor general each year. , there have been 21 honorary appointments.|$|E

25|$|The {{pieces that}} do not fall <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three types are Auf meinen lieben Gott BuxWV 179, which is, quite unusually for the time, a dance suite based on the chorale, and the ones based on the chant (Magnificats BuxWV 203–5 and Te Deum laudamus, BuxWV 218), which are {{structurally}} similar to chorale fantasias.|$|E
25|$|Evans and Kaufman {{isolated}} the {{embryonic stem cells}} from early embryos (embryoblasts) of mice and established them in cell cultures. These early embryonic cells {{have the potential to}} differentiate <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cells of the adult organism. They modified these stem cells genetically and placed them in the wombs of female mice so they would give birth to genetically modified offspring.|$|E
25|$|The Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses {{unpublished}} Minnesota state {{criteria of}} performance at 1.5 or more standard deviations on standardized testing {{in three or}} more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.|$|E

25|$|Johnny Depp's {{shooting}} {{on the film}} was the hardest to incorporate <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new actors' schedules, due to his contractual obligation on Michael Mann's Public Enemies at the time; in the end, Gilliam had access to Depp for one day and three hours. All of the shots involving him had {{to be completed in}} one take, to fit into Depp's compressed time schedule.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of his {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{showed that}} Ötzi {{belongs to the}} K1 subclade, but cannot be categorized <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three modern branches of that subclade (K1a, K1b or K1c). The new subclade has provisionally been named K1ö for Ötzi. Multiplex assay study was able {{to confirm that the}} Iceman's mtDNA belongs to a previously unknown European mtDNA clade with a very limited distribution among modern data sets.|$|E
25|$|Like most native Caucasian peoples, the Georgians {{do not fit}} <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main ethnic {{categories}} of Europe or Asia. The Georgian language, the most pervasive of the Kartvelian languages, is neither Indo-European, Turkic nor Semitic. The present day Georgian or Kartvelian nation {{is thought to have}} resulted from the fusion of aboriginal, autochthonous inhabitants with immigrants who moved into South Caucasus from the direction of Anatolia in remote antiquity.|$|E
50|$|The Bolyai-Gerwien theorem {{states that}} any polygon may be {{dissected}} <b>into</b> <b>any</b> other polygon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same area. It is not true, however, that any polyhedron has a dissection <b>into</b> <b>any</b> other polyhedron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same volume. This process is possible, however, for any two honeycombs (such as cube) in three dimension and <b>any</b> two zonohedra <b>of</b> equal volume (in any dimension).|$|R

50|$|As the syncytiotrophoblast {{starts to}} {{penetrate}} the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> embryonic stem cells, which are pluripotent and can develop <b>into</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three germ layer cells.|$|R
25|$|The Restricted {{categories}} {{are subject to}} various restrictions in different states; for example, one or both categories may only be sold in adults-only premises in certain states. For this reason, some adult magazines are published in two editions in Australia, or just one edited edition which can be sold anywhere, with a warning, as Unrestricted Mature. If a publication does not fall <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> categories below it is rated Refused Classification (Banned).|$|E
25|$|The Rest was an Indian {{first-class}} cricket team {{which took}} part in the annual Bombay Pentangular from 1937-38 to 1945-46. It comprised those players who did not fit <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teams that {{took part in}} the Quadrangular, including Catholics, Jews and mixed-race Anglo-Indians. Several leading players from Ceylon also took part. The team reached the final of the Pentangular twice, in 1940–41 and 1943–44. In the 1943–44 final Vijay Hazare scored 309 out of the team's total of 387.|$|E
25|$|Unique in {{sense of}} not fitting <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above categories. The {{parentage}} of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from P.fulgidum, but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique’, {{also known as}} or ‘Rollinson’s Crimson’, in the mid-19th century is also claimed. Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, {{as a result of}} this cross, are much more floriferous.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>the</b> {{first point}} <b>of</b> call when {{arriving}} from Warri, Benin City, Lagos, Abuja, Owerri, Onitsha and the Port Harcourt International Airport. It houses multiple bus stops and travellers catch buses or taxis <b>into</b> <b>any</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Port Harcourt city from there.|$|R
50|$|The main {{challenge}} {{with this approach}} {{is to find a}} geometric way to divide the set into subsets. This may require to discard a small number of shapes that do not fit <b>into</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsets, as explained in the following subsections.|$|R
50|$|The T68 can use any weaver-mounted {{accessory}} {{and can be}} made <b>into</b> <b>any</b> configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M-16/M4 Carbine, as well {{as working}} M203 grenade launchers, that can be mounted on the marker. There are also AK-47 stocks and handguards, and MP5 accessories, allowing custom configurations.|$|R
25|$|The multi-potent {{pancreatic}} progenitor {{cells have}} the capacity to differentiate <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pancreatic cells: acinar cells, endocrine cells, and ductal cells. These progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6-1. Under the influence of neurogenin-3 and ISL1, but in the absence of notch receptor signaling, these cells differentiate to form two lines of committed endocrine precursor cells. The first line, under the direction of a Pax gene, forms α- and γ- cells, which produce glucagon and pancreatic polypeptides, respectively. The second line, influenced by Pax-6, produces beta cells (β-) and delta cells (δ-), which secrete insulin and somatostatin, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{form of an}} Interlingua word is {{considered}} an international prototype {{with respect to the}} other words. On the one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their morphological connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled tempore and not *tempus or *tempo in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as temporal.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{schools are}} divided into three types - gymnasiums, {{professional}} and craft schools. After graduating from the primary school, students take a test called Matura. The test covers subjects that were taught in primary school. They are awarded the maximum of 40 points at the test. They also get points from their average marks from 5th to 8th grade, and the maximum is 60 points. Both the points from Matura and from average marks are totallized into the maximum of 100 points. Then, students {{make a list of}} their preferred schools and are sorted according to how much points they had gained - every secondary school has a limited number of students it takes. After students make lists for preferred schools, they get into the first school that suits them according to the points. If they fail to get <b>into</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> schools they had listed (ex. if they don't have enough points, but they had chosen very competitive schools), they make another list for the Second Enrollment Deadline.|$|E
