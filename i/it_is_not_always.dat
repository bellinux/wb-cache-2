5|$|A few non-essential {{heavy metals}} have been {{observed}} to have biological effects. Gallium, germanium (a metalloid), indium, and most lanthanides can stimulate metabolism, and titanium promotes growth in plants (though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> considered a heavy metal).|$|E
5|$|A dry bell {{may also}} be used for bounce dives to great depths, and then used as the {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the support vessel. In this case <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would be relatively cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of epilepsy is typically made based on {{observation of the}} seizure onset and the underlying cause. An electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) {{to look at the}} structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> possible. Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.|$|E

5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> easy {{to predict}} a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed {{tend to be}} born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of}} the horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes {{that a lot of}} her exploits are poorly documented, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> possible to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E

5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.|$|E

25|$|The {{rule that}} for some {{distributions}} {{the difference between the}} mean and the mode is three times that between the mean and the median is due to Pearson who discovered it while investigating his Type 3 distributions. It is often applied to slightly asymmetric distributions that resemble a normal distribution but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> true.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{selection}} is commonly equated with {{survival of the}} fittest, but this expression originated in Herbert Spencer's Principles of Biology in 1864, five years after Charles Darwin published his original works. Survival of the fittest describes the process of natural selection incorrectly, because natural {{selection is}} not only about survival and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> the fittest that survives.|$|E
25|$|Different trees will, in general, {{correspond}} to different Shabat polynomials, as will different embeddings or colorings {{of the same}} tree.

25|$|The {{study of}} metamemory has some {{similarities}} to introspection {{in that it}} assumes that a memorizer is able to investigate and report on the contents of memory. Current metamemory researchers acknowledge that an individual's introspections contain both accuracies and distortions and are interested in what this conscious monitoring (even if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> accurate) reveals about the memory system.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{known whether}} a {{specific}} form {{is actually the}} official name of an institution, or what is its official name (e.g. whether the city of its location {{is part of the}} name). In addition, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> clear if a group is actually an institution in the sense of having been registered at the court, with a statute, a stamp, letter header etc. on its own. A third problem is {{the question of whether the}} spelling of an organization can be corrected if it is not written according to the above rule. In addition, adjectival forms derived from institution names are also often mistaken because people feel the need to distinguish them from genuine common names (especially if the name contains a fancy name that becomes identical with a common name if written in lowercase). Furthermore, it is unclear why cinemas are treated differently (see above) from theatres, cf. Művész mozi, but Magyar Színház.|$|E
