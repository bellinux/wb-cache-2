5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each <b>gluon</b> carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a <b>gluon</b> is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen <b>gluon,</b> it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen <b>gluon,</b> it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held {{to each other in}} the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The <b>gluon</b> is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E
5|$|In the {{prevailing}} Standard Model of physics, the photon {{is one of}} four gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight <b>gluon</b> gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.|$|E
25|$|The eight <b>gluons</b> {{mediate the}} strong {{interactions}} between color charged particles (the quarks). <b>Gluons</b> are massless. The eightfold multiplicity of <b>gluons</b> is labeled {{by a combination}} of color and anticolor charge (e.g. red–antigreen). Because the <b>gluons</b> have an effective color charge, they can also interact among themselves. The <b>gluons</b> and their interactions are described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics.|$|R
40|$|Glauber <b>gluons</b> in Drell-Yan {{processes}} are soft <b>gluons</b> with the transverse momenta {{much larger than}} their momentum components along the directions of initial hadrons. Their existence has been a serious challenge in proving the factorization of Drell-Yan processes. The recently proposed soft collinear effect theory of QCD can provide a transparent way to show factorizations for a class of processes, {{but it does not}} address the effect of glauber <b>gluons.</b> In this letter we first confirm the existence of glauber <b>gluons</b> through an example. We then add glauber <b>gluons</b> into the effective theory and study their interaction with other particles. In the framework of the effective theory with glauber <b>gluons</b> we are able to show that the effects of glauber <b>gluons</b> in Drell-Yan {{processes are}} canceled and the factorization holds in the existence of glauber <b>gluons.</b> Our work completes the proof or argument of factorization of Drell-Yan process in the framework of the soft collinear effective theory.

50|$|<b>Gluons</b> {{mediate the}} strong interaction, which join quarks and thereby form hadrons, which are either baryons (three quarks) or mesons (one quark and one antiquark). Protons and {{neutrons}} are baryons, joined by <b>gluons</b> {{to form the}} atomic nucleus. Like quarks, <b>gluons</b> exhibit colour and anticolour—unrelated {{to the concept of}} visual color—sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of <b>gluons.</b>|$|R
25|$|Zwanziger {{furthermore}} {{noted that}} the resulting <b>gluon</b> propagator does not admit a Källénndash&Lehmann spectral representation, which signals that the <b>gluon</b> cannot be a physical particle any longer. This is often interpreted as signaling color confinement.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gluon</b> is a vector boson; {{like the}} photon, {{it has a}} spin of 1. While massive spin-1 {{particles}} have three polarization states, massless gauge bosons like the <b>gluon</b> have only two polarization states because gauge invariance requires the polarization to be transverse. In quantum field theory, unbroken gauge invariance requires that gauge bosons have zero mass (experiments limit the gluon's rest mass to less than a few meV/c2). The <b>gluon</b> has negative intrinsic parity.|$|E
25|$|The gluons play an {{important}} role in the elementary strong interactions between quarks and gluons, described by QCD and studied particularly at the electron-proton collider HERA at DESY. The number and momentum distribution of the gluons in the proton (<b>gluon</b> density) have been measured by two experiments, H1 and ZEUS, in the years 1996-2007. The <b>gluon</b> contribution to the proton spin has been studied by the HERMES experiment at HERA. The <b>gluon</b> density in the proton (when behaving hadronically) also has been measured.|$|E
40|$|The {{factorization}} of {{soft and}} ultrasoft <b>gluons</b> from collinear particles is {{shown at the}} level of operators in an effective field theory. Exclusive hadronic factorization and inclusive partonic factorization follow as special cases. The leading order Lagrangian is derived using power counting and gauge invariance in the effective theory. Several species of <b>gluons</b> are required, and softer <b>gluons</b> appear as background fields to <b>gluons</b> with harder momenta. Two examples are given: the factorization of soft <b>gluons</b> in B → Dπ, and the soft-collinear convolution for the B → Xsγ spectrum. 1 I...|$|R

Compact expressions for helicity amplitudes for scattering processes of three and four <b>gluons,</b> with up to three of them off-shell, are presented. Also, maximum-helicity-violating configurations are identified {{for up to two}} off-shell <b>gluons,</b> and the expressions for their helicity amplitudes for an arbitrary number of on-shell <b>gluons</b> are derived. ...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the single}} photon of QED or the three W and Z bosons {{of the weak}} interaction, there are eight {{independent}} types of <b>gluon</b> in QCD.|$|E

25|$|Strong {{interaction}}: {{the interaction}} responsible for holding quarks {{together to form}} hadrons, and holding neutrons and also protons together to form atomic nuclei. The exchange particle that mediates this force is the <b>gluon.</b>|$|E
40|$|Beside {{comparatively}} {{low energy}} Cherenkov <b>gluons</b> observed at RHIC, {{there could be}} high energy <b>gluons</b> at LHC, related to the high energy region of positive real part of the forward scattering amplitude. In both cases they give rise to particles emitted along some cone. The characteristics of the cones produced by {{these two types of}} <b>gluons</b> are different. Therefore different experiments are needed to detect them. The cosmic ray event which initiated this idea is described in detail. RHIC experiments [1, 2] have shown the two-bump structure of the azimuthal angle distribution near the away-side jets. This can be interpreted as the emission of Cherenkov <b>gluons</b> [3, 4, 5, 6]. The notion of Cherenkov <b>gluons</b> was first introduced in [7, 8] to explain some cosmic ray data [9]. Analogous to Cherenkov photons, the Cherenkov <b>gluons</b> can be emitted in hadronic collisions provided the nuclear index of refraction n exceeds 1. The partons moving in such nuclear medium would emit them. These <b>gluons</b> should be emitte...|$|R

25|$|For a long time, lattice {{simulations}} {{seemed to}} indicate that the modified <b>gluon</b> and ghost propagators proposed by Gribov and Zwanziger were correct. In 2007, however, computers had become sufficiently strong to probe the region of low momenta, where the propagators are most modified, {{and it turned out that}} the Gribovndash&Zwanziger picture is not correct. Instead, the <b>gluon</b> propagator goes to a constant value when the momentum is taken to zero, and the ghost propagator still goes like 1/k2 at low momenta. This is the case for both 3 and 4 space-time dimensions. A solution to this discrepancy has been proposed, adding condensates to the Gribovndash&Zwanziger action.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the behavior of the theory at large and small momenta, a key quantity is the propagator. For a Yang–Mills theory we have to consider both the <b>gluon</b> and the ghost propagators. At large momenta (ultraviolet limit), the question was completely settled with the discovery of the asymptotic freedom. In this case it is seen that the theory becomes free (trivial ultraviolet fixed point for renormalization group) and both the <b>gluon</b> and ghost propagators are those of a free massless particle. The asymptotic states of the theory are represented by massless gluons that carry the interaction. The coupling runs to zero as we will see in the next section.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for QCD condensates comes from two eras, the pre-QCD era 1950–1973 and the post-QCD era, after 1974. The pre-QCD results {{established that the}} strong interactions vacuum contains a quark chiral condensate, while the post-QCD results established that the vacuum also contains a <b>gluon</b> condensate.|$|E
25|$|Although in {{the normal}} phase of QCD single <b>gluons</b> may not travel freely, it is {{predicted}} that there exist hadrons that are formed entirely of <b>gluons</b> — called glueballs. There are also conjectures about other exotic hadrons in which real <b>gluons</b> (as opposed to virtual ones found in ordinary hadrons) would be primary constituents. Beyond the normal phase of QCD (at extreme temperatures and pressures), quark–gluon plasma forms. In such a plasma there are no hadrons; quarks and <b>gluons</b> become free particles.|$|R
500|$|The {{strong force}} is today {{understood}} {{to represent the}} interactions between quarks and <b>gluons</b> as detailed by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The strong force is the fundamental force mediated by <b>gluons,</b> acting upon quarks, antiquarks, and the <b>gluons</b> themselves. The (aptly named) strong interaction is the [...] "strongest" [...] of the four fundamental forces.|$|R
40|$|A {{critically}} discerning {{discussion of}} path integral bosonization is given. Successively evaluating the conventional path integral bosonization of QCD it is shown without any approximations that <b>gluons</b> must {{be composed of}} two quarks. This contradicts the fundamentals of QCD, where quarks and <b>gluons</b> are independent fields. Furthermore, bosonizing the Fierz reordered effective four quark interaction term yields <b>gluons,</b> too. Colorless ``mesons'' are shown to be Fierz equivalent to a submanifold of <b>gluons.</b> The results obtained are not specific to QCD, but apply to other models as well. Comment: LaTeX, 8 page...|$|R
25|$|The QCD vacuum is {{the vacuum}} state of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It {{is an example}} of a non-perturbative vacuum state, {{characterized}} by non-vanishing condensates such as the <b>gluon</b> condensate and the quark condensate in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of quark matter.|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{describes}} {{three of}} the four fundamental forces in nature; only gravity remains unexplained. In the Standard Model, a force is described as an exchange of bosons between the objects affected, such as a photon for the electromagnetic force and a <b>gluon</b> for the strong interaction. Those particles are called force carriers or messenger particles.|$|E
25|$|Under some circumstances, {{perturbation}} theory is an invalid approach to take. This {{happens when the}} system we wish to describe cannot be described by a small perturbation imposed on some simple system. In quantum chromodynamics, for instance, the interaction of quarks with the <b>gluon</b> field cannot be treated perturbatively at low energies because the coupling constant (the expansion parameter) becomes too large.|$|E
40|$|We {{apply the}} {{solution}} to the recursion relation for the double-off-shell quark current to the problem of computing one loop amplitudes with an arbitrary number of <b>gluons.</b> We are able to compute amplitudes for photon-gluon scattering, electron-positron annihilation to <b>gluons,</b> and gluon-gluon scattering via a quark loop in the case of like-helicity <b>gluons.</b> In addition, we present the result for the one-loop gluon-gluon scattering amplitude when one of the <b>gluons</b> has opposite helicity from the others.

The RFT calculus for reggeized <b>gluons</b> similarly to the RFT introduced in [3] is proposed and discussed.

50|$|The strong {{interaction}} is {{mediated by the}} exchange of massless particles called <b>gluons</b> that act between quarks, antiquarks, and other <b>gluons.</b> <b>Gluons</b> are thought to interact with quarks and other <b>gluons</b> {{by way of a}} type of charge called color charge. Color charge is analogous to electromagnetic charge, but it comes in three types (±red, ±green, ±blue) rather than one, which results in a different type of force, with different rules of behavior. These rules are detailed in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of quark-gluon interactions.|$|R
25|$|Elementary bosons {{responsible}} for the four fundamental forces of nature are called force particles (gauge bosons). Strong interaction is mediated by the <b>gluon,</b> weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons, and it is sometimes hypothetized that gravitation is mediated by the graviton, {{although it is not}} predicted by the Standard Model but by other theories in the framework of quantum field theory.|$|E
25|$|In quantum chromodynamics, a quark's color {{can take}} one of three values or charges, red, green, and blue. An {{antiquark}} can {{take one of}} three anticolors, called antired, antigreen, and antiblue (represented as cyan, magenta and yellow, respectively). Gluons are mixtures of two colors, such as red and antigreen, which constitutes their color charge. QCD considers eight gluons of the possible nine color–anticolor combinations to be unique; see eight <b>gluon</b> colors for an explanation.|$|E
