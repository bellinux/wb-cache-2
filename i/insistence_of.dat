König was created Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Eusebio by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of 15 December 1958.

5|$|In conclusion, the <b>insistence</b> <b>of</b> ahimsa {{is not so}} {{much about}} non-injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self.

The burial of what now are {{considered}} to be Maria's and Alexei's remains, to be with those of the family, was planned for 2015 but has been delayed mainly due to the <b>insistence</b> <b>of</b> the Russian Orthodox Church on more DNA-testing.|$|E

5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a list of targets.

The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the <b>insistence</b> <b>of</b> Secretary of War Henry L.

5|$|Despite the {{collapse}} of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At the <b>insistence</b> <b>of</b> Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly half his heavy cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return to the status quo in northern Italy.|$|E

Upon <b>insistence</b> <b>of</b> the French, M'ba allowed opposition candidates to run, which it claimed was {{the main reason for}} starting the coup in the first place. However, their leaders were barred from participating because of their involvement in the coup, and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes.|$|E
