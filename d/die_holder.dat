40|$|Brittle {{fracture}} of large forging equipment usually leads to catastrophic consequences. To avoid {{this kind of}} accident, the brittle fracture behaviors of a large <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> were studied by simulating the practical application. The <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> is used on the large die forging press, and it is made of 55 NiCrMoV 7 hot-work tool steel. Detailed investigations including mechanical properties analysis, metallographic observation, fractography, transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis and {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) were conducted. The results reveal that the material generated a large quantity of large size polyhedral M 23 C 6 (M: Fe and Cr mainly) and elongated M 3 C (M: Fe mainly) carbides along the martensitic lath boundaries when the <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> was recurrently tempered and water-cooled at 250 °C during the service. The large size carbides lead to the material embrittlement and impact toughness degradation, and further resulted in the brittle {{fracture of}} the <b>die</b> <b>holder.</b> Therefore, the operation specification must be emphasized to avoid the <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> being cooled by using water, which is aimed at accelerating the cooling...|$|E

Our objective {{is to develop a}} parametric study that can leads mainly to predict accurately the final geometry of the sheet blank and the distribution of strains and stresses and also to control various forming defects, such as thinning as well as parameters affecting strongly the final form of the sheet after forming process. Design/methodology/approach: In cold forming (deep drawing) operation, sheet metal is subject to large strains in order to obtain the final desired shape. However, under severe forming conditions the sheet metal may experience some thinning and even some tearing during the process. Parameters of the deep forming process that may contribute to such conditions include, aspect ratio, blank initial thickness, forming temperature, shoulder radii of the die and punch, contact conditions between the blank and the <b>die,</b> <b>holder</b> and punch, punch displacement rate, etc. The work presented in the current paper is a first part study of numerical parametric investigation that is dealing with the most influent parameters in a forming process to simulate the deep drawing of square cup (such as geometric parameters and coefficient of friction).

40|$|In this study, the {{rheological}} {{characteristics of}} a titanium alloy have been obtained by multi-dome bulging test. Free bulging process is an experimental technique {{that can be used}} to characterize material in conditions of biaxial tension during superplastic, as well as conventional, hot forming. The constitutive constants are calculated on a base of the information about the bulge geometry, applied pressure, and forming time. A multi-dome forming test allows one to reduce the number of the experiments required for the characterization, since every multi-dome test produces several domes of different size. In this study, a specific die for multi-dome test was used. The die has six holes with different radiuses of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 mm. During a test, the specimen is clamped between blank holder and <b>die</b> <b>holder,</b> heated to a specific temperature, and formed by applying constant gas pressure. The experiments were conducted at different temperatures for OT 4 - 1 titanium alloy. The constitutive constants were obtained by processing the experimental data using two different techniques and compared with tensile test results. In order to estimate the influence of friction on the experimental results and to verify obtained material characteristics, finite element (FE) simulation was performed. Finally, the results of FE simulation were compared with the experimental data. The results of the simulation show the advantage of material characterization based on multi dome tests and its interpretation by inverse analysis. The deviations produced by the effect of friction are more significant when the direct approach is applied instead of inverse analysis with a semi analytical model of the bulging process...|$|E
40|$|With the {{competitive}} challenge facing business today, {{the need to}} keep cost down and quality up is a matter of survival. One way in which wire manufacturers can meet this challenge is to possess a thorough understanding of deformation, friction and lubrication during the wire drawing process, and therefore to make good decisions regarding the selection and application of lubricants as well as the die design. Friction, lubrication and die design during wire drawing thus become the subject of this study. Although theoretical and experimental investigations have been being carried out ever since the establishment of wire drawing technology, many problems remain unsolved. It is therefore necessary to conduct further research on traditional and fundamental subjects such as the mechanics of deformation, friction, lubrication and die design in wire drawing. Drawing experiments were carried out on an existing bull-block under different cross-sectional area reductions, different speeds and different lubricants. The instrumentation to measure drawing load and drawing speed was set up and connected to the wire drawing machine, together with a data acquisition system. A die box connected to the existing <b>die</b> <b>holder</b> for using dry soap lubricant was designed and tested. The experimental results in terms of drawing stress vs percentage area reduction curves under different drawing conditions were analysed and compared. The effects on drawing stress of friction, lubrication, drawing speed and pressure die nozzle are discussed. In order to determine the flow stress of the material during deformation, tensile tests were performed on an Instron universal test machine, using the wires drawn under different area reductions. A polynomial function is used to correlate the flow stress of the material with the plastic strain, on which a general computer program has been written to find out the coefficients of the stress-strain function. The residual lubricant film on the steel wire after drawing was examined both radially and longitudinally using an SEM and optical microscope. The lubricant film on the drawn wire was clearly observed. Therefore, the micro-analysis by SEM provides a way of friction and lubrication assessment in wire drawing...|$|E

In this process, a moving die was employed in order to correct the eccentricity between the punch and die and to ease the setting of tools. The gap between the <b>die</b> and <b>holder</b> allowed the eccentric die to move, and thus the die became concentric after several strikes. For the moving die, the depth of the shiny burnished surface on the sheared edge increased and that of the rough fracture surface decreased.

The array, which is {{to be used as a}} spatial light modulator (SLM) for optical maskless lithography, consists of 8 mu m x 8 mu m pixels, which can be individually addressed by an analog voltage to enable accurate tilt angle modulation. Due to very stringent requirements on mounted-die flatness (< 0. 01 mrad), the first level packaging of SLM die is done using specially designed SiC holders. To avoid trapped particles between the <b>die</b> and <b>holder,</b> which would jeopardize the flatness spec, special backside cleaning of the dies (less than or equal to one 0. 8 -mu m particle/cm(2)) is needed before mounting the SLM <b>die</b> on the <b>holder.</b> To enable this backside cleaning and to avoid front-side particles during dicing, handling, and wire bonding, a temporary wafer-or zero-level packaging cap, which can be placed and removed at room temperature, was developed.
