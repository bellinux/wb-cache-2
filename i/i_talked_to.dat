That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E

[...] This came shortly after McConaughey said he would hypothetically be interested in reprising his role as Rust Cohle in a third season.

She stated: [...] "When I first read the book, I thought, 'This would be a great film,' and boy was I wrong. It's a much better TV series. Fast forward, I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC, which to me seemed like an odd pairing for this. Then I heard it wasn't going forward at NBC so <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Frank." [...] On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers; the former wrote the script and directed the episode. The entire series was pre-ordered based on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the {{official}} music video's release in November 2003, Madonna's manager Caresse Henry confirmed video plans for [...] "Love Profusion". It was directed by Luc Besson and shot on September 2003, at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Besson later directed Madonna in the 2007 animated film Arthur and the Invisibles. [...] "There are a lot of special effects. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> things that weren't there – which is what you do when you're doing green-screen or blue-screen stuff. There's {{going to be a lot}} of fairies dancing around me. Isn't that exciting? I always have a lot of fairies dancing around me", Madonna commented about the music video. The video premiered in the US on February 11, 2004 on AOL's First View. After the premiere, it was streamed on Yahoo!, MSN, Windows Media, Apple, MTV, VH1, iFilm and Madonna.com.|$|E
500|$|Although Winona Ryder was {{the first}} cast member {{attached}} to the script, Dianne Wiest {{was the first}} to sign on. [...] "Dianne, in particular, was wonderful", Burton said. [...] "She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested". When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. [...] "He certainly wasn't my ideal, but <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him", Burton remembered. [...] "He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up". Cruise asked for a [...] "happier" [...] ending. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks turned down the part, the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop The Bonfire of the Vanities. Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: [...] "Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late." [...] Jim Carrey was also considered for the role, while Thompson favored John Cusack. Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest, although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but I {{could do it in}} a way that also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Giancarlo about how he played that part ...

500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{joined the}} series during its second season, {{and had to}} quickly learn about all the gadgets {{featured}} in Fringes debut season.

[...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing that struck me about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s {{one of those things that}} people love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s sort of what I was trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking. It’s quite cool." ...|$|E
500|$|A Bengali by birth, Shankar {{had already}} brought the growing {{humanitarian}} crisis in Bangladesh to Harrison's attention, while {{staying at the}} ex-Beatle's house, Friar Park, earlier in the year. The state formerly known as East Pakistan (and before that, East Bengal) had suffered an estimated 300,000 casualties when the Bhola cyclone hit its shores on 12 November 1970, and the indifference shown by the ruling government in West Pakistan, particularly by President Yahya Khan, was just one reason the Bengali national movement sought independence on 25 March 1971. This declaration resulted in an immediate military crackdown by Khan's troops, and three days later the Bangladesh Liberation War began. By 13 June, details of the systematic massacre of citizens were beginning to emerge internationally via the publication in London's Sunday Times of an article by Anthony Mascarenhas. Along with the torrential rains and intensive flooding that were threatening the passage of millions of refugees into north-eastern India, this news galvanised Shankar into approaching Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering. [...] "I was in a very sad mood, having read all this news," [...] Shankar later told Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "and I said, 'George, this is the situation, I know it doesn't concern you, I know you can't possibly identify.' But while <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> George he was very deeply moved... and he said, 'Yes, I think I'll {{be able to do}} something.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I thought I had {{the idea}} broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video.
