This theory refers the effect to an attractive force, and is not agreed to by the discoverer, M. Arago, nor by M. Ampère, who quote against it the absence of all attraction when the magnet and metal are at rest (62. 126.), although the induced magnetism should still remain; and who, from experiments made with a long dipping needle, conceive the action to be always repulsive (125.).|$|E
60|$|The case which {{originally}} drew {{my attention}} to this topic is that given by Mr. Basil Thomson in his South Sea Yarns (p. 195). Mr. Thomson informs me that he wrote his description {{on the day after}} he witnessed the ceremony, a precaution which left no room for illusions of memory. Of course, in describing a conjuring trick, one who is not an expert records, not what actually occurred, but what he was able to see, and the chances are that he did not see, and therefore omits, an <b>essential</b> <b>circumstance,</b> while he misstates other circumstances. I am informed by Mrs. Steel, the author of The Potter's Thumb and other stories of Indian life, that, in watching an Indian conjurer, she generally, or frequently, detects his method. She says that the conjurer often begins by whirling rapidly before the eyes of the spectators a small polished skull of a monkey, and she is inclined to think that the spectators who look at this are, in some way, more easily deluded. These facts are mentioned that I may not seem unaware of what can be said to impugn the accuracy of the descriptions of the Fire Rite, as given by Mr. Thomson and other witnesses.|$|E

6000|$|A {{coincidence}} remains {{which more}} than all the rest proclaims Pope to be the author of the address [...] "to the reader." [...] Nothing would have served better his purpose in the prosecution than to prevail upon Curll to confess that the letters were of his own procuring and printing. Upon the seizure of the books Smythe wrote to him in the name of P. T., promising that he should have the work upon easier terms, and holding out the prospect of a second and more important volume of correspondence if he would keep secret the whole transaction, would assert that he had the letters from different hands, and avow that he had printed them, as he did Cromwell's before.[56] The preface, which had never been seen by Curll, and which was appended, as if in anticipation of the event, to all the copies carried off to the House of Lords, contained the same tale he was instructed to tell. [...] "The collection," [...] it said, [...] "hath been owing to several cabinets, some drawn from thence by accidents, and others, even of those to ladies, voluntarily given. It is to one of that sex we are beholden for the whole correspondence with H. C[romwell] Esq., which letters being lent her by that gentleman she took the liberty to print." [...] On the 12th of May, the day the work was published, Pope gave a similar account to Caryll of the mode by which the contents were procured. [...] "What," [...] he said, [...] "makes me sick of writing is the shameless industry of such fellows as Curll, and the idle ostentation, or weak partiality of many of my correspondents, who have shown about my letters (which I never writ but in haste, and generally against the grain, in mere civility; for almost all letters are impertinent further than Si vales, bene est; ego valeo) {{to such a degree that}} a volume of two hundred or more are printed by that rascal. But he could never have injured me this way, had not my friends furnished him with the occasion, by keeping such wretched papers as they ought to have burned." [...] The whole of this passage is an egregious specimen of misrepresentation and hypocrisy. A glance at the work must have revealed to Pope that the new letters it contained were those which had been returned to him,--the letters to Gay, Digby, Blount, and Caryll; that it comprised letters to as well as from him,[57]--letters of which he was the sole depositary; that the text was not taken from the originals, but from the copy he had amended and re-cast; and that it was, therefore, impossible that his acquaintances should have furnished materials which could only have been derived from one source,--the bound book in the Oxford library. His pretence that his letters were hasty and insignificant expressions of civility, when he had spared no pains in collecting and editing them; his affected indignation at his friends [...] "for keeping such wretched papers as they ought to have burned," [...] when he himself had preserved them in duplicate, and designed them for publication; his transparent fiction that almost the entire circle of his correspondents,--Addison, Steele, Congreve, Gay, Walsh, Trumbull, Craggs, Digby, Blount, and others,--had been guilty of [...] "idle ostentation or weak partiality," [...] in showing these [...] "wretched papers" [...] to somebody who transcribed them for the press,--are all so many additional arguments to show the conscious guilt of Pope, and the gross and clumsy inventions by which he endeavoured to divert suspicion. The fable he concocted is, in its <b>essential</b> <b>circumstance,</b> identical with the fabulous story of P. T. While P. T. on his part is telling a falsehood to the public in the preface, and begging the bookseller to tell it in the House of Lords, Pope on his own behalf is telling the same falsehood in private to Caryll. This concurrence of misrepresentation between the letter of the poet, and P. T.'s address [...] "to the reader" [...] and instructions to Curll, could not have proceeded from independent and hostile persons.|$|E

Although the attributes that underpin the capacity to adapt are widely agreed upon in literature, empirical evidence on how rural communities can develop adaptations are still scarce. Here, we provide such evidence based on a comprehensive driver-response reconstruction of a community in the buffer-zone of a Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. We found that coping (between 1990 and 2000) was gradually replaced by adaptations (1995 – 2010) based on: (i) diversification of land-use, (ii) improved social organization, (iii) improved communal decision-making, and (iv) more sustainable forms of land management. The diversification of local farming systems through inclusion of organic forest-based palm and coffee cultivation {{and the establishment of}} associated organizations, formed the basis of these changes. These adaptations were mainly supported by improved social, institutional and political capital. Communal forest resources, long-term support of an NGO and a highly motivated population, were <b>essential</b> <b>circumstances</b> that allowed these trajectories to develop. However, current unequal land and power distribution could undermine and debilitate adaptive capacity. Communities and supportive organizations need to be aware and capable to adjust continuously to prevent today's adaptation strategies from becoming tomorrow's coping responses...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, social {{innovation}} {{has been gaining}} more attention, {{not only in the}} scholarly literature and in public discourse but in rural development practice as well. An important reason for this is the greater involvement of civil society in this form of innovation. In this paper, building on definitions of {{social innovation}} found in the literature, we focus on the actual processes of social innovation in rural Hungary. The hypothesis behind our research was that {{a better understanding of how}} social innovation takes place in practice could increase its presence and efficiency in rural development. To explore these issues, we analysed four different cases of social innovation situated in rural Hungary. Our research shows that, despite common patterns, social innovation is highly dependent on its actual context and on the individual, the agentic engine, who initiates and carries out the innovation. For the capitalisation and the long-term sustainability of an innovative development project the institutionalisation of social networks gathering around it seems to be another crucial factor. Thus, creating an appropriate frame to drive the process all the way from the innovative idea through product development to institutionalisation, possibly in the form of a social enterprise, can be considered an <b>essential</b> <b>circumstance</b> for successful social innovation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) is a system consisting {{of a collection of}} nodes and a base station. A node is composed by a processor, local memory, sensors, radio and battery and a base station is responsible for receiving and processing data collected by the nodes. They perform collaborative activities due to limited resources, such as battery, processor and memory. Nowadays, the applications of WSNs are many and varied, and the applications in agriculture are still incipient. One interesting WSN application is in greenhouses, where the crop conditions such as climate and soil do not depend on natural agents. To control and monitor the environmental factors, sensors and actuators are <b>essential.</b> Under these <b>circumstances,</b> WSN should be used to make a distributed measure, spreading sensors all over the greenhouse. In a great number of applications the sensors are located in a fixed point of the greenhouse. However, even in a greenhouse there are differences between some environmental variables from one place to another. Thus, using WSN should guarantee not only real time monitoring, but also guarantee a better control.

At the posthumous {{trial of}} the Ruthvens in November, {{witnesses}} like Lennox swore to his {{quarter of an hour}} of talk with Ruthven at Falkland before the hunt.

In particular, behaviors for robots are formalized in terms of kinetic state machines, a motion description language, and the interaction of the kinetic state machine with real-time information from (limited range) sensors. This formalization allows us to create a mathematical basis for the study of such systems, including techniques for integrating sets of behaviors. In addition we suggest optimality criteria for comparing both atomic and compound behaviors in various environments.

Core flood experiments using hematite suspensions for various particle concentrations (1 - 5 ppm) were conducted in Bentheim sandstone cores to quantify the injectivity. Simultaneously, X-ray CT scanning was performed under dynamic conditions to obtain deposition profiles along the core at different times. From microscopic analyses and visual observations, {{it was found that}} surface deposition in the porous medium and face plugging at the inlet of the core were responsible for decline in injectivity. A good agreement was obtained between the modeled and experimental results showing the validity of the retention function. Further, the effect of various parameters (particle concentration, number of grids etc.) on injectivity was investigated. Finally, the results from the study help the operators in planning and design of water management strategy for improved oil recovery projects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to understanding {{of the effect of}} organizational context on supply chain integration. One result is a context- based model that can provide support for practitioners regarding what level of integration to establish with suppliers and customers. Given the notion that most organizations are dependent on other organizations, it leads to a need for not only cross-functional integration but also for integration across organizational boundaries. However, in many organizations the level of integration with suppliers and customers is often inappropriate, inefficient and limited mainly to dyadic integration of order processing and operational scheduling. The existing literature provides only a limited insight concerning the <b>essential</b> <b>circumstances</b> for the integration and the slow growth of the implementation of inter-organizational integration has been attributed primarily to lack of guidelines for creating business relationships with supply chain partners. In the literature, “the more integration the better performance” solutions have often been presented without consideration of very complex internal and external organizational environments of involved companies. During recent years, questions have been raised regarding the nature of integration with suppliers and customers {{and the extent to which}} it can be accomplished. Instead of all-encompassing integration, selectivity has been suggested in terms of what level of integration should be applied to each link of the supply chain. The problem for an organization is not to find “one best way”; rather it is to search for solutions that advance integration and differentiation simultaneously. Preferable level of integration depends on many contextual factors associated with e. g. focal company, industry, competitive environment, and nature and type of products. However, in the previous research the focus has primarily been on studying single or limited sets of contextual factors and their impact on integration. These results are often fragmented, leading to multiple frameworks and models. A unifying model providing recommendations in terms of what level of integration to establish with suppliers and customers considering organization’s specific circumstances is desirable. In this study, a large number of contextual factors of integration with suppliers and customers were identified and structured. Additionally, the relationship between these factors and level of the integration was clarified. The study is based on the Grounded Theory methodology. To understand the effect of context on level of integration, two supply chains (triads) from two different industries - medical devices and fast moving consumer goods - have been selected as core samples. Findings are based on in-depth analysis of qualitative data obtained from fourteen interviews with practitioners such as CEOs, SC managers, sales managers, purchasing managers, and logisticians. Following the Grounded Theory methodology, the analysis of the collected data was conducted in three major rounds divided into six steps. The results were compared with a theoretical frame of reference. The main result of this study is a model that describes the relationship between contextual factors and integration activities with suppliers and customers. The findings suggest that the assumption of a fit between context and integration of the Structural Contingency Theory is applicable also from an inter-organizational perspective. The model can be applied to contextual factors both external and internal to an organization. It is supplemented by structured lists of identified contextual factors and integration activities. Recalling the notion of fit between value of contextual factors and level of integration with suppliers and customers, it can be stated that even low levels of integration can be appropriate as long as they are consistent with the values of certain factors representing organizational context. Furthermore, the model adds to existing models and frameworks as it can be used as a diagnostic tool. Applying this model, an organization can evaluate if current levels of integration fit with the corresponding values of contextual factors. Furthermore, the model support identification of misfits between values of contextual factors and present level of integration and it provides an opportunity to adjust or reevaluate the current levels of integration. The model, in combination with the lists of contextual factors and integration activities, can then be used to develop corrective actions in order to regain the desired fit. Intention of this study was to identify and analyze integration of triads in the studied supply chains, commonly known as Supply chain integration. However, this scope of integration has not been found, which is in line with previous research indicating that triadic integration is rare. To reflect the actual situation in more accurate way it is suggested to use the term Inter-organizational integration, implying dyadic scope of integration, rather than Supply chain integration. ...|$|R

For any mobile device, the capacity to explore in its surroundings is <b>essential.</b> Evading hazardous <b>circumstances,</b> for example, crashes and risky conditions (temperature, radiation, presentation to climate, and so on.) comes in the first place, yet in the event that the robot has a reason that identifies with particular places in its surroundings, it must discover those spots. There is an increment in examination here due to the requisition of mobile robots in a solving issues like investigating natural landscape and assets, transportation tasks, surveillance, or cleaning. We require great moving competencies and a well exactness for moving in a specified track in these requisitions. Notwithstanding, control of these navigation bots get to be exceptionally troublesome because of the exceedingly unsystematic and dynamic aspects of the surrounding world. The intelligent reply to this issue is the provision of sensors to study the earth. As neural networks (NNs) are described by adaptability and a fitness for managing non-linear problems, they are conceived to be useful when utilized on navigation robots. In this exploration our computerized reasoning framework is focused around neural network model for control of an Automated motion robot in eccentric and unsystematic nature. Hence the back propagation algorithm has been utilized for controlling the direction of the mobile robot when it experiences by an obstacle in the left, right and front directions. The recreation of the robot under different deterrent conditions is carried out utilizing Arduino which utilizes C programs for usage...|$|R

In 1981 these three serotypes accounted for 45 %, 12 %, and 7 % of isolations. The remaining 35 % comprised strains belonging to a further 188 different serotypes, none of which {{accounted for more than}} 1 % of the total. In 1988 S typhimurium accounted for 24 % of isolations, S enteritidis 57 %, and S virchow 4 %. The remaining 15 % comprised strains of a further 184 serotypes. The resistances to the common antimicrobial drugs in non-typhoidal salmonellas isolated in England and Wales in 1981 and 1988 were reported with particular reference to resistance to four or more antimicrobial drugs (multiple resistance). For S typhimurium the overall percentage of resistant strains varied little, but multiple resistance more than doubled from 5 % to 12 %; in S enteritidis the incidence remained the same. In S virchow the percentages of strains resistant to all the antimicrobial drugs and in particular, to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, trimethoprim and furazolidone, rose from 0. 2 % to 10. 4 %. Salmonella enteritis in man is usually a self limiting disease and antimicrobial treatment is seldom required; but should spread beyond the intestine occur, effective antimicrobial treatment is <b>essential.</b> Under these <b>circumstances</b> a knowledge of the likelihood of resistances to commonly available drugs could be of considerable value to the clinician...|$|R
40|$|The SMC 5 / 6 protein complex {{consists}} of the Smc 5, Smc 6 and Non-Smc-Element (Nse) proteins and is important for genome stability in many species. To identify novel components in the DNA repair pathway, we carried out a genetic screen to identify mutations that confer reduced resistance to the genotoxic effects of caffeine, which inhibits the ATM and ATR DNA damage response proteins. This approach identified inactivating mutations in CG 5524 and MAGE, homologs of genes encoding Smc 6 and Nse 3 in yeasts. The fact that Smc 5 mutants are also caffeine-sensitive and that Mage physically interacts with Drosophila homologs of Nse proteins suggests that {{the structure of the}} Smc 5 / 6 complex is conserved in Drosophila. Although Smc 5 / 6 proteins are required for viability in S. cerevisiae, they are not <b>essential</b> under normal <b>circumstances</b> in Drosophila. However, flies carrying mutations in Smc 5, Smc 6 and MAGE are hypersensitive to genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation, camptothecin, hydroxyurea and MMS, consistent with the Smc 5 / 6 complex serving a conserved role in genome stability. We also show that mutant flies are not compromised for pre-mitotic cell cycle checkpoint responses. Rather, caffeine-induced apoptosis in these mutants is exacerbated by inhibition of ATM or ATR checkpoint kinases but suppressed by Rad 51 depletion, suggesting a functional interaction involving homologous DNA repair pathways that deserves further scrutiny. Our insights into the SMC 5 / 6 complex provide new challenges for understanding the role of thi...|$|R
40|$|High-throughput {{sequencing}} metabarcoding {{studies in}} marine biosecurity have largely focused on targeting environmental DNA (eDNA). DNA can persist extracellularly in the environment, making discrimination of living organisms difficult. In this study, bilge water samples (i. e., water accumulating on-board a vessel during transit) {{were collected from}} 15 small recreational and commercial vessels. eDNA and eRNA molecules were co-extracted and the V 4 region of the 18 S ribosomal RNA gene targeted for metabarcoding. In total, 62. 7 % of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified {{at least once in}} the corresponding eDNA and eRNA reads, with 19. 5 % unique to eDNA and 17. 7 % to eRNA. There were substantial differences in diversity between molecular compartments; 57 % of sequences from eDNA-only OTUs belonged to fungi, likely originating from legacy DNA. In contrast, there was a higher percentage of metazoan (50. 2 %) and ciliate (31. 7 %) sequences in the eRNA-only OTUs. Our data suggest that the presence of eRNA-only OTUs could be due to increased cellular activities of some rare taxa that were not identified in the eDNA datasets, unusually high numbers of rRNA transcripts in ciliates, and/or artefacts produced during the reverse transcriptase, PCR and sequencing steps. The proportions of eDNA/eRNA shared and unshared OTUs were highly heterogeneous within individual bilge water samples. Multiple factors including boat type and the activities performed on-board, such as washing of scientific equipment, may {{play a major role in}} contributing to this variability. For some marine biosecurity applications analysis, eDNA-only data may be sufficient, however there are an increasing number of instances where distinguishing the living portion of a community is <b>essential.</b> For these <b>circumstances,</b> we suggest only including OTUs that are present in both eDNA and eRNA data. OTUs found only in the eRNA data need to be interpreted with caution until further research provides conclusive evidence for their origin...|$|R
