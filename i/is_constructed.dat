5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> {{primarily}} {{of steel and}} glass. The main building {{is based on the}} diagonal truss. Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western fa√ßade of the museum is a screen wall composed of laminated glass tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too much like a trailer on stilts.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{synthesise}} {{a number}} of unique polymers like the polysaccharide molecules cellulose, pectin and xyloglucan from which the land plant cell wall <b>is</b> <b>constructed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> of red pressed brick, detailed with locally quarried limestone, {{and reinforced}} with steel girders. The building's primary contractor was C.A. Moses.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{land was}} given to the British Malaya government in 1882 for them to construct a hospital.

5|$|The derived {{category}} of coherent sheaves <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> using tools from complex geometry, {{a branch of}} mathematics that describes geometric curves in algebraic terms and solves geometric problems using algebraic equations. On the other hand, the Fukaya category <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> using symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics. Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a symplectic form, a mathematical tool {{that can be used}} to compute area in two-dimensional examples.|$|E

5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E

A number of residences <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> between 1946 and 1960 (8.7%) and after 1980 (14.6%).|$|R
5|$|Borobudur <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> {{in such a}} {{way that}} it reveals various levels of terraces, showing {{intricate}} architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in Arupadhatu circular terraces. The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.|$|E
5|$|By {{combining}} the wide angle focal lengths with narrow apertures, the lens provides strong {{depth of field}} rather than making blurred backgrounds. The lens <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> with a hybrid aspherical lens that when combined with two glass mold elements provides excellent correction for distortion as well as astigmatism.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in {{southern}} Scandinavia, and from June in the north.

It <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> by the female from seaweed and dead grass, and lined with finer fibres or hair.|$|E

The Platform 1 station and refreshment room <b>were</b> <b>constructed</b> in 1923 and 1926 respectively.|$|R
5|$|His {{rigorous}} {{mathematical analysis}} {{of the structure of}} self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which <b>is</b> <b>constructed),</b> preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.|$|E
5|$|Nanjing Metro is a {{rapid transit}} {{system in the}} Chinese city of Nanjing, with {{stations}} in nine of the city's eleven districts.

The results of Nanjing's 2015 Municipal Bureau of Statistics count showed that Nanjing Metro carried a total of 720 million rides that year.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps one of Zobel's most {{fascinating}} inventions is the lattice filter section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it <b>is</b> <b>constructed</b> out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is {{the phase of}} the signal at different frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The sub-choir <b>was</b> <b>constructed</b> in the 16th century, {{resulting}} in {{the removal of the}} frontispiece.
